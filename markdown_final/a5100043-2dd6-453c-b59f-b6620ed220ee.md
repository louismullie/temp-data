## Question

What is the efficacy of Bronchitrol in managing acute bronchitis symptoms?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the efficacy of "Bronchitrol" in managing acute bronchitis symptoms and what the evidence shows. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "Bronchitrol" actually is and whether it appears in the provided literature. Then, I should verify the standard of care for acute bronchitis and which therapies have supportive evidence. Next, I will check for any similarly named or commonly confused products that might be relevant. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and safety considerations, anchoring to high-quality guidelines and systematic reviews.

> Let me first confirm the identity of "Bronchitrol". Wait, let me verify the spelling and whether this exact brand appears in the supplied references. I do not see any mention of a product named "Bronchitrol" in the provided sources, which include contemporary AAFP and CHEST guidance and systematic reviews of acute bronchitis therapies, suggesting that if "Bronchitrol" exists, it is not covered by these evidence summaries or is not a recognized intervention in these guidelines.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider whether "Bronchitrol" might be a regional or alternative name for a known therapy. Let me think about commonly discussed agents: beta-agonists, mucolytics like ambroxol or N-acetylcysteine, and essential oil–based products such as myrtol standardized. I need to check if any of these could be the intended product. The Cochrane review of beta2-agonists shows no routine benefit in acute bronchitis without wheeze and highlights adverse effects, so if "Bronchitrol" were a bronchodilator, routine use would not be supported [^115BX8qH]. For mucolytics, evidence in acute bronchitis is limited and mixed; ambroxol has a single older RCT suggesting symptomatic benefit in acute respiratory infection, but overall the acute bronchitis evidence base is weak and not guideline-endorsed, so I should be cautious about extrapolating that to routine care [^114WBbFC]. For essential oil preparations, a recent randomized trial of a myrtol-based combination (AtusinCAP) reported improvements in cough outcomes, but this is a single study of a dietary supplement and not reflected in current guideline recommendations, so I should not generalize this as standard therapy yet [^111JXPyZ] [^113vMkar].

> Next, I should review the standard of care to anchor the recommendation. I need to ensure I'm aligned with high-credibility guidance. AAFP 2025 advises against routine use of beta-agonists, antitussives, antihistamines, anticholinergics, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and antibiotics for uncomplicated acute bronchitis, emphasizing that it is self-limited and that patient education and symptom relief are the mainstays [^114XJ6Bx] [^112YmzVc] [^113jtq4u] [^115NqVos]. CHEST 2020 similarly recommends no routine prescription of antibiotics, beta-agonists, antitussives, or other pharmacologics for immunocompetent adult outpatients with cough due to acute bronchitis, reserving reassessment if symptoms persist or worsen [^116X18bo] [^1134dJJY]. Let me double-check the Cochrane synthesis on beta-agonists: it concludes there is little evidence for routine benefit and signals tremor and nervousness as common adverse effects, reinforcing the guideline stance [^115BX8qH].

> I will now examine the role of antibiotics, because patients often ask about them. The Cochrane review shows only a modest reduction in cough duration of about half a day with antibiotics, offset by increased adverse effects, so routine antibiotics are not recommended for uncomplicated acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults [^111FGJZY]. AAFP echoes this, noting the small benefit does not outweigh harms and recommending avoidance of antibiotics in typical cases [^112YmzVc]. But wait, what if the presentation suggests a bacterial complication or an alternative diagnosis like pertussis or COPD exacerbation? In that case, I should reconsider and treat the specific condition rather than labeling it as "bronchitis", which is consistent with guideline caveats to reassess if symptoms persist or worsen [^116X18bo] [^1134dJJY].

> Let me consider symptomatic options patients sometimes request. I should confirm that OTC cough medications are not recommended for improving cough in acute bronchitis due to insufficient evidence, and that antitussives may be considered only for short-term symptomatic relief in select cases, not as routine therapy [^114XJ6Bx] [^114BiT1W]. I need to ensure I communicate the natural history clearly: cough commonly lasts 2–3 weeks, and setting expectations reduces unnecessary medication use and improves satisfaction [^115uFvJ7].

> But wait, what if "Bronchitrol" refers to a complementary or essential oil–based product? I should double-check the single randomized trial of AtusinCAP, which combined essential oils with bromelain and propolis and reported higher clinical cure rates and faster improvement in cough metrics versus placebo; however, this is a single study of a supplement, not incorporated into guidelines, and should be interpreted as preliminary rather than standard of care [^111JXPyZ] [^113vMkar]. Hold on, I should verify safety signals: the trial reported no excess adverse events versus placebo, but broader generalizability and replication are needed before recommending such products routinely [^111JXPyZ].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Given that "Bronchitrol" is not identified in the provided evidence base and that contemporary guidelines recommend against routine pharmacologic therapy for uncomplicated acute bronchitis, I cannot endorse "Bronchitrol" for acute bronchitis without knowing its composition and seeing supportive, guideline-concordant evidence. Management should focus on patient education, reassurance about the 2–3 week cough duration, and selective symptomatic measures if needed, with reassessment if symptoms persist or worsen to evaluate alternative diagnoses or complications [^115uFvJ7] [^115NqVos] [^116X18bo] [^1134dJJY].

> Finally, I should confirm safety and next steps. If the patient is already using "Bronchitrol", I need to check the exact ingredients, dosing, and duration, screen for adverse effects such as tremor or gastrointestinal upset, and align use with the limited evidence for the specific components while discussing the lack of guideline support. If wheeze or airflow limitation is present, a time-limited trial of a short-acting beta-agonist may be reasonable in select cases, but routine use is not supported and should be discontinued if there is no clear benefit or if adverse effects occur [^115BX8qH] [^113jtq4u] [^116X18bo].

I can't find a medication called "Bronchitrol". Could you **confirm the exact product name** or provide more details (active ingredient, manufacturer, or a link)? If you meant one of the following, I can summarize the evidence:

- **Beta-agonists (e.g. albuterol)**: not recommended routinely for acute bronchitis without wheeze or airflow limitation; may be considered only if wheeze is present [^112eykiT] [^113jtq4u] [^115BX8qH].
- **Antibiotics**: not recommended for routine use in acute bronchitis due to minimal benefit and potential harms [^112YmzVc] [^111FGJZY] [^112yjRGd].
- **Mucolytics (e.g. ambroxol, NAC)**: limited and inconsistent evidence; not routinely recommended for acute bronchitis [^1129EhuC] [^1125ujrZ] [^114WBbFC].

Please confirm the product so I can provide a **precise, evidence-based assessment**.

### Bronchitis (acute) [^116AouQL]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis affects more than 40 in 1000 adults per year in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of people have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or of environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing to acute bronchitis is unclear. One third of people may have longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in people without chronic respiratory disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2015 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 420 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 306 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 245 studies and the further review of 61 full publications. Of the 61 full articles evaluated, three updated systematic reviews and three RCTs were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 12 PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we categorised the efficacy for six intervention-comparison combinations, based on information about the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, antihistamines, antitussives, β₂ agonists (inhaled), and expectorants/mucolytics.

### Bronchitis (acute) [^114RWvnp]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis, with transient inflammation of the trachea and major bronchi, affects over 40/1000 adults a year in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of people have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or of environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing to acute bronchitis is unclear. A third of people may have longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in people without chronic respiratory disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2007 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (amoxicillin [with or without clavulanic acid], cephalosporins, or macrolides), antihistamines, antitussives, β₂ agonists (inhaled or oral), cephalosporins, expectorants, and analgesics.

### Beta2-agonists for acute bronchitis [^115BX8qH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal treatment for acute bronchitis is not clear. Because many patients with acute bronchitis have airflow limitation as well as cough, beta2-agonists may be useful.

Objectives

To determine whether beta2-agonists improve the symptoms of acute bronchitis in patients who do not have underlying pulmonary disease.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (through August 2000), MEDLINE (1966 to 2000), EMBASE (1974 to 2000), and Conference Proceedings using "bronchodilator (exp)", "adrenergic beta-agonist (exp)", or "sympathomimetics (exp)" and "bronchitis" or "cough"; Science Citation Index for referenced publications; and letters to manufacturers of beta2-agonists. An updated search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (issue 3, 2003); MEDLINE (January 2000 to July 2003); EMBASE (January 2000 to July 2003) was run in July 2003.

Selection Criteria

Trials in which patients (adults or children over two years of age) without known pulmonary disease who were diagnosed with acute bronchitis or acute cough without other cause were randomized to beta2-agonist versus placebo, no treatment, or alternative treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three reviewers independently first selected outcomes and evaluated trial quality while blinded to study results, and then extracted data. Trials in children and in adults were analyzed separately.

Main Results

Two trials in children (n = 109) with acute cough and no evidence of airway obstruction did not find any benefits from beta2-agonists. Combined data did not show a significant difference in daily cough scores between patients given oral beta2-agonists and those in the control groups. Five trials in adults (n = 418) with acute cough or acute bronchitis had mixed results, but overall summary statistics did not reveal any significant benefits from oral (three trials) nor inhaled (two trials) beta2-agonists. There were no significant differences in daily cough scores nor in the number of patients still coughing after seven days (control rate 73%; RR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.54–1.09). Subgroups of patients with evidence of airflow limitation had lower symptom scores if given beta2-agonists in one trial; and the trials that did note quicker resolution of cough in patients given beta2-agonists were those that had a higher proportion of patients with wheezing at baseline. Patients given beta2-agonists were more likely to report tremor, shakiness, or nervousness than patients in the control groups (for trials in children control rate 0%; RR 6.76, 95% CI 0.86 to 53.12, NNH 9, 95% CI 5 to 100; for trials in adults, control rate 11%; RR 7.94, 95% CI 1.17 to 53.94, NNH 2.3, 95% CI 2 to 3).

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no evidence to support using beta2-agonists in children with acute cough who do not have evidence of airflow obstruction. There is also little evidence that the routine use of beta2-agonists for adults with acute cough is helpful. These agents may reduce symptoms, including cough, in patients with evidence of airflow obstruction; but this potential benefit is not well-supported by the available data and must be weighed against the adverse effects associated with beta2-agonists.

### Uncomplicated acute bronchitis [^114fk38g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is an acute cough illness in otherwise healthy adults that usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks. This review describes the pathophysiology of the condition and provides a practical approach to the evaluation and treatment of adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Practical points to be made are:1. Respiratory viruses appear to cause the large majority of cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.2. Pertussis infection is present in up to 10% to 20% of adults with cough illness of more than 2 to 3 weeks' duration. No clinical features distinguish pertussis from nonpertussis infection in adults who were immunized against pertussis as children.3. Transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness appears to be the predominant mechanism of the bothersome cough of acute bronchitis.4. Ruling out pneumonia is the primary objective in evaluating adults with acute cough illness in whom comorbid conditions and occult asthma are absent or unlikely. In the absence of abnormalities in vital signs (heart rate > 100 beats/min, respiratory rate > 24 breaths/min, and oral body temperature > 38 degrees C), the likelihood of pneumonia is very low.5. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials do not support routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.6. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that inhaled albuterol decreases the duration of cough in adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis.7. Intervention studies suggest that antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis can be reduced by using a combination of patient and physician education. Decreased rates of antibiotic treatment are not associated with increased utilization, return visits, or dissatisfaction with care.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis affects over 40/1000 adults a year in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of people have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or of environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing to acute bronchitis is unclear. One third of people may have longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in people without chronic respiratory disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 21 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, antibiotics (macrolides, tetracyclines, cephalosporins, penicillins, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [co-trimoxazole]), antihistamines, antitussives, beta(2) agonists (inhaled or oral), and expectorants/mucolytics.

### Clinical significance of the infection-free interval in the management of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis [^111xHDwB]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Rational and appropriate antibiotic use for patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) is a major concern, as approximately half of these patients do not have a bacterial infection. Typically, the result of antimicrobial therapy for patients with acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ABECB) is not eradication of the pathogen but resolution of the acute symptoms. However, the length of time before the next bacterial exacerbation can be another important variable, as the frequency of exacerbations will affect the overall health of the patient and the rate of lung deterioration over time. Clinical trials comparing antimicrobial therapies commonly measure resolution of symptoms in AECB patients as the primary end point, regardless of whether the exacerbation is documented as bacterial in nature. Ideally, the scientific approach to assessing the efficacy of antibiotic therapy for ABECB should include a measurement of acute bacterial eradication rates in patients with documented bronchial bacterial infection followed by measurement of the infection-free interval (IFI), ie, the time to the next ABECB. The use of these variables can provide a standard for comparing various antimicrobial therapies. As we learn more about how antibiotics can affect the IFI, treatment decisions should be adapted to ensure optimal management of ABECB for the long-term.

### Diagnosis and management of acute bronchitis [^112hWrZf]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is one of the top 10 conditions for which patients seek medical care. Physicians show considerable variability in describing the signs and symptoms necessary to its diagnosis. Because acute bronchitis most often has a viral cause, symptomatic treatment with protussives, antitussives, or bronchodilators is appropriate. However, studies indicate that many physicians treat bronchitis with antibiotics. These drugs have generally been shown to be ineffective in patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Furthermore, antibiotics often have detrimental side effects, and their overuse contributes to the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance. Patient satisfaction with the treatment of acute bronchitis is related to the quality of the physician-patient interaction rather than to prescription of an antibiotic.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^1134dJJY]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

CHEST Expert Panel suggestions — management of cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients state there is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the efficacy of prescribed treatments for cough due to acute bronchitis. For immunocompetent adult outpatients with cough due to acute bronchitis, we suggest no routine prescription of antibiotic therapy, antiviral therapy, antitussives, inhaled beta agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, oral NSAIDs or other therapies until such treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For immunocompetent adult outpatients with cough due to acute bronchitis, if the acute bronchitis worsens, we suggest consideration for treatment with antibiotic therapy if a complicating bacterial infection is thought likely (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), and remarks note that differential diagnoses, such as exacerbations of chronic airways diseases (COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis) that may require other therapeutic management (such as with oral corticosteroids) should also be considered.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: randomised placebo controlled trial [^113wvMtz]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis implies a self limiting infection of the large airways and is characterised by cough without pneumonia. It is a prevalent disease and one of the most common reasons for visits in primary care. Patients often return to their doctor or seek other medical help as symptoms may persist for two or three weeks, mainly cough, which may be bothersome for some patients and could last for up to four weeks or more.

Acute bronchitis is mainly a viral infection. The role of bacteria in this infection continues to be controversial since bronchial biopsy samples have never shown bacterial invasion. It is thought that acute bronchitis reflects an inflammatory response of the epithelium of the bronchi to infections. Microscopic examination shows a thickening of the bronchial and tracheal mucosa corresponding to the inflamed areas. These findings are consistent with proximal lower airway inflammation observed with positron emission tomography.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^114hBege]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence for the diagnosis and management of cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients was reviewed as an update to the 2006 "Chronic Cough Due to Acute Bronchitis: American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines".

Methods

Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection manifested predominantly by cough with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks with no clinical or any recent radiographic evidence to suggest an alternative explanation. Two clinical population, intervention, comparison, outcome questions were addressed by systematic review in July 2017: (1) the role of investigations beyond the clinical assessment of patients presenting with suspected acute bronchitis, and (2) the efficacy and safety of prescribing medication for cough in acute bronchitis. An updated search was undertaken in May 2018.

Results

No eligible studies relevant to the first question were identified. For the second question, only one relevant study met eligibility criteria. This study found no difference in number of days with cough between patients treated with an antibiotic or an oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent compared with placebo. Clinical suggestions and research recommendations were made based on the consensus opinion of the CHEST Expert Cough Panel.

Conclusions

The panelists suggested that no routine investigations be ordered and no routine medications be prescribed in immunocompetent adult outpatients first presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, until such investigations and treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner. If the cough due to suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, a reassessment and consideration of targeted investigations should be considered.

### Safety and efficacy of inhalable ambroxol hydrochloride aerosol for adult patients with respiratory diseases: an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study [^114MNER5]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory diseases are prevalent infectious and non-infectious diseases and pose an enormous public health burden. They include a myriad of acute and chronic respiratory conditions such as bronchiectasis, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In 2019, approximately 455 million individuals were afflicted with chronic respiratory disease globally, representing an approximately 40% rise over 1990. Acute or chronic cough and sputum production, viscous sputum and difficulty of expectoration are the main manifestations of acute or chronic respiratory disease and occur as a result of airway mucus hypersecretion and impaired mucus clearance. Airway mucus hypersecretion may also cause luminal plugging of large airways, leading to reduced respiratory function and health-related quality of life (QoL).

As a key pathophysiological feature in many respiratory diseases, airway mucus hypersecretion and decreased mucus clearance could provide an environment for microbial growth, leading to infection and inflammation, which could cause worsening of asthma, cystic fibrosis or other respiratory illnesses and exacerbations of COPD, highlighting the importance of amelioration of airway mucus hypersecretion. Though aerosolised hypertonic saline solution led to sustained acceleration of mucus clearance and improved lung function in cystic fibrosis patients, it has not proven efficacious in other respiratory diseases. Mucolytic therapy could reduce COPD exacerbations as well as ease the symptoms of cough and expectorationand has been recommended as an add-on therapy for COPDby several international guidelines including the International Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines. However, mucolytic agent N -acetylcysteine, which has been approved by the United States FDA, has failed to consistently demonstrate benefit in reducing the risk of acute exacerbation of COPD.

Regarding medical management for acute bronchitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, ACP 2021 guidelines recommend to limit antibiotic treatment duration to 5 days when managing patients with acute uncomplicated bronchitis with clinical signs of a bacterial infection (presence of increased sputum purulence in addition to increased dyspnea, and/or increased sputum volume).

### Acute bronchitis: rapid evidence review [^117PueHE]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis and accounts for more than 3 million outpatient office visits in the United States annually. The differential diagnosis includes exacerbations of preexisting conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure or other causes of acute cough, including pertussis, COVID-19, influenza, and community-acquired pneumonia. Acute cough may present with or without sputum production. Diagnostic testing is not indicated unless there is concern for other potential causes, such as community-acquired pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19. Acute bronchitis is a self-limiting disease. Evidence does not support the use of antitussives, honey, antihistamines, anticholinergics, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Antibiotics do not contribute to the overall improvement of acute bronchitis; although they may decrease the duration of cough by approximately 0.5 days, their use exposes patients to antibiotic-related adverse effects. Therefore, symptom relief and patient education regarding the expected duration of cough (2–3 weeks) are recommended for the management of acute bronchitis. Strategies shown to decrease antibiotic prescribing include delayed antibiotic prescriptions and describing acute bronchitis as a chest cold.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^111FGJZY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits and risks of antibiotics for acute bronchitis remain unclear despite it being one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in improving outcomes and to assess adverse effects of antibiotic therapy for people with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2016, Issue 11 (accessed 13 January 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1, 2017), Embase (1974 to 13 January 2017), and LILACS (1982 to 13 January 2017). We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 5 April 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough, in people without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in this 2017 update. We included 17 trials with 5099 participants in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. At follow-up there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between the antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15). Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (4 studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6) and a night cough (4 studies with 538 participants, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7). Participants given antibiotics had a shorter mean cough duration (7 studies with 2776 participants, mean difference (MD) -0.46 days, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.04). The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and MD of productive cough did not reach statistical significance. Antibiotic-treated participants were more likely to be improved according to clinician's global assessment (6 studies with 891 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 11) and were less likely to have an abnormal lung exam (5 studies with 613 participants, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6). Antibiotic-treated participants also had a reduction in days feeling ill (5 studies with 809 participants, MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) and days with impaired activity (6 studies with 767 participants, MD -0.49 days, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04). The differences in proportions with activity limitations at follow-up did not reach statistical significance. There was a significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group (12 studies with 3496 participants, RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36; NNT for an additional harmful outcome 24).

There is limited evidence of clinical benefit to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. Antibiotics may have a modest beneficial effect in some patients such as frail, elderly people with multimorbidity who may not have been included in trials to date. However, the magnitude of this benefit needs to be considered in the broader context of potential side effects, medicalisation for a self limiting condition, increased resistance to respiratory pathogens, and cost of antibiotic treatment.

Bronchitis Severity Scale (BSS) score ≥ 5 points at screening (out of 20 points maximum);
cough severity of ≥ 4 on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS; see Supplementary Material, Appendix S1 for more details) at screening;
body temperature < 39 °C;
duration of symptoms ≤ 5 days before enrollment in the study;
occurrence of initial symptoms (sputum production with impaired expectoration) within 2 days prior to initiation of study intervention;
non-smokers* (*stopped smoking ≥ 6 months before enrollment).

Key exclusion criteria included: history of or current confounding respiratory disease (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis or chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis, and lung cancer), a lung radiogram revealing pulmonary inflammatory opacities, suspected pneumonia, concurrent bacterial infection, and antibiotic intake.

A list of all criteria can be found in the Supplementary Material, Appendix S2. All participants provided a signed informed consent prior to study participation.

### Efficacy and safety of atusinCAP in the treatment of acute uncomplicated bronchitis in the primary care setting: a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (AABA) [^116xo4L9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute bronchitis (AB) is a lower respiratory tract infection commonly diagnosed by general practitioners, leading to > 5 million physician encounters each year in the United States. It is a self-limiting disorder manifested by cough with or without phlegm production lasting for up to 3 weeks. AB is often mistaken for a common cold (defined as a selflimiting mild upper respiratory illness) or other respiratory disorders causing cough. Therefore, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) evidencebased clinical practice guidelines recommend the diagnosis of AB to be established only in the absence of evidence for pneumonia, common cold, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.

Treatment of AB mainly consists of reducing the frequency of cough attacks without suppressing the cough reflex, ultimately aiming at improving quality of life and productivity, and reducing absenteeism. Accordingly, AB treatment often entails the administration of antitussive agents (including codeine, dextromethorphan, moguisteine, and hydrocodone) for shortterm symptomatic relief of coughing, although evidence for their benefits is inconsistent. Other therapies, including routine treatment with antibiotics, β₂-agonist bronchodilators, or mucokinetic agents, are not recommended, as they lack evidence for beneficial effects on cough.

Alternative, nonprescription therapies for relief of coughing are commonly used by patients with AB, with echinacea, pelargonium, dark honey, and Myrtol standardized showing modest clinical benefits in different clinical studies. Myrtol standardized is a phytotherapeutic that contains a distillate of essential oils rich in the monoterpenes 1,8cineole (eucalyptol), d-limonene, and alpha-pinene, known for their antiinflammatory and antioxidative properties. It has previously shown to be statistically significantly superior compared with placebo and comparable with antibiotic treatment (cefuroxime or ambroxol) in treating AB.

Since the management of cough is a major challenge in AB, it is of interest to investigate the potential benefit of a combination therapy approach for symptom relief. Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a food supplement (Atusin ® CAP), combining 4 types of purified essential oils (eucalyptus, sweet orange, lemon, and myrtle), rich in 1,8cineole, d-limonene, and alpha-pinene, in addition to bromelain and green Brazilian propolis, in adults with AB.

### Efficacy and safety of atusinCAP in the treatment of acute uncomplicated bronchitis in the primary care setting: a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (AABA) [^111JXPyZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute bronchitis (AB) is a lower respiratory tract infection manifested by cough, which is challenging to manage at the moment. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a food supplement (Atusin ® CAP) combining 4 types of purified essential oils, bromelain, and green Brazilian propolis in adults.

Methods

A post-surveillance, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical study was conducted over 6 months. Participants with acute uncomplicated bronchitis were administered the combination preparation (verum group) or placebo for 10 days in total. The primary outcome was clinical cure, defined as a ≥ 75% reduction in baseline Bronchitis Severity Scale (BSS) score after 10 days.

Results

In total, 310 participants were randomized 1:1, of which 155 and 150 participants in the verum and placebo group, respectively, were included in the efficacy and safety analysis sets. A statistically significantly higher number of clinically cured participants was observed in the verum group compared to the placebo group on all reporting days until the end of study intervention administration (Day 10: p = 0.029). The mean BSS score was statistically significantly different between the study intervention groups from Day 7 (p = 0.050) until Day 10 (p = 0.011). In addition, there were no differences in the incidence of adverse events between the verum and placebo group.

Conclusions

The study shows that the studied combination preparation, containing scientifically proven active substances that bring together key mechanisms for cough relief, is effective in the treatment of acute uncomplicated bronchitis.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^115ZLpNh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis, which is one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care, is controversial. Most clinicians prescribe antibiotics in spite of expert recommendations against this practice.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antibiotic treatment for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Strategy

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2004); EMBASE (January 2000 to December 2003); SciSearch from 1989 to 2004; reference lists of articles and the authors' personal collections up to 1996, and also wrote to study authors and drug manufacturers. EMBASE has previously been searched from 1974 to 2000).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough without other obvious cause in patients without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality. Authors were contacted for missing data.

Main Results

Nine trials involving over 750 patients aged eight to over 65 and including smokers and non-smokers were included in the primary analysis. The quality of the trials was variable. A variety of outcome measures were assessed. Overall, patients receiving antibiotics had better outcomes than did those receiving placebo. At a follow-up visit, they were less likely to have a cough (relative risk (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.85; number-needed-to-treat (NNT) 5; 95% CI 3 to 14), show no improvement on physician assessment (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; NNT 14; 95% CI 8 to 50), or have abnormal lung findings (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.89; NNT 11; 95% CI 6 to 50); and had shorter durations of cough (weighted mean difference 0.58 days; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.16 days), productive cough (weighted mean difference (WMD) 0.52 days; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.03 days), and feeling ill (WMD 0.58 days; 95% CI 0.00 to 1.16 days). There were no significant differences regarding the presence of night cough, productive cough, or activity limitations at follow up, or in the mean duration of activity limitations. The benefits of antibiotics were less apparent in a sensitivity analysis that included data from two other studies of patients with upper respiratory tract infections with productive cough. There was a non significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group, relative risk (RR) 1.22 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.58).

Reviewers' Conclusions

Overall, antibiotics appear to have a modest beneficial effect in patients who are diagnosed with acute bronchitis. The magnitude of this benefit, however, is similar to that of the detriment from potential adverse effects.

### Mucolytic agents versus placebo for chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111LPvy4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Individuals with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may suffer recurrent exacerbations with an increase in volume or purulence of sputum, or both. Personal and healthcare costs associated with exacerbations indicate that any therapy that reduces the occurrence of exacerbations is useful. A marked difference among countries in terms of prescribing of mucolytics reflects variation in perceptions of their effectiveness.

Objectives

Primary objective• To determine whether treatment with mucolytics reduces frequency of exacerbations and/or days of disability in patients with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Secondary objectives• To assess whether mucolytics lead to improvement in lung function or quality of life.• To determine frequency of adverse effects associated with use of mucolytics.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles on 10 separate occasions, most recently in July 2014.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised studies that compared oral mucolytic therapy versus placebo for at least two months in adults with chronic bronchitis or COPD. We excluded studies of people with asthma and cystic fibrosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

This review analysed summary data only, most derived from published studies. For earlier versions, one review author extracted data, which were rechecked in subsequent updates. In later versions, review authors double-checked extracted data and then entered data into RevMan for analysis.

Main Results

We added four studies for the 2014 update. The review now includes 34 trials, recruiting a total of 9367 participants. Many studies did not clearly describe allocation concealment; hence selection bias may have inflated the results, which reduces our confidence in the findings. Results of 26 studies with 6233 participants show that the likelihood that a patient could be exacerbation-free during the study period was greater among mucolytic groups (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.57 to 1.94). However, more recent studies show less benefit of treatment than was reported in earlier studies in this review. The overall number needed to treat with mucolytics for an additional beneficial outcome for an average of 10 months - to keep an additional participant free from exacerbations - was eight (NNTB 8, 95% CI 7 to 10). Use of mucolytics was associated with a reduction of 0.03 exacerbations per participant per month (mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% CI -0.04 to -0.03; participants = 7164; studies = 28; I² = 85%) compared with placebo, that is, about 0.36 per year, or one exacerbation every three years. Very high heterogeneity was noted for this outcome, so results need to be interpreted with caution. The type or dose of mucolytic did not seem to alter the effect size, nor did the severity of COPD, including exacerbation history. Longer studies showed smaller effects of mucolytics than were reported in shorter studies. Mucolytic use was associated with a reduction of 0.43 days of disability per participant per month compared with placebo (95% CI -0.56 to -0.30; studies = 13; I(2) = 61%). With mucolytics, the number of people with one or more hospitalisations was reduced, but study results were not consistent (Peto OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.89; participants = 1788; studies = 4; I(2) = 58%). Investigators reported improved quality of life with mucolytics (MD -2.64, 95% CI -5.21 to -0.08; participants = 2231; studies = 5; I² = 51%). Although this mean difference did not reach the minimal clinically important difference of -4 units, we cannot assess the population impact, as we do not have the data needed to carry out a responder analysis. Mucolytic treatment was not associated with any significant increase in the total number of adverse effects, including mortality (Peto OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.03; participants = 2931; studies = 8; I(2) = 0%), but the confidence interval is too wide to confirm that the treatment has no effect on mortality.

Authors' Conclusions

In participants with chronic bronchitis or COPD, we are moderately confident that treatment with mucolytics may produce a small reduction in acute exacerbations and a small effect on overall quality of life. Our confidence in the results is reduced by the fact that effects on exacerbations shown in early trials were larger than those reported by more recent studies, possibly because the earlier smaller trials were at greater risk of selection or publication bias, thus benefits of treatment may not be as great as was suggested by previous evidence.

### Efficacy and safety of atusinCAP in the treatment of acute uncomplicated bronchitis in the primary care setting: a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (AABA) [^113vMkar]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

To conclude, this was a randomized, placebo-controlled study reporting on well-defined outcomes that are relevant to daily clinical practice. It demonstrated that the combination preparation studied, which contains active substances with mechanisms for cough relief, is effective in the treatment of acute uncomplicated bronchitis. Therefore, the studied combination preparation provides an alternative treatment option for patients with AB, especially in primary care.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^112JFNM3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits and risks of antibiotics for acute bronchitis remain unclear despite it being one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in improving outcomes and assess adverse effects of antibiotic therapy for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 12, MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to January 2014) and LILACS (1982 to January 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough, in patients without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Seventeen trials with 3936 participants were included in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. There was limited evidence to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. At follow-up, there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 22. Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (four studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; NNTB 6); have a night cough (four studies with 538 participants, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7) and a shorter mean cough duration (seven studies with 2776 participants, mean difference (MD) -0.46 days, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.04). The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and MD of productive cough did not reach statistical significance. Antibiotic-treated patients were more likely to be unimproved according to clinician's global assessment (six studies with 891 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 25); have an abnormal lung exam (five studies with 613 participants, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6); have a reduction in days feeling ill (five studies with 809 participants, MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) and a reduction in days with limited activity (six studies with 767 participants MD -0.49 days, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04). The differences in proportions with activity limitations at follow-up did not reach statistical significance. There was a significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group (12 studies with 3496 participants) (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36; NNT for an additional adverse effect 5).

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. Antibiotics may have a modest beneficial effect in some patients such as frail, elderly people with multimorbidity who may not have been included in trials to date. However, the magnitude of this benefit needs to be considered in the broader context of potential side effects, medicalisation for a self-limiting condition, increased resistance to respiratory pathogens and cost of antibiotic treatment.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: randomised placebo controlled trial [^111Ha4ku]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Most of these infections are self limiting, and several studies have suggested that the benefit of antimicrobial treatment is marginal. However, most patients with acute bronchitis receive antibiotics, even in countries with low rates of antibiotic prescribing. This over-prescription constitutes a global problem and is an important factor in increasing the levels of antibiotic resistance. Several approaches for controlling acute cough have included narcotic cough suppressants, expectorants, antihistamines, decongestants, herbal remedies, and β₂ agonists. Even though all these drugs are widely prescribed in patients with acute bronchitis, evidence is scant that their use may be helpful for adults with cough. A Cochrane review of the use of antitussives in patients with acute cough showed no clear benefit for duration of cough. Some studies did report the beneficial effects of expectorants, but these studies were small and had methodological flaws. Another Cochrane review of β₂ agonists showed little evidence for their efficacy in adults with acute cough. These agents may reduce symptoms, including cough, in people with evidence of airflow obstruction. However, their potential benefit in patients without chronic airway disease is not well supported by the data available and must be weighed against the adverse effects associated with their use. There is therefore an urgent need to identify novel treatment measures to deal with this common infectious disease, particularly in light of growing patient expectations and increasing antibiotic resistance. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely prescribed in patients with lower respiratory tract infections, mainly for alleviating fever and chest pain as well as other common complaints such as cough. Notwithstanding, the effectiveness of these drugs for reducing the duration and intensity of cough has not been analysed in randomised clinical trials. No sufficiently powered studies have been published comparing the role of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with that of antibiotics. We therefore compared the efficacy of ibuprofen and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with placebo in a group of otherwise healthy adults with acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for bronchiectasis [^117SWjwr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is being increasingly diagnosed and recognised as an important contributor to chronic lung disease in both adults and children in high- and low-income countries. It is characterised by irreversible dilatation of airways and is generally associated with airway inflammation and chronic bacterial infection. Medical management largely aims to reduce morbidity by controlling the symptoms, reduce exacerbation frequency, improve quality of life and prevent the progression of bronchiectasis. This is an update of a review first published in 2000.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in children and adults with stable state bronchiectasis, specifically to assess whether the use of ICS: (1) reduces the severity and frequency of acute respiratory exacerbations; or (2) affects long-term pulmonary function decline.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Register of trials, MEDLINE and Embase databases. We ran the latest literature search in June 2017.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ICS with a placebo or no medication. We included children and adults with clinical or radiographic evidence of bronchiectasis, but excluded people with cystic fibrosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We reviewed search results against predetermined criteria for inclusion. In this update, two independent review authors assessed methodological quality and risk of bias in trials using established criteria and extracted data using standard pro forma. We analysed treatment as 'treatment received' and performed sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

The review included seven studies, involving 380 adults. Of the 380 randomised participants, 348 completed the studies. Due to differences in outcomes reported among the seven studies, we could only perform limited meta-analysis for both the short-term ICS use (6 months or less) and the longer-term ICS use (> 6 months). During stable state in the short-term group (ICS for 6 months or less), based on the two studies from which data could be included, there were no significant differences from baseline values in the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV₁) at the end of the study (mean difference (MD) -0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.26 to 0.09) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (MD 0.01 L, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.17) in adults on ICS (compared to no ICS). Similarly, we did not find any significant difference in the average exacerbation frequency (MD 0.09, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.79) or health-related quality of life (HRQoL) total scores in adults on ICS when compared with no ICS, though data available were limited. Based on a single non-placebo controlled study from which we could not extract clinical data, there was marginal, though statistically significant improvement in sputum volume and dyspnoea scores on ICS. The single study on long-term outcomes (over 6 months) that examined lung function and other clinical outcomes, showed no significant effect of ICS on any of the outcomes. We could not draw any conclusion on adverse effects due to limited available data. Despite the authors of all seven studies stating they were double-blind, we judged one study (in the short duration ICS) as having a high risk of bias based on blinding, attrition and reporting of outcomes. The GRADE quality of evidence was low for all outcomes (due to non-placebo controlled trial, indirectness and imprecision with small numbers of participants and studies).

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review indicates that there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of ICS in adults with stable state bronchiectasis. Further, we cannot draw any conclusion for the use of ICS in adults during an acute exacerbation or in children (for any state), as there were no studies.

### Chronic cough due to chronic bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113t7aCp]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic bronchitis is a disease of the bronchi that is manifested by cough and sputum expectoration occurring on most days for at least 3 months of the year and for at least 2 consecutive years when other respiratory or cardiac causes for the chronic productive cough are excluded. The disease is caused by an interaction between noxious inhaled agents (eg, cigarette smoke, industrial pollutants, and other environmental pollutants) and host factors (eg, genetic and respiratory infections) that results in chronic inflammation in the walls and lumen of the airways. As the disease advances, progressive airflow limitation occurs, usually in association with pathologic changes of emphysema. This condition is called COPD. When a stable patient experiences a sudden clinical deterioration with increased sputum volume, sputum purulence, and/or worsening of shortness of breath, this is referred to as an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis as long as conditions other than acute tracheobronchitis are ruled out. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to chronic bronchitis, and to make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

Methods

Recommendations for this section of the review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "chronic bronchitis", and "COPD".

Results

The most effective way to reduce or eliminate cough in patients with chronic bronchitis and persistent exposure to respiratory irritants, such as personal tobacco use, passive smoke exposure, and workplace hazards is avoidance. Therapy with a short-acting inhaled beta-agonist, inhaled ipratropium bromide, and oral theophylline, and a combined regimen of inhaled long-acting beta-agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid may improve cough in patients with chronic bronchitis, but there is no proven benefit for the use of prophylactic antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, expectorants, postural drainage, or chest physiotherapy. For the treatment of an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, there is evidence that inhaled bronchodilators, oral antibiotics, and oral corticosteroids (or in severe cases IV corticosteroids) are useful, but their effects on cough have not been systematically evaluated. Therapy with expectorants, postural drainage, chest physiotherapy, and theophylline is not recommended. Central cough suppressants such as codeine and dextromethorphan are recommended for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing.

Conclusions

Chronic bronchitis due to cigarette smoking or other exposures to inhaled noxious agents is one of the most common causes of chronic cough in the general population. The most effective way to eliminate cough is the avoidance of all respiratory irritants. When cough persists despite the removal of these inciting agents, there are effective agents to reduce or eliminate cough.

### Combination inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists for children and adults with bronchiectasis [^114Yseyr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a major contributor to chronic respiratory morbidity and mortality worldwide. Wheeze and other asthma-like symptoms and bronchial hyperreactivity may occur in people with bronchiectasis. Physicians often use asthma treatments in patients with bronchiectasis.

Objectives

To assess the effects of inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) combined with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in children and adults with bronchiectasis during (1) acute exacerbations and (2) stable state.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Airways Group searched the the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials, which includes records identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and other databases. The Cochrane Airways Group performed the latest searches in October 2013.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of combined ICS and LABA compared with a control (placebo, no treatment, ICS as monotherapy) in children and adults with bronchiectasis not related to cystic fibrosis (CF).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data independently using standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We found no RCTs comparing ICS and LABA combination with either placebo or usual care. We included one RCT that compared combined ICS and LABA with high-dose ICS in 40 adults with non-CF bronchiectasis without co-existent asthma. All participants received three months of high-dose budesonide dipropionate treatment (1600 micrograms). After three months, participants were randomly assigned to receive either high-dose budesonide dipropionate (1600 micrograms per day) or a combination of budesonide with formoterol (640 micrograms of budesonide and 18 micrograms of formoterol) for three months. The study was not blinded. We assessed it to be an RCT with overall high risk of bias. Data analysed in this review showed that those who received combined ICS-LABA (in stable state) had a significantly better transition dyspnoea index (mean difference (MD) 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 2.18) and cough-free days (MD 12.30, 95% CI 2.38 to 22.2) compared with those receiving ICS after three months of treatment. No significant difference was noted between groups in quality of life (MD -4.57, 95% CI -12.38 to 3.24), number of hospitalisations (odds ratio (OR) 0.26, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.79) or lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) and forced vital capacity (FVC)). Investigators reported 37 adverse events in the ICS group versus 12 events in the ICS-LABA group but did not mention the number of individuals experiencing adverse events. Hence differences between groups were not included in the analyses. We assessed the overall evidence to be low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

In adults with bronchiectasis without co-existent asthma, during stable state, a small single trial with a high risk of bias suggests that combined ICS-LABA may improve dyspnoea and increase cough-free days in comparison with high-dose ICS. No data are provided for or against, the use of combined ICS-LABA in adults with bronchiectasis during an acute exacerbation, or in children with bronchiectasis in a stable or acute state. The absence of high quality evidence means that decisions to use or discontinue combined ICS-LABA in people with bronchiectasis may need to take account of the presence or absence of co-existing airway hyper-responsiveness and consideration of adverse events associated with combined ICS-LABA.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^117TRMVk]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Clinical KQ (PICO) 3 — prevention of acute exacerbations in chronic bronchitis — asks, "Can therapy that targets chronic cough due to CB prevent or reduce the occurrence of acute CB exacerbations?" CB was defined as a disease of the bronchi that is manifested by cough and sputum expectoration occurring on most days for at least 3 months of the year and for at least 2 consecutive years when other respiratory or cardiac causes for the chronic, productive cough are excluded, and this excludes the subpopulation with COPD asthma overlap syndrome.

### Mucolytic agents for chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115hcdNV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Individuals with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may suffer recurrent exacerbations with an increase in volume or purulence of sputum, or both. Because of the personal and healthcare costs associated with exacerbations, any therapy that reduces the number of exacerbations is useful. There is a marked difference among countries in terms of prescribing of mucolytics depending on whether or not they are perceived to be effective.

Primary Objective

to determine if treatment with mucolytics reduces the frequency of exacerbations, days of disability, or both, in participants with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or both.

Secondary Objectives

to determine if mucolytics lead to an improvement in lung function or quality of life and to determine the frequency of adverse effects associated with mucolytics.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles on ten separate occasions, the most recent being in July 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised studies that compared oral mucolytic therapy with placebo for at least two months in adults with chronic bronchitis or COPD. We excluded studies of people with asthma and cystic fibrosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

The review analysed summary data only, the majority from published studies. For earlier versions, one author extracted data, which was rechecked in subsequent updates. In later versions, we double-checked data extraction. We then entered data into RevMan for analysis.

Main Results

Two further trials have been added to the review for the 2012 update. There are now 30 trials in the review, recruiting a total of 7436 participants. Allocation concealment was not clearly described in the early trials, and selection bias may have inflated the results, which reduces our confidence in the findings of these trials. The likelihood of being exacerbation-free during the study period (22 trials in 4886 participants with a mean duration of 10 months) was greater in the mucolytic group for the double-blind trials (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63 to 2.07). However, the more recent trials show less benefit of treatment than the earlier trials included in this review. The overall number needed to treat with mucolytics to keep an additional participant free from exacerbations over 10 months was seven (NNTB 7; 95% CI 6 to 9). The use of mucolytics was associated with a reduction of 0.04 exacerbations per participant per month (95% CI -0.04 to -0.03) compared with placebo; that is about 0.48 per year, or one exacerbation every two years. There was very high heterogeneity in this outcome (I² = 87%) so results need to be interpreted with caution. The number of days of disability per month also fell (mean difference (MD) -0.48; 95% CI -0.65 to -0.30) in 12 trials on 2305 participants. There was no clinically important improvement in lung function or consistent impact on quality of life with mucolytics. Mucolytic treatment was not associated with any significant increase in adverse effects, including mortality (Peto OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.64) in six trials on 1821 participants.

Authors' Conclusions

In participants with chronic bronchitis or COPD, treatment with a mucolytic may produce a small reduction in acute exacerbations, but may have little or no effect on the overall quality of life. The effects on exacerbations shown in early trials were larger than those found in the more recent studies. This may be because the earlier smaller trials were at higher risk of selection or publication bias, so the benefits of treatment may not be as large as suggested by the previous evidence.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1156nhgo]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to acute bronchitis and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice. Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care clinicians and emergency department physicians. It is an acute respiratory infection with a normal chest radiograph that is manifested by cough with or without phlegm production that lasts for up to 3 weeks. Respiratory viruses appear to be the most common cause of acute bronchitis; however, the organism responsible is rarely identified in clinical practice because viral cultures and serologic assays are not routinely performed. Fewer than 10% of patients will have a bacterial infection diagnosed as the cause of bronchitis. The diagnosis of acute bronchitis should be made only when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD have been ruled out as the cause of cough. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited respiratory disorder, and when the cough persists for > 3 weeks, other diagnoses must be considered.

Methods

Recommendations for this review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004. The search was limited to literature published in the English language and human studies, using search terms such as "cough", "acute bronchitis", and "acute viral respiratory infection".

Results

Unfortunately, most previous controlled trials guiding the treatment of acute bronchitis have not vigorously differentiated acute bronchitis and the common cold, and also have not distinguished between an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and acute asthma as a cause of acute cough. For patients with the putative diagnosis of acute bronchitis, routine treatment with antibiotics is not justified and should not be offered. Antitussive agents are occasionally useful and can be offered as therapy for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing, but there is no role for inhaled bronchodilator or expectorant therapy. Children and adult patients with confirmed and probable whooping cough should receive a macrolide antibiotic and should be isolated for 5 days from the start of treatment; early treatment within the first few weeks will diminish the coughing paroxysms and prevent spread of the disease; the patient is unlikely to respond to treatment beyond this period.

Conclusion

Acute bronchitis is an acute respiratory infection that is manifested by cough and, at times, sputum production that lasts for no more than 3 weeks. This syndrome should be distinguished from the common cold, an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and acute asthma as the cause of acute cough. The widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of acute bronchitis is not justified, and vigorous efforts to curtail their use should be encouraged.

Secondary outcomes included:

Frequency of daytime cough attacks, as assessed by the investigator at Visit 1 (baseline) using the BSS and by the participants on Days 1 through 10 using the Acute Bronchitis Severity Score (ABSS) (0 = missing/very rarely [1–2 times/day], 1 = rarely [3–5 times/day], 2 = occasionally [6–10 times/day], 3 = frequently [11–20 times/day], 4 = constantly [> 20 times/day]; see Supplementary Material, Appendix S4 for more details). In the study, changes in the frequency of daytime cough attacks were considered clinically significant in case of a ≥ 75% reduction in daytime cough attacks from baseline.

In the study, a decrease from baseline in cough severity per VAS of ≥ 75% was assumed to be clinically significant.
Frequency of nocturnal cough attacks, as assessed by the investigator at Visit 1 (baseline) using the BSS and by the participants on Days 1 through 10 using the ABSS (0 = missing/very rarely [1–2 times/night], 1 = rarely [3–5 times/night], 2 = occasionally [6–10 times/night], 3 = frequently [11–20 times/night], 4 = constantly [> 20 times/night]; see Supplementary Material, Appendix S4 for more details). In the study, achieving a score equal to 0 was considered clinically significant.
Improvement of expectoration, as assessed by the investigator at Visit 1 (baseline) using the BSS and by the participants on Days 1 through 10 using the ABSS (0 = no difficulty, 1 = easy, 2 = somewhat difficult, 3 = very difficult, 4 = extremely difficult; see Supplementary Material, Appendix S4 for more details). In the study, achieving a score equal to 0 was considered clinically significant.
Chest pain and discomfort on coughing, as assessed by the investigator at Visit 1 (baseline) using the BSS and by the participants on Days 1 through 10 using the ABSS (0 = not even once, 1 = rarely, 2 = from time to time, 3 = often, 4 = constantly; see Supplementary Material, Appendix S4 for more details). In the study, achieving a score equal to 0 was considered clinically significant.
Quality of life measured as a limitation of daily activity due to cough, as assessed by the investigator at Visit 1 (baseline) and by the participants on Days 1 through 10 using the ABSS (0 = not even once, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = very severe; see Supplementary Material, Appendix S4 for more details). In the study, achieving a score equal to 0 was considered clinically significant.
Response to study intervention, as assessed by the investigator at Visit 3 (end of study intervention administration) using a verbal rating scale (0 = symptoms resolved, 1 = symptoms improved compared to baseline, 2 = symptoms unchanged compared to baseline, 3 = symptoms worsened compared to baseline). In the study, participants with a score of 0 or 1 were defined as 'responders'; participants with a score of 2 or 3 were defined as 'non-responders'.
Adverse events (AEs), as recorded daily by the investigator in the eCRF and by the participants in the electronic patient diary from Days 1 through 10 as the incidence of mild, moderate, and severe serious and nonserious AEs.

### European Respiratory Society clinical practice guideline for the management of adult bronchiectasis [^115G9axw]. The European Respiratory Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, ERS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering the following interventions during exacerbations:

- prescribe antibiotics for an exacerbation, guided by previous microbiology results, local susceptibility patterns, and clinical severity

- include guidance on recognizing exacerbations in an adult bronchiectasis self-management plan. Consider providing selected patients the ability to self-administer antibiotics at home with appropriate instruction and education to allow more prompt treatment

- review patients not responding promptly to oral antibiotics or showing signs of a severe exacerbation to determine if there is a need for a change in treatment, intravenous antibiotic treatment, and/or hospitalization

- adapt airway clearance regimens in frequency, intensity, and technique during an exacerbation

- recognize that a 14-day antibiotic course is considered standard, especially in severe exacerbations or in patients with P. aeruginosa infection. Consider shorter courses in patients with mild bronchiectasis, those with infection due to pathogens more sensitive to antibiotics (such as S. pneumoniae), or patients with a rapid return to baseline symptoms during treatment.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^115EmYm9]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chronic cough due to chronic bronchitis (CB) — positive end-expiratory pressure for preventing or reducing acute CB exacerbations was evaluated in only one eligible study that examined the nonpharmacological treatment of positive end-expiratory pressure. The very small study (20 subjects in the intervention group and 23 in the control group) had several limitations: unclear randomization, inability to blind, and overall 20% loss to follow-up. For exacerbation outcomes, they reported that 3 of 20 (15%) intervention subjects and 12 of 23 (52%) control subjects had at least one exacerbation. There were no data reported for the rate of exacerbations; it was only reported that the exacerbation rate was statistically significantly less in the intervention group (P < .005). With use of GRADE, the resulting evidence level for this intervention is very low.

### Efficacy and safety of atusinCAP in the treatment of acute uncomplicated bronchitis in the primary care setting: a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (AABA) [^111iwgzr]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study schedule

Each participant was followed for 14 days in total, including 3 scheduled study visits and a telephone call:

Visit 1 (on Day 1): screening for eligibility, randomization, collection of baseline data, and first administration of studied combination preparation/placebo.
Visit 2 (on Day 4): assessment of efficacy, tolerability, and compliance after 4 days of studied combination preparation/placebo administration.
Visit 3 (on Day 10): assessment of efficacy, tolerability, and compliance after 10 days of studied combination preparation/placebo administration.
Telephone call (on Day 14): follow-up on participant's condition 4 days after the last dose of studied combination preparation/placebo.

Data management

Participant data were collected by a trained investigator by means of electronic case report forms (eCRFs). Each investigator's database was password protected. All participants were assigned an identification number in the study to which all study-related data were linked. Each participant received an electronic patient diary, with username and password, in which the participant reported daily the parameters to be collected as described in Section ‎2.7.

Study outcomes

In this study, the primary outcome was clinical cure, which was defined as a ≥ 75% reduction in baseline BSS score after 10 days. The BSS score is calculated as the sum of the intensity of the 5 most important symptoms of AB (i.e. the frequency of cough attacks, sputum discharge, rales/rhonchi on auscultation, chest pain during coughing, and dyspnea), which are assessed using a scale ranging from 0 to 4 (0 = absent [1–2 times/day], 1 = mild [3–5 times/day], 2 = moderate [6–10 times/day], 3 = severe [11–20 times/day], 4 = very severe [> 20 times/day]). The BSS score, therefore, varies between 0 and 20 points. It was assessed by the investigator at all visits and by the participants in the electronic patient diary on Days 1 through 10.

### Inhaled steroids for bronchiectasis [^112gE4CH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is increasingly recognized as a major cause of respiratory morbidity especially in developing countries and in some ethnic populations of affluent countries. It is characterized by irreversible dilatation of airways, generally associated with chronic bacterial infection. Medical management largely aims to reduce morbidity by controlling the symptoms and by preventing the progression of bronchiectasis.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in children and adults with bronchiectasis (a) during stable bronchiectasis; and for reducing; (b) the severity and frequency of acute respiratory exacerbations and (c) long term pulmonary decline.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialized Register Collaboration and Cochrane Airways Group, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched by the Cochrane Airways Group. The latest searches were performed in September 2007.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials comparing ICS with a placebo or no medication. Children and adults with clinical or radiographic evidence of bronchiectasis were included, but patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Results of searches were reviewed against pre-determined criteria for inclusion.

Main Results

There were no paediatric studies. Six adult studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of the 303 randomised, 278 subjects completed the trials. In the short term group (ICS for less then 6 months duration), adults on huge doses of ICS (2g per day of budesonide equivalent) had significantly improved forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV₁), forced vital capacity (FVC), Quality of life (QOL) score and sputum volume but no significant difference in peak flow, exacerbations, cough or wheeze, when compared to adults in the control arm (no ICS). When only placebo-controlled studies were included, there were no significant difference between groups in all outcomes examined (spirometry, clinical outcomes of exacerbation or sputum volume etc). The single study on long term outcomes showed no significant effect of inhaled steroids in any of the outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

The present review indicates that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of inhaled steroids in adults with stable state bronchiectasis. While a therapeutic trial may be justified in adults with difficult to control symptoms and in certain subgroups, this has to be balanced with adverse events especially if high doses are used. No recommendation can be made for the use of ICS in adults during an acute exacerbation or in children (for any state) as there were no studies.

### Acute bronchitis: rapid evidence review [^113hYQ39]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute bronchitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that delayed antibiotic prescription (such as when the diagnosis is in question or if the patient requests a prescription) decreases antibiotic use without affecting patient satisfaction.

### Airway clearance techniques for bronchiectasis [^1179SGcp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

People with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis commonly experience chronic cough and sputum production and these features may be associated with progressive decline in clinical status. Airway clearance techniques (ACTs) are often prescribed to facilitate expectoration of sputum from the lungs, but the efficacy of these techniques in a stable clinical state or during an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis is unclear.

Objectives

Primary: to determine the effects of ACTs on the rate of acute exacerbations, incidence of hospitalisation and health-related quality of life in individuals with acute and stable bronchiectasis. Secondary: to determine whether a) ACTs are safe for individuals with acute and stable bronchiectasis and b) ACTs have beneficial effects on physiology and symptoms in individuals with acute and stable bronchiectasis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials from inception to October 2012, PEDro in October 2012 and handsearched relevant journals.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled parallel and cross-over trials that compared an ACT to no treatment, sham ACT or directed coughing in participants with bronchiectasis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Five studies involving 51 participants met the inclusion criteria of the review, all of which were cross-over design. Four studies were on adults with stable bronchiectasis, and the other study was on clinically stable children with bronchiectasis. Three studies were single treatment sessions, two were longer-term studies. The interventions varied and some control groups received a sham intervention while others were inactive. The methodological quality of the studies was variable and the studies were not able to blind participants and personal. Heterogeneity between studies precluded these data from meta-analysis and the review was therefore narrative. One study on 20 adults comparing an airway oscillatory device with no treatment found no significant difference in the number of exacerbations at 12 weeks (low-quality evidence). No data were available to assess the impact of ACTs on the time to exacerbation, duration of, incidence of hospitalisation or total number of hospitalised days. The same study reported clinically significant improvements in health-related quality of life in both disease-specific and cough-related measures. While based on a small number of participants and the data were skewed, the median difference in the change in total St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score over three months in this study was 8.5 units (P value = 0.005 (Wilcoxon), low-quality evidence). Two studies reported mean increases in volume of sputum expectorated with airway oscillatory devices in the short term of 8.4 mL (95% CI 3.4 to 13.4 mL) and in the long term of 3 mL (P value = 0.02), with no significant effect on lung function. One study reported an immediate reduction in pulmonary hyperinflation in adults with non-positive expiratory pressure (PEP) ACTs (difference in functional residual capacity (FRC) of 19%, P value < 0.05) and with airway oscillatory devices (difference in FRC of 30%, P value < 0.05) compared to no ACTs. A similar decrease in pulmonary hyperinflation (difference in FRC of 6%) was found in children using an airway oscillatory device for 3 months compared to sham therapy. No studies reported on the effects of gas exchange, people's symptoms or antibiotic usage.

Authors' Conclusions

ACTs appear to be safe for individuals (adults and children) with stable bronchiectasis, where there may be improvements in sputum expectoration, selected measures of lung function and health-related quality of life. The role of these techniques in people with an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis is unknown. In view of the chronic nature of bronchiectasis, more data are needed to establish the clinical value of ACTs over the short and long term on patient-important outcomes, including symptoms, on physiological outcomes which may clarify the rationale for each technique and on long-term parameters that impact on disease progression in individuals with stable bronchiectasis. This is necessary in order to provide further guidance of specific ACT prescription for people with bronchiectasis. It may also be important to establish the comparative effect of different types of ACTs in people with bronchiectasis.

### Antibiotics for prolonged wet cough in children [^1137RANQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cough is a frequent symptom presenting to doctors. The most common cause of childhood chronic (greater than fours weeks' duration) wet cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in some settings, although other more serious causes can also present this way. Timely and effective management of chronic wet or productive cough improves quality of life and clinical outcomes. Current international guidelines suggest a course of antibiotics is the first treatment of choice in the absence of signs or symptoms specific to an alternative diagnosis. This review sought to clarify the current evidence to support this recommendation.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of antibiotics in treating children with prolonged wet cough (excluding children with bronchiectasis or other known underlying respiratory illness) and to assess risk of harm due to adverse events.

Search Methods

We undertook an updated search (from 2008 onwards) using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, trials registries, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest searches were performed in September 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with a placebo or a control group in children with chronic wet cough. We excluded cluster and cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods as recommended by Cochrane. We reviewed results of searches against predetermined criteria for inclusion. Two independent review authors selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. We contacted authors of eligible studies for further information as needed. We analysed data as 'intention to treat'.
Main Results

We identified three studies as eligible for inclusion in the review. Two were in the previous review and one new study was included. We considered the older studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias whereas we judged the newly included study at low risk of bias. The studies varied in treatment duration (from 7 to 14 days) and the antibiotic used (two studies used amoxicillin/clavulanate acid and one used erythromycin). We included 190 children (171 completed), mean ages ranged from 21 months to six years, in the meta-analyses. Analysis of all three trials (190 children) found that treatment with antibiotics reduced the proportion of children not cured at follow-up (primary outcome measure) (odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.31, using intention-to -treat analysis), which translated to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). We identified no significant heterogeneity (for both fixed-effect and random-effects model the I² statistic was 0%). Two older trials assessed progression of illness, defined by requirement for further antibiotics (125 children), which was significantly lower in the antibiotic group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.34; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5). All three trials (190 children) reported adverse events, which were not significantly increased in the antibiotic group compared to the control group (OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.69). We assessed the quality of evidence GRADE rating as moderate for all outcome measures, except adverse events which we assessed as low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious for the treatment of children with chronic wet cough (greater than four weeks) with an NNTB of three. However, antibiotics have adverse effects and this review reported only uncertainty as to the risk of increased adverse effects when they were used in this setting. The inclusion of a more robust study strengthened the previous Cochrane review and its results.

### Mucolytic agents for chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114gjTS8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Individuals with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may suffer recurrent exacerbations with an increase in volume and/or purulence of sputum and any therapy that reduced the number of exacerbations would be useful. There is a marked difference between countries in terms of prescribing of mucolytics depending on whether or not they are perceived to be effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral mucolytics in adults with stable chronic bronchitis or COPD.

Search Strategy

We have searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and reference lists of articles, on three separate occasions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials that compared oral mucolytic therapy with placebo for at least two months in adults with chronic bronchitis or COPD. Studies of people with asthma and cystic fibrosis were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer extracted data. Study authors and drug companies were contacted for missing information.

Main Results

Twenty three trials were included. Compared with placebo, there was a significant reduction in the number of exacerbations per patient with oral mucolytics (weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.066 per month, 95% confidence interval -0.077, -0.054, p < 0.001). Using the annualised rate of exacerbations in the control patients of 2.7 per year, this is a 29% reduction. The number of days of disability also fell (WMD -0.56, 95% confidence interval -0.77, -0.35, p < 0.001). The number of patients who remained exacerbation-free was greater in the mucolytic group (OR 2.22, 95% confidence interval 1.93, 2.54, p < 0.001). There was no difference in lung function or in adverse effects reported between treatments.

Reviewer's Conclusions

In subjects with chronic bronchitis or COPD, treatment with mucolytics was associated with a small reduction in acute exacerbations and a somewhat greater reduction in total number of days of disability.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^115xHMqq]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute cough due to viral respiratory tract infections

In viral respiratory tract infections, sore throat, headache, sneezing, runny nose and nasal congestion appear early in the course of the disease; cough emerges on day 2 or 3 only, but subsequently, from day 4 cough becomes the most bothersome and by far the longest lasting symptom until day 14.

Viral infections of the respiratory epithelium cause early release of many inflammatory mediators disrupting the respiratory epithelium, sensitising chemosensitive cough receptors and the neuronal pathway of the cough reflex. Thus, hypersensitivity of the afferent sensory nerves is thought to be the major mechanism causing cough in acute bronchitis, not the production of excessive mucus. Where mild-to-moderate mucus hypersecretion occurs, it is through the superficial goblet cells and submucosal glands. The incidence of mucus production, if any, seems to be present in common colds in just the first 48–72 hours. An evaluation of the placebo arms (n = 774) of several studies in common cold after day 1 show no increase in sputum production. Thus, in viral respiratory tract infections, sputum expectoration, if any, lasts for a short time and the amount of secretion is small. From the therapeutic aspect, the treatment of wet and dry cough remains the same and recently a call for the removal of this classification has been made. Therefore, antitussives with proven efficacy might be the most appropriate treatment to relieve debilitating cough, of whatever character, in acute respiratory tract infections. Worsening bronchial obstruction may only be a risk in patients with pre-existing chronic airway obstruction.

### Effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment versus antibiotic therapy and placebo for patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis with purulent sputum. the BAAP study protocol [^1132kc9R]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchitis is a clinical term which implies a self-limiting infection of the large airways and is characterized by clinical manifestations of cough without pneumonia. This process affects approximately 5% of adults annually with a greater incidence in the winter. It accounts for 9.4% of the infections attended by family physicians. Acute bronchitis is mainly a viral infection. The role of bacteria in this infection continues to be controversial since bronchial biopsies have never demonstrated bacterial invasion. In some cases atypical germs may be involved including Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumonia.

It is thought that acute bronchitis reflects an inflammatory response to infections of the epithelium of the bronchi. Microscopic examination demonstrates a thickening of the bronchial and tracheal mucosa corresponding to the inflamed areas. These pathological findings are consistent with publications of proximal lower airway inflammation observed with positron emission tomography. During the first days of infection, the symptoms of upper respiratory infections cannot be clinically distinguished from the symptoms of acute bronchitis. However, in acute bronchitis cough lasts more than five days and during this prolonged period of symptoms, the results of functional respiratory tests are usually abnormal. Forty per cent of the patients present significant reductions in forced espiratory volume in the first second (FEV₁) with values of less than 80% over the theoretical value, or bronchial hyper-reactivity with improvement during the following 5–6 weeks. Cough may persist from 10 to 20 days in acute bronchitis, but it may sometimes last up to 4 weeks or more. In a recent study on the efficacy of the acellular pertussis vaccine including 2,781 healthy adults, the mean duration of cough in acute bronchitis by all causes was 18 days, with a median of 24 days. Moreover, almost half of the patients with acute bronchitis report the production of purulent expectoration. Peroxidase released by the leukocytes in sputum causes the colour changes; hence, colour alone should not be considered indicative of bacterial infection. Indeed, in healthy adults, the positive predictive value of purulent sputum for the presence of alveolar disease is low, being of approximately 10%.

Bronchitis has shown to reduce the quality of life of patients. One study on the quality of life of patients with infections of the upper respiratory tract, some of which were labelled acute bronchitis, showed a reduction in seven subscales of the 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey, including vital and social function, although this decrease was transitory. Furthermore, up to twenty per cent of the patients return to their physician within the first month for the persistence of symptoms.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^1146M1eL]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients — definition, evidence, and panel suggestions are as follows: Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection manifested predominantly by cough with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks with no clinical or any recent radiographic evidence to suggest an alternative explanation. For the second question, only one relevant study met eligibility criteria, and this study found no difference in number of days with cough between patients treated with an antibiotic or an oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent compared with placebo, while no eligible studies relevant to the first question were identified. The panelists suggested that no routine investigations be ordered and no routine medications be prescribed in immunocompetent adult outpatients first presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, until such investigations and treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner, and if the cough due to suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, a reassessment and consideration of targeted investigations should be considered.

### Mucolytic agents for chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115Vv8SZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Individuals with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may suffer recurrent exacerbations with an increase in volume and/or purulence of sputum. Because of the personal and healthcare costs associated with exacerbations, any therapy that reduces the number of exacerbations is useful. There is a marked difference between countries in terms of prescribing of mucolytics depending on whether or not they are perceived to be effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral mucolytics in adults with stable chronic bronchitis or COPD.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles on eight separate occasions, the most recent being in September 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials that compared oral mucolytic therapy with placebo for at least two months in adults with chronic bronchitis or COPD. We excluded studies of people with asthma and cystic fibrosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author extracted data. We contacted study authors and drug companies for missing information.

Main Results

Twenty-eight trials involving 7042 participants were included. Compared with placebo, there was a significant reduction in the number of exacerbations per patient with oral mucolytics (weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.04 per month, 95% confidence interval -0.05 to -0.03). Using a weighted annualised rate of exacerbations in the control patients of 2.4 per year, this is a 21% reduction. The number of days of disability also fell (WMD -0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.77 to -0.35). One recent study has shown that the benefit may apply only to patients not already receiving inhaled corticosteroids. The number of patients who remained exacerbation-free was greater in the mucolytic group (odds ratio (OR) 1.93 (95% CI 1.71 to 2.17)). There is no strong evidence of improvement in lung function and treatment is not associated with any increase in adverse effects. Patients on mucolytics may be less likely to be hospitalised during the study period.

Authors' Conclusions

In participants with chronic bronchitis or COPD, treatment with mucolytics was associated with a small reduction in acute exacerbations and a reduction in total number of days of disability. Benefit may be greater in individuals who have frequent or prolonged exacerbations, or those who are repeatedly admitted to hospital with exacerbations with COPD. Mucolytics should be considered for use, through the winter months at least, in patients with moderate or severe COPD in whom inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are not prescribed.

### European Respiratory Society clinical practice guideline for the management of adult bronchiectasis [^115ar67f]. The European Respiratory Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, ERS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering the following investigations and management in a deteriorating patient:

- obtain a comprehensive re-evaluation of patients and their treatment in cases of clinical deterioration, including increasing exacerbation frequency and/or severity, worsening of symptoms, and/or rapid decline in lung function

- evaluate adherence to both airway clearance techniques and/or pharmacological treatment

- review underlying diseases other than bronchiectasis to ensure they are being adequately treated

- consider obtaining investigation for specific conditions known to be associated with deterioration, such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, or infection with a new pathogen

- recognize that early diagnosis of bronchiectasis, accurate identification and treatment of its underlying cause, adequate management of chronic airway infection, and interventions to prevent exacerbations and control disease may delay disease progression

- obtain repeat chest CT imaging to identify several potential causes of deterioration

- obtain repeat testing for nontuberculous mycobacterial infection when there are suggestive clinical or radiologic features, particularly in patients who deteriorate despite appropriate antibiotics

- refer deteriorating patients who are not already under the care of a bronchiectasis specialist to a respiratory clinic with expertise in bronchiectasis

- review and optimize current treatment using a "treatable traits" approach. This includes, but is not limited to, treatment directed at the underlying etiology of the patient's bronchiectasis, airway clearance and mucoactive treatments, vaccination status, long-term (inhaled or oral) antibiotic treatment, P. aeruginosa eradication treatment, long-term inhaled bronchodilator and corticosteroid treatment, pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, and non-invasive ventilatory support where appropriate

- consider offering lung resection in highly selected patients with localized disease whose symptoms are not controlled by medical treatment optimized by a bronchiectasis specialist

- recognize that early referral for lung transplantation is essential in patients with progressive disease despite optimal medical management. This may include rapidly declining forced expiratory volume in one second or forced expiratory volume in one second ≤ 30% predicted, and/or arterial CO₂ pressure ≥ 50 mmHg. (conditional recommendation for the intervention, very low certainty of evidence).

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^1125ujrZ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Much of the evidence supporting drug therapy in acute cough is old and of poor quality. There is little randomised controlled trial-based evidence which is of a modern standard. There are also well-known geographical differences in prescribing. For example, in Germany, OTC secretolytics and mucolytics such as ambroxol and N -acetylcysteine (NAS) are by far the most popular treatment with a market share as high as 47.4% of the entire common cold OTC market (source: IMS OTC Report). In contrast, in North America, OTC oral decongestant/first-generation (sedating) H1 antihistamines are used most frequently. Both strategies have little supporting evidence. Degrading mucus polymers and lowering mucus viscosity by mucolytic drugs has not been proven effective in treatment of cough in acute bronchitis. While first-generation antihistamines such as diphenhydramine might be effective in the treatment of cough, the second-generation ones are not.

How can we assess the efficacy of antitussive medications?

Since acute bronchitis and acute cough are by definition self-limiting illnesses lasting a few days, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between spontaneous remissions because of the patient getting better naturally from the effect of any medicine which has been administered. Basically, three tools have been used over the years to examine the antitussive activity of the currently marketed drugs. Subjective measures such as the visual analogue scale (VAS) or simply asking the patient whether they think their cough has improved were originally the favoured efficacy measure and many long-established preparations obtained their licence on this basis. Unfortunately, many of the studies are poorly designed with an inadequate number of patients and frequently using a mixed bag of diseases such as chronic bronchitis, tuberculosis and even lung cancer! Clearly, such studies would not be permissible in the modern era. Thus, the evidence base for many traditional antitussive preparations is extremely poor and, in our opinion, would be insufficient to make any claims of antitussive activity in terms of modern 'evidence-based medicine'.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: randomised placebo controlled trial [^116LYh4h]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

One of the results of this study is that antibiotic treatment was not more effective than placebo in shortening the duration of cough. Systematic analyses of clinical trials also suggest that antibiotics may achieve a reduction, albeit marginal, in the duration of the symptoms. A review of the Cochrane Library showed that patients given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough than were those given placebo (risk ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.85), but these results came from only four clinical trials with 275 participants in total. Another randomised clinical trial, based on data from the genomics to combat resistance against antibiotics in community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in Europe (GRACE) study, not included in the Cochrane Library review, has recently been published. It constitutes, by far, the largest study carried out, including 16 networks in 12 European countries with 2061 adults aged 18 or older with acute cough of less than one month's duration as the prominent symptom, and once pneumonia was excluded on the basis of clinical grounds. Symptoms rated moderately bad or worse, which was considered as the main outcome, lasted a median of six days in the group allocated to amoxicillin 3 g daily and seven days in the placebo group, with a non-significant difference (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.18). Similar to our study design, Stott and colleagues included only patients with acute bronchitis and purulent sputum and did not observe any statistically significant differences in the resolution of cough between the group treated with antibiotics and the group assigned to the control. Current guidelines, endorsed by several national societies, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the European Respiratory Society, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, do not recommend the routine use of antibiotics for uncomplicated acute bronchitis in otherwise normal people. None the less, after their introduction in the 1940s, antibacterial agents were rapidly embraced for treatment of acute bronchitis. At present, more than 60% of patients receive antibiotics for acute bronchitis, and it is currently one of the five most commonly cited infections for excessive antibiotic use in outpatients. Many doctors may not give antibiotics on the first visit, but are more likely to prescribe these antibacterials on subsequent visits, mainly if discoloured sputum is present. In a prospective study of more than 3000 adults with acute cough due a lower respiratory tract infection in 13 European countries, Butler and colleagues observed that patients who presented discoloured sputum were prescribed antibiotics 3.2 times more often than those patients without discoloured sputum. In other studies this odds ratio of antibiotic prescribing in the presence of discoloured sputum ranged from 2.1 to 4.8. This aspect is even more important since more than half of the patients with acute bronchitis report the production of purulent sputum. Peroxidase released by the leucocytes in sputum causes the colour changes; hence, colour alone should not be considered indicative of bacterial infection. Another explanation for the frequent prescription of antibiotics is the lack of distinction between acute and chronic bronchitis. This may explain why clinicians perceive antibiotics to be more beneficial to smokers.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^111BWZ1A]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis — evidence base and clinical statement: Only six studies were eligible, with five pharmacological and one nonpharmacological intervention, and the nonpharmacological study used positive end-expiratory pressure; although all authors reported significant improvement in cough measures, studies were very small, had design or outcome limitations, several did not present cough outcome data, most were short in duration (2 to 12 weeks for pharmacologic studies and 6 months for the nonpharmacologic study), and using GRADE the evidence level was very low; accordingly, for adult patients with chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of any pharmacologic treatments (antibiotics, bronchodilators, mucolytics) as a means of relieving cough per se.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: when are antibiotics indicated? A systematic review [^116Dxw2f]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Methods

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotics with placebo or no antibiotics in COPD patients suffering from an acute exacerbation defined as a worsening of a previous stable situation with symptoms such as increased dyspnea, increased cough, increased sputum volume or change in sputum colour. We considered studies if > 90% of patients had a clinical (physician-based) diagnosis of COPD or, ideally, spirometrically confirmed COPD. We excluded studies of patients with acute bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma or bronchiectasis.

We included trials evaluating any antibiotics that were administered orally or parenterally daily for a minimum period of at least three days. We chose three days because this is the minimum duration for which antibiotics are usually prescribed in clinical practice for COPD exacerbations.

The outcome measure of primary interest was treatment failure defined as (1) no resolution of symptoms and signs as reported by patients or physicians or as (2) need for further antibiotics. Outcome measures of secondary interest were duration of hospital admission, admission to an intensive care unit, health-related quality of life, symptoms, mortality, and any adverse events registered during the study period.

Search strategy

The search was carried out by information specialists (Bazian, London, UK) and included searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2005 issue 4), PREMEDLINE (1960 to 1965), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1974 to March 2006), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE, March 2006). We entered all included studies into the Pub-med "related articles" function and the science citation index. In addition, we scrutinised the reference lists of included studies and review articles as well the conference proceedings of the international congresses of the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society from 2000 to 2006 since these studies might not have been fully published yet. We also contacted representatives of the pharmaceutical industry for additional published or unpublished data (Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, BoehringerIngelheim, Pfizer and MSD). Finally, we searched international data bases for trial registration to identify ongoing or recently completed trials.

Study selection

Two members of the review team independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all identified citations without imposing any language restrictions. The reviewers then evaluated the full text of articles that seemed potentially eligible by one of the reviewers. Final decisions on in- and exclusion were recorded in the Endnote file and agreement was assessed using chance-adjusted kappa statistics.

### Efficacy of non-invasive ventilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^11715Q8k]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant public health concern, affecting millions of individuals worldwide and imposing a substantial burden on healthcare systems. The diagnosis of COPD involves a comprehensive assessment of symptoms, lung function tests (spirometry), and physical examination. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) provides guidelines for diagnosis and staging, which inform treatment decisions. According to GOLD criteria, a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV₁)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio < 0.7 is diagnostic for COPD. Managing COPD requires a multifaceted approach, including pharmacological interventions (such as steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics), pulmonary rehabilitation, and ventilator support. Stable COPD is characterized by a period of time when the patient's symptoms are stable and not experiencing an acute exacerbation. During this period, patients may experience symptoms such as dyspnea, wheezing, and coughing, but these symptoms are typically manageable with medication and other treatments. Conversely, post-exacerbation COPD (PECOPD) patients are those who have recently experienced an acute exacerbation of COPD and are in the recovery phase. These patients are at increased risk of recurrent exacerbations, hospital readmissions, and mortality, and require careful management to prevent further decline and improve outcomes.

### Effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment versus antibiotic therapy and placebo for patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis with purulent sputum. the BAAP study protocol [^114yaam3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Sample size

We will accept a null hypothesis if the number of days of frequent cough in the anti-inflammatory arm is the same or ± 2 days as that observed in the other two treatment arms (placebo and antibiotic treatment). Based on the literature, the standard deviation of the duration of frequent cough is 5.5 days in patients with chronic bronchitis and purulent sputum. For an α: 0.05 and a β: 0.2 and accepting possible losses of 15%, we calculate that the sample size should be of 140 patients per group (total of 420 patients).

Analysis

Intention-to-treat statistical analyses will be performed. To analyse the time until cure of the different symptoms and for the main result variable (days from the onset of the picture until the patient scores a maximum of 1 in the box related to cough in the symptom diary) survival analysis will be carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison between the three survival curves will be undertaken using the log-rank test. In addition, bivariate analysis will be peformed with comparison of proportions using the chi-square test to evaluate secondary variables of the study and variance analysis to assess the relationship between quantitative variables for both independent and paired data.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^116yCD45]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients — summary of suggestions indicates that for cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, we suggest no routine investigation with chest x-ray, spirometry, peak flow measurement, sputum for microbial culture, respiratory tract samples for viral PCR, serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) or procalcitonin (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). If suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, we suggest that the patient is advised to seek reassessment and targeted investigation(s) be considered (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), and suggested targeted investigations could include chest x-ray, sputum for microbial culture, peak expiratory flow rate recording(s), complete blood count and inflammatory markers such as CRP. For cough due to acute bronchitis, we suggest no routine prescription of antibiotic therapy, antiviral therapy, antitussives, inhaled beta agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, oral NSAIDs or other therapies until such treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). If acute bronchitis worsens, we suggest consideration for treatment with antibiotic therapy if a complicating bacterial infection is thought likely (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), and differential diagnoses such as exacerbations of chronic airways diseases (COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis) that may require other therapeutic management (such as with oral corticosteroids) should also be considered.

### Chinese medicinal herbs for acute bronchitis [^116icixk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care physicians. It is traditionally treated with antibiotics (although the evidence for their effectiveness is weak, and modest at best) and other even less effective treatments. Chinese medicinal herbs have also been used as a treatment.

Objectives

This review aimed to summarise the existing evidence on the comparative effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs for treating uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4) which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to 19 September 19, 2011), EMBASE (1988 to 19 September 2011) and CNKI and the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1980 to 19 September, 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Chinese medicinal herbs with placebo, antibiotics or other Western medicines for the treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

In this updated review, 74 studies involving 6877 participants were reported as RCTs by the study authors. None of them met the inclusion criteria for this review. Out of the 74 trials, we identified 39 as non-RCTs and 35 compared different Chinese herbal medicines in the intervention and control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient quality data to recommend the routine use of Chinese herbs for acute bronchitis. Trial design limitations of the individual studies meant that we could not draw any conclusions about the benefits of Chinese herbs for acute bronchitis. In addition, the safety of Chinese herbs is unknown due to the lack of toxicological evidence for these herbs, although adverse events were reported in some case reports.

Ambroxol

Ambroxol is the active metabolite of bromhexine and the most popular drug on the German OTC market (in 2015, 24% of the expectorant market share with an additional 1.7% for bromhexine, source: IMS OTC Report). Most references arise from the 1970s to 1980s and are related to long-term use in obstructive lung disease to prevent exacerbations or are in chronic bronchitisto ease expectoration. A recent review of ambroxol clinical datastated that, based on acceptability of study design (ie, randomised, double-blind, controlled) for short-term use in adults, only 3 out of 24 studies were acceptable. Only the Matthys et al study investigated acute respiratory tract infection in a large, four parallel arm (some 170 patients in each arm) double-blind quadruple dummy randomised design the effect of 3×30 mg ambroxol days 1–3, 2×30 mg days 4–14, 4×300 mg myrtol (a standardised phytotherapeutic distillate containing 1,18 cineol) 1–14 days and 2×250 mg cefuroxime 1–6 days versus placebo over 2 weeks. Among secondary outcomes were diary data on nightly cough and coughing bouts during the day assessed. All three treatments were similarly effective and significantly better than placebo. The remaining two studies assessed short-term treatment of chronic conditions. Studies in children were conducted only without a control group or versus an active comparator in an open design.

Based on these data, symptomatic efficacy of ambroxol versus placebo on cough is proven in a single RCT.

N-acetylcysteine

NAC is the second most popular drug for acute cough in Germany with 23.5% of the OTC expectorant market share in 2015 (source: IMS OTC Report), a fact sharply contrasting with the available evidence for this indication. A Cochrane Library meta-analysis of three RCTs with cough at day 7 as the main outcome is available for acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in a paediatric population. Statistically significant benefit was seen but the authors felt they were 'of little clinical relevance'. Another Cochrane review for OTC medications for acute cough in 2014 did not find any references for NASnor did a MEDLINE search by the authors of this paper (search terms of N-Acetylcystein AND Cough; N-Acetylcystein AND bronchitis; Acetylcystein AND cough; Acetylcystein AND Bronchitis).

Exacerbations are a characteristic feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and contribute significantly to associated morbidity and mortality. Renewed interest in this common clinical problem and research using new investigative tools has enhanced substantially the understanding of the pathogenesis of exacerbations. Results of recent clinical trials and observational studies have allowed refinements in treatment of exacerbations that should im-prove patient outcomes. This article discusses a rational, stratified approach to the use of antibiotics for this condition based on these recent studies.

Frequency of daytime cough attacks

The number of participants achieving a ≥ 75% reduction in daytime cough attacks from baseline (i.e. a clinically significant reduction) was statistically significantly higher in the verum group compared to the placebo group on Days 3 (p = 0.022), 8 (p = 0.015), and 10 (p = 0.029) (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
Frequency of participants achieving a ≥ 75% reduction in daytime cough attacks from baseline. Total n = 305 (verum group/placebo group: 155/150). RRs and ORs are accompanied by corresponding 95% CIs. pValues were calculated using the Pearson χ² test (2sided). The frequency of daytime cough attacks was assessed by the investigator at Day 1 (baseline), Day 4 and Day 10 using the BSS and by the participants on Days 1 through 10 using the ABSS (results shown for Day 3 and Day 8)

Time to ≥ 75% reduction in frequency of daytime cough attacks

The study revealed that participants receiving the studied combination preparation experienced a clinically significant reduction in daytime cough attacks statistically significantly faster compared to participants receiving placebo (p = 0.027) (Fig. 5).

Cough severity

The number of participants achieving a ≥ 75% reduction in cough severity from baseline per VAS (i.e. a clinically significant reduction) was consistently higher in the verum group compared to the placebo group on all reporting days (Fig. 6). A statistically significant difference between the 2 study intervention groups was observed on Days 3 (p = 0.041), 8 (p = 0.042), and 10 (p = 0.011).

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^117WmX5o]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chronic cough due to chronic bronchitis (CB) is addressed by a CHEST Expert Panel through a systematic review focusing on adult patients, key diagnostic and treatment questions, and development of guideline suggestions. Chronic cough due to CB is described as causing significant impairment in quality of life, and the review examined whether features of the history suggest cough‑phlegm syndrome is due to CB, whether treatment of stable CB can improve or eliminate chronic cough, and whether therapy targeting cough due to CB can prevent or reduce acute CB exacerbations. Studies of adult CB populations were included and assessed for relevance and quality, guideline suggestions were developed and voted on using CHEST methodology, and the search strategy used varied descriptors and assessments to identify studies. The conclusions state that the evidence supporting management of chronic cough due to CB is limited overall and of low quality, and that the article provides guidance by presenting suggestions based on currently available evidence while identifying gaps and areas for future research. The report is endorsed by the American Association for Respiratory Care.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^115JU8be]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients — evaluation and pharmacologic management is summarized as follows: For immunocompetent adult outpatients presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, we suggest no routine investigation. If the cough persists or worsens, we suggest reassessment and consideration of targeted investigations. We suggest no routine prescription of antibiotic therapy, antiviral therapy, antitussives, inhaled beta agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, oral NSAIDs, or other therapies. If the cough due to suspected acute bronchitis worsens, we suggest reassessment and consideration for treatment with antibiotic therapy if a bacterial infection is thought likely or treatment for other alternative conditions deemed likely.

### European Respiratory Society clinical practice guideline for the management of adult bronchiectasis [^1115iFpi]. The European Respiratory Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, ERS 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize an exacerbation as a worsening of symptoms that exceeds day-to-day variability and necessitates a change in management. Core symptoms include changes in cough, sputum volume and/or consistency, sputum purulence, dyspnea and/or exercise intolerance, fatigue or malaise, and hemoptysis. Additional clinical features may include fever, wheezing, general discomfort, anorexia, weight loss, pleuritic chest pain, and changes on chest examination. Recognize features of a severe exacerbation, defined as requiring hospitalization or intravenous antibiotic treatment, which may include tachypnea, acute or acute on chronic respiratory failure, a significant decline in oxygen saturation or respiratory function, hypercapnia, hemoptysis, new onset of cyanosis, new signs of cor pulmonale, hemodynamic instability, and/or impaired cognitive function.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^113qmtQk]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Stable chronic bronchitis (CB) treatment — PICO Question 2 GRADE evidence summarizes randomized comparisons of antibiotics and bronchodilators on cough outcomes. Azithromycin improved cough-related quality of life, with an "increase in LCQ total score after 12 wk with azithromycin compared with placebo = 1.3 ± 0.5 (95% CI, 0.3–2.3) (P = 0.01)". For ipratropium bromide, "Data not provided for cough" but "Mean frequency reported as decreased by 15.9% and cough severity reported only as decreased (P < .05)". Bamiphylline showed within-group improvement: "Pretrial clinical cough score: 2.76 ± 0.84 vs posttrial score 0.8 ± 0.63 with bamiphylline (P < .01) compared with 2.45 ± 0.48 vs 2.33 ± 0.7 for placebo (NS)".

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^111Fm5tW]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Diphenhydramine

Diphenhydramine is a first-generation H1 antihistamine approved in some countries as an OTC antitussive, including the United States and the UK. In Germany, diphenhydramine 50 mg is approved as a hypnotic or antiemetic only. First-generation antitussives in combination with oral decongestants are recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence Based Guidelines for the treatment of cough in common cold and in the so-called upper airway cough syndrome. However, despite the title of those guidelines, this recommendation is based on expert opinion. In cough challenge studies in healthy participantsand patients with acute viral respiratory infection (diphenhydramine combination syrup with decongestant) in adults efficacy could have been established. However, no symptom or objective cough monitoring-based studies are available for acute cough. There is a clear-cut discrepancy between evidence of efficacy and broad clinical use of diphenhydramine/decongestant combinations for acute cough — despite an important sedative effect (dizziness) — especially in the United States. Table 1 evaluates how European antitussives match up to the modern metrics in cough research.

### Chinese medicinal herbs for acute bronchitis [^111Gx4Xd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary-care physicians. It is traditionally treated with antibiotics, (although the evidence for their effectiveness is weak and modest at best), and other even less effective treatments. Chinese medicinal herbs have been also used as treatment.

Objectives

This review aims to summarise the existing evidence on the comparative effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs for treating uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's specialised register; The Chinese Cochrane Centre's Controlled Trials Register (up to December 2004); MEDLINE (1966 to March Week 1, 2005); EMBASE (1988 to December 2004); and the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1980 to December 2004).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing Chinese medicinal herbs with placebo, antibiotics or other Western medicines for the treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Four trials reported the time to improvement of cough, fever, and rales associated with bronchitis and showed that patients treated with Chinese herbs had a shorter duration of signs and symptoms. Two trials reported the proportion of patients with improved signs and symptoms at follow up and showed that Chinese herbs were beneficial in terms of relief of signs and symptoms. Thirteen trials analysed the data on physician global assessment of improvement at follow up. Nine of thirteen trials showed that Chinese herbs were superior to routine treatment and the other four trials showed a similar effect to routine treatment. In general, Chinese herbs appeared beneficial. Only one trial reported on adverse effects during treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient quality data to recommend the routine use of Chinese herbs for acute bronchitis. The benefit found in this systematic review could be due to publication bias and study-design limitations of the individual studies. In addition, the safety of Chinese herbs is unknown due to the lack of toxicological evidence on these Chinese herbs, though adverse events are rarely reported. Chinese herbs should be used carefully.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: randomised placebo controlled trial [^113sUbzJ]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This study found no differences in the number of days with frequent cough among patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum treated with ibuprofen, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, or placebo. The trial was sufficiently powered and, to the best of our knowledge, the first to allow conclusions on the efficacy of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug in patients with acute bronchitis compared with an antibiotic and placebo.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^111BHEfY]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

PICO question 1 — adult outpatients with suspected acute bronchitis defines inclusion criteria for diagnostic accuracy studies, specifying study designs (systematic review [with or without meta-analysis], RCT, retrospective or prospective cohort study, cross-sectional study), population (ambulatory or outpatient; ≥ 18 y of age; acute bronchitis), interventions (CXR; sputum for microbial culture; PCR for virus; C-reactive protein; procalcitonin; spirometry pre- and postbronchodilator or methacholine challenge), comparator (history and physical alone), and outcomes (primary: exclusion of pneumonia, influenza, pertussis, asthma, or acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, sinusitis, COPD, bronchiectasis; use negative predictive value; secondary: other diagnostic accuracy test parameters including positive predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, area under ROC curve).

### Bronchodilator therapy in patients with acute bronchitis… [^112QYWuM]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

to the editor: I read with interest the article "Acute Bronchitis" by Drs. Hueston and Mainous. 1 in the March 15 issue of American Family Physician. I agree with the authors regarding the limited value of antibiotics in the treatment of this common condition. However, recommendations for the appropriate use of bronchodilator therapy were not clearly stated. Should one base treatment on history alone or on physical examination findings alone. Should peak flow measurements be less than 80 percent of the predicted measurement before treatment is started. How long should bronchodilator therapy be used to treat this condition. Clarification of these issues will help physicians to better care for their patients who have this common condition. in reply: As Dr. Seehusen points out, antibiotics have not been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of acute bronchitis. Therefore, we do not recommend routine use of antibiotics in patients with acute bronchitis.

While it would be convenient to have a "high-risk" profile for patients who are more likely to have a bacterial infection, as we pointed out in our article, there is no way to predict the rare patient who has a bacterial etiology for his or her bronchitis. As far as treatment to prevent adult-onset asthma is concerned, antibiotics are not justified at this time. Currently, there is no good estimate of how often. Chlamydia pneumoniae is the etiologic agent for acute bronchitis, nor is there conclusive proof that Chlamydia infection causes asthma or that early treatment of Chlamydia prevents the development of asthma. For patients with prolonged cough lasting a month or longer, treatment with antibiotics may be cost effective, especially when compared with an expensive evaluation for chronic cough. 1 Otherwise, antibiotics should be avoided since they are an unnecessary expense, can cause side effects and may increase resistance to antibiotics. In response to Dr.

Sharkness's questions, the use of bronchodilators, more specifically albuterol, is based on clinical suspicion of acute bronchitis. No aspect of the patient's history or physical findings or findings on peak flow measurement indicates when albuterol will be most effective. Albuterol can be continued until symptoms are cleared; it should be noted, though, that in the two studies that examined the use of albuterol, 90 percent of patients had resolution of their cough after one week. 2, 3.
