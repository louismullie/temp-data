## Question

Indications for provigil

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for Provigil (modafinil), specifically distinguishing FDA-labeled uses from off-label applications and integrating guideline positions and safety constraints. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-approved indications and exact labeling language. Then, I should verify dosing and key limitations of use, especially in OSA. Next, I will review major off-label uses with the strength of evidence and guideline support. After that, I need to check safety, contraindications, and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary and double-check for any inconsistencies before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the FDA-labeled indications. Provigil is indicated to improve wakefulness in adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or shift work disorder (SWD), and it is not approved for pediatric use or for treating the underlying airway obstruction in OSA, which is a critical limitation I should emphasize [^112bzaqm] [^113GWQeD] [^111wZQL3].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing details so I don't overstate flexibility. For narcolepsy and OSA, the recommended dose is 200 mg once in the morning. For SWD, 200 mg taken about one hour before the work shift. Doses up to 400 mg have been studied but generally do not add consistent benefit beyond 200 mg, so I should not imply routine use of 400 mg without justification [^112iCRuf] [^114VJ4UB].

> Hold on, I should verify the OSA-specific limitation and ensure I capture CPAP requirements correctly. In OSA, modafinil treats residual excessive sleepiness and is not a substitute for primary therapy; maximal effort with CPAP should be made and maintained before and during modafinil treatment, and other causes of persistent sleepiness must be excluded, which aligns with guideline language from VA/DoD and AASM [^112bzaqm] [^112Y2nsF] [^111HT8Xh].

> Next, I should review the major off-label domains and their evidentiary footing, starting with fatigue and hypersomnolence in neurologic disease. Modafinil shows signal for MS-related fatigue in some studies, but results are mixed and guideline endorsements are cautious. AASM suggests considering modafinil for hypersomnia secondary to MS, yet ASCO recommends against routine use of wakefulness agents for cancer-related fatigue, and Cochrane highlights low-certainty benefits for fatigue augmentation in depression, so I need to be careful not to overgeneralize [^1125TnKV] [^11416iB1].

> Let me consider psychiatric applications next, and I should double-check where the evidence is strong versus preliminary. Meta-analytic data suggest modafinil augmentation can improve depressive symptoms and fatigue in unipolar and bipolar depression, but I must flag the risk of switching/mania and the need to screen for bipolar spectrum illness; importantly, WHO advises against using modafinil for stimulant use disorders, whereas ASAM/AAAP allows conditional consideration in cocaine use disorder absent comorbid psychosis, so recommendations diverge and should be individualized [^113GEGgx] [^116cKtxW] [^116VvT1N] [^114WpfWP].

> I will now examine ADHD, where confusion is common. Although randomized trials show symptomatic improvement, serious rash including possible SJS occurred in pediatric programs, leading to lack of FDA approval. Thus, even though guidelines may conditionally discuss pediatric narcolepsy, modafinil is not approved for ADHD, and pediatric use remains off-label with a boxed warning signal for severe cutaneous reactions [^111wZQL3] [^111jx8dy] [^113gvE5n].

> Let me think about hypersomnolence secondary to neurodegenerative and acquired brain injuries, since this is often asked. AASM suggests modafinil as a conditional option for hypersomnia in Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and even brain tumor–related hypersomnia, but the evidence base is limited and heterogeneous; I should frame these as expert-supported options after addressing primary sleep disorders and contributors [^117Ha4e2] [^112eHUKk].

> Next, I should review safety, contraindications, and special populations to ensure risk is balanced. Serious rash, including SJS/TEN and DRESS, can occur, often within 1–5 weeks, and modafinil should be stopped at the first sign of rash. Psychiatric adverse effects, cardiovascular effects, and multi-organ hypersensitivity are additional concerns. It is a Schedule IV controlled substance with stimulant-like properties but low observed withdrawal liability. Severe hepatic impairment warrants 50% dose reduction, and modafinil reduces contraceptive efficacy, necessitating nonhormonal backup. Finally, pediatric use is not established in the US label and carries elevated rash risk, so I should reinforce avoiding pediatric prescribing outside research or exceptional circumstances [^112Yy99S] [^114uN2Sm] [^114YksoJ] [^113bfZXY] [^113GWQeD] [^111wZQL3].

> But wait, what if someone cites a sports-medicine source listing fatigue due to multiple sclerosis as an indication? I should clarify that this reflects off-label or practice-based use rather than FDA labeling. Sports medicine references sometimes summarize real-world indications, yet the FDA label remains the authoritative source; thus, while MS fatigue appears in some clinical summaries, it is not an FDA-approved indication and should be presented as guideline-supported but off-label with variable evidence quality [^111KZ1AP] [^112bzaqm].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final synthesis. FDA-approved indications are adult narcolepsy, residual excessive sleepiness in OSA alongside optimized CPAP or equivalent therapy, and SWD. Major off-label uses with variable evidence include MS-related fatigue, depression-related fatigue augmentation, hypersomnia in PD, TBI, and brain tumor survivors, and investigational roles in stimulant use disorders where guidance conflicts. Modafinil is not approved for pediatric use or ADHD, and all off-label use should be individualized with explicit counseling on risks, interactions, and monitoring plans [^112bzaqm] [^1125TnKV] [^113GEGgx] [^116cKtxW] [^116VvT1N] [^111wZQL3].

---

Provigil (modafinil) is indicated to improve wakefulness in adults with **excessive sleepiness** associated with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or shift work disorder (SWD) [^112bzaqm] [^111E7AoE]. In OSA, it treats residual sleepiness despite optimal CPAP or other standard therapy, not the airway obstruction itself [^112bzaqm] [^111HT8Xh]. It is **not approved for pediatric use** or for other off-label indications such as ADHD, depression, or fatigue from other causes [^113GWQeD] [^111wZQL3]. The recommended dose is 200 mg once daily (morning for narcolepsy/OSA; ~1 hour before shift for SWD) [^112iCRuf]; reduce to 100 mg in severe hepatic impairment [^113bfZXY].

---

## FDA-approved indications

Provigil is **FDA-approved** for the following indications:

- **Narcolepsy**: Improves wakefulness in adults with excessive sleepiness [^112bzaqm] [^112t7c1m].

- **Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)**: Treats residual excessive sleepiness despite optimal CPAP or other standard therapy; does not treat the airway obstruction [^112bzaqm] [^112Y2nsF].

- **Shift work disorder (SWD)**: Improves wakefulness in adults with excessive sleepiness from shift work [^112bzaqm] [^115SoBcA].

---

## Limitations of use

Key limitations include that in OSA, Provigil is for **residual sleepiness** and is not a treatment for the underlying obstruction; maximal CPAP or other standard therapy should be maintained [^112bzaqm] [^112Y2nsF]. Provigil is not approved for pediatric patients, and its safety and effectiveness in children under 17 have not been established [^113GWQeD] [^111wZQL3].

---

## Dosage and administration

| **Indication** | **Recommended dosage** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|
| Narcolepsy | 200 mg once daily | Morning |
| Obstructive sleep apnea | 200 mg once daily | Morning |
| Shift work disorder | 200 mg once daily | Approximately 1 hour before the work shift |

---

In severe hepatic impairment, **reduce the dose to 100 mg daily** [^113bfZXY].

---

## Off-label uses (not FDA-approved)

While Provigil is sometimes used off-label, these uses are **not FDA-approved**:

- **Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)**: Not approved due to safety concerns, including serious skin reactions [^111wZQL3].

- **Depression and fatigue**: Some studies suggest benefit, but not FDA-approved [^113GEGgx] [^112bzaqm].

- **Multiple sclerosis-related fatigue**: Some evidence supports use, but not FDA-approved [^1125TnKV] [^112bzaqm].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Serious rash**: Rare but potentially life-threatening (SJS, TEN, DRESS); discontinue immediately if rash occurs [^112Yy99S].

- **Psychiatric symptoms**: Anxiety, insomnia, agitation, depression, and rare psychosis; use caution in patients with psychiatric history [^1146d6N8].

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Monitor patients with cardiovascular disease [^114VJ4UB].

- **Abuse potential**: Schedule IV controlled substance; monitor for misuse or dependence [^114YksoJ].

---

Provigil is indicated to improve wakefulness in adults with excessive sleepiness from narcolepsy, OSA, or SWD, with specific limitations and dosing adjustments. It is **not approved for pediatric use** or other off-label indications.

### Modafinil (Provigil) [^112Yy99S]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Serious Rash, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome

Serious rash requiring hospitalization and discontinuation of treatment has been reported in association with the use of modafinil.

In clinical trials of modafinil, the incidence of rash resulting in discontinuation was approximately 0.8% (13 per 1,585) in pediatric patients (age < 17 years); these rashes included 1 case of possible Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and 1 case of apparent multi-organ hypersensitivity reaction. Several of the cases were associated with fever and other abnormalities (e.g., vomiting, leukopenia). The median time to rash that resulted in discontinuation was 13 days. No such cases were observed among 380 pediatric patients who received placebo. PROVIGIL is not approved for use in pediatric patients for any indication [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Rare cases of serious or life-threatening rash, including SJS, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), and Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in adults and children in worldwide postmarketing experience. The reporting rate of TEN and SJS associated with modafinil use, which is generally accepted to be an underestimate due to underreporting, exceeds the background incidence rate. Estimates of the background incidence rate for these serious skin reactions in the general population range between 1 to 2 cases per million-person years.

There are no factors that are known to predict the risk of occurrence or the severity of rash associated with PROVIGIL. Nearly all cases of serious rash associated with modafinil occurred within 1 to 5 weeks after treatment initiation. However, isolated cases have been reported after prolonged treatment (e.g., 3 months). Accordingly, duration of therapy cannot be relied upon as a means to predict the potential risk heralded by the first appearance of a rash.

Although benign rashes also occur with PROVIGIL, it is not possible to reliably predict which rashes will prove to be serious. Accordingly, PROVIGIL should be discontinued at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. Discontinuation of treatment may not prevent a rash from becoming life-threatening or permanently disabling or disfiguring.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE PROVIGIL is indicated to improve wakefulness in adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, or shift work disorder. Limitations of Use In OSA, PROVIGIL is indicated to treat excessive sleepiness and not as treatment for the underlying obstruction. If continuous positive airway pressure is the treatment of choice for a patient, a maximal effort to treat with CPAP for an adequate period of time should be made prior to initiating and during treatment with PROVIGIL for excessive sleepiness. 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.
2. 1 Dosage in Narcolepsy and Obstructive Sleep Apnea The recommended dosage of PROVIGIL for patients with narcolepsy or OSA is 200 mg taken orally once a day as a single dose in the morning.

Doses up to 400 mg/day, given as a single dose, have been well tolerated, but there is no consistent evidence that this dose confers additional benefit beyond that of the 200 mg/day dose.
2. 2 Dosage in Shift Work Disorder The recommended dosage of PROVIGIL for patients with SWD is 200 mg taken orally once a day as a single dose approximately 1 hour prior to the start of their work shift.
2. 3 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the dosage of PROVIGIL should be reduced to one-half of that recommended for patients with normal hepatic function. Patients should be advised to discontinue therapy and immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema or anaphylaxis (e.g.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^114WpfWP]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Stimulant use disorder (StUD) with psychosis or mania — The CGC recommended that symptoms of psychosis related to or co-occurring with StUD be treated with indicated pharmacotherapy, and these studies generally noted a large beneficial effect of pharmacotherapy for both preexisting and stimulant-induced psychosis, as well as preexisting and stimulant-induced mania. Undesirable side effects would be similar to those experienced from the use of these medications in any context, and the CGC noted that clinicians should be aware of differences in side effect profiles, particularly between typical and atypical antipsychotic medications. Clinicians should generally avoid use of modafinil or psychostimulant medications to treat StUD in patients with histories of psychoses, whether substance-induced or preexisting, and similarly, clinicians should generally avoid use of psychostimulant medications to treat StUD in patients with histories of stimulant-induced mood disorders.

### Modafinil for fatigue in MS: a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study [^111tc1VV]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether modafinil, a wakefulness-promoting agent, is useful for fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Methods

Patients with MS with stable disability, and a baseline score of 45 or more on the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), were eligible for the 5-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. The initial daily dose of modafinil was 200 mg for 1 week. Depending on tolerance, the dose was increased by 100 mg every week up to 400 mg/day and remained unchanged between day 21 and day 35. The primary outcome variable was the change of MFIS score at day 35.

Results

A total of 115 patients with MS were enrolled in the study and in the intention to treat analysis. The mean MFIS score at baseline was 63 ± 9 in the placebo group and 63 ± 10 in the modafinil group. MFIS scores improved between day 0 and day 35 in both placebo-treated and modafinil-treated groups, but no significant difference was detected between the two groups. There was no major safety concern.

Conclusions

There was no improvement of fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis treated with modafinil vs placebo according to the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale.

### Adjunctive use of modafinil in bipolar patients: just another stimulant or not? [^116nahwd]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Depression is much more common in the life course of people with bipolar disorder than mania or mixed states. Unfortunately, few established treatments are available, and new ones are needed. Modafinil is a novel stimulant approved for treating improving wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift-work sleep disorder. Given that bipolar depression is commonly associated with fatigue and somnolence, modafinil is a logical choice. In one recent study of moderate size (n = 85), modafinil was shown to be more effective than placebo in treating bipolar depression. The incidence of cycle induction in this trial was very low (lower than placebo), although isolated case reports of mania, hypomania, or mixed states have been reported. Given the limited options for bipolar depression, modafinil should be considered in patients who have not responded to approved treatments, although more research is needed.

### Treatment of central disorders of hypersomnolence: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112DW7BW]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Narcolepsy in adults — armodafinil (Recommendation 5) is advised conditionally: We suggest that clinicians use armodafinil (vs no treatment) for the treatment of narcolepsy in adults. (CONDITIONAL). Remark notes it is an FDA Schedule IV federally controlled substance because of its potential for abuse or dependence; based on animal data, armodafinil may cause fetal harm and human data are insufficient to determine risk; a 2018 annual report of the ongoing armodafinil/modafinil pregnancy registry in the United States showed a higher rate of major congenital anomalies and other adverse reactions in children exposed in utero; and armodafinil may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraception. The TF identified 1 randomized controlled trial and 1 open-label study in narcolepsy type 1 and narcolepsy type 2 demonstrating clinically significant improvements in excessive daytime sleepiness and disease severity; the overall quality of evidence was moderate and downgraded due to imprecision.

### Modafinil (Provigil) [^113GWQeD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

If you have a severe rash with PROVIGIL, stopping the medicine may not keep the rash from becoming life-threatening or causing you to be permanently disabled or disfigured.

PROVIGIL is not approved for use in children for any medical condition.

It is not known if PROVIGIL is safe or effective in children under 17 years of age.

What is PROVIGIL?

PROVIGIL is a prescription medicine used to improve wakefulness in adults who are very sleepy due to one of the following diagnosed sleep disorders:

narcolepsy
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). PROVIGIL is used to treat excessive sleepiness, but not the obstruction or medical condition that is causing OSA. You should talk with your doctor about treatments for OSA before you start taking PROVIGIL and during treatment with PROVIGIL. PROVIGIL does not take the place of treatments that your doctor has prescribed for OSA. It is important that you continue to use these treatments as prescribed by your doctor.
shift work disorder (SWD)

PROVIGIL will not cure these sleep disorders. PROVIGIL may help the sleepiness caused by these conditions, but it may not stop all your sleepiness. PROVIGIL does not take the place of getting enough sleep. Follow your doctor's advice about good sleep habits and using other treatments.

### Stimulating meditation: a pre-registered randomised controlled experiment combining a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, with brief mindfulness training [^1136UmR8]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Mindfulness meditation is increasingly used as a component of psychological treatments for a variety of mental and physical health problems. Clinical trials of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have demonstrated the strongest evidence for preventing depressive relapse, although MBIs also show promise for other indications. However, in addition to clinical trials that have examined this typical, extended format of mindfulness training, single-session experimental studies of very brief training (single session 'mindfulness induction': typically ≤ 20 min) have been conducted in healthy volunteers. Although some such studies demonstrated immediate benefits of brief mindfulness training exercises (e.g. on negative affect:), such studies are typically mechanistic, rather than aiming to establish clinical efficacy. For example, studies of mindfulness inductions have examined the neurophysiological basis of mindful mental states and the association between such states (or their accompanying neurophysiological changes), and adaptive changes in affect, cognition and behaviour; others have sought to identify active components of more comprehensive treatments by examining isolated mindfulness techniques. Given the brevity of these experimental mindfulness trainings/inductions, it is perhaps unsurprising that the observed effects are typically small (d ≈ 0.2) and short-lived. Despite this, such experimental studies are potentially highly informative in terms of identifying characteristics of participants who might show early treatment gains during a comprehensive/extended MBI, or in terms of developing novel, brief MBIs.

The nature of typical MBIs, both in terms of their short-term demands (prolonged within-session practice), and their relatively extended duration (typically spanning c. eight weeks), may not be optimal for some patient groups, and abbreviated treatments might be more accessible to a wider range of patients. However, other obstacles can prevent initial engagement with MBIs. Indeed, the specific focus of MBIs on self-regulation of attention represents a potential barrier in patients for whom attentional and motivational difficulties are an inherent symptom of their disorder. One approach to overcoming such obstacles may be to employ biological strategies (e.g. non-invasive brain stimulation or cognitive enhancing drugs) to support the basic attentional capacities required during MBIs. Laboratory-based studies of brief mindfulness trainings are ideally placed to preliminarily test such MBI-adjunctive treatments.

### A practical guide to the therapy of narcolepsy and hypersomnia syndromes [^112N19EV]. Neurotherapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Modafinil

Modafinil was developed and first used for the treatment of narcolepsy in France in the 1980s. It has been studied in double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion in a large number of narcoleptic patients and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for narcolepsy, shift work disorder, and residual sleepiness in treated sleep apnea. It was recognized as an active metabolite of adrafinil, a compound developed as a cognitive enhancer for the elderly. The compound is highly insoluble in water and has a low potency, meaning that active doses are in the range of hundreds of milligrams vs tens of milligrams for doses of amphetamine or methylphenidate that are needed to produce similar wake-promoting effects (equipotency). As a chemical entity, it is poorly and slowly absorbed due to the insolubility in water. Formulation is key, and when formulated as Provigil (racemic mixture of D- and L-modafinil), it is compounded into small beads that increase absorption and consistency of effects.

Because it was rapidly shown that modafinil is pharmacologically distinct from amphetamine (but less so from methylphenidate) in some animal tests, and that abuse potential for the compound was low, the mode of action of modafinil was touted as totally different from other stimulants, and did not involve dopamine. Indeed, after more than 20 years of experience with the compound, abuse with dependence remains rare, although there is no doubt that the compound is misused to increase performance rather than to treat disease in some cases. In the late 1980s, studies at Stanford showed that the compound had very similar properties to very selective DAT reuptake inhibitors in a canine model of narcolepsy. In particular, as for other DAT compounds, it was shown to reduce wakefulness without affecting REM sleep or reducing cataplexy, a symptom that in canine narcolepsy is mostly sensitive to adrenergic reuptake inhibition.

### Pitolisant versus placebo or modafinil in patients with narcolepsy: a double-blind, randomised trial [^111axAMB]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Narcolepsy is characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy. Histamine neurons are crucial to maintain wakefulness. We assessed the safety and efficacy of pitolisant (previously called BF2.649), a selective histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist that activates these neurons, in patients with narcolepsy.

Methods

For this double-blind, randomised, parallel-group controlled trial, we recruited patients with narcolepsy from 32 sleep disorder centres in five European countries. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had not taken psychostimulants for at least 14 days, and had EDS (defined as an Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score of at least 14). Using a computer-generated randomisation sequence, we randomly allocated patients to receive pitolisant, modafinil, or placebo (1:1:1). Treatment lasted 8 weeks: 3 weeks of flexible dosing according to investigator's judgment (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg a day of pitolisant; 100 mg, 200 mg or 400 mg a day of modafinil) followed by 5 weeks of stable dosing. Patients took four tablets a day in a double-dummy design to ensure masking. For the primary analysis, assessed in the intention-to-treat population, we assessed the superiority of pitolisant versus placebo, and the non-inferiority of pitolisant versus modafinil. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01067222.

Findings

Between May 26, 2009, and June 30, 2010, we screened 110 patients, 95 of whom were eligible and randomly assigned to treatment: 30 to placebo, 32 to pitolisant, and 33 to modafinil. Over the 8-week treatment period, mean ESS score reductions were -3.4 (SD 4.2) in the placebo group, -5.8 (6.2) in the pitolisant group, and -6.9 (6.2) in the modafinil group. Our primary analysis of between-group differences in mean ESS score at endpoint (adjusted for baseline) showed pitolisant to be superior to placebo (difference -3.0, 95% CI -5.6 to -0.4; p = 0.024), but not non-inferior to modafinil (difference 0.12, 95% CI -2.5 to 2.7; p = 0.250). We recorded 22 adverse events with pitolisant, 26 with modafinil, and ten with placebo. Six severe adverse events were treatment-related: one with pitolisant (abdominal discomfort) and five with modafinil (abdominal pain, abnormal behaviour, amphetamine-like withdrawal symptoms, lymphoadenopathy, and inner ear disorders).

Interpretation

Pitolisant at doses up to 40 mg was efficacious on EDS compared with placebo and well tolerated compared with modafinil. If these findings are substantiated in further studies, pitolisant could offer a new treatment option for patients with narcolepsy.

### A retrospective review of supratherapeutic modafinil exposures [^112MBSXF]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Modafinil (2-[(Diphenylmethyl) sulfinyl] acetamide) is a unique non-amphetamine wakefulness-promoting agent that was first marketed in France in the early 1990s for the treatment of excessive somnolence in patients with narcolepsy. It was subsequently approved in the USA in 1998 under the brand name Provigil® and is used for the treatment of various sleep disorders characterized by excessive sleepiness, including narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift work sleep disorder. It has steadily gained popularity among prescribers due to its wakefulness-promoting efficacy, presumed lower potential for abuse, and lack of peripheral sympathomimetic effects commonly observed with amphetamine stimulants. As a result, it has been studied and used off-label to treat sedation and fatigue in neurological and medical conditions including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, HIV infection, cancer, and fibromyalgia. It has also shown promise in the treatment of cocaine dependence and withdrawal, alcoholic organic brain disorder, and in augmentation of antidepressant regimens.

Modafinil appears to have a complex mechanism of action that is not completely understood. It is known to cause an increase in extracellular concentrations of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, glutamate, and histamine and to cause a decrease in extracellular gamma-aminobutyric acid in the neocortex. It has been shown to bind to and inhibit the dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter at clinically relevant doses, which may be responsible in part for its therapeutic effects. Unlike amphetamines, modafinil has no effect on spontaneous dopamine release or turnover and lacks peripheral sympathomimetic effects.

Little information on supratherapeutic dosing of modafinil exists in the current medical literature. Two small case series have been published in abstract form, and a recent review of data from 11 states was published by Spiller et al. During clinical trials, intentional acute overdoses as high as 4,500 mg were reported, with insomnia, tachycardia, agitation, and anxiety being the only side effects reported; no life-threatening toxicity occurred, and to date, no fatal overdoses have occurred involving modafinil alone.

We performed a retrospective chart review of modafinil exposures reported to the California Poison Control System over an 11-year period. Our aim in this study was to characterize the clinical effects and toxicity associated with overdose of modafinil in the hope of improving treatment guidelines and recommendations for patients with modafinil ingestion.

14.1 Narcolepsy

The effectiveness of modafinil tablets in improving wakefulness in adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy was established in two US 9-week, multi-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind studies of outpatients who met the criteria for narcolepsy. A total of 558 patients were randomized to receive modafinil tablets 200 or 400 mg/day, or placebo. The criteria for narcolepsy include either: 1) recurrent daytime naps or lapses into sleep that occur almost daily for at least three months, plus sudden bilateral loss of postural muscle tone in association with intense emotion (cataplexy); or 2) a complaint of excessive sleepiness or sudden muscle weakness with associated features: sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, automatic behaviors, disrupted major sleep episode; and polysomnography demonstrating one of the following: sleep latency less than 10 minutes or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency less than 20 minutes. For entry into these studies, all patients were required to have objectively documented excessive daytime sleepiness, via a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) with two or more sleep onset REM periods and the absence of any other clinically significant active medical or psychiatric disorder. The MSLT, an objective polysomnographic assessment of the patient's ability to fall asleep in an unstimulating environment, measured latency (in minutes) to sleep onset averaged over 4 test sessions at 2-hour intervals. For each test session, the subject was told to lie quietly and attempt to sleep. Each test session was terminated after 20 minutes if no sleep occurred or 15 minutes after sleep onset.

Hypersomnia secondary to traumatic brain injury in adults — modafinil: We suggest that clinicians use modafinil (vs no treatment) for the treatment of hypersomnia secondary to traumatic brain injury in adults. (CONDITIONAL) The task force assessed effectiveness based on excessive daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and work/school performance/attendance, and One RCT was identified that demonstrated a clinically significant improvement in excessive daytime sleepiness. The task force concluded the overall quality of data on modafinil for patients with TBI was moderate and the level of evidence was downgraded for imprecision; across studies, commonly reported adverse events included insomnia, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and dry mouth. Remarks note this medication is an FDA Schedule IV federally controlled substance because of potential for abuse or dependency, human data are insufficient to determine fetal risk, a report showed a higher rate of major congenital anomalies and other adverse reactions in children exposed in utero, and modafinil may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraception; the balance of desirable and undesirable effects was in favor of modafinil, risks and harms may differ for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and the majority of patients would most likely use modafinil compared to no treatment for their hypersomnia.

### Clinical guideline for the evaluation, management and long-term care of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^111HT8Xh]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) adjunctive therapies — pharmacologic and oxygen guidance: Corticosteroids may improve the apnea–hypopnea index in OSA with concurrent rhinitis and "may be a useful adjunct to primary treatment for OSA (Guideline)". Oxygen supplementation "is not recommended as a primary treatment for OSA (Option)". If used with other primary therapies to treat hypoxemia, "follow-up must include documentation of resolution of the hypoxemia (Consensus)", and oxygen alone "may also prolong apneas and may potentially worsen nocturnal hypercapnia in patients with comorbid respiratory disease". For residual excessive daytime sleepiness despite effective positive airway pressure (PAP), "Modafinil is recommended" when no other cause is identifiable, and "Modafinil should be used in addition to PAP therapy" after other causes "must be ruled out including: suboptimal objective adherence with PAP; ill-fitting PAP masks; insufficient sleep; poor sleep hygiene; other sleep disorders such as narcolepsy or restless legs syndrome/ periodic limb movements of sleep; and depression".

### A systematic review of modafinil: potential clinical uses and mechanisms of action [^114Bp3L3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Modafinil is a novel wake-promoting agent that has U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for narcolepsy and shift work sleep disorder and as adjunctive treatment of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. Modafinil has a novel mechanism and is theorized to work in a localized manner, utilizing hypocretin, histamine, epinephrine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and glutamate. It is a well-tolerated medication with low propensity for abuse and is frequently used for off-label indications. The objective of this study was to systematically review the available evidence supporting the clinical use of modafinil.

Data Sources

The search term modafinil OR Provigil was searched on PubMed. Selected articles were mined for further potential sources of data. Abstracts from major scientific conferences were reviewed. Lastly, the manufacturer of modafinil in the United States was asked to provide all publications, abstracts, and unpublished data regarding studies of modafinil.

Data Synthesis

There have been 33 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of modafinil. Additionally, numerous smaller studies have been performed, and case reports of modafinil's use abound in the literature.

Conclusions

Modafinil is a promising drug with a large potential for many uses in psychiatry and general medicine. Treating daytime sleepiness is complex, and determining the precise nature of the sleep disorder is vital. Modafinil may be an effective agent in many sleep conditions. To date, the strongest evidence among off-label uses exists for the use of modafinil in attention-deficit disorder, postanesthetic sedation, and cocaine dependence and withdrawal and as an adjunct to antidepressants for depression.

### Pharmacotherapy for excessive daytime sleepiness [^1126k9Na]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) has recognized detrimental consequences such as road traffic accidents, impaired psychological functioning and reduced work performance. EDS can result from multiple causes such as sleep deprivation, sleep fragmentation, neurological, psychiatric and circadian rhythm disorders. Treating the underlying cause of EDS remains the mainstay of therapy but in those who continue to be excessively sleepy, further treatment may be warranted. Traditionally, the amphetamine derivatives, methylphenidate and pemoline (collectively sympathomimetic) psychostimulants were the commonest form of therapy for EDS, particularly in conditions such as narcolepsy. More recently, the advent of modafinil has broadened the range of therapeutic options. Modafinil has a safer side-effect profile and as a result, interest in this drug for the management of EDS in other disorders, as well as narcolepsy, has increased considerably. There is a growing school of thought that modafinil may have a role to play in other indications such as obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome already treated by nasal continuous positive airway pressure but persisting EDS, shift work sleep disorders, neurological causes of sleepiness, and healthy adults performing sustained operations, particularly those in the military. However, until adequately powered randomised-controlled trials confirm long-term efficacy and safety, the recommendation of wakefulness promoters in healthy adults cannot be justified.

Wakefulness agents for cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in advanced cancer — evidence update: two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of modafinil screened for fatigue and included 291 total patients; modafinil at a once daily dose of 100–200 mg was not significantly effective at alleviating CRF compared to placebo, and one trial had an attrition rate of 23%. Studies in advanced cancer have shown limited effectiveness of wakefulness agents, namely modafinil and armodafinil, in improving CRF compared to placebo, and the lack of improvement at the tested dose and duration with unclear long-term adverse event risks limits their use.

### Management of fatigue in adult survivors of cancer: ASCO-Society for Integrative Oncology guideline update [^113idqWU]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Wakefulness agents (armodafinil, modafinil) for cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in adults with mixed cancer types: 150 mg of armodafinil once daily did not have a statistically significant effect on fatigue compared to placebo over 4–6 weeks. In a large trial of 877 patients starting cancer treatment, 200 mg modafinil once daily was not significantly more effective than placebo for fatigue (P = 0.08) in the 631 patients with evaluable data; however, when fatigue severity strata were analyzed, a statistically significant group difference (P = 0.033) for those in the severe fatigue category favored modafinil. For individuals with severe baseline CRF, modafinil may be useful; however, additional research is necessary to validate this finding.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^112Y2nsF]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-related residual excessive daytime sleepiness — For treatment of obstructive sleep apnea-related residual excessive daytime sleepiness in patients who are optimally treated with sufficient therapy use, we suggest adding armodafinil, modafinil, solriamfetol (Weak for | Reviewed, New-added). The evidence supporting the above recommendation derives from four systematic reviews (SRs). Moderate quality evidence suggests that both modafinil and armodafinil improve the critical outcomes of sleepiness and quality of life (QoL). Low-quality evidence found no significant difference in the critical outcome of serious adverse events between either modafinil or armodafinil and placebo. Moderate quality evidence suggests that solriamfetol improves sleepiness. High-quality evidence suggests that solriamfetol improves QoL. Moderate quality evidence found no significant difference in serious adverse events between solriamfetol and placebo. Although there was available data for pitolisant showing improvements in sleepiness and QoL, it was not included in the recommendation as it is not FDA-approved for the treatment of residual daytime sleepiness in patients with OSA. There is some variation in patient preference regarding this treatment. Given that the available wake-promoting agents are controlled substances, some patients may be hesitant to take them or may be concerned about side effects. Further, some of these medications are expensive and may not be available for all patients. For active-duty service members, use of any of these medications may lead to occupational restrictions, deployment limitations or referral to a Medical Evaluation Board.

### Comparative efficacy, safety and benefit / risk of alerting agents for excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea: a network meta-analysis [^111Gtd6c]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The study protocol was registered (PROSPERO: CRD42023434640) and data locked on 12 June 2024. The revised PRISMA 2020 guidelines for systematic reviews were followed.

Study selection

Selection criteria were defined as the set of all RCTs published up to 12 June 2024 in adults (aged 18 years or older), diagnosed with OSA by validated sleep tests (polygraphy or polysomnography), and treated for EDS with a pharmacological agent (modafinil/armodafinil, pitolisant, or solriamfetol).

We used the search strategy adapted from SIGN guidance which recommends search terms for systematic reviews and meta-analyses: (("Sleep apnoea, obstructive" [MeSH Terms] OR obstructive sleep apnoea) AND ("Sleep Apnoea Syndromes/Modafinil/Armodafinil " [Mesh]) AND ("Sleep Apnoea Syndromes/Pitolisant" [Mesh]) AND ("Sleep Apnoea Syndromes/Solriamfetol" [Mesh])).

Searches of PubMed, Embase, anddatabases were conducted, and manufacturers were also contacted for details of unpublished RCTs. All reference lists of selected studies and systematic reviews were checked to identify additional eligible studies. There was no restriction for language or the publication period for searching. The authors independently searched for potential studies and disagreement was solved by consensus.

Participants

All randomised patients constituting the Intention-To-Treat population (i.e. Full Analysis Set [FAS]), were analysed.

Interventions and comparators

All pharmacological treatments for EDS in OSA patients and approved in Europe and/or the United States were compared. Dosages analysed were: modafinil 200 mg and 400 mg, solriamfetol 150 mg, and pitolisant 20 mg. The 200 mg and 400 mg dosages of modafinil were considered to be equivalent to armodafinil 150 mg and 250 mg, respectively. Results for modafinil 100 mg were assimilated with those for modafinil 200 mg, as they were shown to be very similar. In a titration series, only the highest dose recommended for treatment was used. Placebo was the comparator in all selected RCTs. Solriamfetol 300 mg was not considered as it is not approved by regulatory agencies.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Modafinil tablets are indicated to improve wakefulness in adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or shift work disorder (SWD).

Limitations of Use

In OSA, modafinil tablets are indicated to treat excessive sleepiness and not as treatment for the underlying obstruction. If continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for a patient, a maximal effort to treat with CPAP for an adequate period of time should be made prior to initiating and during treatment with modafinil tablets for excessive sleepiness.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Modafinil tablets are not approved in this population for any indication.

Serious skin rashes, including erythema multiforme major (EMM) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) have been associated with modafinil use in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In a controlled 6-week study, 165 pediatric patients (aged 5 to 17 years) with narcolepsy were treated with modafinil (n = 123), or placebo (n = 42). There were no statistically significant differences favoring modafinil over placebo in prolonging sleep latency as measured by MSLT, or in perceptions of sleepiness as determined by the clinical global impression-clinician scale (CGI-C).

In the controlled and open-label clinical studies, treatment emergent adverse reactions of the psychiatric and nervous system included Tourette's syndrome, insomnia, hostility, increased cataplexy, increased hypnagogic hallucinations, and suicidal ideation. Transient leukopenia, which resolved without medical intervention, was also observed. In the controlled clinical study, 3 of 38 girls, ages 12 or older, treated with modafinil experienced dysmenorrhea compared to 0 of 10 girls who received placebo.

There were three 7 to 9 week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group studies in children and adolescents (aged 6 to 17 years) with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Two of the studies were flexible-dose studies (up to 425 mg/day), and the third was a fixed-dose study (340 mg/day for patients < 30 kg and 425 mg/day for patients ≥ 30 kg). Although these studies showed statistically significant differences favoring modafinil over placebo in reducing ADHD symptoms as measured by the ADHD-RS (school version), there were 3 cases of serious rash including one case of possible SJS among 933 patients exposed to modafinil in this program. Modafinil is not approved for use in treating ADHD.

Pediatric narcolepsy — Recommendation 21 (modafinil): We suggest that clinicians use modafinil (vs no treatment) for the treatment of narcolepsy in pediatric patients. (CONDITIONAL). Remark statements highlight that this medication is an FDA Schedule IV federally controlled substance because of its potential for abuse or dependency, that the drug is not FDA-approved for patients aged < 17 years based on a black box warning for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and psychosis based on case reports in pediatric patients, that based on animal data modafinil may cause fetal harm and human data are insufficient to determine risk, that a 2018 annual report of the ongoing armodafinil/modafinil pregnancy registry showed a higher rate of major congenital anomalies and other adverse reactions in children exposed in utero, and that modafinil may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraception. The TF assessed whether modafinil was effective for pediatric narcolepsy based on improvements in excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (when present), disease severity, quality of life, accident risk, and work/school performance/attendance, identified 1 observational study demonstrating clinically significant improvement in excessive daytime sleepiness, and rated the overall quality of evidence as very low with downgrading due to imprecision; adverse events included irritability, dry mouth, nausea, and headaches, with no severe reactions including SJS and psychosis reported. Based on their clinical expertise, the TF determined that the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects is likely in favor of modafinil for pediatric patients with narcolepsy.

Duloxetine (Cymbalta ®) is a noradrenaline+5-HT reuptake inhibitor antidepressant with a more balanced effect on noradrenaline and 5-HT reuptake than sibutramine, which is more potent on noradrenaline. Duloxetine increases synaptic dopamine and noradrenaline concentrations in rat FC, but the effect is small, and duloxetine is minimally effective in treating ADHD. In clinical trials, dasotraline produced a small weight loss, but it was ineffective in BED (Table 1).

Armodafinil (Nuvigil ®) is the active, R(-)-enantiomer of modafinil (Provigil ®). Armodafinil is approved to treat narcolepsy and other conditions involving excessive sleepiness. Although the parent racemate, modafinil, is stimulant, its pharmacology is enigmatic, and to date, no definitive mode of action has been demonstrated. Modafinil is a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor. However, with extremely low potency, that is Ki/IC 50 values in the micromolar range, it is debatable whether this mechanism is clinically irrelevant. Modafinil produces small increases in synaptic dopamine and noradrenaline concentrations in FC, which is surprising because it has no NET blocking effect. Because of its micromolar DAT affinity, modafinil produces very small increases of extracellular dopamine in the striatum. Consistent with its ability to increase noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in the FC, modafinil is effective in ADHD, but its efficacy is slower in onset and lower than the stimulants. The poor quality of the results from a single, small trial where armodafinil was administered to obese subjects with BED precludes a realistic assessment of its potential efficacy (Table 1).

### Modafinil augmentation for residual symptoms of fatigue in patients with a partial response to antidepressants [^115E7DSN]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the literature discussing the use of modafinil in the treatment of residual symptoms of fatigue in patients with depression.

Data Sources

PubMed (1966-March 2007) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-March 2007) were searched using the key words modafinil and depression. A manual search of the reference section of the articles retrieved was conducted to identify articles not indexed in either of these sources.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles published in English were evaluated. Studies were included if modafinil was used to treat patients with residual fatigue from depression and the effects were measured with validated fatigue subscales.

Data Synthesis

One retrospective study, 5 open-label trials, and 2 randomized controlled clinical trials met the inclusion criteria for assessment of residual symptoms of fatigue as assessed by commonly used fatigue subscales after modafinil administration. Although improvement with fatigue has occurred with modafinil therapy, literature regarding the topic is limited by the lack of well-controlled clinical trials. Modafinil does appear to improve residual fatigue with depression as evidenced by open-label trials; however, the efficacy of this agent has not been duplicated in randomized controlled trials. The open-label trials that have been conducted often had no comparator and a small number of patients. In addition, outcome measures used in the studies were not consistent between trials. Modafinil appears to be well tolerated, with the main adverse effects being headache and nausea.

Conclusions

Open-label trials indicate that modafinil may be effective in ameliorating fatigue associated with depression; however, this effect has not been reproduced in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Therefore, the use of modafinil for the treatment of residual fatigue is not recommended due to the lack of reproducible data of its efficacy. Long-term, adequately powered clinical trials should be conducted to determine its place in therapy.

Introduction

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the treatment of central disorders of hypersomnolence in adults and children.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine to develop recommendations and assign strengths to each recommendation, based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using the GRADE process. The task force provided a summary of the relevant literature and the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that support the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended to guide clinicians in choosing a specific treatment for central disorders of hypersomnolence in adults and children. Each recommendation statement is assigned a strength ("strong" or "conditional"). A "strong" recommendation (ie, "We recommend… ") is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A "conditional" recommendation (ie, "We suggest… ") is one that requires that the clinician use clinical knowledge and experience and strongly consider the individual patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action. Under each disorder, strong recommendations are listed in alphabetical order followed by the conditional recommendations in alphabetical order. The section on adult patients with hypersomnia because of medical conditions is categorized based on the clinical and pathological subtypes identified in ICSD-3. The interventions in all the recommendation statements were compared to no treatment.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended dosage of PROVIGIL for each indication is as follows:

Narcolepsy or OSA: 200 mg once a day in the morning. (2.1)
SWD: 200 mg once a day, taken approximately one hour prior to start of the work shift. (2.2)
Severe Hepatic Impairment: reduce dose to half the recommended dose. (2.3, 12.3)
Geriatric Patients: consider lower dose. (2.4, 12.3)

2.1 Dosage in Narcolepsy and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)

The recommended dosage of PROVIGIL for patients with narcolepsy or OSA is 200 mg taken orally once a day as a single dose in the morning.

Doses up to 400 mg/day, given as a single dose, have been well tolerated, but there is no consistent evidence that this dose confers additional benefit beyond that of the 200 mg/day dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)].

2.2 Dosage in Shift Work Disorder (SWD)

The recommended dosage of PROVIGIL for patients with SWD is 200 mg taken orally once a day as a single dose approximately 1 hour prior to the start of their work shift.

2.3 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment

In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the dosage of PROVIGIL should be reduced to one-half of that recommended for patients with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.4 Use in Geriatric Patients

Consideration should be given to the use of lower doses and close monitoring in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

### Modafinil (Provigil) [^113zHJmz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients treated with PROVIGIL showed a statistically significant improvement in the ability to remain awake compared to placebo-treated patients as measured by the MWT at final visit (Table 2). A statistically significant greater number of patients treated with PROVIGIL showed improvement in overall clinical condition as rated by the CGI-C scale at final visit (Table 3). The 200 mg and 400 mg doses of PROVIGIL produced statistically significant effects of similar magnitude on the MWT, and also on the CGI-C.

In the second study, a 4-week trial, 157 patients with OSA were randomized to receive PROVIGIL 400 mg/day or placebo. Documentation of regular CPAP use (at least 4 hours/night on 70% of nights) was required for all patients. The primary measure of effectiveness was the change from baseline on the ESS at final visit. The baseline ESS scores for the PROVIGIL and placebo groups were 14.2 and 14.4, respectively. At week 4, the ESS was reduced by 4.6 in the PROVIGIL group and by 2.0 in the placebo group, a difference that was statistically significant.

Nighttime sleep measured with polysomnography was not affected by the use of PROVIGIL.

### Efficacy of psychostimulant drugs for amphetamine abuse or dependence [^1112Q3tn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Amphetamine dependence is a public health problem with medical, psychiatric, cognitive, legal and socioeconomic consequences. To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved for this disorder, and psychotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. In recent years, psychostimulants have been investigated as a possible replacement therapy.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of psychostimulant medications for amphetamine abuse or dependence. The influences of type of drug, type of dependence, comorbid disorders, clinical trial risk of bias and publication of data were also studied.

Search Methods

Relevant trials were searched in the following sources: PubMed (January 1966 to 6 June 2012), EMBASE (January 1988 to 6 June 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 5 of 12, May 2012), PsycINFO (January 1985 to 6 June 2012) and the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group (June 2012). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved trials, the list of studies citing the included trials and the main electronic registers of ongoing trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and EU Clinical Trials Register). Finally, we contacted investigators to request information about unpublished trials. Searches included non-English language literature.

Selection Criteria

All randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials investigating the efficacy or safety of psychostimulants for amphetamine dependence or abuse conducted in an outpatient setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Eleven studies were included in the review (791 participants). Studied psychostimulants included dexamphetamine, bupropion, methylphenidate and modafinil. No significant differences were found between psychostimulants and placebo for any of the studied efficacy outcomes. Overall retention in studies was low (50.4%). Psychostimulants did not reduce amphetamine use (mean difference (MD) -0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.85 to 0.33) or amphetamine craving (MD 0.07, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.59) and did not increase sustained abstinence (relative risk (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.49). The proportion of adverse events inducing dropout was similar for psychostimulants and placebo (risk difference (RD) 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.04). The main findings did not change in any subgroup analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

Results of this review do not support the use of psychostimulant medications at the tested doses as a replacement therapy for amphetamine abuse or dependence. Future research could change this conclusion, as the numbers of included studies and participants are limited and information on relevant outcomes, such as efficacy according to the severity of dependence or craving, is still missing.

### A method for deciding about the possible safety of modafinil and armodafinil in patients with seizure disorder [^115Y7qFC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Modafinil or armodafinil (ar/mod) may be considered for patients with approved or unapproved indications, including excessive daytime drowsiness, fatigue, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or addictions. Ar/mod is classified as a psychostimulant, and psychostimulants have been associated with a small risk of seizures. There is no guidance about the use of ar/mod in patients who are at risk of seizures. This article suggests how a physician may explore the safety of ar/mod if indicated in a patient at such risk. In summary, reading the prescribing information, writing to the drug manufacturer, and searching research databases suggest the following: Ar/mod and its metabolites and derivatives have dose-dependent anticonvulsant action in animal models; ar/mod is not associated with seizures as an adverse event in populations at risk, such as those with ADHD, head injury, and brain tumors; it is not associated with worsening of seizure disorder in patients with current seizure disorder; and it is not associated with seizures in overdose. These findings are reassuring. However, not all the data are of high quality, and potential ar/mod interactions with antiepileptic drugs (and other concurrent medications that affect the seizure threshold) need to be considered because ar/mod can induce the metabolism of some drugs and inhibit the metabolism of others. Decisions should be individualized, and decision-making should be a shared effort between patient and physician.

14.3 Shift Work Disorder (SWD)

The effectiveness of PROVIGIL in improving wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with SWD was demonstrated in a 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of 209 patients with chronic SWD were randomized to receive PROVIGIL 200 mg/day or placebo. All patients met the criteria for chronic SWD. The criteria include: 1) either, a) a primary complaint of excessive sleepiness or insomnia which is temporally associated with a work period (usually night work) that occurs during the habitual sleep phase, or b) polysomnography and the MSLT demonstrate loss of a normal sleep-wake pattern (i.e., disturbed chronobiological rhythmicity); and 2) no other medical or mental disorder accounts for the symptoms, and 3) the symptoms do not meet criteria for any other sleep disorder producing insomnia or excessive sleepiness (e.g., time zone change [jet lag] syndrome).

It should be noted that not all patients with a complaint of sleepiness who are also engaged in shift work meet the criteria for the diagnosis of SWD. In the clinical trial, only patients who were symptomatic for at least 3 months were enrolled.

Enrolled patients were also required to work a minimum of 5 night shifts per month, have excessive sleepiness at the time of their night shifts (MSLT score < 6 minutes), and have daytime insomnia documented by a daytime polysomnogram.

The primary measures of effectiveness were 1) sleep latency, as assessed by the MSLT performed during a simulated night shift at the final visit and 2) the change in the patient's overall disease status, as measured by the CGI-C at the final visit [see Clinical Studies (14.1) for a description of these measures.].

Patients treated with PROVIGIL showed a statistically significant prolongation in the time to sleep onset compared to placebo-treated patients, as measured by the nighttime MSLT at final visit (Table 2). A statistically significant greater number of patients treated with PROVIGIL showed improvement in overall clinical condition as rated by the CGI-C scale at final visit (Table 3).

Daytime sleep measured with polysomnography was not affected by the use of PROVIGIL.

### Efficacy and safety of modafinil (provigil) for the treatment of fatigue in multiple sclerosis: a two centre phase 2 study [^112agQZe]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of modafinil for the treatment of fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS).

Methods

Patients aged 18–65 years with a diagnosis of MS, a stable disability level ≤ 6 on the Kurtzke extended disability status scale (EDSS), and a mean score > 4 on the fatigue severity scale (FSS) were eligible for the 9 week, single blind, phase 2, two centre study. Exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of narcolepsy, sleep apnoea, or clinically significant major systemic disease and recent use of medications affecting fatigue. All patients, who remained blinded for the treatment regimen, received placebo during weeks 1–2, 200 mg/day modafinil during weeks 3–4, 400 mg/day modafinil during weeks 5–6, and placebo during weeks 7–9. Safety was evaluated by unblinded investigators. Efficacy was evaluated by self rating scales, using the FSS, the modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS), a visual analogue scale for fatigue (VAS-F), and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). Adverse events were recorded.

Results

Seventy two patients (MS type: 74% relapsing-remitting; 7% primary progressive; 19% secondary progressive) received treatment. After treatment with 200 mg/day modafinil for 2 weeks, a significant improvement in fatigue versus placebo run in was demonstrated. Mean scores after treatment with 200 mg/day modafinil were: FSS, 4.7 versus 5.5 for placebo (p < 0.001); MFIS, 37.7 versus 44.7 (p < 0.001); and VAS-F, 5.4 versus 4.5 (p = 0.003). Fatigue scores for 400 mg/day modafinil were not significantly improved versus placebo run in. Mean ESS scores were significantly improved (p < 0.001) with 200 mg/day modafinil (7.2) and 400 mg/day (7.0) versus the score at baseline (9.5). Serious adverse events were not found at either dose. The most common adverse events were headache, nausea, and aesthenia. Sixty five patients (90%) completed the study.

Conclusions

These data suggest that 200 mg/day modafinil significantly improves fatigue and is well tolerated in patients with MS.

### Unsuccessful suicide attempt of a 15 year old adolescent with ingestion of 5000 mg modafinil [^1146E3cm]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Modafinil (Provigil) is a wake-promoting drug approved for patients with narcolepsy or other causes of excessive daytime sleepiness. Each pill is 100 to 200 mg; maximal daily dose of modafinil in adults is 400 mg (the medication is not approved by the FDA for children younger than 16 years of age). We report the case of an adolescent who attempted to commit suicide by ingesting 50 pills of modafinil. The medication was prescribed for her mother to treat symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis. Approximately 2 hours following ingestion the patient complained of headache, nausea and abdominal pain. Her ECG demonstrated prolonged QTc interval. Observation for 72 hours revealed 24 hours of inability to sleep, tachycardia, and dyskinesia. There was no deterioration of kidney or liver functions, and no change in complete blood count or blood pressure.

### Modafinil (Provigil) [^112LkqLR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In both studies, the primary measures of effectiveness were: 1) sleep latency, as assessed by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT); and 2) the change in the patient's overall disease status, as measured by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C). For a successful trial, both measures had to show statistically significant improvement.

The MWT measures latency (in minutes) to sleep onset averaged over 4 test sessions at 2 hour intervals following nocturnal polysomnography. For each test session, the subject was asked to attempt to remain awake without using extraordinary measures. Each test session was terminated after 20 minutes if no sleep occurred or 10 minutes after sleep onset. The CGI-C is a 7-point scale, centered at No Change, and ranging from Very Much Worse to Very Much Improved. Patients were rated by evaluators who had no access to any data about the patients other than a measure of their baseline severity. Evaluators were not given any specific guidance about the criteria they were to apply when rating patients.

Both studies demonstrated improvement in objective and subjective measures of excessive daytime sleepiness for both the 200 mg and 400 mg doses compared to placebo. Patients treated with PROVIGIL showed a statistically significantly enhanced ability to remain awake on the MWT at each dose compared to placebo at final visit (Table 2). A statistically significantly greater number of patients treated with PROVIGIL at each dose showed improvement in overall clinical condition as rated by the CGI-C scale at final visit (Table 3).

Nighttime sleep measured with polysomnography was not affected by the use of PROVIGIL.

### A practical guide to the therapy of narcolepsy and hypersomnia syndromes [^116LE5Jr]. Neurotherapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Modafinil is one of the few treatments that has been subjected to rigorous, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in narcolepsy and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Modafinil has also been approved for treating sleepiness in the context of shift work sleep disorder and residual sleepiness in pressure airway therapy (PAP) or otherwise treated sleep apnea. Because of the relatively low risk of addiction, modafinil can be more easily prescribed in patients without a clear, biochemically defined central hypersomnia syndrome, and is also easier to stop, if needed. It is also a schedule IV compound.

A typical treatment with modafinil (racemic mixture) in a typical adult hypersomnia/narcolepsy patient may start with 100 mg in the morning, and generally a second 100 mg dose will be added at noon. Then, the total dose may be increased to as much as 400 mg/day. For R-modafinil, as the potency is approximately twice, the initial dose may be 50 mg or 150 mg in the morning to increase to as much as 250 mg in the morning (equivalent to ~500 mg of the racemic mixture). Experience suggests that modafinil is effective for at least half of the patients, whereas in others it is simply too weak a stimulant. Slightly higher doses can be helpful in some patients, but are typically not covered by insurance. In such cases, we either would switch to other stimulants (methylphenidate) or use sodium oxybate and other treatment strategies. Of note, occassionally, it is helpful to add a dose of short-acting stimulant, such as methylphenidate (not slow-release) in addition to modafinil at times when alertness is particularly challenging (early afternoon), or as needed in case of an emergency (driving, etc.).

### Modafinil for the treatment of multiple sclerosis-related fatigue [^116k4Ngr]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of off-label use of modafinil in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS)-related fatigue.

Data Sources

Literature was accessed via MEDLINE (1966-January 2010) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1960–2010), using the medical subject heading terms modafinil, multiple sclerosis, and fatigue.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language, peer reviewed publications were analyzed for relevance. Studies appropriate to the objective were evaluated, including 3 open-label trials, 1 single-blind trial, and 2 randomized placebo-controlled trials.

Data Synthesis

Fatigue symptoms, assessed by a variety of self-reported symptom scales, improved in each of the uncontrolled studies reviewed when participants with MS received modafinil 200 mg or less daily for up to 12 weeks. These benefits were not maintained, however, in one uncontrolled study when modafinil was increased to 400 mg daily. Of the 2 randomized, controlled trials, 1 study found that modafinil 200 mg once daily resulted in a reduction in fatigue symptoms measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale at 8 weeks. The other study found no difference in the reduction of fatigue symptoms, measured by the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale at 5 weeks, between the placebo group and patients who received modafinil 100–200 mg twice daily. The most common adverse reactions associated with modafinil use in all studies included gastrointestinal and central nervous system effects.

Conclusions

Based on the available data, use of modafinil for the treatment of MS-related fatigue has demonstrated benefit in all uncontrolled studies but has conflicting results from 2 controlled studies. Modafinil is a reasonable therapeutic option in this patient population, although larger, long-term, randomized controlled studies are necessary to further elucidate the appropriate dose of modafinil, its effects on MS-related fatigue, and adverse effects associated with its use.

### Comparative efficacy, safety and benefit / risk of alerting agents for excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea: a network meta-analysis [^113gYaKE]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common chronic respiratory disease associated with a high burden of disabilities related to sleepiness and reduced quality of life. Despite first-line treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, many patients experience residual excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). The aim of this study is to compare the relative efficacy and safety of medications authorised for this indication in Europe and/or the United States (modafinil/armodafinil, solriamfetol, and pitolisant) for OSA.

Methods

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the efficacy and safety of authorised medications for adult patients with OSA were identified by literature searches of PubMed, Embase anddatabases (up to 12 June 2024). The primary efficacy endpoint was combined Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Oxford Sleep Resistance (OSLER)/Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) Z-scores. Quality of life (QoL), overall and specific cardiovascular safety, and benefit-risk ratios were calculated. The study was registered with PROSPERO: CRD42023434640.

Findings

Of 4017 studies identified, a total of 20 RCTs involving 4015 patients were included. Analysis of combined subjective (ESS) and objective (OSLER/MWT) efficacy outcome Z-scores showed that solriamfetol (150 mg; effect size [ES] = 0.66 [95% CI: 0.36, 0.96]), pitolisant (20 mg; ES = 0.66 [95% CI: 0.44, 0.88]), and modafinil (200 mg; ES = 0.54: [95% CI: 0.33, 0.74]); 400 mg; ES = 0.54 [95% CI: 0.42, 0.65]) had a clinically meaningful improvement in efficacy. P-scores ranked placebo, then pitolisant, modafinil 200 mg, modafinil 400 mg and solriamfetol for overall safety; and pitolisant, then solriamfetol, modafinil 400 mg and modafinil 200 mg for benefit-risk ratio.

Interpretation

Pitolisant, solriamfetol and modafinil had comparable efficacy for maintaining wakefulness in patients with OSA. Pitolisant had a better safety profile and benefit-risk ratio compared with solriamfetol and modafinil. The overall and cardiovascular safety risk ratios suggest that pitolisant might be the best candidate for patients with OSA with multiple cardiovascular comorbidities.

### Multiple sclerosis [^113wy2zr]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis is the most common cause of neurological disability in young adults. Irreversible disability can occur, but life expectancy is generally not affected.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of: interventions aimed at reducing relapse rates and disability; interventions to improve symptoms during acute relapse; treatments for fatigue; treatments for spasticity; and multidisciplinary care on disability? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 58 systematic reviews, RCTs, and observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following key interventions: amantadine, azathioprine, behaviour modification, botulinum toxin, corticosteroids, exercise, gabapentin, inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation, interferon beta, intrathecal baclofen, intravenous immunoglobulin, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, modafinil, oral drug treatments, oral glatiramer acetate, parenteral glatiramer acetate, physiotherapy, and plasma exchange.

### A practical guide to the therapy of narcolepsy and hypersomnia syndromes [^114ktBcf]. Neurotherapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Modafinil is available as a racemic mixture, or as the R-isomer only. As L-modafinil has a lower affinity for the dopamine transporter and a threefold shorter half-life than R-modafinil, the effects of the racemic mixture are more similar to those of R-modafinil once steady state concentrations are reached, although small differences have been reported. Patients may benefit from one daily administration in the morning or from two administrations at morning and noon. A common side effect is headache (as with other stimulants), but this side effect generally subsides when doses are more slowly increased. Increased anxiety or blood pressure can also be observed. As for many other medications, modafinil can induce an allergic reaction, an effect that can escalate to a Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) life-threatening situation. Because such an effect was suspected in a few cases during a pediatric trial of racemic modafinil, the compound is not approved for pediatric use. The risk of a possible Stevens Johnson Syndrome with modafinil is to be balanced with that of an increased risk of addiction with more classic stimulants.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

Modafinil tablets contain modafinil, a Schedule IV controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

In humans, modafinil produces psychoactive and euphoric effects, alterations in mood, perception, thinking, and feelings typical of other CNS stimulants. In in vitro binding studies, modafinil binds to the dopamine reuptake site and causes an increase in extracellular dopamine, but no increase in dopamine release. Modafinil is reinforcing, as evidenced by its self-administration in monkeys previously trained to self-administer cocaine. In some studies, modafinil was also partially discriminated as stimulant-like. Physicians should follow patients closely, especially those with a history of drug and/or stimulant (e.g., methylphenidate, amphetamine, or cocaine) abuse. Patients should be observed for signs of misuse or abuse (e.g., incrementation of doses or drug-seeking behavior).

The abuse potential of modafinil (200, 400, and 800 mg) was assessed relative to methylphenidate (45 and 90 mg) in an inpatient study in individuals experienced with drugs of abuse. Results from this clinical study demonstrated that modafinil produced psychoactive and euphoric effects and feelings consistent with other scheduled CNS stimulants (methylphenidate).

9.3 Dependence

In one placebo-controlled clinical trial, the effects of modafinil withdrawal were monitored following 9 weeks of modafinil use. There were no reported withdrawal symptoms with modafinil during 14 days of observation, although sleepiness returned in narcoleptic patients.

### A retrospective review of supratherapeutic modafinil exposures [^113p2bJ3]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

The University of California–San Diego Institutional Review Board approved this retrospective cohort study. A retrospective chart review of the California Poison Control System (CPCS) electronic database (Visual Dotlab) for cases between the years 1998 and 2008 was performed. Search codes included the terms "modafinil" and "Provigil". Cases were assessed by the principal and assistant investigators only after removal of all patient identifiers. Inclusion criteria included patients of any age with single substance exposure to modafinil and follow-up to a known outcome (this cohort included patients exposed to modafinil who were described in abstract form in). Exclusion criteria were history of any co-ingestants and inability to follow the patient to a known outcome.

Data collected included date of occurrence, age, gender, weight (where available), dose ingested by history (or, in the case of a child, pill count or events witnessed by a parent), whether exposure was intentional or unintentional, symptoms, duration of clinical effects, site of exposure, management site, treatment, length of hospital stay, and clinical outcome. Among intentional exposures, "abuse" was defined as use of the medication for purported psychotropic effects, while "misuse" was defined as use of the medication for its known stimulating effects for non-FDA-approved indications (e.g. to facilitate studying). Tachycardia was defined as a heart rate > 100 bpm, and hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg. Outcomes were coded as "no effect", "minor effect", "moderate effect", "major effect", or "death" according to the criteria set forth by the American Association of Poison Control Centers. All data abstracted were transcribed into a standardized Microsoft Excel 2008 for Mac (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) spreadsheet.

### Use of modafinil for the treatment of attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^1112xhi4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence for the use of modafinil in the treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (January 1990-May 2006) was conducted using MeSH terms ADHD and modafinil. The search was limited to English-language articles on clinical trials in humans. The Cochrane Database was also searched.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The literature search yielded 4 randomized clinical trials.

Data Synthesis

The use of modafinil in the treatment of ADHD is associated with significant improvements in primary outcome measures used to assess the status of patients diagnosed with ADHD. Several aspects of cognitive function in ADHD patients also appear to improve following modafinil treatment. Modafinil shows a favorable adverse effect profile. Insomnia and headache were the most common adverse effects, seen in approximately 20% of treated individuals. However, it has not been demonstrated that the beneficial effects of modafinil are maintained with chronic administration.

Conclusions

Modafinil may be a viable option for some patients in the treatment of ADHD, perhaps those for whom standard ADHD therapies have not been successful or tolerated. There remains a need for additional large, long-term studies using flexible titration methods to optimize the dose of modafinil to establish safety and efficacy, as well as head-to-head comparisons between modafinil and both long- and short-acting stimulants to determine the role of modafinil in the treatment of ADHD.

### Modafinil for people with schizophrenia or related disorders [^113rdoS7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

People with schizophrenia have a range of different symptoms, including positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (such as social withdrawal and lack of affect), and cognitive impairment. The standard medication for people with schizophrenia is antipsychotics. However, these medications may not be effective for all symptoms of schizophrenia, as cognitive and negative symptoms are usually hard to treat. Additional therapies or medications are available for the management of these symptoms. Modafinil, a wakefulness-promoting agent most frequently used in narcolepsy or shift work sleep disorder, is one intervention that is theorised to have an effect of these symptoms.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to assess the effects of modafinil for people with schizophrenia or related disorders.

Search Methods

On 27 April 2015, 24 May 2017, and 31 October 2019, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials, which is based on regular searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, time, document type, or publication status limitations for the inclusion of records in the register.

Selection Criteria

We selected all randomised controlled trials comparing modafinil with placebo or other treatments for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently extracted data from the included studies. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis. We used GRADE to complete a 'Summary of findings' table and assessed risk of bias for the included studies.

Main Results

Eleven studies including a total of 422 participants contributed to data analyses. Most studies had a small population size (average 38 people per study) and were of short duration. We also detected a high risk of bias for selective outcome reporting in just under 50% of the trials. We therefore rated the overall methodological quality of the included studies as low. We considered seven main outcomes of interest: clinically important change in overall mental state, clinically important change in cognitive functioning, incidence of a clinically important adverse effect/event, clinically important change in global state, leaving the study early for any reason, clinically important change in quality of life, and hospital admission. All studies assessed the effects of adding modafinil to participants' usual antipsychotic treatment compared to adding placebo to usual antipsychotic treatment. Six studies found that adding modafinil to antipsychotic treatment may have little or no effect on overall mental state of people with schizophrenia, specifically the risk of worsening psychosis (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.98; participants = 209; studies = 6, low-quality evidence). Regarding the effect of modafinil on cognitive function, the trials did not report clinically important change data, but one study reported endpoint scores on the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB): in this study we found no clear difference in scores between modafinil and placebo treatment groups (MD -3.10, 95% CI -10.9 to 4.7; participants = 48; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence). Only one study (N = 35) reported adverse effect/event data. In this study one serious adverse event occurred in each group (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.06 to 12.42; participants = 35; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence). One study measured change in global state using the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement Scale. This study found that adding modafinil to antipsychotic treatment may have little or no effect on global state (RR 6.36, 95% CI 0.94 to 43.07, participants = 21; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence). Nine studies found that modafinil has no effect on numbers of participants leaving the study early (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.52 participants = 357; studies = 9, moderate-quality evidence). None of the trials reported clinically important change in quality of life, but one study did report quality of life using endpoint scores on the Quality of Life Inventory, finding no clear difference between treatment groups (MD -0.2, 95% CI -1.18 to 0.78; participants = 20; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence). Finally, one study reported data for number of participants needing hospitalisation: one participant in each group was hospitalised (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.06 to 12.42; participants = 35; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Due to methodological issues, low sample size, and short duration of the clinical trials as well as high risk of bias for outcome reporting, most of the evidence available for this review is of very low or low quality. For results where quality is low or very low, we are uncertain or very uncertain if the effect estimates are true effects, limiting our conclusions. Specifically, we found that modafinil is no better or worse than placebo at preventing worsening of psychosis; however, we are uncertain about this result. We have more confidence that participants receiving modafinil are no more likely to leave a trial early than participants receiving placebo. However, we are very uncertain about the remaining equivocal results between modafinil and placebo for outcomes such as improvement in global state or cognitive function, incidence of adverse events, and changes in quality of life. More high-quality data are needed before firm conclusions regarding the effects of modafinil for people with schizophrenia or related disorders can be made.

5.5 Psychiatric Symptoms

Psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with modafinil.

In the adult PROVIGIL controlled trials, psychiatric symptoms resulting in treatment discontinuation (at a frequency ≥ 0.3%) and reported more often in patients treated with PROVIGIL compared to those treated with placebo were anxiety (1%), nervousness (1%), insomnia (< 1%), confusion (< 1%), agitation (< 1%), and depression (< 1%).

Postmarketing adverse reactions associated with the use of modafinil have included mania, delusions, hallucinations, suicidal ideation, and aggression, some resulting in hospitalization. Many, but not all, patients had a prior psychiatric history. One healthy male volunteer developed ideas of reference, paranoid delusions, and auditory hallucinations in association with multiple daily 600 mg doses of PROVIGIL (three times the recommended dose) and sleep deprivation. There was no evidence of psychosis 36 hours after drug discontinuation.

Caution should be exercised when PROVIGIL is given to patients with a history of psychosis, depression, or mania. Consideration should be given to the possible emergence or exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms in patients treated with PROVIGIL. If psychiatric symptoms develop in association with PROVIGIL administration, consider discontinuing PROVIGIL.

5.6 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machinery

Although PROVIGIL has not been shown to produce functional impairment, any drug affecting the CNS may alter judgment, thinking or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about operating an automobile or other hazardous machinery until it is reasonably certain that PROVIGIL therapy will not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.

### Modafinil augmentation therapy in unipolar and bipolar depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113GEGgx]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Current pharmacologic treatments for a depressive episode in unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression are limited by low rates of remission. Residual symptoms include a persistent low mood and neurovegetative symptoms such as fatigue. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy and tolerability of augmentation of first-line therapies with the novel stimulant-like agent modafinil in MDD and bipolar depression.

Data Sources

MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, 1980-April 2013 were searched using the following terms: (modafinil or armodafinil) and (depressi* or depressed or major depressive disorder or major depression or unipolar or bipolar or dysthymi*). Inclusion criteria were as follows: randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, sample comprising adult patients (18–65 years) with unipolar or bipolar depression, diagnosis according to DSM-IV, ICD-10, or other well-recognized criteria, modafinil or armodafinil given as augmentation therapy in at least 1 arm of the trial, and publication in English in a peer-reviewed journal.

Study Selection

Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of adjunctive treatment with modafinil or armodafinil of standard treatment for depressive episodes in MDD and bipolar depression were selected.

Data Extraction

Two independent appraisers assessed the eligibility of the trials. A random-effects meta-analysis with DerSimonian-Laird method was used. Moderator effects were evaluated by meta-regression.

Results

Data from 6 RCTs, with a total of 910 patients with MDD or bipolar depression, consisting of 4 MDD RCTs (n = 568) and 2 bipolar depression RCTs (n = 342) were analyzed. The meta-analysis revealed significant effects of modafinil on improvements in overall depression scores (point estimate = -0.35; 95% CI, -0.61 to -0.10) and remission rates (odds ratio = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.49). The treatment effects were evident in both MDD and bipolar depression, with no difference between disorders. Modafinil showed a significant positive effect on fatigue symptoms (95% CI, -0.42 to -0.05). The adverse events were no different from placebo.

Conclusions

Modafinil is an effective augmentation strategy for acute depressive episodes, including for symptoms of fatigue, in both unipolar and bipolar disorders.

### Wake-promoting pharmacotherapy for psychiatric disorders [^112SMkLH]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Medications promoting wakefulness are currently used in psychopharmacology in different contexts and with different objectives. In particular, they may be used for the treatment of syndromes that primarily show significant impairment in alertness/wakefulness (e.g., excessive sleepiness and other sleep disorders) as well as for the symptomatic treatment of different neuropsychiatric disorders that, in turn, are not exclusively characterized by sleep-wake disturbances (like mood disorders, for instance). In addition, several psychotropic compounds, including some antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and anxiolytics have well-established sedating side effects that may go beyond the therapeutic target and require the symptomatic use of wake-promoting agents. Even though such a clinical scenario reflects millions of individuals affected (alterations of wakefulness have a prevalence rate of 20–43% in the general population), relatively few pharmacotherapies are available, mainly including compounds with psychostimulating effects, such as methylphenidate, modafinil, and armodafinil and some amphetaminic agents. In light of their side effects and potential for abuse, such compounds have received FDA approval only for a limited number of psychiatric disorders. Nonetheless, their clinical application has recently become more widespread, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, narcolepsy, treatment-resistant depression, bipolar disorder, shift work sleep disorder, schizophrenia, and addictions. Wake-promoting agents have different mechanisms of action, peculiar clinical strengths and specific limitations, with novel drugs in the field under extensive investigation. The present review is aimed to provide an updated overview of the aforementioned compounds as well as investigational drugs in the field, in terms of mechanism of action, indications and use in clinical practice.

5.2 Angioedema and Anaphylaxis Reactions

Angioedema and hypersensitivity (with rash, dysphagia, and bronchospasm), were observed in patients treated with armodafinil, the R enantiomer of modafinil (which is the racemic mixture). No such cases were observed in modafinil clinical trials. However, angioedema has been reported in postmarketing experience with modafinil. Patients should be advised to discontinue therapy and immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema or anaphylaxis (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue or larynx; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness).

5.3 Multi-organ Hypersensitivity Reactions

Multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions, including at least one fatality in postmarketing experience, have occurred in close temporal association (median time to detection 13 days: range 4–33) to the initiation of modafinil.

Although there have been a limited number of reports, multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions may result in hospitalization or be life-threatening. There are no factors that are known to predict the risk of occurrence or the severity of multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions. Signs and symptoms of this disorder were diverse; however, patients typically, although not exclusively, presented with fever and rash associated with other organ system involvement. Other associated manifestations included myocarditis, hepatitis, liver function test abnormalities, hematological abnormalities (e.g., eosinophilia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), pruritus, and asthenia. Because multi-organ hypersensitivity is variable in its expression, other organ system symptoms and signs, not noted here, may occur.

If a multi-organ hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, PROVIGIL should be discontinued. Although there are no case reports to indicate cross‑sensitivity with other drugs that produce this syndrome, the experience with drugs associated with multi-organ hypersensitivity would indicate this to be a possibility.

5.4 Persistent Sleepiness

Patients with abnormal levels of sleepiness who take PROVIGIL should be advised that their level of wakefulness may not return to normal. Patients with excessive sleepiness, including those taking PROVIGIL, should be frequently reassessed for their degree of sleepiness and, if appropriate, advised to avoid driving or any other potentially dangerous activity. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge sleepiness or drowsiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities.

14.2 Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)

The effectiveness of PROVIGIL in improving wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with OSA was established in two multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical studies of patients who met the criteria for OSA. The criteria include either: 1) excessive sleepiness or insomnia, plus frequent episodes of impaired breathing during sleep, and associated features such as loud snoring, morning headaches and dry mouth upon awakening; or 2) excessive sleepiness or insomnia and polysomnography demonstrating one of the following: more than five obstructive apneas, each greater than 10 seconds in duration, per hour of sleep and one or more of the following: frequent arousals from sleep associated with the apneas, bradytachycardia, and arterial oxygen desaturation in association with the apneas. In addition, for entry into these studies, all patients were required to have excessive sleepiness as demonstrated by a score ≥ 10 on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), despite treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Evidence that CPAP was effective in reducing episodes of apnea/hypopnea was required along with documentation of CPAP use.

In the first study, a 12-week trial, a total of 327 patients with OSA were randomized to receive PROVIGIL 200 mg/day, PROVIGIL 400 mg/day, or matching placebo. The majority of patients (80%) were fully compliant with CPAP, defined as CPAP use greater than 4 hours/night on > 70% of nights. The remainder were partially CPAP compliant, defined as CPAP use < 4 hours/night on > 30% of nights. CPAP use continued throughout the study. The primary measures of effectiveness were 1) sleep latency, as assessed by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and 2) the change in the patient's overall disease status, as measured by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) at the final visit [see Clinical Studies (14.1) for a description of these measures].

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

PROVIGIL contains modafinil, a Schedule IV controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

In humans, modafinil produces psychoactive and euphoric effects, alterations in mood, perception, thinking, and feelings typical of other CNS stimulants. In in vitro binding studies, modafinil binds to the dopamine reuptake site and causes an increase in extracellular dopamine, but no increase in dopamine release. Modafinil is reinforcing, as evidenced by its self-administration in monkeys previously trained to self-administer cocaine. In some studies, modafinil was also partially discriminated as stimulant-like. Physicians should follow patients closely, especially those with a history of drug and/or stimulant (e.g., methylphenidate, amphetamine, or cocaine) abuse. Patients should be observed for signs of misuse or abuse (e.g., incrementation of doses or drug-seeking behavior).

The abuse potential of modafinil (200, 400, and 800 mg) was assessed relative to methylphenidate (45 and 90 mg) in an inpatient study in individuals experienced with drugs of abuse. Results from this clinical study demonstrated that modafinil produced psychoactive and euphoric effects and feelings consistent with other scheduled CNS stimulants (methylphenidate).

9.3 Dependence

In one placebo-controlled clinical trial, the effects of modafinil withdrawal were monitored following 9 weeks of modafinil use. There were no reported withdrawal symptoms with modafinil during 14 days of observation, although sleepiness returned in narcoleptic patients.

### Efficacy and safety of modafinil in the treatment of cancer-related fatigue [^1175UA3L]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of modafinil in the treatment of cancer-related fatigue (CRF). DATA SOUCES: Literature was accessed via MEDLINE (1950-week 3, November 2008), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Google Scholar using the terms modafinil, cancer, and fatigue. Reference citations from articles identified were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language publications identified were analyzed for significance. Studies relevant to the objective were used, including 2 prospective open-label studies, one randomized double-blind, dose-controlled trial with an open-label extension, and one Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.

Data Synthesis

Fatigue is a nearly universal adverse effect of cancer and its treatment that is unrelated to physical exertion, is not relieved by sleep or rest, and negatively affects quality of life. Modafinil is a central nervous system stimulant with minimal toxicity and a low propensity for abuse. Clinical data demonstrate that modafinil significantly reduces fatigue in patients who have received cancer treatment or are currently undergoing chemotherapy. Additional benefits include improvement in cognitive function, mood, general activity, walking ability, normal work ability, relations with other people, and enjoyment of life. Limitations of the available data include open-label design in 3 of the 4 studies; the absence of numerical results of fatigue assessments in the abstract of 1 trial, preventing the determination of clinical significance; and the full inclusion/exclusion criteria, which were not included in the published abstracts. These limitations leave readers without a clear picture of the study populations. Finally, different patient populations at different points in treatment with varying durations of therapy were used, which makes extrapolation of data to the general population challenging.

Conclusions

Further randomized placebo-controlled trials are necessary to amass evidence for the effective and safe use of modafinil for CRF; however, if traditional therapies have failed or are intolerable, modafinil can be considered a treatment option.

14.1 Narcolepsy

The effectiveness of PROVIGIL in improving wakefulness in adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy was established in two US 9‑week, multi-center, placebo‑controlled, parallel-group, double‑blind studies of outpatients who met the criteria for narcolepsy. A total of 558 patients were randomized to receive PROVIGIL 200 or 400 mg/day, or placebo. The criteria for narcolepsy include either: 1) recurrent daytime naps or lapses into sleep that occur almost daily for at least three months, plus sudden bilateral loss of postural muscle tone in association with intense emotion (cataplexy); or 2) a complaint of excessive sleepiness or sudden muscle weakness with associated features: sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, automatic behaviors, disrupted major sleep episode; and polysomnography demonstrating one of the following: sleep latency less than 10 minutes or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency less than 20 minutes. For entry into these studies, all patients were required to have objectively documented excessive daytime sleepiness, via a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) with two or more sleep onset REM periods and the absence of any other clinically significant active medical or psychiatric disorder. The MSLT, an objective polysomnographic assessment of the patient's ability to fall asleep in an unstimulating environment, measured latency (in minutes) to sleep onset averaged over 4 test sessions at 2-hour intervals. For each test session, the subject was told to lie quietly and attempt to sleep. Each test session was terminated after 20 minutes if no sleep occurred or 15 minutes after sleep onset.

### Chronic fatigue in cancer survivorship: psychiatry versus oncology or psychiatry with oncology? [^111UXE9m]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological Treatments

No drug has regulatory approval for ME/CFS fatigue, and guidelines do not recommend any specific pharmacotherapy for the fatigue symptom itself. Psychiatrists may trial medications targeting prominent associated symptoms – e.g. low-dose duloxetine or amitriptyline for fibromyalgia-like pain or sleep, or stimulants in severe refractory cases – but evidence for these in ME/CFS is limited and they are not standard guideline recommendations. On the oncology side, pharmacologic options for CRF have been explored and appear in guidelines with cautious endorsement for select patients. For example, psychostimulants like methylphenidate or modafinil have shown small short-term benefits in some cancer fatigue trials. Accordingly, the ASCO and NCCN guidelines note that stimulants can be considered only for refractory CRF or when rapid improvement in fatigue is needed (e.g. to maintain work schedules), but they refrain from routine recommendation due to mixed evidence and potential side effects.

Corticosteroids have been used for fatigue in advanced cancer/palliative settings with temporary benefit but are not suitable for long-term use. Other agents like antidepressants have generally not shown significant benefit on fatigue unless there is a concurrent depression.

In summary, medications play a minor role in both conditions' fatigue management, but oncology guidelines are somewhat more open to off-label pharmacological stimulants in carefully selected cases whereas ME/CFS guidelines focus on symptom-by-symptom management with no specific recommendation for stimulants (which can often lead to "crashes" in ME/CFS patients if not very carefully managed).

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. PROVIGIL is not approved in this population for any indication.

Serious skin rashes, including erythema multiforme major (EMM) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) have been associated with modafinil use in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In a controlled 6-week study, 165 pediatric patients (aged 5–17 years) with narcolepsy were treated with modafinil (n = 123), or placebo (n = 42). There were no statistically significant differences favoring modafinil over placebo in prolonging sleep latency as measured by MSLT, or in perceptions of sleepiness as determined by the clinical global impression-clinician scale (CGI-C).

In the controlled and open-label clinical studies, treatment emergent adverse reactions of the psychiatric and nervous system included Tourette's syndrome, insomnia, hostility, increased cataplexy, increased hypnagogic hallucinations, and suicidal ideation. Transient leukopenia, which resolved without medical intervention, was also observed. In the controlled clinical study, 3 of 38 girls, ages 12 or older, treated with modafinil experienced dysmenorrhea compared to 0 of 10 girls who received placebo.

There were three 7 to 9 week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group studies in children and adolescents (aged 6–17 years) with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Two of the studies were flexible-dose studies (up to 425 mg/day), and the third was a fixed-dose study (340 mg/day for patients < 30 kg and 425 mg/day for patients ≥ 30 kg). Although these studies showed statistically significant differences favoring modafinil over placebo in reducing ADHD symptoms as measured by the ADHD-RS (school version), there were 3 cases of serious rash including one case of possible SJS among 933 patients exposed to modafinil in this program. Modafinil is not approved for use in treating ADHD.

If you have a severe rash with modafinil tablets, stopping the medicine may not keep the rash from becoming life-threatening or causing you to be permanently disabled or disfigured.

Modafinil tablets are not approved for use in children for any medical condition.

It is not known if modafinil tablets are safe or effective in children under 17 years of age.

What are modafinil tablets?

Modafinil tablets are a prescription medicine used to improve wakefulness in adults who are very sleepy due to one of the following diagnosed sleep disorders:

narcolepsy
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Modafinil tablets are used to treat excessive sleepiness, but not the obstruction or medical condition that is causing OSA. You should talk with your doctor about treatments for OSA before you start taking modafinil tablets and during treatment with modafinil tablets.
