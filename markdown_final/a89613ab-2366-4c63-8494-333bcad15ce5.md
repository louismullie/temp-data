## Question

If you suspect a basal cell carcinoma is a shave biopsy ok

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a shave biopsy is appropriate for suspected basal cell carcinoma and how to apply it safely in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what major guidelines say about biopsy technique selection. Then, I should verify the diagnostic adequacy of shave biopsy and its limitations. Next, I will examine when shave biopsy is preferred versus when punch or excisional biopsy is better. After that, I need to check the implications of margin status in shave biopsies and how to interpret them. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and ensure the plan aligns with follow-up and documentation standards.

> Let me first confirm the guideline position so I don't jump to conclusions. The NCCN and AAD guidelines explicitly list shave, punch, and excisional biopsy as acceptable diagnostic techniques for suspected BCC, with the choice individualized to lesion characteristics and clinician judgment, and they emphasize obtaining adequate depth to inform diagnosis and therapy, including identifying aggressive features if present [^116poSa1] [^116tWmiH] [^1138Fxri].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic performance of shave biopsy specifically. Multiple series show shave biopsy reliably yields sufficient tissue for accurate histologic diagnosis in the vast majority of cases, with high concordance to clinical suspicion and low patient-reported discomfort even without local anesthesia in selected settings, supporting its diagnostic utility when appropriately selected and executed [^1162mg1c] [^117RwNxg].

> Hold on, I should verify the key limitations before recommending shave broadly. Shave biopsies can miss deeper components, leading to under-recognition of aggressive subtypes such as infiltrative or micronodular patterns, and they are not designed to assess true margin status; reported "negative margins" on shave have a poor negative predictive value for residual tumor, and deeper-level review frequently reveals previously missed positive margins, so a negative shave margin should not reassure us that the tumor is gone [^111tSvQ3] [^111bVFTz] [^112xk6jH] [^115CPkzE].

> I need to ensure I'm aligning technique with risk and anatomy. For low-risk, superficial or small nodular BCCs on the trunk or extremities, shave biopsy is reasonable and efficient. For high-risk sites (face, ears, periocular, genitalia), ill-defined or clinically deep lesions, or when aggressive histology is suspected, punch or excisional biopsy is preferred to better sample depth and architecture, and NCCN notes that shave removal may be considered in select low-risk scenarios but excision is favored if tumor extends beyond the dermis [^1144zpnm] [^116mkWjT] [^117RwNxg].

> Let me consider the practical distinction between diagnostic shave biopsy and shave removal. Diagnostic shave aims to sample adequately for diagnosis, whereas shave removal intends complete eradication in low-risk lesions. Even with negative margins on a shave removal, residual BCC is common, so patients should be counseled that additional treatment may still be needed and that margin status on shave is unreliable for predicting cure [^117JJsRw] [^117T7Ltw] [^112xk6jH].

> Next, I should review how to interpret pathology and plan next steps. I should confirm that the pathology report includes subtype and features that raise recurrence risk, and I must remember that the intent of a biopsy is diagnosis, not margin assessment. If the biopsy is inadequate or the clinical picture and histology diverge, I should repeat or upgrade the biopsy rather than proceeding based on incomplete information [^113TF3Yk] [^11289hSW] [^112fniN2].

> I will now examine special scenarios where shave can mislead. Superficial BCC diagnosed on shave may harbor deeper nodular, micronodular, or infiltrative components that were not sampled, particularly in older patients and on the head/neck, which can alter management and increase Mohs stages needed for clearance. This strengthens the case for deeper sampling when clinical suspicion for invasion is higher [^111tSvQ3] [^112R7saK].

> But wait, what if the lesion is clinically obvious and tiny in a low-risk location — do I even need a biopsy? European guidance allows omitting histology for clearly diagnosed, small, superficial or nodular BCCs in low-risk areas when noninvasive tools support the diagnosis, yet in U.S. practice, tissue confirmation remains standard; if I consider shave removal as a one-step diagnostic and therapeutic approach, I must document that intent and counsel on the possibility of residual disease requiring further therapy [^115uHABe] [^112Ti2CY].

> Let me double-check documentation and communication requirements so nothing is missed. I should provide the pathologist with patient age, sex, anatomic location, lesion size, prior treatment, and any immunosuppression or radiation history, and I should request subtype and adverse features in the report. After any BCC diagnosis, I need to perform a complete skin examination and arrange risk-appropriate follow-up given the high risk of additional keratinocyte cancers [^117418ic] [^113TF3Yk] [^116ja7u7] [^111q6t8w].

> Putting this together, my bottom line is that yes, shave biopsy is acceptable for suspected BCC when the lesion is low risk, superficial, and in a low-risk location, with the understanding that it is a diagnostic, not curative, procedure and that deeper or high-risk lesions warrant punch or excisional sampling. I should explicitly counsel that negative shave margins do not equal cure and that additional treatment is frequently indicated, aligning the plan with guideline-based risk stratification and follow-up [^11289hSW] [^116tWmiH] [^1144zpnm] [^112xk6jH].

---

Shave biopsy is appropriate for suspected basal cell carcinoma when the lesion is **superficial or raised** and located in a low-risk area (trunk or extremities) [^116gN3Jo], as it provides adequate tissue for diagnosis with minimal scarring and rapid healing [^1162mg1c]. It is **not recommended for lesions in high-risk facial sites** (nose, eyelids, periorbital, perioral, ears), those with suspected infiltrative or morpheaform subtypes, or when deeper invasion is suspected, because shave biopsy can miss deeper components and understage aggressive disease [^116poSa1] [^111tSvQ3]. If shave biopsy is inconclusive or suspicion for aggressive features remains, perform a punch or excisional biopsy to ensure accurate diagnosis and guide definitive management [^116tWmiH] [^113bBCeR].

---

## Indications for shave biopsy in suspected BCC

Shave biopsy is appropriate in the following scenarios:

- **Superficial lesions**: Superficial or raised lesions confined to the epidermis or superficial dermis [^116gN3Jo].

- **Low-risk locations**: Lesions on the trunk or extremities, where cosmetic and functional considerations are less critical [^notfound].

- **Patient factors**: Patients with bleeding disorders or those unable to tolerate more invasive procedures may benefit from shave biopsy due to its minimally invasive nature [^113bBCeR].

---

## Limitations and risks of shave biopsy

While shave biopsy is useful, it has limitations and risks:

- **Incomplete sampling**: Shave biopsy may not capture deeper tumor components, potentially missing aggressive subtypes (infiltrative, morpheaform) or perineural invasion [^111tSvQ3] [^111bVFTz].

- **False negatives**: Negative margins on shave biopsy do not guarantee complete tumor removal, with residual tumor present in approximately 39.4% of cases in recent studies [^1146tA14].

- **Misclassification**: Initial shave biopsy may underdiagnose aggressive subtypes, leading to undertreatment and increased recurrence risk [^111tSvQ3] [^112R7saK].

---

## Clinical scenarios where shave biopsy is not recommended

Shave biopsy is not recommended in the following scenarios:

- **High-risk locations**: Facial lesions involving the nose, eyelids, periorbital area, perioral area, or ears, where deeper invasion and aggressive subtypes are more common [^111tSvQ3].

- **Suspicion of aggressive subtypes**: Lesions with ill-defined borders, induration, or clinical features suggestive of infiltrative or morpheaform BCC [^116poSa1].

- **Recurrent lesions**: Recurrent BCCs or lesions previously treated with radiation or immunosuppression, due to higher risk of deeper invasion and recurrence [^117RwNxg].

---

## Alternative biopsy techniques

When shave biopsy is not appropriate, **alternative techniques** include:

| **Biopsy technique** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Punch biopsy | - Deeper lesions <br/> - Suspicion of aggressive subtypes <br/> - High-risk locations | - Provides full-thickness tissue sample <br/> - Better assessment of tumor depth and subtype | - Small scar <br/> - Slightly more invasive than shave biopsy |
| Excisional biopsy | - Small lesions <br/> - Suspicion of aggressive subtypes <br/> - High-risk locations | - Complete tumor removal <br/> - Accurate histopathological assessment | - Larger scar <br/> - More invasive procedure |

---

## Guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) emphasize tailoring the biopsy technique to lesion characteristics, location, and patient factors [^113bBCeR] [^116poSa1]. They recommend shave biopsy for superficial lesions in low-risk locations but advise punch or excisional biopsy for high-risk sites or suspected aggressive subtypes [^117JJsRw] [^117RwNxg].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Studies show that shave biopsy can result in residual tumor in a significant proportion of cases, particularly for nodular or infiltrative subtypes [^1146tA14]. Recurrence rates after shave biopsy vary depending on tumor subtype, location, and adequacy of subsequent treatment, with higher recurrence observed in aggressive subtypes and high-risk locations [^112jbxTE].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing biopsy choice

Patient-specific factors influencing biopsy choice include **age and comorbidities**, as older patients or those with comorbidities may benefit from less invasive shave biopsy, and **patient preference**, since some patients may prioritize minimal scarring and faster healing, making shave biopsy more acceptable [^117RwNxg].

---

## Post-biopsy management and follow-up

Regardless of biopsy technique, **post-biopsy management** should include:

- **Definitive treatment**: Surgical excision, Mohs micrographic surgery, or other appropriate treatments based on tumor subtype, location, and patient factors [^1116XAAe].

- **Follow-up**: Regular follow-up visits to monitor for recurrence or new lesions, as patients with BCC have a higher risk of developing additional skin cancers [^111q6t8w].

---

Shave biopsy is appropriate for suspected BCC in **superficial lesions** or **low-risk locations**, providing adequate tissue for diagnosis with minimal scarring. It is not recommended for high-risk sites, aggressive subtypes, or recurrent lesions, where punch or excisional biopsy is preferred. The choice of biopsy technique should be individualized based on lesion characteristics, location, and patient factors, with careful consideration of the risks and benefits of each method.

### Misclassification of aggressive basal cell carcinoma subtypes and implications for management [^112R7saK]. Dermatologic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) varies by histopathologic subtype; however, biopsies may inadequately characterize them as nonaggressive, risking potential suboptimal treatment.

Objective

To characterize the rate of undetected aggressive BCC subtypes by size, location, and histopathology type.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective cohort study of 928 BCCs treated with Mohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS) at a tertiary academic institution from 2015 to 2017, comparing patient and tumor characteristics and histopathologic subtype on biopsy versus Mohs.

Results

Among the 825 BCCs with known subtypes on biopsy, 68% (561/825) were classified as nonaggressive, 28% (159/561) of which were subsequently found to have aggressive subtypes on MMS. Aggressive features were more often underrepresented in biopsy samples taken from Area H compared with Area M/L (odd ratio [OR] 2.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.73–4.08, p < .001) or those with nodular subtypes (OR 2.19, CI 1.08–4.45, p = .03). Of concern, these unsuspected aggressive BCCs required more Mohs stages for clearance (mean 2.37, SD 0.72, p < .001) compared with BCCs that remained nonaggressive on both biopsy and Mohs (mean 1.50, SD 0.75).

Conclusion

Given the high percentage of BCCs with unsuspected aggressive subtypes, higher clinical suspicion for undiagnosed high-risk BCCs should be given to nodular BCCs and to BCCs on Area H.

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) biopsy — For suspected cSCC, the recommended biopsy techniques are punch biopsy, shave biopsy, and excisional biopsy, and the technique used will depend on the characteristics of the suspected malignancy and the judgment of the physician. The biopsy size and depth should be adequate to provide the recommended clinical information and pathology report elements to permit accurate diagnosis and guide therapy, and repeat biopsy may be considered if the initial biopsy specimen is inadequate for accurate diagnosis.

### Guidelines of care for the management of basal cell carcinoma [^1116XAAe]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) — surgical treatment recommendations specify modality selection and margins by risk category. A treatment plan that considers recurrence rate, preservation of function, patient expectations, and potential adverse effects is recommended. For low-risk primary BCC, surgical excision with 4-mm clinical margins and histologic margin assessment is recommended, and the work group recommends standard excision with a 4-mm margin of uninvolved skin around the tumor and/or biopsy site to a depth of the mid-subcutaneous adipose tissue with histologic margin assessment for low-risk primary BCC. C&E may be considered for low-risk tumors in non — terminal hair — bearing locations. Standard excision may be considered for select high-risk tumors; however, strong caution is advised when selecting a treatment modality without complete margin assessment for high-risk tumors. Mohs micrographic surgery is recommended for high-risk BCC.

### A large percentage of excision specimens show residual basal cell carcinoma: a retrospective chart review [^1146tA14]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is recommended. However, patients often note that the biopsy site appears resolved and inquire about the need for additional treatment.

Objective

This study aims to determine the rate of residual BCC on excision specimens after initial shave biopsy to aid in decision-making on the necessity of further treatment.

Methods and Materials

A retrospective chart review was conducted that reviewed excision specimen pathology reports of previously biopsy-proven basal cell carcinomas for the presence of residual tumor between 2012 and 2022 at a single institution.

Results

Two thousand one hundred seventeen cases met inclusion criteria. Overall, 39.4% of patients had residual BCC after an initial shave biopsy. Using an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval, a significant relationship was found between larger lesions, longer time between biopsy and excision, and lesions on high-risk body sites with increased odds of residual BCC. A significant relationship was found between negative or not specified margins on shave biopsy with decreased odds of residual BCC.

Conclusion

The results show that a large percentage of patients have residual BCC following initial biopsies. These results should be included in physician-patient discussions about treatment options for BCC.

### Biopsy outperforms reflectance confocal microscopy in diagnosing and subtyping basal cell carcinoma: results and experiences from a randomized controlled multicentre trial [^113xFFYn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Since the 1990s, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) – also called confocal imaging – became known for its noninvasive skin imaging potential. Preliminary studies of RCM used for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) focused on the correlation of histopathological and RCM features. 1, 2, 3 The high and increasing incidence of BCC, 4, 5, 6 accompanied by a persistent increasing pressure on our already heavily overloaded healthcare systems, justify the interest in this field. Ultimately, RCM could be a quick, patient‐friendly and economically interesting alternative to the current standard punch biopsy (PB) diagnosis. A PB is an invasive procedure, with risks of pain, scar formation and sampling error. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 The latter might lead to undertreatment followed by a recurrent tumour requiring additional (costly) therapy. Furthermore, PB does not give an immediate result owing to the time needed for tissue processing and assessment.

In contrast, RCM provides a noninvasive cellular‐level view and facilitates direct diagnosing with the possibility of complete lesion assessment, minimizing the risk of sampling error. Therefore, replacing PB with RCM would potentially save time, patient discomfort and money. Also, it might facilitate diagnosis and treatment in one visit ('one‐stop shop'). 12

As recently concluded, clinical evidence on the implementation of RCM for regular BCC diagnostics is currently too premature. Furthermore, most work was performed by experts, 13 and cost‐effectiveness has yet to be evaluated. Ideally, RCM should at least have similar diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing BCC as the currently used biopsies. Furthermore, the BCC subtype should be identified correctly, to select the most appropriate treatment. Also, costs of RCM preferably should not exceed costs of PB, and implementation should be feasible. Furthermore, the patient's experience should, ideally, be superior with RCM or at least similar to PB. All of these outcomes were assessed in this randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The primary objective was to investigate whether a correct diagnosis and subtype could be determined with RCM in patients with a clinically suspected primary BCC, in a real‐world setting. The secondary objectives were to study patient satisfaction and patient preferences.

### A large scalp ulceration [^111mXCGT]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A 57-year-old Caucasian man presented with a 3-month history of an expanding irregularly shaped superficial ulcer on the vertex of the scalp with associated hair loss. The patient reported blisters and pustules prior to the onset of the ulcer and alopecia. He denied other skin or oral lesions and specifically denied picking at the scalp. At the time of presentation, physical examination revealed a superficial ulcer, measuring roughly 15 × 8 cm (Fig 1), on the vertex of the scalp. A shave biopsy (Fig 2) was initially performed, followed by 2 punch biopsies; one for hematoxylin and eosin staining, and one for direct immunofluorescence (Fig 3).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Bullous impetigo
B. Ulcerated basal cell carcinoma
C. Dermatitis artefacta
D. Pemphigus vulgaris
E. Brunsting-Perry cicatricial pemphigoid

Answers:
A. Bullous impetigo – Incorrect. Bullous impetigo would show a subcorneal neutrophil-rich bulla with associated Gram-positive cocci.
B. Ulcerative basal cell carcinoma – Incorrect. Basal cell carcinoma would show a basaloid neoplasm extending off of the epidermis, with peripheral palisading of nuclei and clefting artifact surrounding tumor nodules.
C. Dermatitis artefacta – Incorrect. Dermatitis artefacta typically presents with irregularly shaped erosions/ulcers with jagged borders. While the patient's clinical presentation revealed an asymmetric ulcer, dermatitis artefacta should test negative on direct immunofluorescence.
D. Pemphigus vulgaris – Incorrect. Pemphigus vulgaris would demonstrate a suprabasilar intraepidermal acantholytic bulla with potential follicular involvement. Additionally, it is not typically a scarring process on biopsy.
E. Brunsting-Perry cicatricial pemphigoid – Correct. This patient's presentation of a rapidly progressing ulcer on the head with loss of hair growth in addition to a subepidermal bulla with positive direct immunofluorescence findings suggests localized cicatricial pemphigoid, with the Brunsting-Perry variant being the most likely diagnosis.

### Shave biopsy without local anaesthetic to diagnose basal cell carcinoma and other skin tumours prior to definitive treatment: analysis of 109 lesions [^1162mg1c]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnostic biopsy of basal cell carcinoma and other skin tumours may be necessary prior to definitive treatment.

Objectives

To assess whether shave biopsy sampling of tumours without local anaesthetic can provide adequate tissue to make an accurate histological diagnosis, and to determine whether any discomfort is associated with the technique.

Methods

One hundred and nine lesions from 99 patients were sampled by shave biopsy without local anaesthetic. Any discomfort associated with the procedure, and the adequacy of the histological specimen, were documented. The pathology diagnosis was also compared against the clinically suspected diagnosis.

Results

In 108 of the 109 lesions sampled, sufficient tissue was obtained to make an accurate histological diagnosis. In only six of the 109 procedures was any discomfort reported and in all cases this was rated as minor. A high correlation was found between histological diagnosis and initial clinical suspicion.

Conclusions

Shave biopsy without local anaesthetic is a simple, relatively pain-free method of obtaining tissue samples for histological diagnosis in appropriate tumours.

### Basal cell and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas: diagnosis and treatment [^116gN3Jo]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Keratinocyte carcinoma, traditionally referred to as nonmelanoma skin cancer, includes basal cell and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and is the most common skin cancer malignancy found in humans. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends counseling about minimizing exposure to ultraviolet radiation for people aged six months to 24 years with fair skin types to decrease their risk of skin cancer. Routine screening for skin cancer is controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concludes that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of a routine whole-body skin examination to screen for skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma commonly appears as a shiny, pearly papule with a smooth surface, rolled borders, and arborizing telangiectatic surface vessels. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma commonly appears as a firm, smooth, or hyperkeratotic papule or plaque, and may have central ulceration. Initial tissue sampling for diagnosis is a shave technique if the lesion is raised, or a punch biopsy of the most abnormal-appearing area of skin. High-risk factors for recurrence and metastasis include prior tumors, ill-defined borders, aggressive histologic patterns, and perineural invasion. Mohs micrographic surgery has the lowest recurrence rate among treatments but is best considered for large, high-risk tumors or tumors in sensitive anatomic locations. Smaller, lower-risk tumors are treated with surgical excision, electrodesiccation and curettage, or cryotherapy. Topical imiquimod and fluorouracil are also treatment options for superficial basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in situ. There are no clear guidelines for follow up after an index keratinocyte carcinoma, but monitoring for recurrence is important because the five-year risk of subsequent skin cancer is 41%. After more than one diagnosis, the five-year risk increases to 82%.

### Shave and punch biopsy for skin lesions [^114tgNys]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Shave and punch biopsies are essential procedures for physicians who manage skin conditions. These office-based procedures can diagnose questionable dermatologic lesions, including possible malignancies. Approaches include the superficial shave biopsy, saucerization excision, punch biopsy, and elliptical excision. A superficial shave biopsy can be used for raised lesions. A saucerization biopsy may be performed for flat or pigmented lesions. Punch biopsies yield full-thickness samples and can be used for lesions that require dermal or subcutaneous tissue for diagnosis. Indications for biopsy of suspected melanoma remain controversial. Sufficient tissue may be obtained with the quicker, less costly saucerization biopsy or the more time-consuming, invasive elliptical excisional biopsy.

### Deep shave removal of suspected basal cell carcinoma: a prospective study [^117T7Ltw]. Dermatologic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosis and treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in the same visit by shave removal may decrease health care spending and promote patient satisfaction.

Objective

To prospectively evaluate deep shave removal of lesions clinically suspicious for low-risk BCC on the trunk or extremities in immunocompetent patients.

Materials and Methods

Deep shave removal with the intent to remove the entire tumor was performed from January 2015 to June 2016, and patients were followed prospectively for clinical evidence of tumor recurrence.

Results

Seventy-seven lesions were removed from 51 patients, including 29 (37%) superficial and nodular BCCs, 27 (35%) superficial BCCs, 16 (21%) nodular BCCs, and 5 (6%) non-BCCs. Fifteen BCCs (21%) had positive residual margins after deep shave removal, which was significantly more likely to occur in nodular compared with superficial BCCs (odds ratio = 7.8, 95% confidence interval = 1.4–43), and underwent re-excision. Fourteen specimens initially reported to have negative margins after deep shave underwent resectioning, which revealed positive margins in 4 specimens (28.6%). No BCCs have recurred clinically after an average follow-up of 50 months (SE 3.2).

Conclusion

Consider deep shave removal for low-risk BCCs on the trunk or extremities in immunocompetent patients hoping to avoid a second treatment visit.

### Breast carcinoma masquerading as basal cell carcinoma of the nipple [^114nT3hH]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Case report

A 47-year-old woman was evaluated by her dermatologist for a persistent erosion of the right nipple. The patient suffered skin breakdown in this area, with intermittent, spontaneous, bloody discharge for the last year. No breast mass was identified on physical examination. Two mammograms, an ultrasound scan, and an MRI of the area were reported unremarkable. On examination, the patient had only superficial erosion involving the right nipple. A shallow shave biopsy found aggregates of atypical basaloid cells (Fig 1). These aggregates were stained with Ber-EP4, an immunomarker used to identify basal cell carcinoma.

A histologic diagnosis of BCC was rendered, and the patient was referred for MMS. At the time of presentation for surgery, there was a 7-mm erosion of the nipple without involvement of the areola (Fig 2). Frozen sections from the first stage of MMS revealed atypical cells that were evaluated as inconsistent with BCC (Fig 3) by the surgeon. Surgery was terminated and an excisional biopsy was performed.

Histologic examination of the larger excisional specimen found a deeper proliferation of markedly atypical and pleomorphic cells that formed ductal structures, and an assessment of ductal breast carcinoma was rendered by a different dermatopathologist (W. H.) (Fig 4, A). Repeat immunostains showed expression of Ber-EP4 (Fig 4, B) but also expression of cytokeratin-7 and HER2-neu (Fig 4, C). There was also a markedly elevated proliferative index with Ki67 staining. The patient was then referred to an oncologist and breast surgeon for evaluation and management. Based on tumor size and a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy result, stage T1a breast cancer was diagnosed. Treatment consisted of a lumpectomy with nipple removal and adjuvant radiation.

### Basal cell skin cancer, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^11289hSW]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for basal cell carcinoma - NCCN, more specifically with respect to histopathology (biopsy), NCCN 2023 guidelines recommend to perform a biopsy with the intent for diagnosis, not to assess the margin status.

### Characteristics of superficial basal cell carcinomas containing more aggressive subtypes on final histopathologic diagnosis [^111tSvQ3]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The prognosis and treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are largely dependent on tumor subtype, which is typically determined by punch or shave biopsy. Data regarding concordance between BCC subtype on initial biopsy and final histopathology for Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) or excision with frozen sections (EFS) are limited.

Objectives

To determine the concordance between initial biopsy and final MMS or EFS subtyping of BCC. We aim to investigate the incidence and clinical characteristics of lesions initially diagnosed as superficial BCC (sBCC) that are later found to have a nodular, micronodular, or infiltrative component.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of all MMS or EFS cases performed at a single academic center from August 1, 2015, to August 31, 2017. Inclusion criteria were a biopsy-proven diagnosis of sBCC and presence of residual tumor following stage I of MMS or EFS. Fisher&rsquo; s exact test was used to evaluate significance of clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with the presence of a nodular, micronodular, or infiltrative BCC component.

Results

A total of 164 MMS or EFS cases had an initial biopsy showing sBCC. Of these, 117 had residual BCC on stage I, and 43 (37%) were found to have a nodular, micronodular, or infiltrative component. Significant predictors of reclassified BCC subtype included age over 60 years (P = 0.006) and location on the head or neck (P = 0.043). Reclassified lesions required significantly more stages of MMS to clear (P = 0.036). Shave biopsy was used to diagnose 114 (97%) of the included cases.

Conclusions

Over one third of shave biopsies that initially diagnosed sBCC failed to detect a nodular, micronodular, or infiltrative component. Management of biopsy-proven sBCC should take into account the possible presence of an undiagnosed deeper tumor component with appropriate margin-assessment treatment modalities when clinically indicated.

### Predictive value of basal cell carcinoma biopsies with negative margins: a retrospective cohort study [^111N5Dh7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pathology reports of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) biopsies often contain comments of positive or negative margins, with only 1%-2% of the margin evaluated. The negative predictive value (NPV) of biopsy margin status on residual BCC is unknown.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the NPV of BCC biopsy margin status on the absence of residual BCC in the corresponding excision.

Methods

From our institution's archives, we collected BCC biopsies with negative margin readings that had subsequent excisions. For excisions read as negative for residual BCC, the excision blocks were sectioned at 150-μm intervals until exhausted.

Results

We collected 143 cases that met criteria; 34 (24%) were found to contain residual BCC in the corresponding excision leading to a NPV of 76%; in 31 of 34 (91%) of these cases, the residual histologic subtype was superficial.

Limitations

Our sectioning technique did not evaluate 100% of the excision specimens.

Conclusion

Negative margins in a BCC biopsy are a poor predictor of residual disease in the patient. We recommend that clinicians treat these lesions, and that pathologists who comment on margin status of BCC biopsies consider adding a caveat to reflect these findings.

### Incidence of residual nonmelanoma skin cancer in excisions after shave biopsy [^111Lsqf1]. Dermatologic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nonmelanoma skin cancer is an increasingly common disease that is typically treated surgically. After histopathologic confirmation by biopsy, the carcinoma is typically removed by excision, but not all excisional specimens contain residual carcinoma.

Objectives

To define the rate of residual basal and squamous cell carcinomas within excisional specimens after shave biopsy in a general dermatology office.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 439 consecutive cases sent to a single dermatopathology lab from a practitioner's general dermatology office who also performs Mohs micrographic surgery. One hundred cases had a histopathologically proven carcinoma on biopsy with subsequent excision. Histopathologic type, location, age, sex, and time from biopsy to excision were all analyzed for statistical association.

Results

Of 57 cases of basal cell carcinoma, 34 (59.6%) had positive residuals. Of 43 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, 12 (27.9%) had positive residuals. Histologic type was significantly associated (p = .002) with residual carcinoma in excisional specimens, with basal cells 2.13 times as likely to have residual carcinoma present.

Conclusion

The rate of residual nonmelanoma carcinoma in excision specimens after shave biopsy was found to be different from previously reported in the literature. These data may have therapeutic ramifications if further substantiated.

### Microcystic adnexal carcinoma: a review of the literature [^116it58a]. Dermatologic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) is a rare, locally aggressive cutaneous neoplasm that commonly occurs on the face.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to comprehensively review the current literature on MAC pertaining to epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, histology, immunohistochemistry, prognosis, follow-up, and treatment.

Materials and Methods

An extensive literature review was conducted using OVID MEDLINE and PubMed to identify articles relating to MAC.

Results

Microcystic adnexal carcinoma typically presents as a skin-colored nodule on the face. The pathogenesis is mostly related to pilar and eccrine differentiation. Histologically, MAC can mimic syringoma, desmoplastic trichoepithelioma, and infiltrative basal cell carcinoma. Diagnosis is challenging because superficial shave biopsies may reveal only benign findings that do not warrant further management. A deep biopsy is mandatory for the correct diagnosis, and Mohs micrographic surgery provides the highest cure rate.

Conclusion

Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a locally aggressive disease with histological margins that often far surpass what is clinically suspected. Mohs micrographic surgery is the standard of care for removal of these lesions. Patients with a history of MAC should be examined at least every 6 months for recurrence, metastasis, and development of additional skin cancers.

### Optical coherence tomography for the characterization of basal cell carcinoma in vivo: a pilot study [^114iW1TX]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Optical coherence tomography combines principles of ultrasonography and optical interferometry to provide real-time cross-sectional images of subsurface microstructure of tissue in vivo.

Objective

The purpose of this pilot study was to define and characterize basal cell carcinoma by using optical coherence tomography.

Methods

Twenty-three patients with 49 lesions clinically suggestive of superficial basal cell carcinoma were recruited. Optical coherence tomography was used to characterize the features of the pearly papules in real time and in vivo. Shave biopsy and light microscopic images were compared with images from optical coherence tomography.

Results

Basal cell carcinoma was identified in 27 patients; all 27 had optical coherence tomographic images for comparison. Seven images were uninterpretable, probably because of technical problems. Of the remainder, 20 sites matched the histologic features seen on light microscopy, with excellent correlation between optical coherence tomographic images and histopathologic features of superficial, nodular, micronodular and infiltrative basal cell carcinomas.

Limitations

This study was limited by the small number of patients examined. Also, as this study was not designed as an intent-to-diagnose study, the actual predictive value of optical coherence tomography technology remains unproven.

Conclusions

Optical coherence tomography technology has potential for the diagnosis and histopathologic characterization of basal cell cancer. Additional studies to determine any practical role for optical coherence tomography are indicated.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) biopsy recommendations — The recommended biopsy techniques for BCC are punch biopsy, shave biopsy, and excisional biopsy. The biopsy technique used will depend on the characteristics of the suspected malignancy (morphology, location, etc) and the judgment of the physician. The biopsy size and depth should be adequate to provide the recommended clinical information and pathology report elements to permit accurate diagnosis and guide therapy. Repeat biopsy may be considered if initial biopsy specimen is inadequate for accurate diagnosis.

### Guidelines of care for the management of basal cell carcinoma [^112exvE1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Basal cell carcinoma research gaps — The expert work group acknowledges that much has yet to be learned regarding the optimal management of patients with BCC, identifying significant gaps that include the use and value of dermoscopy and other imaging modalities in diagnosis and the clinical and prognostic value of biomarkers that may aid in identifying tumors susceptible to targeted systemic therapy. Additional gaps include noninvasive treatment modalities with recurrence rates comparable to surgery and the optimal use of currently available systemic inhibitors of the hedgehog pathway, as well as identification of novel therapies able to achieve high response rates with a more tolerable side effect profile. Because recommendations are occasionally based on consensus rather than high-level evidence, management of BCC should therefore always be tailored to meet individual patients' needs.

### Guidelines of care for the management of basal cell carcinoma [^113bBCeR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) — biopsy technique selection notes that the available literature does not identify a single optimal biopsy technique for suspected BCC; recommended techniques include punch biopsy, shave (eg, by tangential technique) biopsy, and excisional biopsy. Excisional biopsy is distinguished from excision with margins in that the former is intended to determine and/or confirm diagnosis, whereas the latter is intended to remove the tumor. For all techniques, specimen size and depth should be adequate to provide the recommended clinical information and pathology report elements to permit accurate diagnosis and guide therapy, including identification of an aggressive growth pattern if present; repeat biopsy may be considered when the initial specimen is inadequate for accurate diagnosis. Selection of technique depends on clinical characteristics of the suspected tumor and patient-specific factors such as bleeding and wound healing diatheses, and shave biopsies are not necessarily superficial and may penetrate deep into the dermis.

### Clinical and histologic characteristics of clinically unsuspected melanomas [^112f46xc]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Thin melanomas are recognized and captured by clinicians at an alarming rate, whereas thick melanomas remain underrecognized. Improved recognition of thick melanomas will require further understanding of their clinical and histologic characteristics at various stages of development because emerging data suggest that the thin melanomas being captured today may not represent the forerunners of the thick melanomas. In this retrospective analysis, pathology requisition forms from melanomas diagnosed by histopathology were examined for submitted clinical diagnosis, patient characteristics, melanoma thickness, and biopsy method. Three hundred eighty-five melanomas were identified from 2003 to 2011. Most lesions (71.7%) were clinically suspected to be melanocytic. The mean depth in this group was 0.62mm. Of the unsuspected cases (28.3%), the most common submitted diagnoses were basal cell carcinomas and seborrheic keratoses, consistent with previous reports. The mean depth in the unsuspected group was 1.64mm, and more frequently extended to the deep margin (51.8% vs 25.4% of the time). Shave biopsy was the overwhelming preferred method of biopsy (79.5% overall). Compared with thin melanomas, thick melanomas are underrecognized by physicians due to their lack of characteristic morphologic features; consequently, they are more frequently associated with suboptimal biopsies.

### Exfoliative cytology for diagnosing basal cell carcinoma and other skin cancers in adults [^113nw6aR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management, reduce morbidity and improve survival. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised to the skin but has potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue, while cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and melanoma have a much higher potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death. Exfoliative cytology is a non-invasive test that uses the Tzanck smear technique to identify disease by examining the structure of cells obtained from scraped samples. This simple procedure is a less invasive diagnostic test than a skin biopsy, and for BCC it has the potential to provide an immediate diagnosis that avoids an additional clinic visit to receive skin biopsy results. This may benefit patients scheduled for either Mohs micrographic surgery or non-surgical treatments such as radiotherapy. A cytology scrape can never give the same information as a skin biopsy, however, so it is important to better understand in which skin cancer situations it may be helpful.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of exfoliative cytology for detecting basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of standard diagnostic practice (visual inspection with or without dermoscopy). Secondary objectives were: to determine the diagnostic accuracy of exfoliative cytology for detecting cSCC, invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, and any other skin cancer; and for each of these secondary conditions to compare the accuracy of exfoliative cytology with visual inspection with or without dermoscopy in direct test comparisons; and to determine the effect of observer experience.

Search Methods

We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also studied the reference lists of published systematic review articles.

Selection Criteria

Studies evaluating exfoliative cytology in adults with lesions suspicious for BCC, cSCC or melanoma, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS-2). Where possible we estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model.

Main Results

We synthesised the results of nine studies contributing a total of 1655 lesions to our analysis, including 1120 BCCs (14 datasets), 41 cSCCs (amongst 401 lesions in 2 datasets), and 10 melanomas (amongst 200 lesions in 1 dataset). Three of these datasets (one each for BCC, melanoma and any malignant condition) were derived from one study that also performed a direct comparison with dermoscopy. Studies were of moderate to poor quality, providing inadequate descriptions of participant selection, thresholds used to make cytological and histological diagnoses, and blinding. Reporting of participants' prior referral pathways was particularly poor, as were descriptions of the cytodiagnostic criteria used to make diagnoses. No studies evaluated the use of exfoliative cytology as a primary diagnostic test for detecting BCC or other skin cancers in lesions suspicious for skin cancer. Pooled data from seven studies using standard cytomorphological criteria (but various stain methods) to detect BCC in participants with a high clinical suspicion of BCC estimated the sensitivity and specificity of exfoliative cytology as 97.5% (95% CI 94.5% to 98.9%) and 90.1% (95% CI 81.1% to 95.1%). respectively. When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 clinically suspected BCC lesions with a median observed BCC prevalence of 86%, exfoliative cytology would miss 21 BCCs and would lead to 14 false positive diagnoses of BCC. No false positive cases were histologically confirmed to be melanoma. Insufficient data are available to make summary statements regarding the accuracy of exfoliative cytology to detect melanoma or cSCC, or its accuracy compared to dermoscopy.

Authors' Conclusions

The utility of exfoliative cytology for the primary diagnosis of skin cancer is unknown, as all included studies focused on the use of this technique for confirming strongly suspected clinical diagnoses. For the confirmation of BCC in lesions with a high clinical suspicion, there is evidence of high sensitivity and specificity. Since decisions to treat low-risk BCCs are unlikely in practice to require diagnostic confirmation given that clinical suspicion is already high, exfoliative cytology might be most useful for cases of BCC where the treatments being contemplated require a tissue diagnosis (e.g. radiotherapy). The small number of included studies, poor reporting and varying methodological quality prevent us from drawing strong conclusions to guide clinical practice. Despite insufficient data on the use of cytology for cSCC or melanoma, it is unlikely that cytology would be useful in these scenarios since preservation of the architecture of the whole lesion that would be available from a biopsy provides crucial diagnostic information. Given the paucity of good quality data, appropriately designed prospective comparative studies may be required to evaluate both the diagnostic value of exfoliative cytology by comparison to dermoscopy, and its confirmatory value in adequately reported populations with a high probability of BCC scheduled for further treatment requiring a tissue diagnosis.

### Basal cell skin cancer, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111uhjnw]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Basal cell skin cancer — principles of excision reporting state that "The intent of excision is to clear the tumor and thus margin status needs to be reported". For saucerization specimens "intended for definitive surgical therapy should be labeled as such, as they can be histopathologically difficult to distinguish from shave biopsies but must be evaluated for margin status". Excision requisitions should include "patient age and gender, anatomic location, clinical diameter of lesion, and additional clinical information listed above under Principles of Biopsy Reporting". Minimal elements for surgical specimens include "histologic subtype of BCC, a invasion of tumor beyond deep reticular dermis, presence of perineural invasion (if involving nerve below dermis or if largest nerve involved is ≥ 0.1 mm in caliber) and lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and peripheral and deep margin status". For Mohs excisions, "reporting of these elements is also encouraged", and because "Since depth of invasion (in mm) may not be ascertained on tangentially cut Mohs specimens, anatomic level of invasion should be reported". Additionally, "Frozen or permanent section analysis of the clinical tumor specimen may be undertaken if needed for complete reporting of features associated with poor prognosis".

### Obtaining an adequate specimen for the diagnosis of pigmented lesions [^111sNLPf]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Melanoma is a common, potentially deadly disease but is curable if caught early. A specimen of a pigmented lesion must capture the entire width and depth of the lesion to evaluate the lesion's size, symmetry, and circumscription. Saucerization shaving, punching, and excision biopsy are 3 techniques that can be used to achieve a satisfactory specimen. Physicians should have a low threshold to biopsy a suspicious atypical pigmented lesion, but acceptable specimens are key in following through with an accurate diagnosis.

### Biopsy type does not affect the number of stages during mohs micrographic surgery: a retrospective study [^111k8E2f]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is the treatment of choice for high-risk basal cell carcinoma (BCC). However, there are no evidence-based recommendations regarding which biopsy type is more appropriate to obtain tumour samples prior to MMS. Shave or punch biopsies are performed depending on the clinical characteristics of the tumour, surgeon experience and local protocols. However, biopsy type might result in difficult histopathological interpretation and influence the practical implementation of MMS. We performed a retrospective study on 208 consecutive BCCs treated with MMS. Of the 208 BCC biopsies, 42 (20.2%) were obtained by the shave method and 166 (79.8%) via punch. Those obtained with the shave technique had a mean of 1.64 stages vs. 1.69 stages with the punch technique (P = 0.130). These findings suggest biopsy type does not affect Mohs surgery performance. The biopsy type of choice is the one deemed adequate for each specific case to obtain a diagnosis and tumour subtyping.

### Tangential shave removal of basal cell carcinoma [^113qCakv]. Dermatologic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the outcome of tangential shave removal (TS) of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) on the trunk and extremities.

Design

Cohort study of patients with multiple truncal BCC treated using TS in an academic dermatologic surgery practice.

Setting

Academic institution referral practice.

Patients

Individuals with BCC referred to the dermatologic surgery unit for ongoing therapy of multiple lesions.

Interventions

TS of amenable superficial and nodular BCCs with twice-annual follow-up. Lesions were removed using a scalpel as a uniform-depth mid-to-upper dermal shave and sent for routine pathology. Basic wound care was applied.

Primary Outcome Measures

Apparent cure rate and outcome of scars.

Results

One hundred eighty-two BCCs were treated in 19 individuals. Patients were followed for an average of 5.2 years. One lesion recurred. Three specimens had positive margins requiring further surgery. Scarring was acceptable and similar to what is observed with curettage and electrocoagulation.

Conclusions

TS is a reasonable treatment for primary superficial and nodular BCC on the trunk and extremities.

### Accuracy of biopsy sampling for subtyping basal cell carcinoma [^111bVFTz]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a common skin cancer for which the treatment and recurrence risk correlate with the histologic subtype. Limited information is available regarding the accuracy of biopsy in diagnosing BCC subtypes.

Objective

We sought to determine the correlation between BCC subtypes present in a biopsy specimen and the actual subtypes present in a tumor.

Methods

In this retrospective study, skin biopsy specimens and corresponding excisions were reviewed. All histologic subtypes present in the biopsy specimen were reported and compared with the composite BCC subtype present in the biopsy specimen and excision.

Results

A total of 232 biopsy specimens and corresponding wide excisions were examined. The biopsy specimen accuracy rate was 82% for punch and shave biopsy specimens. Mixed histologic subtypes were seen in 54% of the cases, half of which contained an aggressive subtype (infiltrative, morpheaform, or micronodular). There was an 18% discordance rate between the biopsy specimen subtype and the composite subtype. Importantly, 40% of these discordant cases (7% of all cases examined) had an aggressive subtype that was not sampled in the initial biopsy specimen. Furthermore, some cases were misidentified as infiltrative subtype in the biopsy specimen as a result of misinterpretation of surface ulceration and reactive stromal changes.

Limitations

The limited number of punch biopsy specimens and the fact that Mohs excisions were not included are limitations.

Conclusions

Punch and shave biopsy specimens provided adequate sampling for correct BCC subtyping in 82% of the cases examined. However, 18% of the biopsy specimens were misidentified, some of which missed an aggressive component. Thus, there are potential pitfalls in the identification of BCC subtypes in biopsy specimens, which may have important implications in treatment outcome.

### Basal cell skin cancer, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111q6t8w]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Basal cell carcinoma — follow-up and surveillance should include history and physical examination with a complete skin examination every 6 to 12 months for the first 5 years, and then at least annually for life; imaging may be considered if clinical examination is insufficient, and follow-up with a dermatologist is strongly recommended when criteria are met including past or imminent solid organ, marrow, or hematopoietic cell transplant, one or more cutaneous melanomas in the past 5 years, or four or more NMSCs within the past 5 years. Imaging modality and targeted area should be at the discretion of the treating team based on the suspected extent of disease, histologic confirmation is sufficient to diagnose local recurrence but imaging can be considered to assess extent of disease, patients should be educated on sun protection and self-examination, the primary treatment pathway for high-risk BCC should be followed for local recurrence, and for locally advanced, nodal metastases, and distant metastases the appropriate path should be followed with consideration for multidisciplinary discussion and multimodality treatments. Risk of additional tumors is high, with an estimated 30% to 50% developing another BCC within 5 years representing a 10-fold increase versus the general population; patients with a prior BCC are at increased risk of developing SCC and cutaneous melanoma, development of a second BCC is most likely during the short-term follow-up after diagnosis of the first lesion, and therefore close follow-up in both the short- and long-term is critical.

### Merkel cell carcinoma (primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of skin) mimicking basal cell carcinoma with review of different histopathologic features [^1127rmbh]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2014). Low credibility.

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but highly aggressive malignancy, which often has typical histopathologic and immunohistochemical (IHC) features. Sometimes the diagnosis is missed because of atypical histological or aberrant IHC findings. A case of MCC that showed irregular lobules of basaloid cells with keratotic areas on the initial shave biopsy is being reported. IHC showed positive staining for high-molecular weight cytokeratin but negative staining for cytokeratin 20, findings consistent with basal cell carcinoma. Subsequent excision specimen showed histopathologic features more typical of MCC. IHC still was negative for cytokeratin 20 but positive for synaptophysin. Review of the literature shows other examples of MCC with basal cell carcinoma-like features. Various other histopathologic differentiations of MCC include those that demonstrate squamous cell and eccrine carcinoma features and those that show melanocytic, lymphomatous, sarcomatous, muscular, and atypical fibroxanthoma-like features. Different histopathologic patterns and mimics of MCC are reviewed to help prevent dermatopathologists from misdiagnosing this aggressive tumor.

### Biopsy outperforms reflectance confocal microscopy in diagnosing and subtyping basal cell carcinoma: results and experiences from a randomized controlled multicentre trial [^114VtABm]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Index test: punch biopsy

Patients allocated to the PB group received standard diagnostic care: a 3‐mm PB taken from the clinically most suspected area after local anaesthesia with 1% Xylocaine/adrenaline. PBs were paraffin embedded after at least 4 h of formaldehyde fixation. Paraffin sections (6 μm) were processed and stained with haematoxylin and eosin by a standard protocol. Histopathological classification of BCC was performed by experienced pathologists according to Dutch guidelines. 18

Reference test: excision

Conventional surgical excision was performed according to the current Dutch recommendations, 18 with a 3–5‐mm margin for low‐ and high‐risk BCC, respectively. Excision specimens were processed using the standard protocol: tumours were inspected and measured by a technician by the naked eye and excision margins were inked. The specimen was then bread‐loaf cut every 3 mm, followed by paraffin embedding, processing of paraffin sections (6 μm) and haematoxylin and eosin staining. Histopathological classification was performed as for biopsies.

Reference test: follow‐up

For patients not diagnosed with a BCC, regular clinical follow‐up was used as reference test, in line with the recent Cochrane review (Figure 1). 13 The diagnosis of 'no BCC' was classified as correct in cases where no reported signs for BCC in the treated area developed during follow‐up. In cases where an alternative diagnosis was made by PB (e.g. squamous cell carcinoma), the patient was treated when indicated and followed up.

Statistical analysis

For each group baseline characteristics were summarized for descriptive statistics.

For all sensitivity and specificity estimates, cross‐tables were used and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the exact binomial calculation. Comparison between diagnostic groups was compared using two‐tailed unconditional exact tests (α = 0.05). Imputation of missing observations was not performed. All analyses were performed on a complete case basis, with completeness being restricted to the variables needed for any specific analysis. Patients without a reference test (e.g. did not undergo a conventional surgical excision after BCC diagnosis) were excluded from the diagnostic accuracy analysis. Data preparation was performed in SPSS (version 25; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA), tests and calculations of CIs were performed using the Exact library (version 2.0) in R (version 3.6·1).

### Margin status in shave biopsies of nonmelanoma skin cancers: is It worth reporting? [^115CPkzE]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Context

-The practice of reporting margin status in biopsies is relatively unique to biopsies of the skin and highly variable among pathologists.

Objective

-To address the accuracy of margin evaluation in shave biopsies of nonmelanoma skin cancers.

Design

-We collected shave biopsies of squamous and basal cell carcinomas that appeared to have uninvolved margins on routine sign out. We obtained deeper levels on corresponding tissue blocks until blocks were exhausted and examined them for tumor at biopsy margins.

Results

-Forty-seven consecutive cases were collected, including 20 squamous cell (43%) and 27 basal cell (57%) carcinomas. Eleven of 47 cases (23%) with negative margins at initial diagnosis demonstrated positive margins upon deeper-level examination. Margins of 8 of 27 basal cell carcinomas (30%) and 3 of 20 squamous cell carcinomas (15%) were erroneously classified as "negative" on routine examination.

Conclusions

-No guidelines exist regarding the reporting of margins in nonmelanoma skin cancer biopsies, and reporting practices vary extensively among pathologists. We found that nearly one-quarter of positive margins in shave biopsies for cutaneous carcinomas are missed on standard histologic examination. Moreover, reporting of a positive margin may also be misleading if the clinician has definitively treated the skin cancer at the time of biopsy. For these reasons, and as routine exhaustion of all tissue blocks is impractical, the decision to include or exclude a comment regarding the margin status should be given conscious consideration, accounting for the clinical intent of the biopsy and any known information regarding postbiopsy treatment.

### Traditional versus streamlined management of basal cell carcinoma (BCC): a cost analysis [^116VAghG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Facing rising incidence of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and increasing pressure to contain health care spending, physicians need to contemplate cost-effective paradigms for managing BCC.

Objective

We sought to perform a cost analysis comparing the traditional BCC management scheme with a simplified detect-and-treat scheme that eliminates the biopsy before initiating definitive treatment.

Methods

A decision analytic model was developed to compare the costs of traditional BCC management with the detect-and-treat scheme, under which qualifying lesions diagnosed clinically were either treated with shave removal or referred to Mohs micrographic surgery for on-site histologic check. Values for model parameters were based on literature and our institutional data analysis. Costs were based on 2014 Medicare fee schedule.

Results

The average cost per lesion with detect-and-treat scheme was $449 for non-Mohs micrographic surgery-indicated lesions (vs $566 with traditional management, $117 in savings) and $819 for Mohs micrographic surgery-indicated lesions (vs $864 with traditional management, $45 in savings). The combined weighted average savings per case was $95 (15% of total average cost). Conclusions were similar under various plausible scenarios.

Limitations

Model parameter values may vary based on individual practices.

Conclusions

A simplified management strategy eliminating routine pretreatment biopsy can reduce BCC treatment cost without compromising quality of care.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) biopsy approach emphasizes that studies using subsequent definitive excision as the reference standard found initial punch or shave biopsies were able to detect the most aggressive histologic subtypes of BCC in the vast majority of cases, but when recurrent tumor, deep invasion, or other aggressive features are suspected, more extensive tissue resection or multiple scouting biopsies may in certain cases be needed if more superficial methods are insufficient; the need to obtain information through biopsy is counterbalanced by patient preference and physician judgment to minimize biopsy-associated discomfort, trauma, risk for wound infection or dehiscence, scar, and loss of function, particularly on the head, neck, and other vital, functional, sensory, or cosmetically sensitive sites.

### Cystic basal cell carcinoma or hidrocytoma? The use of an excisional biopsy in a histopathologically challenging case [^115q3FKt]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2004). Low credibility.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has many histologic variants. These variants may show differentiation toward benign and malignant tumors of cutaneous appendages, especially hair follicles. Herein we describe a lesion that was clinically thought to be a BCC, but a superficial biopsy showed histologic features suggestive of an apocrine hidrocystoma. Because of some cytologic atypia, complete excision was recommended. The excision specimen revealed a cystic BCC. The importance of examining the entire neoplasm before reaching a final pathologic diagnosis is emphasized.

Suspected BCC — clinical information to accompany specimens and recommended pathology report elements are specified as follows: Clinical information provided to the pathologist is strongly recommended to include age, sex, anatomic location, and whether the lesion is recurrent; recommended items include size of lesion, immunosuppression, and history (especially radiation burn, organ transplant). Elements to be included in the final pathology report for excision specimens are recommended to include histologic subtype, invasion beyond reticular dermis, and perineural involvement. When submitting biopsy tissue for histopathologic diagnosis, the work group recommends that wherever possible and appropriate, key elements of patient demographics, clinical presentation, and clinical history should be provided to the pathologist. Pathologic evaluation of skin biopsy specimens is ideally performed by a dermatologist or pathologist who is experienced in interpreting cutaneous neoplasms.

### Basal cell skin cancer, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116poSa1]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Clinical presentation and workup of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) — On clinical presentation of a lesion suspicious for skin cancer, workup for BCC begins with a history and physical examination, biopsy, and if applicable a shave removal. A skin biopsy is then performed on any suspicious lesion, and the biopsy should include deep reticular dermis because infiltrative histology may be present only at deeper, advancing margins and superficial biopsies will frequently miss this component. After BCC diagnosis, a full skin examination is recommended since individuals with skin cancer often have additional, concurrent precancers or cancers at other sun-exposed sites and are also at increased risk of developing cutaneous melanoma.

### Diagnosis and treatment of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma [^112wDeVf]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Family physicians are regularly faced with identifying, treating, and counseling patients with skin cancers. Nonmelanoma skin cancer, which encompasses basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma, is the most common cancer in the United States. Ultraviolet B exposure is a significant factor in the development of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma. The use of tanning beds is associated with a 1.5-fold increase in the risk of basal cell carcinoma and a 2.5-fold increase in the risk of squamous cell carcinoma. Routine screening for skin cancer is controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force cites insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine whole-body skin examination to screen for skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma most commonly appears as a pearly white, dome-shaped papule with prominent telangiectatic surface vessels. Squamous cell carcinoma most commonly appears as a firm, smooth, or hyperkeratotic papule or plaque, often with central ulceration. Initial tissue sampling for diagnosis involves a shave technique if the lesion is raised, or a 2- to 4-mm punch biopsy of the most abnormal-appearing area of skin. Mohs micrographic surgery has the lowest recurrence rate among treatments, but is best considered for large, high-risk tumors. Smaller, lower-risk tumors may be treated with surgical excision, electrodesiccation and curettage, or cryotherapy. Topical imiquimod and fluorouracil are also potential, but less supported, treatments. Although there are no clear guidelines for follow-up after an index nonmelanoma skin cancer, monitoring for recurrence is prudent because the risk of subsequent skin cancer is 35 percent at three years and 50 percent at five years.

Basal cell skin cancer — principles of biopsy reporting specify that "The intent of a biopsy is for diagnosis, not to assess the margin status". Pathologic evaluation "is ideally performed by a dermatologist, pathologist, dermatopathologist, or Mohs surgeon who is experienced in interpreting cutaneous neoplasms". Biopsy requisitions should include "patient age and gender, clinical diameter of lesion, anatomic location, and prior treatment of lesion", with "immunosuppression and history of RT". The pathologic report "should include histologic subtypea and presence and extent of any features that would increase the risk for local recurrence", including "invasion of tumor beyond reticular dermis and presence/caliber of perineural invasion". Footnote definitions note low-risk subtypes "include nodular, superficial, and other non-aggressive growth patterns such as keratotic, infundibulocystic, and fibroepithelioma of Pinkus"; and high-risk subtypes "include basosquamous, infiltrative, sclerosing/morpheaform, micronodular, and BCC with sarcomatoid differentiation".

### Guidelines of care for the management of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [^111B6xur]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Biopsy for suspected cSCC — The available literature does not identify a single optimal biopsy technique, and recommended techniques include punch biopsy, shave (eg, by tangential technique) biopsy, and excisional biopsy. Excisional biopsy is distinguished from excision with margins in that the intent of the former is to determine and/or confirm diagnosis, whereas the intent of the latter is to remove the tumor. For all techniques, the biopsy specimen size and depth should be adequate to provide the recommended clinical information and pathology report elements to permit accurate diagnosis and guide therapy, including by identifying an aggressive growth pattern if present. Repeat biopsy may be considered if the initial biopsy specimen is inadequate for accurate diagnosis. Selection of the specific biopsy technique is contingent on the clinical characteristics of the suspected tumor, including morphology, expected histologic subtype and depth, natural history, and anatomic location; patient-specific factors, such as bleeding and wound healing diatheses; and patient preference and physician judgment.

Sample size

Based on an extensive local database of previously collected cases (n > 200), we assumed a percentage of correctly identified BCC subtypes of 71% using PB and 85% using RCM, when compared with conventional surgical excision as the gold standard in this study. Consequently, 148 patients were needed per group to obtain a power of 80% (Fisher's exact, two‐sided, α = 0.05). In addition, it was expected that 10% of patients in whom a physician had a clinical suspicion of BCC would not have a histopathologically confirmed BCC. Therefore, the initial goal was to include 329 patients with a clinical suspicion of primary BCC. More details of the initial sample size calculation can be found in the previously published study protocol. 14

Owing to the limited progress of the study, mainly caused by technical problems with the RCM after 288 patients, the continuation of the study would only be possible with major changes in the staffing of the study team. Before taking such a major decision it was decided to analyse whether the 41 remaining patients to be included would have an impact on the primary outcome. For specificity, a clear statistically significant difference had already been found (P < 0.001), while the high levels of sensitivity (99% for both methods) precluded the possibility of finding any difference. This premature end of inclusion was authorized by the medical ethical committee that approved the study (CMO Regio Arnhem–Nijmegen)

### Multiple basal cell carcinomas in a young adult treated with imiquimod 5%: a case report and literature review [^112JD15d]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

We present a case of basal cell carcinoma that is unique in the literature with regard to the rare combination of age of onset and number of BCCs at initial presentation that was successfully treated with imiquimod 5%. The patient is a 28-year-old Caucasian man with no past medical or dermatological history. Physical exam was remarkable for seven pink translucent skin lesions on the forehead, alar ridge, zygoma, and upper back. There were no signs or symptoms of a syndrome or disease entity known to cause BCC. Shave biopsies revealed basal cell carcinoma in all 7 lesions. The patient was successfully treated with topical imiquimod 5% 6 days per week for 6 weeks. The presentation of this number of de novo BCCs in a patient this young in absence of a known BCC syndrome has, to the best of our knowledge, not previously been reported in the literature and was successfully treated with imiquimod 5%.

### Diagnosis and management of uncommon cutaneous cancers [^114V7Jeu]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Uncommon types of cutaneous cancers are mainly cited in the literature as case reports and their etiology, pathogenesis and prognosis have to be surmised because of their rarity. Within this group exist the rare and also the unusual, for instance a relatively common carcinoma arising in a strange circumstance. Initial management of such tumors involves taking a history and performing a thorough examination, allowing a diagnosis to be made. These tend to follow one of three patterns: the lesion is confidently recognized; the lesion is unknown but a likely diagnosis can be made and; the lesion is unknown. It is within the latter two groupings that the uncommon cutaneous cancers exist. A biopsy is then performed to confirm the diagnosis. For large lesions a punch or incisional biopsy is taken which must include a portion of normal skin at the lesion edge. If the lesion is small enough to allow direct closure, an excision biopsy is performed, with a minimum margin of 2mm. Shave biopsy can be employed to confirm a diagnosis, but care must be taken that the subsequent management of the lesion is not adversely affected. With the rare tumors diagnosis can be difficult and there may not be enough tissue in a biopsy for a definitive diagnosis. The whole lesion may therefore need to be excised to obtain a confident diagnosis with further surgical treatment planned as required. Once the diagnosis is established a decision on the method of treatment can be made. The limited literature would suggest that rare skin tumors are unresponsive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, so the mainstay of treatment is surgery. When there are no established guidelines for the treatment of a particular rare tumor a pathologist can usually provide advice as to the probable nature of the lesion. This allows surgical treatment to be positioned into one of three main groups: lesions that behave like basal cell carcinomas (BCC); lesions that behave like squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and; lesions that behave like soft tissue sarcomas (STS). It is helpful to have a management plan into which each variety of rare tumor can be fitted, giving guidance as to the best and most appropriate management. Grouping treatment into BCC, SCC or STS-like treatment has been useful. As more becomes known regarding these malignancies their subsequent management can be adjusted accordingly. Currently, it would appear wise to treat each under a broader subgroup.

### Breast carcinoma masquerading as basal cell carcinoma of the nipple [^116EfnQp]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

A broad differential diagnosis exists for dermatologic disease of the NAC. This differential diagnosis includes inflammatory conditions, such as dermatitis (nipple eczema) and lichen simplex chronicus; benign neoplasms, such as nipple adenoma; and malignant neoplasms, including nonmelanoma skin cancer, Paget's disease, breast carcinoma, and metastatic disease.

BCC of the NAC is a rare but increasingly common condition most often identified in men with excessive sun exposure of the trunk. The initial misdiagnosis of BCC may have been a result of the small size of the shave sampling and the choice of a shave rather than a punch biopsy. Although the expression of Ber-EP4 was thought to mitigate in favor of BCC, this monoclonal antibody actually marks a variety of neoplastic processes. In fact, the Ber-EP4 immunostain was developed from a breast cancer cell line, and the stain will mark not only BCC, but also other cutaneous malignancies, some breast carcinomas, and some gastrointestinal carcinomas.

The presence of nipple discharge in this patient should likely have also brought the assessment of BCC into question. Although discharge has been reported in BCC of the nipple, it is not present in most cases. Nipple discharge with negative imaging findings poses a significant diagnostic problem for clinicians. Benign nipple discharge is most often bilateral, nonbloody, and nonspontaneous. On the contrary, pathologic nipple discharge, as seen in this patient, is most often unilateral, bloody, and spontaneous. Recent studies indicate that up to 25% of patients with pathologic nipple discharge will have underlying breast cancer. For patients with breast cancer presenting with only pathologic nipple discharge, mammography is of limited sensitivity (10% to 57%).

When performing MMS, physicians must approach all histology specimens with a critical eye for the unexpected. Reviewing biopsy specimens before MMS resulted in an altered diagnosis in 2% of the cases in one study. Mohs surgeons treating cutaneous neoplasms of the NAC should be aware that breast carcinoma can mimic a BCC. In this case, careful histologic assessment of the frozen sections during MMS allowed for identification of potential misdiagnosis, for transition to an improved biopsy technique, and, ultimately, for timely and appropriate management of the patient's breast carcinoma.

### Guidelines of care for the management of basal cell carcinoma [^114RwiyV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) guideline scope and evidence framework — This guideline addresses the management of patients with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) from the perspective of a US dermatologist, with the main focus on the most commonly considered and utilized approaches for the surgical and medical treatment of primary BCC, and it also includes recommendations on the treatment of recurrent tumors when applicable, appropriate biopsy techniques, staging, follow-up, and prevention of BCC; a detailed discussion of specific chemotherapeutic or radiotherapeutic approaches for distant metastatic BCC falls outside the scope, though general recommendations on the management of patients with advanced or metastatic BCC are included to facilitate consultation with specialists. An expert work group was convened to determine the audience and scope and to identify key questions, and an evidence-based approach used systematic searches of PubMed and the Cochrane Library from January 1960 through April 2015, with a secondary search from April 2015 to August 2016, prospectively limited to the English language. The clinical questions used to structure the evidence review addressed grading systems, biopsy techniques, and pathology report content for BCC and cSCC, the benefits, harm, and effectiveness/efficacy of available treatments across surgical treatment, topical therapy, and energy devices, effective treatment options for advanced BCC and cSCC, and methods for follow-up and prevention of recurrence and new primary keratinocyte cancer formation.

Surgical treatment for BCC — A broad range of therapeutic modalities is available, and when appropriately selected, a practitioner is able to achieve outstanding results. For example, C&E of a small, superficial BCC on the back may have an equally high cure rate as MMS for an infiltrative BCC on the nose. When the most appropriate therapy is being chosen, recurrence rate, preservation of function, patient expectations, and potential adverse effects must be taken into thorough consideration. When studies evaluating efficacy are reviewed, critical attention must be paid to the length of follow-up because, due to the slow growth rate of BCC, recurrences are frequently diagnosed beyond 5 years following definitive treatment.

Specimens from intended complete surgical removal (eg, shave excisions) should be labeled as such so that margin status is reported. Since depth of invasion (in mm) may not be ascertained on tangentially cut Mohs specimens, anatomic level of invasion should be reported. Frozen or permanent section analysis of the clinical tumor specimen may be undertaken if needed for complete reporting of the features below to enable AJCC tumor staging. Immunohistochemistry may be utilized as needed to help identify lymphovascular or nerve invasion, or to identify single tumor cells or small aggregates.

### Nonpersistence of basal cell carcinoma after diagnostic shave biopsy: reconstruction when specimen is negative during surgery [^116ZqPD6]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Initial tissue sampling for diagnosis of suspected basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is typically performed using a shave biopsy technique or punch biopsy.

Methods

Our realization of no residual BCC findings after excision in some patients with biopsy-proven BCC diagnosed through a shave biopsy prompted us to conduct a retrospective study of all consecutive patients with 127 BCCs who were treated in our department between 2006 and 2012. All patients with incompletely excised BCCs after shave biopsy diagnosis were operated on by a single surgeon (R.G.), eliminating variables in preoperative evaluation and surgical technique including margin control and reconstructive approach. Patient demographics, initial BCC site, size, subtype, duration between shave biopsy and surgery, size of excision, findings of intraoperative frozen section analysis, type of closure technique, and final pathology reports were analyzed.

Results

There were 108 residual BCCs diagnosed after surgical excision. Most of the108 BCCs were nodular (52) or micronodular (21) subtype. Eighteen BCCs were treated with excision and primary closure. Flap procedure was performed in 64 BCCs after excision. Twenty-six defects after excision were reconstructed using skin grafts. There was no evidence of residual BCC in 15% of BCCs (19 patients) after surgical treatment. In other words, shave biopsy was found to be curative in 15% of BCCs. Seven patients in no residual BCC group received excision and primary closure. Eleven patients underwent flap reconstruction, whereas only 1 patient required skin grafting. Most of the patients in this group had nodular or micronodular type BCC (14/19).

Conclusions

We were not able to identify any clinically significant predictors of residual versus no residual BCC, at least within the context of the current study. Although most patients diagnosed with BCC had residual tumors for which they received surgical treatment, 15% of patients had to undergo primary closure, skin graft, or flap procedure for negative residual BCC. We would like to promote greater awareness on the subject among plastic surgeons treating BCCs. And, it is extremely important that the informed consent should include statements regarding possible reconstructive procedures even in the case of nonpersistent tumor from medicolegal standpoint.

Risk stratification and imaging for local basal cell carcinoma (BCC) based on risk factors for recurrence — After the complete skin examination, a risk assessment should be performed to determine the treatment plan. Any high-risk factor places the skin lesion in the high-risk category and imaging should be considered if a clinical exam is insufficient to determine disease extent, and a low threshold for performing skin biopsies in these patients is necessary. For locally advanced disease, which is defined as primary or recurrent extensive disease where surgery and/or radiation therapy (RT) may not result in a cure or would potentially yield a significant functional limitation, patients should consider imaging to determine disease extent. If perineural disease is suspected, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with or without contrast is preferred, whereas if bone disease is suspected, computed tomography (CT) with contrast is preferred unless contraindicated. Imaging modality and targeted area should be at the discretion of the treating team based on the suspected extent of disease (local, regional, metastatic). Histologic confirmation is sufficient to diagnose local recurrence, but MRI can be considered to assess extent of local disease; for nodal or distant metastases, histologic analysis and/or CT imaging can be used for confirmation and to gauge the extent of disease.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma - NCCN, more specifically with respect to histopathology, NCCN 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain pathologic evaluation of skin biopsies by a dermatologist, pathologist, or dermatopathologist experienced in interpreting cutaneous neoplasms. Reporting of margins and the elements below is not required for biopsy specimens.

### Guidelines of care for the management of basal cell carcinoma [^115fAzLE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of human cancer, with a continually increasing annual incidence in the United States. When diagnosed early, the majority of BCCs are readily treated with office-based therapy, which is highly curative. In these evidence-based guidelines of care, we provide recommendations for the management of patients with BCC, as well as an in-depth review of the best available literature in support of these recommendations. We discuss biopsy techniques for a clinically suspicious lesion and offer recommendations for the histopathologic interpretation of BCC. In the absence of a formal staging system, the best available stratification based on risk for recurrence is reviewed. With regard to treatment, we provide recommendations on treatment modalities along a broad therapeutic spectrum, ranging from topical agents and superficially destructive modalities to surgical techniques and systemic therapy. Finally, we review the available literature and provide recommendations on prevention and the most appropriate follow-up for patients in whom BCC has been diagnosed.

Regarding surgical interventions for basal cell carcinoma, more specifically with respect to surgical excision, BAD 2021 guidelines recommend to perform standard surgical excision with delayed definitive reconstruction or Mohs micrographic surgery as a first-line treatment option in adult patients with high risk BCC within a high-risk anatomical site, if the BCC has poorly defined clinical margins under bright lighting and magnification or dermoscopy.

### Skin cancers of the hand and upper extremity [^116bsdFL]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Skin cancers represent the most common primary malignancies of the hand. They typically present as painless lesions on areas of high sun exposure, such as the dorsum of the hand and upper extremity. The most common malignancy is squamous cell carcinoma, followed by basal cell carcinoma and melanoma. The key to successful treatment is early and accurate diagnosis and treatment. Unlike open biopsies, which are indicated for deep soft tissue and bone lesions, biopsies for skin cancer can be performed under local anesthesia in the office setting in the form of shave or punch biopsies. A number of nonsurgical treatment options are available for treatment. However, when surgical excision is indicated, appropriate margin resections are dictated by the grade and stage of the malignancy.

### Negative predictive value of biopsy margins in keratinocyte carcinoma: a literature review [^112xk6jH]. Dermatologic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pathologists sometimes include commentary on margin involvement in shave biopsy reports of keratinocyte carcinoma (KC). This practice can lead to confusion regarding the need for further treatment. There is limited literature evaluating the reliability of reported histologic margin status in shave biopsies of KC.

Objective

To evaluate the negative predictive value (NPV) of reported clear shave biopsy margins in basal and squamous cell carcinomas to determine whether this assessment is a reliable predictor of complete tumor removal.

Methods

A literature review was performed using the PubMed database. The data were compiled, NPVs were calculated by the tumor subgroup, and a statistical analysis was performed.

Results

Four studies met inclusion criteria. Two hundred twenty-one KCs were identified (n = 221). All specimens had negative-reported histologic margins (39 squamous cell carcinoma [SCC] and 182 BCC). Fifty-five cases initially noted to have negative margins on biopsy were found to have residual tumor on subsequent analysis: 5 SCC and 50 BCC, translating to 12.8% of all SCC (5/39) and 27.5% for BCC (50/182). Negative predictive values were found to be 75.1% for all KCs, 87.2% for SCC, and 72.5% for BCC.

Conclusion

Negative histologic margin status on shave biopsy specimens of KC has a poor NPV and is an inadequate predictor for complete tumor removal.
