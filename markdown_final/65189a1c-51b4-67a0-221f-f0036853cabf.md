## Question

Is calcium supplements ok with uretral stones

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether calcium supplements are okay to use in someone with ureteral stones. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the stone composition and whether this is a calcium oxalate stone, since that determines risk with calcium intake. Then, I should verify the difference between dietary calcium and supplemental calcium and how timing matters. Next, I will review guideline positions and the highest-quality evidence on calcium supplementation and stone risk. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like enteric hyperoxaluria and combined vitamin D plus calcium. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: ureteral stones are usually calcium oxalate, and the key question is whether supplemental calcium increases urinary calcium and promotes recurrence, whereas dietary calcium taken with meals can bind oxalate in the gut and reduce oxalate absorption, which is protective. I should confirm that this mechanistic distinction is supported by guidelines and trials before drawing conclusions [^fc14bcc3] [^c1b271ba].

> Wait, let me verify the difference between dietary and supplemental calcium. The AUA advises maintaining normal dietary calcium intake of about 1,000–1,200 mg/day and explicitly notes that supplemental calcium may be associated with increased stone formation, whereas observational data suggest older women using calcium supplements have about a 20% higher stone risk. This aligns with the concept that isolated calcium pills can raise urinary calcium without the oxalate-binding benefit of mealtime calcium from food [^fc14bcc3] [^c1b271ba].

> I need to check the highest-quality evidence on supplementation. The WHI randomized trial of 1,000 mg calcium plus 400 IU vitamin D daily in postmenopausal women showed a statistically significant 17% increase in urinary tract stones, and a USPSTF evidence review confirmed a small but consistent increase in kidney stones with combined vitamin D and calcium, whereas calcium alone in smaller RCTs did not show a significant increase. This supports avoiding combined vitamin D plus calcium in patients with stone risk, and being cautious even with calcium alone [^f9197e1f] [^222d7e82] [^2161a917].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about calcium alone. Meta-analytic data are mixed: observational studies link supplemental calcium to higher stone risk, but pooled RCTs of calcium alone generally show no significant increase, suggesting confounding by diet and population in observational designs. Still, given biologic plausibility and guideline caution, I should recommend prioritizing dietary calcium and, if supplements are needed, using them with meals and keeping total intake within 1,000–1,200 mg/day [^87fef0be] [^5742689c] [^fc14bcc3].

> I should confirm timing matters. Taking calcium carbonate with meals reduces oxalate absorption and does not increase the calcium oxalate activity product, whereas bedtime dosing increases urinary calcium without reducing oxalate, raising stone risk. This is why guidelines and studies emphasize taking any required calcium supplement with meals, not apart from food [^08b817a7] [^93f2b340].

> But wait, what if the patient has enteric hyperoxaluria or malabsorption. In that specific phenotype, calcium citrate or elemental calcium taken with meals is actually recommended to bind oxalate in the gut and reduce urinary oxalate, so in that narrow context, supervised calcium supplementation is beneficial rather than harmful. I should double-check that both EAU and CUA endorse this approach, which they do [^edb5b71d] [^63dba5e6].

> Let me consider combined vitamin D plus calcium more carefully. Multiple high-quality sources converge on a small but real increase in kidney stones with combined supplementation, so in patients with a history of stones, I should avoid routine combined vitamin D and calcium pills and, if vitamin D is indicated for deficiency, pair it with careful dietary calcium and monitoring rather than a calcium pill [^f9197e1f] [^222d7e82] [^2161a917].

> I should confirm practical guardrails. Total calcium intake should stay within 1,000–1,200 mg/day, supplements should be minimized and, if needed, limited to about 500–600 mg/day in divided doses with meals, and patients should maintain high fluid intake, moderate sodium, and normal dietary calcium from food. If supplements are used, calcium citrate is reasonable because it can be taken with or without food, though taking it with meals still helps oxalate binding [^fc14bcc3] [^93f2b340] [^9666b4e3].

> Next, I should review monitoring. For recurrent stone formers or those starting calcium for bone health, a 24-hour urine for stone risk factors about 6 months after any diet or supplement change is prudent to ensure urinary calcium and other lithogenic risks are not worsening, aligning with AUA follow-up guidance [^027f59f2] [^6fe27968].

> Putting this together, I should be explicit: calcium supplements are not categorically contraindicated with ureteral stones, but they should be used cautiously, preferentially as calcium citrate with meals, and generally limited to patients who cannot meet calcium needs from diet, with total intake kept within 1,000–1,200 mg/day. Combined vitamin D plus calcium should be avoided in stone formers when possible, and patients with enteric hyperoxaluria are a notable exception where mealtime calcium is therapeutic [^fc14bcc3] [^93f2b340] [^edb5b71d] [^222d7e82].

Calcium supplements are **generally not recommended** for patients with ureteral stones because they can increase urinary calcium and promote stone formation [^fc14bcc3]. If calcium is needed for bone health, **take it with meals** to bind oxalate and reduce stone risk [^93f2b340] [^08b817a7], and keep total daily calcium intake ≤ 1,200 mg [^fc14bcc3]. Avoid high-dose calcium supplements, especially with vitamin D, and prioritize dietary calcium [^222d7e82] [^c59aab55]. Always consult a healthcare provider before starting or changing calcium supplements.

## Relationship between calcium supplements and ureteral stones

Calcium stones are the **most common type** of ureteral stones, typically calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate [^b5a2f723]. Calcium supplements can increase urinary calcium excretion, raising the risk of calcium stone formation [^fc14bcc3]. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) found that combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation increased the risk of kidney stones by 17% (hazard ratio 1.17, 95% CI 1.02–1.34) [^f9197e1f] [^417b0677]. Similarly, the USPSTF concluded that calcium and vitamin D supplementation increases kidney stone incidence, albeit modestly [^222d7e82] [^2161a917].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines advise **caution** with calcium supplements in patients with a history of ureteral stones:

- **AUA guidelines**: Maintain normal dietary calcium intake (1,000–1,200 mg/day) and avoid excessive calcium supplementation, as it may increase stone risk [^fc14bcc3] [^c1b271ba].
- **CUA guidelines**: If calcium supplements are required, take them with meals to bind dietary oxalate and reduce absorption [^93f2b340] [^08b817a7].
- **EAU guidelines**: In enteric hyperoxaluria, calcium supplements with meals are recommended to reduce oxalate absorption [^edb5b71d] [^63dba5e6].

---

## Risks associated with calcium supplementation

Calcium supplementation carries several **risks** for patients with ureteral stones:

- **Increased urinary calcium**: Excess calcium is excreted, increasing supersaturation and stone risk [^fc14bcc3].
- **Hypercalciuria**: Chronic hypercalciuria promotes calcium stone formation [^notfound].
- **Interaction with vitamin D**: Combined calcium and vitamin D can further increase urinary calcium and stone risk [^222d7e82] [^172497e3].

---

## Circumstances where calcium supplementation may be appropriate

In select situations, **calcium supplementation may be appropriate** with caution:

- **Enteric hyperoxaluria**: Calcium with meals binds oxalate and reduces urinary oxalate [^edb5b71d] [^63dba5e6].
- **Low dietary calcium**: If dietary intake is inadequate, supplements may be used with meals and close monitoring [^fc14bcc3] [^93f2b340].
- **Bone health**: For osteoporosis, use the lowest effective dose with meals and monitor urinary calcium [^fc14bcc3] [^027f59f2].

---

## Alternative strategies for calcium intake

To minimize stone risk, **prioritize dietary calcium** and use these strategies:

- **Dietary calcium**: Aim for 1,000–1,200 mg/day from food, as it binds oxalate and reduces stone risk [^fc14bcc3] [^c1b271ba].
- **Calcium citrate**: Preferred if supplementation is needed, as it can be taken with or without food and may reduce stone risk [^9666b4e3].
- **Avoid high-dose supplements**: Limit supplemental calcium to ≤ 500–600 mg/day and avoid high-dose vitamin D with calcium [^fc14bcc3] [^222d7e82].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Patients taking calcium supplements should have **regular monitoring**:

- **24-hour urine testing**: Monitor calcium, oxalate, and citrate to assess stone risk [^027f59f2] [^6fe27968].
- **Serum calcium**: Check periodically to detect hypercalcemia [^b653cc8c].
- **Imaging**: Consider periodic imaging if stone risk is high or symptoms recur [^b653cc8c].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Calcium supplements are **generally not recommended** for patients with ureteral stones due to increased urinary calcium and stone risk [^fc14bcc3]. If calcium is needed, take it with meals, limit total intake to ≤ 1,200 mg/day, and avoid high-dose vitamin D combinations [^93f2b340] [^fc14bcc3] [^222d7e82]. Prioritize dietary calcium and monitor urinary calcium and stone risk with a healthcare provider [^c59aab55] [^027f59f2].

### Ascorbic acid supplements and kidney stone incidence among men: a prospective study… [^341d3867]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Urinary oxalate is an important determinant of calcium oxalate kidney stone formation. 1 Vitamin C is excreted in urine both in its unmetabolized form and as oxalate; however, there remains considerable uncertainty over the kidney stone risk that may be associated with ascorbic acid supplement use.
2. We examined whether ascorbic acid supplements were associated with kidney stones in a population-based, prospective cohort of men. During 11 years of follow-up we ascertained 436 first incident cases of kidney stones. Ascorbic acid use was associated with a statistically significant 2-fold increased risk. In contrast, multivitamin use was not associated with kidney stone risk. The strengths of this study include the large population-based prospective cohort design, validated exposure data, and virtually complete follow-up of the study population through linkage to high-quality registers.

Furthermore, analysis of kidney stone material collected from 3176 men, treated with extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy in Stockholm County, found calcium oxalate to be the dominant component in 92. 6%. It could thus be assumed that at least 90% of the kidney stones in our study population were composed primarily of calcium oxalate.
5. The rate difference was 147 of 100 000 for first incident cases; however, the recurrent nature of kidney stones implies that the absolute risk increase, for this modifiable risk factor, is potentially higher. Our findings need to be confirmed by other studies but may have important implications for the clinical advice given to kidney stone formers. Currently there are no well-documented benefits of high-dose ascorbic acid supplement use, 7 and, therefore, it seems prudent to advise that high-dose preparations be avoided, particularly by those with a history of kidney stones.

In conclusion, our results indicate that high-dose ascorbic acid supplements — one of the most commonly used vitamin preparations — are associated with a dose-dependent 2-fold increased risk of kidney stone formation among men.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^b653cc8c]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA medical management of kidney stones guideline — screening evaluation in newly diagnosed kidney or ureteral stones states: A clinician should perform a screening evaluation consisting of a detailed medical and dietary history, serum chemistries and urinalysis on a patient newly diagnosed with kidney or ureteral stones (Clinical Principle). A detailed history should elicit from the patient any medical conditions, dietary habits or medications that predispose to stone disease; nutritional factors associated with stone disease include calcium intake below or significantly above the recommended dietary allowance, low fluid intake, high sodium intake, limited intake of fruits and vegetables and high intake of animal-derived purines; and patients should be queried regarding their regular use of any stone-provoking medications or supplements. Dietary history should elicit from the patient their average daily intake of fluids (amount and specific beverages), protein (types and amounts), calcium, sodium, high oxalate-containing foods, fruits and vegetables and over-the-counter supplements. Serum chemistries should include electrolytes, calcium, creatinine and uric acid that may suggest underlying medical conditions associated with stone disease. Urinalysis should include both dipstick and microscopic evaluation to assess urine pH and indicators of infection and to identify crystals pathognomonic of stone type, and urine culture should be obtained in patients with a urinalysis suggestive of urinary tract infection or in patients with recurrent UTIs.

### Calcium supplements: do they help or harm? [^5c082077]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

Current recommendations for calcium intake call for 1,000 mg per day for women ages 19–50 and 1,200 mg per day for women over age 50 to ensure bone health. Given recent concerns that calcium supplements may raise risk for cardiovascular disease and kidney stones, women should aim to meet this recommendation primarily by eating a calcium-rich diet and taking calcium supplements only if needed to reach the RDA goal (often only approximately 500 mg per day in supplements is required).

### Citrate salts for preventing and treating calcium-containing kidney… [^398c1c00]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Do citrate salts treat and prevent calcium-containing kidney stones in adults. Evidence-Based Answer Citrate supplementation reduces stone size to less than 5 mm and prevents new stone formation when compared with placebo or no intervention. Citrate therapy also stabilizes existing stones and decreases the need for retreatment. These benefits come at the expense of upper gastrointestinal disturbances that lead to a higher dropout rate.

1. 2 Without prevention, 10% of individuals will have a symptomatic recurrence of stones at one year, 33% at five years, 50% at 10 years, and 75% at 20 years. 3 Urinary tract stones represent an important health care expense with charges exceeding $10 billion annually in the United States.

3 Because citrate binds urinary calcium, it may inhibit the formation of calcium oxalate stones; therefore, the authors of this Cochrane review aimed to determine if the use of citrate salts can prevent and treat calcium-containing kidney stones. This Cochrane review included seven randomized controlled trials with a total of 477 participants. 1 Three studies compared potassium citrate supplementation with placebo or no intervention, and three studies compared potassium-sodium citrate with no intervention. One study compared potassium-magnesium citrate with placebo. Primary outcomes included radiographic evidence of reduced stone size to less than 5 mm, lack of new stone formation, or stone size stability over six months, one year, or two years. Secondary outcomes were the need for retreatment, adverse events, and dropout rates. Dosages of citrate therapy ranged from 30 to 60 mEq per day.

Citrate therapy prevented growth of existing stones. Only two studies reported the need for retreatment as an outcome; in these, citrate therapy significantly decreased the need for retreatment vs. control over a follow-up period of three to four years. In absolute terms, the need for retreatment was 3. 6% vs.
41. 4% in the first study.

Vitamin D and calcium supplementation — potential harms: The WHI trial found a statistically significant increase in the incidence of kidney stones in women taking vitamin D and calcium compared with women taking placebo. For every 273 women who received supplementation over a 7-year follow-up period, 1 woman was diagnosed with a urinary tract stone. In addition, a recent study of combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation found findings consistent with those from the WHI trial, although the increase was not statistically significant.

### Nonpharmacologic methods of stone risk reduction: diet and supplements [^5e158bee]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

This article provides background and a rationale for patient-centered, individualized, nonpharmacologic risk reduction for the most common types of kidney stones. An appreciation for the heterogeneity of urolithiasis and how it is expressed across stone formers is reviewed. Evidence-based strategies to address urinary and dietary risk factors are reviewed. Strategies to target risk factors are provided. For appropriate lithogenic risk factors, targeted nonpharmacologic therapies, informed by individualized assessment and consideration of patient-centered factors, is encouraged.

### Vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^eef12f14]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Risk assessment and preventive medication — determinants and evidence summary: Low bone mass, older age, and history of falls are major risk factors for incident osteoporotic fractures, and absolute fracture risk is very low in premenopausal women compared with postmenopausal women. The recommendation against supplementation at lower doses was based on an overall assessment that supplementation at low doses provides no benefit, while evidence on the effect of supplementation on fractures at higher doses is conflicting; if future evidence shows a benefit, the magnitude of that benefit will need to be weighed against the magnitude of harms caused by supplementation (kidney stones).

### Calcium intake and risk of fracture: systematic review [^12e07c0d]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Small benefits might be useful at a population level if calcium supplements were used widely, well tolerated, and safe. Persistence with calcium supplements in clinical trials is low, however, at about 40–60%, and in one recent randomised controlled trial, there were 24 more women admitted to hospital for acute gastrointestinal symptoms in the calcium group than the placebo group, and 16 fewer women with a fracture. In another randomised controlled trial, there were 68 more women with a kidney stone in the CaD group and 56 fewer women with a fracture. In our randomised controlled trial and subsequent meta-analyses, the cardiovascular risks of calcium were similar toor exceededthe benefits of calcium on fracture prevention. In addition, 10–20% of people experience gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation, which cause a considerable number to stop taking the supplements. Thus, because of the small benefits of use and unfavourable risk:benefit profile, calcium supplements should not be recommended for fracture prevention either at an individual or population level.

### Treatment and prevention of kidney stones: an update [^cf444941]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The incidence of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) is rising worldwide, especially in women and with increasing age. Kidney stones are associated with chronic kidney disease. Preventing recurrence is largely specific to the type of stone (e.g., calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, cystine, struvite [magnesium ammonium phosphate]), and uric acid stones); however, even when the stone cannot be retrieved, urine pH and 24-hour urine assessment provide information about stone-forming factors that can guide prevention. Medications, such as protease inhibitors, antibiotics, and some diuretics, increase the risk of some types of kidney stones, and patients should be counseled about the risks of using these medications. Managing diet, medication use, and nutrient intake can help prevent the formation of kidney stones. Obesity increases the risk of kidney stones. However, weight loss could undermine prevention of kidney stones if associated with a high animal protein intake, laxative abuse, rapid loss of lean tissue, or poor hydration. For prevention of calcium oxalate, cystine, and uric acid stones, urine should be alkalinized by eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables, taking supplemental or prescription citrate, or drinking alkaline mineral waters. For prevention of calcium phosphate and struvite stones, urine should be acidified; cranberry juice or betaine can lower urine pH. Antispasmodic medications, ureteroscopy, and metabolic testing are increasingly being used to augment fluid and pain medications in the acute management of kidney stones.

Calcium safety and upper limits — In a Swedish prospective longitudinal cohort, calcium intake of more than 1,500 mg/day was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI, 1.17 to 1.67) for all-cause mortality, and a large study raised concerns about nephrolithiasis although the absolute risk of kidney stones was small (2.5% in the calcium-supplemented group versus 2.1% in the control group) with a mean total calcium intake of ∼2,100 mg. A study of more than 9,000 participants followed for 10 years found that postmenopausal women taking 500 to 1,000 mg of supplemental calcium had a significant survival advantage over women not taking supplements, while low dietary calcium intake (< 700 mg/day compared with 1,400 mg/day) has been associated with increased cardiovascular risks and a meta-analysis found no effect of calcium supplements on cardiovascular risk. In summary, studies to date suggest that dietary calcium may be preferred over supplemental calcium and that total calcium intake should not exceed 1,500 mg/day; increasing calcium intake beyond the recommended levels has not been shown to be useful and may be harmful.

### Diet, fluid, or supplements for secondary prevention of nephrolithiasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^8102f740]. European Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Although numerous trials have evaluated efficacy of diet, fluid, or supplement interventions for secondary prevention of nephrolithiasis, few are included in previous systematic reviews or referenced in recent nephrolithiasis management guidelines.

Objective

To determine efficacy and safety of diet, fluid, or supplement interventions for secondary prevention of nephrolithiasis.

Evidence Acquisition

Systematic review and meta-analysis of trials published January 1950 to March 2008. Sources included Medline and bibliographies of retrieved articles. Eligible trials included adults with a history of nephrolithiasis; compared diet, fluids, or supplements with control; compared relevant outcomes between randomized groups (eg, stone recurrence); had ≥ 3 mo follow-up; and were published in the English language. Data were extracted on participant and trial characteristics, including study methodologic quality.

Evidence Synthesis

Eight trials were eligible (n = 1855 participants). Study quality was mixed. In two trials, water intake > 2 l/d or fluids to achieve urine output > 2.5 l/d reduced stone recurrence (relative risk: 0.39; 95% confidence interval: 0.19–0.80). In one trial, fewer high soft drink consumers assigned to reduced soft drink intake had renal colic than controls (34% vs 41%, p = 0.023). Content and results of multicomponent dietary interventions were heterogeneous; in one trial, fewer participants assigned increased dietary calcium, low animal protein, and low sodium had stone recurrence versus controls (20% vs 38%, p = 0.03), while in another trial, more participants assigned diets that included low animal protein, high fruit and fiber, and low purine had recurrent stones than controls (30% vs 4%, p = 0.004). No trials examined the independent effect of altering dietary calcium, sodium, animal protein, fruit and fiber, purine, oxalate, or potassium. Two trials showed no benefit of supplements over control treatment. Adverse event reporting was poor.

Conclusions

High fluid intake decreased risk of recurrent nephrolithiasis. Reduced soft drink intake lowered risk in patients with high baseline soft drink consumption. Data for other dietary interventions were inconclusive, although limited data suggest possible benefit from dietary calcium.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^fc14bcc3]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — calcium oxalate stones and dietary oxalate/calcium: Clinicians should counsel patients with calcium oxalate stones and relatively high urinary oxalate to limit intake of oxalate-rich foods and maintain normal calcium consumption (Expert Opinion). Patients with hyperoxaluria and a history of calcium oxalate stones should be advised to consume calcium from foods and beverages primarily at meals, and total calcium intake should not exceed 1,000–1,200 mg daily. Many patients can obtain adequate calcium from foods and beverages; calcium supplementation is not necessary in these patients, and in an observational study of older women, calcium supplement users were 20% more likely to form a stone than women who did not take supplements.

### Vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^108084d9]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Because of the aging population, osteoporotic fractures are an increasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Approximately 2 million osteoporotic fractures occurred in the United States in 2005, and annual incidence is projected to increase to more than 3 million fractures by 2025. Within 1 year of experiencing a hip fracture, many patients are unable to walk independently, more than half require assistance with activities of daily living, and 20% to 30% of patients will die.

Objective

To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, to prevent fractures.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on vitamin D, calcium, and combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults (defined as not living in a nursing home or other institutional care setting). The review excluded studies conducted in populations with a known disorder related to bone metabolism (eg, osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency), taking medications known to be associated with osteoporosis (eg, long-term steroids), or with a previous fracture.

Findings

The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to estimate the benefits of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation to prevent fractures in community-dwelling men and premenopausal women. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium has no benefit for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to estimate the benefits of doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D or greater than 1000 mg of calcium to prevent fractures in community-dwelling postmenopausal women. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that supplementation with vitamin D and calcium increases the incidence of kidney stones.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of vitamin D and calcium supplementation, alone or combined, for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, asymptomatic men and premenopausal women. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of daily supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. (I statement) The USPSTF recommends against daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. (D recommendation) These recommendations do not apply to persons with a history of osteoporotic fractures, increased risk for falls, or a diagnosis of osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.

### High-dose supplementation with vitamin C – induced pediatric urolithiasis: the first case report in a child and literature review [^c0291a68]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

High dose of vitamin C intake could increase urine oxalate excretion and hence the risk of calcium stone formation. We report a case of left ureteral stone in a 9-year-old boy with an extremely high urine oxalate excretion. Besides, he had a habit of taking high-dose supplementation of vitamin C since the age of 3 years. After vitamin C intake prohibited without other therapy and change of dietary intake, the urine oxalate excretion was decreased to normal level and no recurrence of urolithiasis was present during the 3-year follow-up. Thus, high-dose supplementation with vitamin C for years in a child could induce the urinary stones.

### Osteoporosis prevention, screening, and diagnosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 1 [^c1c56f0b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

USPSTF vitamin D and calcium supplementation in community-dwelling adults — fracture prevention evidence and RDAs — notes that for community-dwelling, postmenopausal women, the USPSTF "recommends against supplementation with 400 international units or less of vitamin D and 1,000 mg or less of calcium to prevent fractures because adequate evidence indicates that supplementation has no effect on fracture incidence," and it found "insufficient evidence on whether supplementation with higher doses of vitamin D and calcium, alone or combined, prevents fracture." Evidence synthesis from 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 51,419 adults showed vitamin D alone had "no difference in hip fracture risk" (three RCTs, 5,496 participants; absolute risk difference [ARD], -0.01%; 95% CI -0.80% to 0.78%), and vitamin D plus calcium had "no effect on the risk of total fractures" (one RCT, 36,282 participants; ARD -0.35%; 95% CI -1.02% to 0.31%) and hip fracture (two RCTs, 36,727 participants); the combination was "associated with an increased risk of kidney stones" (three RCTs, 39,213 participants; ARD, 0.33%; 95% CI 0.06%–0.60%). Recommended daily allowance (RDA) values are "1,000 mg per day from ages 19 to 50 years and 1,200 mg per day in older women" for calcium and "600 international units per day to age 70 years and 800 international units thereafter" for vitamin D; the "RDA of vitamin D is believed to maintain an adequate serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (20 ng/mL) in 97.5% of the population." For screening, the USPSTF concludes "the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults," and the Endocrine Society "advises that there is insufficient evidence to recommend screening individuals who are not at risk of vitamin D deficiency."

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) scope and evidence update — vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for primary fracture prevention in community-dwelling adults states that persons with known osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency were excluded from the evidence review and recommendation statement, explains that the recommendation against supplementation at lower doses was based on an overall assessment that low-dose supplementation provides no benefit, and adds that evidence for fracture prevention with vitamin D doses greater than 400 IU daily is inconsistent and inadequate. The USPSTF also notes that evidence was too limited to make a separate recommendation about calcium supplementation alone and that newer evidence confirms an increased risk for kidney stones with combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation while also suggesting no increased incidence of cardiovascular disease with vitamin D supplementation.

Forest plot of highest vs lowest category of vitamin and calcium supplementation and risk of incident nephrolithiasis in RCTs. RECORD, Randomized Evaluation of Calcium or Vitamin D; ViDA, Vitamin D Assessment; RCTs, randomized controlled trials; RR, relative risk; CI, confidence interval

No significant associations with incident stones were observed for high intake of dietary vitamin B6 and total vitamin D. Meta-analyses of total and supplemental vitamin C showed nonsignificantly increased risks of incident stones with moderate and substantial heterogeneity, respectively. The pooled results of 2 female cohorts for supplemental calcium > 501 mg/d yielded a significant RR of 1.16 (95% CI, 1.00–1.35). In contrast, 4 RCTs of supplemental calcium (600–1600 mg/d) produced a null association without heterogeneity. Supplemental vitamin D increased the risk of kidney stones in 5 observational studies (RR: 1.22; 95% CI, 1.01–1.49) but not in 7 RCTs (RR: 0.84; 95% CI, 0.65–1.10). The VITAL study was the largest RCT in terms of sample size and cases but it did not exclude participants with a history of kidney stones. When we included the VITAL study, the pooled RR of RCTs changed from 0.84 to 1.06 (95% CI, 0.95–1.19). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated similar results. The meta-analysis of vitamin D plus calcium supplementation in 3 RCTs was no different from the previous meta-analysis by Kahwati et al. showing that the cosupplementation was a significant stone predictor (RR: 1.18; 95% CI, 1.04–1.35) (Data not shown in the figure). The result was driven by the Women's Health Initiative RCT (RR: 1.17; 95% CI,1.03–1.34).

### Thiazide dose, urine calcium, and symptomatic kidney stone events… [^718a1153]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Although thiazides are a mainstay of kidney stone prevention, 1 one study questioned their efficacy, 2 leading some to argue against their use for this indication. 3 Because thiazides are believed to mitigate stone formation by reducing urine calcium, one explanation for NOSTONE's null finding is that the calcium reductions were insufficient to affect recurrence risk. We conducted a cohort study quantifying the association between thiazide dose and calcium reduction and correlating calcium changes with symptomatic stone events. We identified those prescribed thiazides within the 6 months after urine collection and those who also had follow-up collection between 30 and 180 days after their first prescription fill.

The University of Michigan Health System institutional review board deemed this study exempt and did not require consent because they considered the study to be no more than minimal risk. This study followed the STROBE reporting guideline. Figure 1 reveals significant associations between higher thiazide doses and greater 24-hour mean and percentage calcium reductions, 19. 5%, and
18. 0%, 2 which may explain NOSTONE's null results.

Limitations include the possibility of omitted variable bias and unmeasured differences between participants prescribed different dosages that could confound the observed associations. We analyzed a sample of mostly older adults, potentially limiting generalizability. Nonetheless, for individuals prescribed thiazides for stone prevention, it may be beneficial to monitor calcium excretion and adjust dose and diet to attain an adequate reduction in urine calcium.

### Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and the risk of fractures [^f9197e1f]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

The efficacy of calcium with vitamin D supplementation for preventing hip and other fractures in healthy postmenopausal women remains equivocal.

Methods

We recruited 36,282 postmenopausal women, 50 to 79 years of age, who were already enrolled in a Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial. We randomly assigned participants to receive 1000 mg of elemental calcium as calcium carbonate with 400 IU of vitamin D3 daily or placebo. Fractures were ascertained for an average follow-up period of 7.0 years. Bone density was measured at three WHI centers.

Results

Hip bone density was 1.06 percent higher in the calcium plus vitamin D group than in the placebo group (P < 0.01). Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels.

Conclusions

Among healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00000611.).

### Guidelines on urolithiasis [^d8568e20]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

A project was initiated by the Health Care Office of the European Association of Urology in order to formulate common recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of patients with urolithiasis. The basic task for the working group therefore was to extract and evaluate evidence from the literature in order to reach a consensus on how these patients could best be managed.

Methods

Extensive reviews of the literature together with a thorough and detailed discussion of the various topics, by a working group including of experts from several European countries, provided the basis for a consensus overview of urolithiasis and its management.

Results and Conclusions

Recommendations are given for the management of patients with acute stone colic and for active removal of stones from the ureter and kidney. Moreover, the principles for risk evaluation of patients with recurrent stone formation and appropriate recurrence preventive treatment are given.

### Urinary tract stone occurrence in the women's health initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trial of calcium and vitamin D supplements [^417b0677]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trial (RCT) of calcium plus vitamin D (CaD) supplements found a 17% excess in urinary tract stone incidence in the supplemented group. This study evaluated whether this risk is modified by participant characteristics.

Objective

We examined the correlates of urinary tract stone occurrence in the CaD arm of the WHI trial.

Design

We analyzed an RCT involving 36,282 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 y from 40 WHI centers: 18,176 women received 500 mg calcium carbonate plus 200 IU vitamin D(3) twice daily (1000 mg and 400 IU daily, respectively), and 18,106 women received a matching placebo for an average of 7.0 y. The incidence of urinary tract stones was determined.

Results

The incidence of self-reported clinically diagnosed urinary tract stones was more common in the active CaD medication group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.34): 449 women in the CaD group and 381 women in the placebo group reported a stone during the trial. The rates of self-reported stones did not differ between various demographic, anthropomorphic, dietary, and other hypothesized risk factors according to randomization assignment. Neither the total calcium intake nor the use of calcium supplements at baseline was associated with the risk of stones. In sensitivity analyses that censored participants who were below 80% adherence, the findings were similar.

Conclusions

Daily supplementation with CaD for 7 y was associated with an increase in the number of self-reported urinary tract stones. These findings have implications for CaD supplement use. This trial was registered with the WHI at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00000611.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^c1b271ba]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Diet therapies — sodium restriction and dietary calcium for calcium stone formers advise that clinicians should counsel patients with calcium stones and relatively high urinary calcium to limit sodium intake and consume 1,000–1,200 mg per day of dietary calcium (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B), with the Panel supporting a target of ≤ 100 mEq (2,300 mg) sodium intake daily; in supporting evidence, a five-year randomized controlled clinical trial in men with a history of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis and idiopathic hypercalciuria assigned to a diet lower in calcium (400 mg/day) or to a diet with normal calcium content (1,200 mg/day) and lower amounts of animal protein and sodium found at study end that the risk of developing a recurrent stone on the normal calcium diet was 51% lower than on the lower calcium diet, although the independent effect of calcium could not be ascertained; supplemental calcium, in contrast, may be associated with an increased risk of stone formation.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^992c00c3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis in men — calcium intake and safety reports that the Institute of Medicine recommends a calcium intake of 1000 mg/d for men aged 51–70 and 1200 mg/d for men (and women) older than 70. In clinical trials for osteoporosis in men, calcium (500–1000 mg/d) and vitamin D [400–1200 IU/d (10–30 μg/d)] supplementation was provided for all subjects. A meta-analysis in women showed that calcium supplements may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction but no other cardiovascular end points or death, and this finding has not been confirmed in men. In older women, calcium supplementation increases the risk of kidney stones; although the prevalence of kidney stones is higher in men than in women, no increase in kidney stones has been demonstrated in men at the level of calcium intake recommended for optimal bone health. An observational study suggested a higher risk of metastatic prostate cancer in men receiving high doses of supplemental calcium (1500–2000 mg/d), but this has not been substantiated in clinical trials.

### Calcium supplementation and kidney stone risk in osteoporosis: a systematic literature review [^832bbbf8]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This paper aims to examine the risk of nephrolithiasis in patients with osteoporosis and calcium supplementation.

Methods

This work is based on the systematic review of studies retrieved by a sensitive search strategy in Medline and Embase (1991–2010), and the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to 2010. The abstracts of the annual scientific meetings of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) (2008–2010) were also examined. The selection criteria were the following: patients with osteoporosis, on calcium supplementation alone or associated with other treatments for osteoporosis. We measured the likelihood of developing kidney stones, renal colic, changes in urinary sediment and serum parameters. We selected systematic literature reviews, randomised clinical trials (RCT) and cohort studies.

Results

We included 10 studies, 8 RCT and 2 cohort studies of moderate quality. All patients had osteoporosis (> 8.000 patients), they were mostly women with a mean age of 50–70 years. Daily calcium doses varied from 120 mg up to 1.500 mg, and treatment duration from 3 days to 3 years. Changes in urinary sediment were found, but in general they were not clinically relevant. No cases of nephrolitiasis were found in more than a half of the included studies. In total there were 3 cases of kidney stone, 2 urinary tract calcifications, 16 cases of nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis, 4 of haematuria and 5 patients reporting kidney pain.

Conclusions

According to our results, calcium supplements in the treatment of osteoporosis alone or in combination with another type of treatment does not significantly increase the risk of nephrolithiasis or renal colic.

### Dietary and lifestyle factors for primary prevention of nephrolithiasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e8cea678]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to collectively investigate a wide range of modifiable lifestyle factors and to clarify their strength of association with incident kidney stones by comparing the highest vs lowest categories of exposures. The findings suggested that total fluid intake, water, coffee, tea, alcohol, beer, fruit, vegetables, dietary fiber, dietary potassium, magnesium, and calcium decreased the risk of kidney stones, whereas high BMI, total meat intake, animal protein, dietary sodium, spinach, oxalate, fructose and soda increased the risk. Total and supplemental vitamin C intakes were linked with nonsignificant risk of renal stones. Supplemental vitamin D and calcium alone increased the risk in observational studies but not in RCTs. In contrast, cosupplementation conferred the risk in RCTs. No significant associations were detected with physical activity, energy intake, dietary vitamin B6 and total vitamin D.

Kidney stone selection and management — donor candidates with prior or current stones: The acceptance of a donor candidate with prior or current kidney stones should be based on an assessment of stone recurrence risk and knowledge of the possible consequences of kidney stones after donation. As recommended in chapter 5 (Predonation Kidney Function), when asymmetry in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), parenchymal abnormalities (including stones), vascular abnormalities, or urological abnormalities are present but do not preclude donation, the more affected kidney should be used for donation. There are reports of nephrolithiasis-related adverse events in recipients of an allograft with a stone left in situ, and there are also reports on the safety and success of ex vivo ureteroscopy to remove stones from explanted donor kidneys before transplantation. Donors and donor candidates who develop kidney stones should follow general population evidence-based guidelines for dietary and pharmacologic-based strategies to prevent kidney stones.

### Monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation does not increase kidney stone risk or serum calcium: results from a randomized controlled trial [^2c72a706]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A growing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are investigating the potential health benefits of high-dose vitamin D supplementation. However, there are limited RCT data on the safety of calcium-related adverse effects.

Objective

We investigated the incidence of kidney stone and hypercalcemia events in a large, population-based RCT of vitamin D supplementation.

Design

The Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in 5110 participants in Auckland, New Zealand. This trial investigated the impact of monthly 100,000 IU vitamin D3 supplementation over several years on cardiovascular events, respiratory infections, and falls/fractures. Participants provided information about recent kidney stone events in regular questionnaires sent to them with study capsules. Hospitalization data for kidney stones were collected from health authorities. Serum calcium was measured in an 8% subsample of participants who returned annually for blood tests. HRs of time to the first kidney stone event were calculated by Cox regression.

Results

During a median follow-up of 3.3 y, 158 participants reported a kidney stone event (76 vitamin D, 82 placebo). The HR of reporting the first kidney stone event was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.66, 1.23; P = 0.51) for participants in the vitamin D arm compared with the placebo arm. There were 18 urolithiasis events in the hospitalization records: 7 in the vitamin D arm and 11 from the placebo arm. The HR to the first hospitalization urolithiasis event was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.24, 1.26; P = 0.30) in the vitamin D arm compared with the placebo arm. From the subsample annual blood test, there was no case of hypercalcemia in the vitamin D arm, compared with 1 in the placebo arm.

Conclusion

Over a median of 3.3 y, monthly supplementation with 100,000 IU vitamin D3 did not affect the incidence rate of kidney stone events, or hypercalcemia. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as ACTRN12611000402943.

### Safety of calcium and vitamin D supplements, a randomized controlled trial [^172497e3]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

It is anticipated that an intake of vitamin D found acceptable by Endocrine Society Guidelines (10 000 IU/day) with co-administered calcium supplements may result in frequent hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia. This combination may be associated with kidney stones. The objective of this study was to compare the episodes of hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia from calcium supplements co-administered with 10 000 IU or 600 IU vitamin D daily. This design allows a comparison of the Institute of Medicine recommendation for the RDA of vitamin D along with the upper limit of calcium intake with the high intake of vitamin D suggested by the Endocrine Society.

Context

Harms of currently recommended high intake of vitamin D have not been studied.

Design

The design was a randomized controlled trial with 2 groups with evaluation every 3 months for one year: (a) CaCO 3 1200 mg/day with 10 000 IU vitamin D 3 /day or (b) CaCO 3 1200 mg/day with 600 IU vitamin D 3 /day.

Patients

This study was conducted in an ambulatory research centre in healthy, white postmenopausal women.

Measurements

Serum and 24-hour urine calcium were measured.

Results

Hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria occurred in both groups. At the final visit, 19/48 in the high dose D group had hypercalciuria. The odds of developing hypercalciuria were 3.6 [OR = 3.6(1.39, 9.3)] times higher in the high dose D group. The odds of developing hypercalcaemia did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

The safe upper level of vitamin D recommended by the Endocrine Society when accompanied by calcium supplements results in frequent hypercalciuria. The risk of kidney stones at these levels should be investigated.

### Thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention [^11fad65b]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

HOW SHOULD PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT CALCIUM KIDNEY STONES BE MANAGED IN CONSIDERATION OF THESE RECENT FINDINGS?

We propose to invest energy and time in patient education, such as dietary and physical behavior changes, as first line intervention. If this does not suffice, pharmacological measures should be discussed on a case-to-case basis. Citrate salts are a valid option, although high quality trial evidence is limited. Additionally, CaP stone formation may be triggered by alkali administration, necessitating careful monitoring of treatment and urine pH. In patients with calcium kidney stones that are intolerant, or not responsive to citrate supplementation as monotherapy, long-acting thiazides such as chlorthalidone or indapamide may be tried. Importantly, however, there are currently only theoretical considerations and no robust trial data demonstrating an advantage of these thiazide-like compounds over hydrochlorothiazide for kidney stone recurrence prevention. Close monitoring of the patient should be started, and if there is no relevant change in stone activity after 2–3 years of treatment, discontinuation should be explored. The combination of thiazides and alkali therapy may be promising, but has not been tested rigorously so far. Benefits and potential risks associated with long-term use of thiazides should be discussed carefully with each patient.

### Pathophysiology and management of calcium stones [^68619c70]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is a common disorder that accounts for significant cost, morbidity, and loss of work. There is a one in eight lifetime chance of being diagnosed with urinary stones. Calcium is the most common component of renal stones in individuals in industrialized nations. Calcium stones form as a result of a variety of environmental and metabolic abnormalities that change the urinary environment and increase supersaturation of stone-forming salts. Understanding the pathophysiology of stone disease can help direct treatment toward correction of the underlying abnormalities. Current medical and dietary therapeutic regimens have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of recurrent stone formation.

Preventive approaches — efforts to prevent the recurrence of nephrolithiasis target decreasing concentrations of the lithogenic factors and increasing the concentrations of inhibitors of stone formation; this is achieved by both dietary changes and appropriate pharmacologic approaches, and dietary changes include increasing water intake, reducing dietary oxalate, reducing dietary animal protein and other purines, and maintaining normal dietary calcium.

Recurrent nephrolithiasis — other dietary interventions: In patients with calcium oxalate stones, one trial found fewer recurrences with a multicomponent diet including normal or high calcium intake (1200 mg/d) versus a low-calcium diet (400 mg/d), and that a multicomponent diet including low sodium intake (50 mmol/d) was associated with fewer recurrences than a high-sodium diet; outcome assessment used radiographic recurrence in 4 subgroups and resulted in 9 possible interpretations. Composite stone recurrence by radiography was assessed in 2 trials with mixed results, and no included studies addressed a low-oxalate diet.

### Medical management of common urinary calculi… [^6a1abee5]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

The causes of calcium oxalate stones and their mechanisms are listed in Table 4. Hypercalciuria is the most common metabolic abnormality associated with these calculi, followed by hypocitraturia, which involves a deficiency of the naturally occurring stone inhibitor citrate. Treatments for these stones depend on the underlying condition. Note that there are no specific medications for hyperoxaluria; medical treatment consists of increasing calcium intake to control enteric hyperoxaluria. Additionally, decreasing the intake of oxalates contained in foods such as spinach, rhubarb, beets, chocolate, nuts, tea, strawberries, soy foods, and wheat bran may be beneficial. 20; less common etiologies include primary hyperparathyroidism, excessive alkalinization, and sarcoidosis.

Renal tubular acidosis is associated with hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia. Medical treatment of these stones consists of replenishing urinary citrate to prevent new stone formation and delay growth of existing stones. Care must be taken to avoid excessive alkalinization, because high urinary pH can increase the urinary supersaturation of calcium phosphate salts. If hypercalciuria persists, addition of a thiazide diuretic is indicated.
21. Radiographic imaging can be difficult because pure uric acid calculi typically are radiolucent. They are, however, readily apparent on noncontrast CT. In addition to the general measures outlined above, treatment of uric acid stones involves correction of urinary pH. Potassium citrate at a dosage of 30 to 60 mEq per day will raise the urinary pH to greater than 5.
5. 24Allopurinol at a dosage of 300 mg daily can be added in patients with hyperuricemia.

Acetohydroxamic acid is an irreversible inhibitor of urease and can prevent the crystallization of struvite stones. 28 However, because of side effects, it generally is reserved for use in patients who cannot tolerate surgical intervention. 29.

### Dietary and lifestyle factors for primary prevention of nephrolithiasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^94aee4fd]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The summarized evidence in this study indicated that several lifestyle factors, such as BMI, beverages and dietary patterns, were significantly associated with the risk of nephrolithiasis. Adherence to specific dietary patterns is likely to have a far-reaching effect in reducing the stone burden. However, long-term RCTs are needed to confirm the cost-effectiveness of dietary patterns for the reduction of the incidence and recurrence rates of kidney stones. Future studies on vitamin D and calcium supplementation could help clarify their respective and combined effects on kidney stone formation.

### Vitamin D and calcium supplementation to prevent… [^6c1a8320]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

A. Vitamin D and calcium supplementation is associated with an increased incidence of renal stones. B. In postmenopausal women, there is adequate evidence that daily supplementation with 400 IU of vitamin D 3combined with 1, 000 mg of calcium has no effect on the incidence of fractures. C. Vitamin D and calcium supplements are relatively inexpensive and readily available without a prescription. C. Daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D 3and 1, 000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in premenopausal women and in men. D. Daily supplementation with 800 IU of vitamin D 3and 1, 500 mg of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in noninstitutionalized, postmenopausal women. Answers 1. The correct answer is D. The USPSTF recommends against daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D 3 and 1, 000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in noninstitutionalized, postmenopausal women.

The evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of daily supplementation with greater than 400 IU of vitamin D 3 and greater than 1, 000 mg of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in noninstitutionalized, postmenopausal women.
2. The correct answers are A, B, and C. In the Women's Health Initiative, women taking supplemental vitamin D and calcium had a statistically increased incidence of renal stones. Adequate evidence indicates that supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D 3 and 1, 000 mg or less of calcium has no effect on the incidence of fractures in noninstitutionalized, postmenopausal women. Vitamin D and calcium supplements are inexpensive and readily available without a prescription. The USPSTF recommendations on vitamin D and calcium supplementation to prevent fractures apply only to noninstitutionalized men and women.

In pre-menopausal women and in men, there is inadequate evidence to determine the effect of combined vitamin D 3 and calcium supplementation on the incidence of fractures. There is inadequate evidence regarding the effect of combined daily supplementation with greater than 400 IU of vitamin D 3 and greater than 1, 000 mg of calcium on fracture incidence in noninstitutionalized, postmenopausal women.

### Fresh lemon juice supplementation for the prevention of recurrent stones in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis: a pragmatic, prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpointtrial [^ed590e2e]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Standard diet with normal calcium and reduced animal proteins and salt content reduces stone recurrence in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. Whether lemon juice supplementation further reduces recurrence rate is unknown.

Methods

In this single-centre, prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint trial (Clinical Trials gov NCT01217372) we evaluated the effects of fresh lemon juice supplementation (60 mL twice daily) versus no supplementation, on time to stone recurrence in 203 patients with recurrent idiopathic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis who were all prescribed a standard diet. Patients were included between July 2009 and March 2017 at the Nephrology Unit of the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital in Bergamo, Italy. Time to stone recurrence at 2 years of follow-up was the primary outcome. Analyses were by intention-to-treat.

Findings

During two years of follow-up 21 of 100 patients randomised to lemon juice supplementation and 32 of 103 controls randomised to no supplementation had stone recurrence [HR (95% CI): 0·62 (0·35–1·07), p = 0·089]. Patient adherence to lemon juice supplementation, however, progressively decreased from 68% at one-year to 48% at two-year follow-up. At explorative analyses restricted at one-year follow-up, ten patients with supplementation versus 22 controls had stone recurrence [0·43 (0·20–0·89), p = 0·028]. After adjustment by age, sex and normo or hypocitraturia, the HR (95%) was still significant [0·45 (0·20–0·93), p = 0·036]. At six months, 24 hour urinary sodium excretion decreased by 8·60 ± 65·68 mEq/24 h in patients receiving lemon juice supplementation and increased by 3·88 ± 64·78 mEq/24 h in controls. Changes significantly differed between groups (p = 0·031). This difference was subsequently lost. Treatment was safe. In patients with lemon juice supplementation gastrointestinal disorders were more frequent (p < 0·001). Renal and urinary tract disorders were similar between groups (p = 0·103).

Interpretation

Explorative analyses suggest that f resh lemon juice supplementation to standard diet might prevent stone recurrence in patients with calcium-oxalate nephrolithiasis. However, treatment effect was likely reduced by progressively declining adherence to lemon juice supplementation.

Funding

This study received no funding.

### Vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults: evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^222d7e82]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Osteoporotic fractures result in significant morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To update the evidence for benefits and harms of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through March 21, 2017; references; and experts. Surveillance continued through February 28, 2018.

Study Selection

English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or observational studies of supplementation with vitamin D, calcium, or both among adult populations; studies of populations that were institutionalized or had known vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or prior fracture were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Dual, independent review of titles/abstracts and full-text articles and study quality rating using predefined criteria. Random-effects meta-analysis used when at least 3 similar studies were available.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incident fracture, mortality, kidney stones, cardiovascular events, and cancer.

Results

Eleven RCTs (N = 51 419) in adults 50 years and older conducted over 2 to 7 years were included. Compared with placebo, supplementation with vitamin D decreased total fracture incidence (1 RCT [n = 2686]; absolute risk difference [ARD], -2.26% [95% CI, -4.53% to 0.00%]) but had no significant association with hip fracture (3 RCTs [n = 5496]; pooled ARD, -0.01% [95% CI, -0.80% to 0.78%]). Supplementation using vitamin D with calcium had no effect on total fracture incidence (1 RCT [n = 36 282]; ARD, -0.35% [95% CI, -1.02% to 0.31%]) or hip fracture incidence (2 RCTs [n = 36 727]; ARD from the larger trial, -0.14% [95% CI, -0.34% to 0.07%]). The evidence for calcium alone was limited, with only 2 studies (n = 339 total) and very imprecise results. Supplementation with vitamin D alone or with calcium had no significant effect on all-cause mortality or incident cardiovascular disease; ARDs ranged from -1.93% to 1.79%, with CIs consistent with no significant differences. Supplementation using vitamin D with calcium was associated with an increased incidence of kidney stones (3 RCTs [n = 39 213]; pooled ARD, 0.33% [95% CI, 0.06% to 0.60%]), but supplementation with calcium alone was not associated with an increased risk (3 RCTs [n = 1259]; pooled ARD, 0.00% [95% CI, -0.87% to 0.87%]). Supplementation with vitamin D and calcium was not associated with an increase in cancer incidence (3 RCTs [n = 39 213]; pooled ARD, -1.48% [95% CI, -3.32% to 0.35%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Vitamin D supplementation alone or with calcium was not associated with reduced fracture incidence among community-dwelling adults without known vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or prior fracture. Vitamin D with calcium was associated with an increase in the incidence of kidney stones.

### Vitamin D and kidney stones [^24d6fc5d]. Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

This review explores the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and lithogenesis. A causal relationship has been assumed despite myriad studies demonstrating that therapeutic doses of vitamin D do not increase lithogenic risk. Select stone formers may be at increased risk for recurrence with vitamin D supplementation, possibly from CYP24A1 gene mutations. Additionally, the evidence for who is vitamin D deficient, and the benefits of supplementation in those not at risk for rickets, is sparse. Concerns may be avoidable as vitamin D screening appears unnecessary in most patients, and superior pharmacology is available which increases bone density, while decreasing stone formation.

It is beyond doubt that appropriate therapeutic steps in this regard are of great benefit for the patient. It needs to be emphasized, however, that no success will be obtained unless the patient is willing and able to follow the ensuing dietary recommendations and medical advice.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^01f80a40]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — calcium and vitamin D safety and dosing indicate that supplementation with vitamin D of up to 4000 IU/d is not associated with safety issues beyond hypercalciuria, but when combined with high amounts of supplemental calcium there is the potential for a greater risk of kidney stones; high-dose intermittent vitamin D (500,000 IU/y or 20,000 IU/wk) can lead to a greater risk of falls and fractures; the Institute of Medicine recommends 1000 to 1200 mg of calcium per day, and Writing Committee members prefer keeping calcium supplement intake < 1000 mg/d; most postmenopausal women in the United States now consume close to 1000 mg/day, an increase of > 200 mg/d from the late 1990s.

### Dietary and lifestyle factors for primary prevention of nephrolithiasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9b3737ae]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

The selection process with exclusion reasons is presented in Fig. 1. The literature search yielded 4849 articles, of which 186 were potentially eligible after title and abstract screening. Through full-text review, 50 articles containing a total of 1,322,133 participants and 21,030 cases with study duration ranging from 1 year to 26 years were included (Additional file 5). Of 50 publications, 34 were cohort studies (33 prospective and 1 retrospective),12 were RCTs, and 4 were case-control studies. The included studies either used self-report, abdominal ultrasound, medical record review or International Classification Disease code to ascertain a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis. Some articles contained 2–3 study populations and assessed multiple risk factors, which encompassed obesity (n = 15), beverage (n = 12), diet (n = 19), physical activity (n = 4), energy intake (n = 3), vitamins and calcium supplements (n = 22). All the included RCTs reported data available for secondary analysis of the associations with vitamin D and calcium supplementation.

Flow chart of the study selection process

Diet

Dietary factors were assessed in 10 observational studies (19 publications), of which 8 were cohort studies conducted within the USA and Europe and 2 were case-controlled studies in the USA and China.

In the meta-analysis of high vs low intake (Fig. 2), a high intake of meat significantly increased the risk of kidney stones (RR: 1.24; 95% CI, 1.12–1.39). No significant heterogeneity was present and sensitivity analysis produced consistent results. Two studies further investigated red meat, processed meat and poultry with inconsistent results. Both reported a 20–53% higher risk of stones for high intake of red meat and null association for poultry consumption. Only one showed significantly increased risk with processed (RR: 1.34; 95% CI, 1.12–1.59) and poultry meat consumption (RR: 1.22; 95% CI, 1.00–1.49). There was no association between fish intake and incident stones in 2 studies. Five cohort studies reported on animal protein, with only one study showing the opposite direction of risk estimate without adjustment for body mass index (BMI) and diabetes. A meta-analysis of the other 4 yielded borderline significant risk (RR: 1.1; 95% CI, 1.02–1.19) with no heterogeneity.

### Dietary and pharmacologic management to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^256bdaf8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical guideline — pharmacologic therapy for recurrent nephrolithiasis — summarizes mechanism-based selection and scope of evidence. Clinicians often select pharmacologic therapy on the basis of method of action: thiazide diuretics reduce urinary calcium and are often prescribed for patients with hypercalciuria, citrates bind to calcium and decrease urine acidity, and allopurinol decreases uric acid in urine. Almost all studies analyzed included only patients with calcium stones, the most common stone type, and although biochemistry suggests a relationship between pharmacologic method of action and stone type, no randomized, controlled trials link biochemical testing to outcomes. Our recommendations do not include patients with suspected hyperparathyroidism or other rare cases.

### Vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^2161a917]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — vitamin D and calcium for primary fracture prevention in community-dwelling adults — found no mortality or cardiovascular disease benefit from supplementation, identified kidney stone harms with combined supplementation, and issued dose-specific conclusions. Vitamin D, with or without calcium, had no statistically significant effect on all-cause mortality or incident cardiovascular disease compared with placebo; for vitamin D alone, four studies reported mortality with pooled absolute risk difference (ARD) −0.74% (95% CI, −0.80% to 0.32%) and pooled relative risk (RR) 0.91 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.01), and in WHI combined supplementation, ARDs for cardiovascular outcomes ranged from −0.69% to 0.12% with all 95% CIs including zero. Combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation for 4 to 7 years increased the incidence of kidney stones, and very high–dose vitamin D (500 000 IU per year) increased falls (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.31]). The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to estimate benefits in community-dwelling men and premenopausal women and concludes with moderate certainty that daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium has no net benefit for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women; it also concludes there is insufficient evidence for the balance of benefits and harms with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium in postmenopausal women.

### Hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and kidney stones in long-term studies of vitamin D supplementation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1b549a69]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D supplementation is increasingly being used in higher doses in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, adverse events from very large annual doses of vitamin D have been shown in 2 RCTs, whereas in a third RCT, low-dose vitamin D, with calcium supplements, was shown to increase kidney stone risk.

Objective

We analyzed the side effects related to calcium metabolism in RCTs, specifically hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and kidney stones, in participants who were given vitamin D supplements for ≥ 24 wk compared with in subjects in the placebo arm.

Design

The following 3 main online databases were searched: Ovid Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Software was used for the meta-analysis.

Results

A total of 48 studies with 19,833 participants were identified, which reported ≥ 1 of the following side effects: hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, or kidney stones. Of these studies, kidney stones were reported in only 9 trials with a tendency for fewer subjects reporting stones in the vitamin D arm than in the placebo arm (RR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.41, 1.09; P = 0.10). In 37 studies, hypercalcemia was shown with increased risk shown for the vitamin D group (RR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.18; P = 0.01). Similar increased risk of hypercalciuria was shown in 14 studies for the vitamin D group (RR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.53; P = 0.03). In subgroup analyses, it was shown that the effect of vitamin D supplementation on risk of hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, or kidney stones was not modified by baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D, vitamin D dose and duration, or calcium co-supplementation.

Conclusions

Long-term vitamin D supplementation resulted in increased risks of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, which were not dose related. However, vitamin D supplementation did not increase risk of kidney stones. Additional large RCTs of long-term vitamin D supplementation are required to confirm these findings.

### Vitamin D supplementation after the menopause [^654bb3ca]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The Kahwat et al. meta-analysis of RCTs or observational studies analyzed vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures among community - dwelling adults without known vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or prior fracture. Supplementation with vitamin D alone or in combination with calcium was not associated with a reduction in fracture risk in studied subjects. Vitamin D with calcium was associated with an increase incidence of kidney stones.

Another more recent meta-analysiscompared vitamin D or vitamin D and calcium with controls. It was based on studies involving at least 200 fracture cases and RCTs enrolling at least 500 participants (59.9% women, mean age 77.1 years, baseline blood 25(OH)D levels ranging from 10.6 ng/ml to 26.3 ng/ml, and reporting at least 10 incident fractures). In 11 observational studies, the combined (vitamin D + calcium) supplementation was associated with an adjusted lower relative risk (RR) for any fracture (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.89–0.96) and for hip fracture (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.75–0.86), for each increase in 10 ng/ml in serum 25(OH)D levels. Supplementation with vitamin D alone in 11 RCTs, with a mean serum 25(OH)D difference of 8.4 ng/ml, was not associated with a reduction in the risk of any fracture or hip fracture, although there were heterogeneous doses of vitamin D supplementation. Contrary to this, the meta-analysis of six RCTs of combined supplementation with vitamin D at daily doses of 400–800 IU/day (median serum difference of 25(OH)D 9.2 ng/ml) and calcium (1000–1200 mg/day) found a significant reduction (6%) for any fracture risk (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.89–0.99), and a 16% reduction for hip fracture risk (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.72–0.97).

### The role of calcium in peri-and postmenopausal women: 2006 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^83119298]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the evidence-based consensus opinion published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2001 on the role of calcium in peri- and postmenopausal women.

Design

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this document. A panel of clinicians and researchers acknowledged to be experts in the field of calcium and women's health was enlisted to review the previous position statement and data published since then, compile supporting statements, and make recommendations. Their advice was used to assist the NAMS Board of Trustees in publishing this position statement.

Results

Adequate calcium intake (in the presence of adequate vitamin D status) has been shown to reduce bone loss in peri- and postmenopausal women and reduce fractures in postmenopausal women older than age 60 with low calcium intakes. Adequate calcium is considered a key component of any bone-protective therapeutic regimen. Calcium has also been associated with beneficial effects in several nonskeletal disorders, primarily hypertension, colorectal cancer, obesity, and nephrolithiasis, although the extent of those effects has not been fully elucidated. The calcium requirement rises at menopause. The target calcium intake for most postmenopausal women is 1,200 mg/day. Adequate vitamin D status, defined as 30 ng/mL or more of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (usually achieved with a daily oral intake of at least 400 to 600 IU), is required to achieve the nutritional benefits of calcium. The best source of calcium is food, and the best food source is dairy products. High-quality calcium supplements (taken in divided doses) are alternative sources for women unable to consume enough dietary calcium. There are no reported cases of calcium intoxication from food sources, and cases associated with supplements are rare (high intake levels of 2,150 mg/day have resulted in a 17% increase in renal calculi in one recent study, but not others). Because no accurate test to determine calcium deficiency exists, clinicians should focus instead on encouraging women to consume enough calcium to meet the recommended levels.

Conclusions

The most definitive role for calcium in peri- and postmenopausal women is in bone health, but, like most nutrients, calcium has beneficial effects in many body systems. Based on the available evidence, there is strong support for the importance of ensuring adequate calcium intake in all women, particularly those in peri- or postmenopause.

Calcium supplementation given with or without vitamin D supplementation is widely used, particularly in the elderly, and has been shown to modestly reduce the risk of new fragility fracture, 1 particularly in those older individuals in residential care. 2 Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is given routinely as adjunctive therapy with anti‐osteoporosis medications, all of which are licensed to be taken in the context of calcium and vitamin D repletion. 3 Calcium supplementation either alone or in combination with vitamin D was viewed as extremely safe, other than gastrointestinal side effects and a slightly increased risk of renal stones, 4 until a publication in the BMJ by Bolland and colleagues in 2008. In this New Zealand‐based trial of calcium supplementation in older women, increased risk of myocardial infarction with calcium supplementation was demonstrated. 5 Subsequent meta‐analyses and a reanalysis of the Women's Health Initiative trial by the same group again demonstrated modest associations between calcium, or calcium and vitamin D, supplementation and increased risk of myocardial infarction but not cardiovascular death. 6, 7 In contrast, no statistically significant associations between calcium and vitamin D supplementation and cardiac outcomes were found in a similar meta‐analysis by Lewis and colleagues 8 or by investigators studying the Women's Health Initiative. 9, 10, 11 However, in the Lewis study, a subanalysis among the much smaller number of individuals randomized to calcium alone did suggest an increased risk of myocardial infarction with use of calcium supplements alone versus placebo. Observational cohort data have led to similarly conflicting findings, (12–18) particularly with regard to dietary calcium intake compared with supplement use. More recently, work has documented differences in the endothelial response to prevailing calcium concentration between healthy and uremic patients, (19–21) and novel Mendelian randomization approaches have indicated an association between lifelong genetically determined calcium concentrations and ischemic heart disease. 22, 23 Given the high incidence of osteoporotic fracture, 24 cardiovascular side effects of treatments used to improve bone health, such as calcium/vitamin D supplementation, could potentially have major implications for public health. 25 Across the intervention and observational data, there is substantial heterogeneity among both exposure and outcome definitions, and there is a marked dearth of evidence pertaining to men. We, therefore, undertook a study of sex‐specific associations between calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation and risk of hospitalization for ischemic heart disease, or subsequent mortality in a very large, population‐based cohort of men and women with uniform ascertainment of both exposure and outcomes: the UK Biobank. The large study population also permitted investigation of whether associations might vary according to baseline cardiovascular risk factors.

### Calcium intake and risk of fracture: systematic review [^c59aab55]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Older men and women are recommended to take at least 1000–1200 mg/day of calcium for bone health and prevention of fractures. The average intake in the diet in Western countries is 700–900 mg/day, and lower in Asia and Africa, meaning that most older people would need to take calcium supplements to meet these recommendations. These guidelines for calcium intake have been widely implemented, and, in some Western countries, more than 30–50% of older women take calcium supplements. Clinical trials of calcium supplements at doses of 1000 mg/day, however, have reported adverse effects, including cardiovascular events, kidney stones, and hospital admissions for acute gastrointestinal symptoms. Consequently, older people have been encouraged to improve bone health by increasing their calcium intake through food rather than by taking supplements. This advice assumes that increasing dietary calcium intake to the recommended level of > 1200 mg/day prevents fractures without causing the adverse effects of calcium supplements.

We assessed the evidence supporting the recommendation to increase dietary calcium intake to prevent fractures and compared the anti-fracture efficacy of increasing calcium intake through dietary sources with the anti-fracture efficacy of calcium supplements. We undertook a systematic review of studies of dietary sources of calcium or calcium supplements in older adults (> 50) with fracture as an endpoint. We primarily focused on the results of randomised controlled trials, but when insufficient evidence from such trials was available, we considered results of observational studies.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^3b5d3d40]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Monitoring vitamin D status during treatment

Monitoring treatments is important to assess their efficacy and safety. Regarding vitamin D supplementations, there is limited evidence for when to monitor response to therapy or toxicity.

When it comes to achieving sufficiency in deficient patients, it seems there is no need to monitor differently according to different dosage regimens (dose and/or frequency) or baseline 25(OH)D serum values. The increase in serum 25(OH)D concentration after supplementation follows a curvilinear response with the increase of the cumulative doses. The delta increase over 100 IU depends on baseline levels, and there is less increase per 100 IU with high doses than low doses. Van Groningen et al calculated that the cholecalciferol loading dose required to reach the serum 25(OH)D target level of 75 nmol/L can be calculated as dose (IU) = 40 × [75 − serum 25(OH)D] × body weight. Mean 25(OH)D levels over a 2-month period are similar to daily, weekly, or monthly administrations (although monthly dosing is associated with more variability), and sufficiency can be reached independently from the baseline 25(OH)D values. In the study by Fassio et al, all participants normalized 25(OH)D safely, regardless of dosing regimens and including patients receiving 10 000 IU/day for the first 8 weeks; moreover, no cases of hypercalcemia were recorded. With regard to recent megatrials results, no effects were found on serum calcium or calciuria unless very high doses were used, such as 4000 to 10 000 IU per day in the Calgary study. Furthermore, these studies did not confirm the modestly increased risk of kidney stones observed in the WHI trial (400 IU per day). However, there might be a need for monitoring in case of other vitamin D metabolite use. As discussed earlier, calcifediol acts much more rapidly than cholecalciferol in increasing serum 25(OH)D levels, resulting in greater fluctuation of 25(OH)D levels. For example, supplementation with 20 μg (800 IU) of cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) increases 25(OH)D concentrations toward 70 nmol/L (28 ng/mL) within 16 weeks, while supplementation with 10 or 15 μg calcifediol (25(OH)D) increases 25(OH)D levels more than 75 nmol/L (> 30 ng/mL) in 8 and 4 weeks, respectively.

### Fresh lemon juice supplementation for the prevention of recurrent stones in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis: a pragmatic, prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpointtrial [^e7bd58db]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

The study was primarily aimed at evaluating whether fresh lemon juice added to standard diet recommendations compared to standard diet without lemon juice supplementation may reduce the risk of stone recurrence. The primary outcome was time to stone recurrence. Stone recurrence was defined by one of the following criteria: 1. A typical renal colic, or an episode of haematuria, with expulsion or removal of a previous undiscovered stone; 2. Echography detection of a previous undiscovered stone, even in the absence of symptoms; 3. More than 30 percent increase in pre-existing stone size. In all cases recurrence had to be confirmed by echography. All echography evaluations were performed by the same nephrologist (S.R.) who was blinded to treatment allocation. Secondarily, the study evaluated changes in urine volume, pH and solutes potentially associated with stone recurrence. All adverse events were recorded until study end and monitored up to complete resolution.

### Vitamin D and kidney stone disease [^c2a70740]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Vitamin D is important in maintaining calcium homeostasis, but its role in kidney stone disease and its effect on stone formation are still not clear.

Recent Findings

Kidney stone formers tend to experience enhanced intestinal calcium absorption, increased urinary calcium excretion, and excessive bone mineral loss. Although direct actions of active vitamin D have been implicated in all these processes, the effect of nutritional vitamin D (vitamin D2 or vitamin D3) use on calcium balance among stone formers is still not clear. In addition, the safety of nutritional vitamin D use in the stone forming population is also not established, considering the potential effect of its use on raising urinary calcium. However, most of the observational studies do not support a significant association between higher nutritional vitamin D store and increased risk of stone formation. Short-term nutritional vitamin D repletion in stone formers with vitamin D deficiency also does not appear to increase urinary calcium excretion.

Summary

The effect of nutritional vitamin D use in stone formers is still not clear. As vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among stone formers, future prospective studies are needed to establish the biological effect, as well as the safety and efficacy of nutritional vitamin D therapy in this unique patient population.

### Dietary and pharmacologic management to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^9d2c5415]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Recurrent nephrolithiasis — harms of dietary therapies: Withdrawals for any cause were low with increased fluid intake, whereas withdrawals were high in long-term trials of soft drink intake, high fiber intake, low animal protein intake, and multicomponent dietary interventions. For increased fluid intake, average withdrawals across two trials were 9.5% (range 0% to 10.0%), and one trial reported no withdrawals due to adverse events. For increased mineral water versus tap water, one study reported no withdrawals and did not report adverse events. For decreased soft drink intake, 8.7% withdrew versus 5.5% with no treatment (relative risk, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.00 to 2.49]). No increased risk for withdrawals for multicomponent interventions compared with control was found.

AUA medical management of kidney stones — potassium citrate for recurrent calcium stones states that clinicians should offer potassium citrate therapy to patients with recurrent calcium stones and low or relatively low urinary citrate (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). Prospective randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that potassium citrate therapy is associated with reduced risk of recurrent calcium stones in patients with low or low normal urinary citrate excretion, calcium stone-forming patients with normal citrate excretion but low urinary pH may also benefit, and potassium citrate is preferred over sodium citrate, as the sodium load in the latter may increase urine calcium excretion.

### Schedule of taking calcium supplement and the risk of nephrolithiasis [^08b817a7]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Variation in the timing of calcium supplement may affect gastrointestinal absorption of both calcium and oxalate differently and may associate with variable risk of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. There are few human studies addressing specifically the appropriate time for taking calcium supplement. Therefore, this study was performed to compare calcium bioavailability and the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation for calcium supplement taken with meal vs. taken at bedtime.

Methods

Thirty-two healthy male navy privates, 22.7 ± 1.9 years old (mean ± SD), who had normal renal function (serum creatinine less than 150 umol/L) and no history of renal stone, participated in the study. The subjects were randomly allocated into two groups of 16 each. Group A took 1 g of calcium carbonate with meal, 3 times/day; and group B took 3 g/day of calcium carbonate at bedtime. After taking the regimens for 1 week, followed by 1 month of washout period, crossover between both groups was done. The diet was controlled throughout the study. Twenty-four-hour urine collections for the determination of urinary constituents were obtained at baseline and after taking both regimens of calcium supplement. Activity product for calcium oxalate was determined to assess the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation.

Results

Urinary excretions of calcium were significantly elevated above the baseline values when taking calcium supplement both with meal (3.48 ± 2.13 mmol/day vs. 5.17 ± 2.61 mmol/day, P < 0.05) and at bedtime (3.09 ± 1.70 mmol/day vs. 5.08 ± 2.34 mmol/day, P < 0.05). There was no difference between the two regimens in the urinary calcium excretions. The urinary oxalate was decreased significantly when the subjects took calcium supplement with meal compared with the corresponding baseline value (0.13 ± 0.05 vs. 0.17 ± 0.07 mmol/d, P = 0.01). In contrast, there was no alteration in urinary oxalate when calcium supplement was taken at bedtime compared to the baseline values (0.15 ± 0.05 mmol/day vs. 0.15 ± 0.06 mmol/day, P = 0.9). Compared with the corresponding baseline values, there was no significant increase in the activity product for calcium oxalate when taking calcium with meal (0.54 ± 0.25 vs. 0.57 ± 0.22, P = 0.54), but it was increased significantly when calcium supplement was taken at bedtime (0.47 ± 0.21 vs. 0.72 ± 0.27, P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Calcium supplement should be taken with meal in order to avoid increasing the risk of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.

### Bisphosphonates and management of kidney stones and bone disease [^4a946362]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Kidney stones are strongly associated with low bone density and bone fracture. Clinical management focuses on prevention of kidney stones and bone fracture. We reviewed literature of kidney stones and bone disease with a special focus on updates in therapeutic strategies. We will review the literature regarding dietary management, supplements, and medications and emphasize the recent studies on bisphosphonates and kidney stone management.

Recent Findings

Bisphosphonate medications are commonly used in management of low bone density. Previous studies showed that they reduce urinary calcium. A recent large prospective study found that bisphosphonates may reduce the risk of kidney stones in individuals who have low bone density. In addition to lowering urinary calcium, a recent study found that bisphosphonates may act as an inhibitor in the urinary space.

Summary

There are multiple dietary and pharmacologic strategies that can be considered for kidney stones and bone disease, such as low salt and normal calcium diet, as well as thiazides, alkali, and bisphosphonate medications. Bisphosphonates may have an important role in reducing bone resorption and reducing overall risk of kidney stone and bone disease.

### Is there a role for pentosan polysulfate in the prevention of calcium oxalate stones? [^0d911da5]. Journal of Endourology (2003). Low credibility.

The clinical role for pentosan polysulfate (PPS) in the prevention of calcium oxalate urolithiasis is not known. Crystallization and aggregation are important steps in calcium oxalate stone formation, and PPS has been shown to inhibit these steps, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, PPS has a role in repairing injured urothelium and inhibiting adhesion to epithelial defects. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study appears warranted to assess the utility of PPS in the prevention of recurrent calcium oxalate stones.

### Dietary and lifestyle factors for primary prevention of nephrolithiasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5742689c]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Dietary and lifestyle factors may play an important role in the increasing prevalence of nephrolithiasis. We aimed to review and quantify the associations between lifestyle factors and incident nephrolithiasis and suggest lifestyle changes for the primary prevention of nephrolithiasis.

Methods

PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched up to May 2019, for observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed modifiable lifestyle factors and risk of nephrolithiasis in adults. Pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using a random effects model. The I 2 statistic was employed to evaluate heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were also conducted whenever possible.

Results

Fifty relevant articles with 1,322,133 participants and 21,030 cases in total were identified. Prominent risk factors for incident stones were body mass index (1.39,1.27–1.52), dietary sodium (1.38, 1.21–1.56), fructose, meat, animal protein, and soda. In contrast, protective factors included fluid intake (0.55, 0.51–0.60), a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) style diet (0.69, 0.64–0.75), alcohol (0.69, 0.56–0.85), water, coffee, tea, vegetables, fruits, dietary fiber, dietary calcium (0.83, 0.76–0.90), and potassium. Vitamin D (1.22, 1.01–1.49) and calcium (1.16, 1.00–1.35) supplementation alone increased the risk of stones in meta-analyses of observational studies, but not in RCTs, where the cosupplementation conferred significant risk.

Conclusions

Several modifiable factors, notably fluid intake, dietary patterns, and obesity, were significantly associated with nephrolithiasis. Long-term RCTs are required to investigate the cost-effectiveness of dietary patterns for stone prevention. The independent and combined effects of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on nephrolithiasis need further elucidation.

### Fresh lemon juice supplementation for the prevention of recurrent stones in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis: a pragmatic, prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpointtrial [^13cf23b4]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis is the most common form of nephrolithiasis. It may affect two to 15 per cent of the general population, with an incidence rate ranging from 114 to 720 new cases reported every year per 100,000 individuals. Without specific pharmacological therapy, 27 to 50 per cent of patients may have stone recurrence over five years. Of note, in 15 per cent of cases recurrence of stones is associated with clinical symptoms and many symptomatic patients require surgical intervention annually.

Kidney stone formation requires crystals to form, grow, aggregate and interact with a non-crystalline organic matrix. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and includes an increased excretion of urinary lithogenic solutes including calcium, oxalate, phosphate, uric acid, and sodium, along with a reduced urinary excretion of inhibitors of crystallization such as citrate and magnesium. Moreover, a reduction or an increase in urinary pH may favour the precipitation of uric acid or calcium phosphate salts, respectively.

In addition to genetic and metabolic factors, also environmental factors including diet play an important role in the development of nephrolithiasis. Diet based on restricted intake of animal proteins and salt, combined with a normal calcium intake, may reduce the risk of stone formation. However, the efficacy in preventing stone recurrences is limited, in particular in chronic stone formers. Potassium citrate is effective in preventing stone recurrence in patients with calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, but approximately one third of treated patients stops the medication because of gastrointestinal disorders such as eructation, bloating or gaseousness, and diarrhoea. Citrus fruits are a natural rich source of citrate and diet supplementation with fresh juice of citrus fruits may represent a valuable alternative option to citrate supply. Amongst the most commonly consumed citrus fruits, lemons contain the greatest concentrations of citric acid. Indeed, citric acid concentration in lemon juice (49·2 g/Kg) exceeds by approximately five-folds the concentration in orange juice. The citrate supplied with the juice that escapes metabolic degradation in vivo is excreted unchanged in the urine where it may prevent the tendency of calcium oxalate salts to precipitate. Moreover, urinary oxalate excretion is not affected by lemon juice, but is increased by orange juice supplementation. This difference probably reflects the greater ascorbic acid concentration in orange compared to lemon juice.

### Association between daily calcium intake and the prevalence of chronic diarrhea: an analysis of NHANES 2005–2010 data [^9666b4e3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the fixed threshold based on dietary guidelines (e.g. < 1 vs. ≥ 1 g/day) did not reach statistical significance, its direction and effect size were consistent with those observed in the continuous and RCS analyses, which suggested a nearly linear inverse association. These findings support, at the population level, the recommendation to gradually increase calcium intake from suboptimal levels toward the guideline-recommended intake (approximately 1,000–1,200 mg/day for adults, depending on age and sex). In practice, a food-first approach is encouraged to increase calcium intake, with a preference for low-fat or fat-free dairy products. For individuals with lactose intolerance, lactose-free milk, yogurt, or hard cheeses can be used as alternatives. Non-dairy sources include calcium-fortified plant-based milk, tofu coagulated with calcium salts, small fish consumed with bones, and certain dark green leafy vegetables. A stepwise increase of approximately 300 mg/day (equivalent to ~ 1 cup of dairy) is a practical approach. If dietary intake remains insufficient, calcium supplements may be considered, typically in divided doses of 200–500 mg of elemental calcium per serving (e.g. calcium carbonate with meals, calcium citrate regardless of meals), while ensuring total calcium intake does not exceed the age-specific tolerable upper intake level. Adequate vitamin D status should also be maintained to support calcium absorption. Individualized assessment is recommended for populations at risk, such as those with a history of kidney stones, hypercalcemia, primary hyperparathyroidism, or advanced chronic kidney disease. Clinically, a 2–4 week trial of increased calcium intake (by 300–600 mg/day) can be implemented, with response evaluated using tools such as the BSFS and monitoring of adverse effects, to inform further adjustments to the intervention.
