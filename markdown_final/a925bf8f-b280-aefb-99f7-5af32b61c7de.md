## Question

what pressure should stockings be while flying

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what pressure graduated compression stockings should have for air travel to prevent deep vein thrombosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether compression is indicated for all travelers or only those at higher risk. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend regarding compression pressure at the ankle. Next, I will examine the randomized trial data that tested specific pressure ranges. After that, I need to consider special populations like pregnancy and those with prior VTE. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note any uncertainties or exceptions, making sure I cite the best available evidence throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk stratification, because I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. For long-distance travel, the baseline risk of symptomatic VTE is low, and most travelers do not benefit from routine prophylaxis; benefits emerge mainly in those with additional risk factors, with risk rising with longer flight durations and cumulative travel time, so recommendations should be individualized rather than universal [^400361ce] [^31703dc7] [^7835eccb].

> Next, I should review authoritative guideline statements on compression pressure. The ACCP recommends properly fitted below-knee graduated compression stockings providing 15–30 mmHg at the ankle for long-distance travelers at increased risk, and advises against routine use in those not at increased risk, which aligns with a risk-stratified approach rather than blanket use [^31703dc7]. The BTS clinical statement similarly advises class 1 stockings with 15–30 mmHg for high-risk travelers, reinforcing the same pressure range and indication framework [^32e7a596]. The CDC Yellow Book notes that graduated compression stockings reduce asymptomatic DVT and are reasonable for high-risk travelers, again reflecting a selective, not routine, strategy [^378b14c6].

> Wait, let me verify the randomized trial data that underpins these pressure recommendations. The pivotal Scurr et al. Lancet trial used class I stockings and showed zero DVT in the stocking arm versus 10% in the control arm, establishing efficacy for that pressure class, though the exact mmHg was not specified in the abstract and the population was older adults on long-haul flights, which supports the concept that moderate compression is effective in higher-risk settings [^0bfc83d7]. A systematic review of flight studies reported that all six randomized trials testing below-knee stockings with ankle pressures of 14–30 mmHg showed a reduction in lower limb venous thrombosis, which directly supports the 15–30 mmHg range as effective in this context [^5d7e0fbd]. The Cochrane review confirms that compression reduces asymptomatic DVT and leg edema without significant adverse effects, although it does not specify a single optimal pressure within the moderate range, underscoring the uncertainty about the exact mmHg within 15–30 [^d7d9d758].

> Hold on, I should verify whether higher pressures are better or if there is a ceiling. Some vascular literature outside travel specifically uses 30–40 mmHg for post-thrombotic syndrome or post-DVT care, but that higher range is not the standard for routine travel prophylaxis and may reduce comfort and compliance without added benefit in low-risk travelers; thus, for flight-related primary prevention, 15–30 mmHg remains the guideline-supported sweet spot balancing efficacy and tolerability [^2f151156] [^31703dc7]. I initially wondered if 20–30 mmHg might be "more protective", but I need to correct that assumption because head-to-head pressure comparisons in flight populations are lacking, and guidelines converge on 15–30 mmHg rather than pushing higher for travel prophylaxis [^31703dc7] [^32e7a596].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with pregnancy. Pregnant travelers have a several-fold increase in VTE risk, and guidelines recommend graduated compression stockings alongside hydration and movement; while exact pressures are not always specified in obstetric guidance, the travel medicine sources align with the 15–30 mmHg range for prophylaxis during long flights, which is reasonable given the physiologic rationale and the general VTE risk increase in pregnancy [^e6976778] [^2d93090e]. For patients with prior VTE or high-risk thrombophilia, expert statements support compression stockings for long-haul travel, and some post-PE guidance even considers pharmacologic prophylaxis in selected cases, again reflecting individualized risk assessment rather than a fixed pressure mandate [^b68c6157] [^fd4504ad].

> Let me consider practical implementation details, because fit and comfort drive adherence. Below-knee stockings are preferred over thigh-high for travel due to better compliance and similar efficacy in pooled analyses, and stockings should be properly sized to deliver the intended gradient; patients should put them on before boarding and keep them on throughout the flight, combining use with ambulation and calf exercises when feasible to maximize benefit [^6477fec1] [^31703dc7]. I should double-check that no major guideline endorses routine use in low-risk travelers, and indeed ACCP and ASH emphasize selective use given minimal absolute benefit and potential inconvenience, reinforcing shared decision-making in borderline cases [^31703dc7] [^400361ce].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. For air travel, the recommended compression pressure is 15–30 mmHg at the ankle, using properly fitted below-knee graduated compression stockings, and this is advised for travelers at increased risk of VTE on flights longer than about 4–6 hours; routine use is not recommended for low-risk travelers, and the decision should be individualized based on risk factors, flight duration, and patient preferences [^31703dc7] [^32e7a596] [^400361ce]. The evidence base supports this range for reducing asymptomatic DVT and edema without significant adverse effects, while acknowledging that the exact optimal pressure within 15–30 mmHg has not been definitively established in head-to-head trials [^d7d9d758] [^5d7e0fbd].

---

For flights over 4 hours, **15–30 mmHg** graduated compression stockings are recommended for travelers at **increased risk** of venous thromboembolism (VTE) [^31703dc7] [^32e7a596]. For low-risk travelers, **routine use is not advised** [^400361ce] [^31703dc7]. Stockings should be **below-knee, properly fitted, and worn during travel** to reduce asymptomatic DVT and leg edema without significant adverse effects [^d7d9d758] [^6477fec1].

---

## Recommended compression pressure

- **15–30 mmHg**: The ACCP and BTS recommend this range for long-distance travelers at increased VTE risk [^31703dc7] [^32e7a596].

- **Below-knee style**: Preferred for comfort and compliance; knee-length stockings are as effective as thigh-length for DVT prevention [^6477fec1].

- **Proper fit**: Essential to avoid discomfort or harm; ill-fitting stockings can cause skin irritation or ischemia.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting compression stockings

- **Cochrane review**: High-quality evidence shows compression stockings reduce asymptomatic DVT (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.04–0.25) and leg edema on flights > 4 hours [^d7d9d758].

- **Scurr et al. (2001)**: Class I stockings eliminated DVT in long-haul travelers, vs 10% in controls [^0bfc83d7].

- **NZATT study**: 1% VTE incidence after long flights; risk rose with additional factors, supporting selective prophylaxis [^ecb8d76c].

---

## Guidelines and expert recommendations

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ACCP | 15–30 mmHg below-knee stockings for travelers at increased VTE risk; not routine for low-risk travelers [^31703dc7] |
| BTS | Class 1 (15–30 mmHg) below-knee stockings for high-risk travelers; not routine for low-risk travelers [^32e7a596] |
| CDC | GCS reduce asymptomatic DVT; consider for high-risk travelers [^378b14c6] |
| ASH | Conditional recommendation for GCS in high-risk travelers; not routine for low-risk travelers [^400361ce] |

---

## Risks and contraindications

- **Minimal risks**: Skin irritation, discomfort, or minor swelling; serious adverse effects are rare [^d7d9d758].

- **Contraindications**: Peripheral arterial disease, severe dermatitis, open wounds, or significant edema.

- **Comfort**: Higher pressures may reduce compliance; 15–20 mmHg is often better tolerated for long wear.

---

## Practical considerations

- **Fit**: Measure calf and ankle circumference to select the correct size; improper fit reduces efficacy and comfort.

- **Duration**: Wear throughout the flight and remove after arrival or after a short rest period.

- **Alternatives**: For high-risk patients who cannot use stockings, consider LMWH or DOACs per clinician judgment [^378b14c6] [^32e7a596].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **15–30 mmHg**: Recommended for travelers at increased VTE risk on flights > 4 hours [^31703dc7] [^32e7a596].

- **Not routine**: Not recommended for low-risk travelers due to minimal benefit [^400361ce] [^31703dc7].

- **Below-knee, well-fitted**: Preferred style to maximize comfort and adherence [^6477fec1].

---

Compression stockings at **15–30 mmHg** are effective for reducing asymptomatic DVT and edema in at-risk travelers on long flights, but are not recommended for routine use in low-risk individuals. Proper fit and comfort are key to adherence and benefit.

### Compression stockings for preventing deep vein thrombosis in airline passengers [^d7d9d758]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Air travel might increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). It has been suggested that wearing compression stockings might reduce this risk. This is an update of the review first published in 2006.

Objectives

To assess the effects of wearing compression stockings versus not wearing them for preventing DVT in people travelling on flights lasting at least four hours.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (10 February 2016). In addition, the CIS searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CENTRAL (2016, Issue 1)).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of compression stockings versus no stockings in passengers on flights lasting at least four hours. Trials in which passengers wore a stocking on one leg but not the other, or those comparing stockings and another intervention were also eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. We sought additional information from trialists where necessary.

Main Results

One new study that fulfilled the inclusion criteria was identified for this update. Eleven randomised trials (n = 2906) were included in this review: nine (n = 2821) compared wearing graduated compression stockings on both legs versus not wearing them; one trial (n = 50) compared wearing graduated compression tights versus not wearing them; and one trial (n = 35) compared wearing a graduated compression stocking on one leg for the outbound flight and on the other leg on the return flight. Eight trials included people judged to be at low or medium risk of developing DVT (n = 1598) and two included high-risk participants (n = 1273). All flights had a duration of more than five hours. Fifty of 2637 participants with follow-up data available in the trials of wearing compression stockings on both legs had a symptomless DVT; three wore stockings, 47 did not (odds ratio (OR) 0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.25, P < 0.001; high-quality evidence). There were no symptomless DVTs in three trials. Sixteen of 1804 people developed superficial vein thrombosis, four wore stockings, 12 did not (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.13, P = 0.09; moderate-quality evidence). No deaths, pulmonary emboli or symptomatic DVTs were reported. Wearing stockings had a significant impact in reducing oedema (mean difference (MD) -4.72, 95% CI -4.91 to -4.52; based on six trials; low-quality evidence). A further two trials showed reduced oedema in the stockings group but could not be included in the meta-analysis as they used different methods to measure oedema. No significant adverse effects were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that airline passengers similar to those in this review can expect a substantial reduction in the incidence of symptomless DVT and low-quality evidence that leg oedema is reduced if they wear compression stockings. Quality was limited by the way that oedema was measured. There is moderate-quality evidence that superficial vein thrombosis may be reduced if passengers wear compression stockings. We cannot assess the effect of wearing stockings on death, pulmonary embolism or symptomatic DVT because no such events occurred in these trials. Randomised trials to assess these outcomes would need to include a very large number of people.

Background

Air travel might increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). It has been suggested that wearing compression stockings might reduce this risk.

Objectives

To assess the effects of wearing compression stockings versus not wearing them among people travelling on flights lasting at least four hours.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group's Specialized Register (January 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2005), EMBASE (January 1980 to December 2005) and several other electronic or grey literature sources, detailed in full in the review. The most recent searches were done in January 2006.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of compression stockings versus no stockings in passengers on flights lasting at least four hours. Trials in which passengers wore a stocking on one leg but not the other, or those comparing stockings and another intervention were also eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two authors independently assessed the quality of each study and extracted data. We sought additional information from trialists.

Main Results

Ten randomized trials (n = 2856) were included; nine (n = 2821) compared wearing stockings on both legs versus not wearing them, and one (n = 35) compared wearing a stocking on one leg for the outbound flight and on the other leg on the return flight. Of the nine trials, seven included people judged to be at low or medium risk (n = 1548) and two included high risk participants (n = 1273). All flights lasted at least seven hours. Fifty of 2637 participants with follow-up data available in the trials of wearing stockings on both legs had a symptomless DVT; three wore stockings, 47 did not (odds ratio 0.10, 95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.25, P < 0.00001). There were no symptomless DVTs in three trials. No deaths, pulmonary emboli or symptomatic DVTs were reported. Wearing stockings had a significant impact in reducing oedema (based on six trials). No significant adverse effects were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Airline passengers similar to those in this review can expect a substantial reduction in the incidence of symptomless DVT and leg oedema if they wear compression stockings. We cannot assess the effect of wearing stockings on death, pulmonary embolus or symptomatic DVT because no such events occurred in these trials. Randomized trials to assess these outcomes would need to include a very large number of people.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis for long-distance air travel — In "long-distance (> 4 hours) travelers without risk factors for VTE", the panel "suggests not using graduated compression stockings, LMWH, or aspirin for VTE prophylaxis (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects)", and the expected benefit from stockings is "on the order of 1 less proximal DVT episode per 2000 to 5000 persons using stockings during a long flight"; because this is a conditional recommendation, "patient involvement in a shared decision-making process" may be required when applying it to individuals such as a "healthy male adult, without VTE risk factors" planning a long flight.

### Air travel and venous thromboembolism: a systematic review [^b64e59ab]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Despite multiple attempts to document and quantify the danger of venous thromboembolism (VTE) following prolonged travel, there is still uncertainty about the magnitude of risk and what can be done to lower it.

Objectives

To review the methodologic strength of the literature, estimate the risk of travel-related VTE, evaluate the efficacy of preventive treatments, and develop evidence-based recommendations for practice.

Data Sources

Studies identified from MEDLINE from 1966 through December 2005, supplemented by a review of the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and relevant bibliographies.

Study Selection

We included all clinical studies that either reported primary data concerning travel as a risk factor for VTE or tested preventive measures for travel-related VTE.

Data Extraction and Analysis

Two reviewers reviewed each study independently to assess inclusion criteria, classify research design, and rate methodologic features. The effect of methodologic differences, VTE risk, and travel duration on VTE rate was evaluated using a logistic regression model.

Data Synthesis

Twenty-four published reports, totaling 25 studies, met inclusion criteria (6 case-control studies, 10 cohort studies, and 9 randomized controlled trials). Method of screening for VTE [screening ultrasound compared to usual clinical care, odds ratio (OR) 390], outcome measure [all VTE compared to pulmonary embolism (PE) only, OR 21], duration of travel (< 6 hours compared to 6–8 hours, OR 0.011), and clinical risk ("higher" risk travelers compared to "lower", OR 3.6) were significantly related to VTE rate. Clinical VTE after prolonged travel is rare [27 PE per million flights diagnosed through usual clinical care, 0.05% symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed through screening ultrasounds], but asymptomatic thrombi of uncertain clinical significance are more common. Graduated compression stockings prevented travel-related VTE (P < 0.05 in 4 of 6 studies), aspirin did not, and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) showed a trend toward efficacy in one study.

Conclusions

All travelers, regardless of VTE risk, should avoid dehydration and frequently exercise leg muscles. Travelers on a flight of less than 6 hours and those with no known risk factors for VTE, regardless of the duration of the flight, do not need DVT prophylaxis. Travelers with 1 or more risk factors for VTE should consider graduated compression stockings and/or LMWH for flights longer than 6 hours.

### Venous thromboembolic complications following air travel: what's the quantitative risk? A literature review [^5d7e0fbd]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To quantify the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) following air travel and assess methods of prevention.

Design

Review of literature.

Methods

We reviewed Pubmed, Medline, Embase and Cochrane Databases for studies that have assessed the risk of VTE associated with air travel.

Results

There is an association of VTE with air travel with pooled odds ratio of 1.59 (confidence interval 1.04–2.43) from three case control studies and relative risk of 2.93 (confidence interval 1.5–5.58) from two controlled cohort studies. The incidence of symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) is extremely low but there is substantial increase when the distance travelled is more than 5,000 miles (1.5 PE per million passengers) or time of flight is more than 8h duration (2.57 PE per million passengers). The quantitative risk of lower limb venous thrombosis in high-risk subjects is 5% per flight and 1.6% per flight for low risk subjects following long haul flights. All six randomised trials to test the below knee compression stockings with ankle pressures of 14–30 mmHg have shown reduction in lower limb venous thrombosis.

Conclusion

VTE is more common in those with additional risk factors when the risk is about 5% per air travel for long haul flights. Class I or II below knee compression stockings are effective in the prevention of lower limb venous thrombosis.

### Travel-associated venous thromboembolism [^7835eccb]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Long-distance travel is assumed to be a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, the available data have not clearly demonstrated the strength of this relationship, nor have they shown evidence for the role of thromboprophylaxis.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of the literature. We also summarized available guidelines from 5 groups.

Results

We found 18 studies that addressed this question. Based on the data presented in the review, we conclude that there is an association between VTE and length of travel, but this association is mild to moderate in effect size with odds ratios between 1.1 and 4. A dose-response relationship between VTE and travel time was identified, with a 26% higher risk for every 2 h of air travel (P = 0.005) starting after 4 h. The quality of evidence for both travel length and thromboprophylaxis was low. However, low-risk prophylactic measures such as graduated compression stockings were shown to be effective in VTE prevention. There is heterogeneity among the different practice guidelines. The guidelines generally concur that no prophylaxis is necessary in travelers without known thrombosis risk factors and advocate for conservative treatment such as compression stockings over pharmacologic prophylaxis.

Conclusions

We conclude air travel is a risk factor for VTE and that there is a dose relationship starting at 4 h. For patients with risk factors, graduated compression stockings are effective prophylaxis.

### Guidelines on travel-related venous thrombosis [^4c2a2c2c]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Long duration travel is a weak risk factor for the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The incidence of VTE after flights of > 4 h is 1 in 4656 and for flights of more than 8 h in low and intermediate risk flyers is around 0.5%. Severe symptomatic pulmonary embolism in the period immediately after travel is extremely rare after flights of < 8 h. In flights over 12 h the rate is 5 per million. VTE may be attributable to travel if it occurs up to 8 weeks following the journey. The risk of travel-related thrombosis is higher in individuals with pre-existing risk factors for the development of VTE. There is no evidence for an association between dehydration and travel-associated VTE and so whilst maintaining good hydration is unlikely to be harmful it cannot be strongly recommended for prevention of thrombosis (recommendation grade 2, level of evidence, B). There is indirect evidence that maintaining mobility may prevent VTE and, in view of the likely pathogenesis of travel-related VTE, maintaining mobility is a reasonable precaution for all travellers on journeys over 3 h (2B). Global use of compression stockings and anticoagulants for long distance travel is not indicated (1C). Assessment of risk should be made on an individual basis but it is likely that recent major surgery (within 1 month), active malignancy, previous unprovoked VTE, previous travel-related VTE with no associated temporary risk factor or presence of more than one risk factor identifies those travellers at highest thrombosis risk (1C). Travellers at the highest risk of travel-related thrombosis undertaking journeys of > 3 h should wear well fitted below knee compression hosiery (2B). Where pharmacological prophylaxis is considered appropriate, anticoagulants as opposed to anti-platelet drugs are recommended based on the observation that, in other clinical scenarios, they provide more effective thromboprophylaxis. Usual contraindications to any form of thromboprophylaxis need to be borne in mind (2C).

### Air travel and thrombosis [^b5aef5f8]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

The current literature suggests a weak association between long-distance travel and the development of asymptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE). Most of the data available relate to air travel and suggest that the risk is largely confined to asymptomatic calf vein thrombosis in passengers with additional risk factors for VTE, travelling for more than 8 h. The risk of both symptomatic and fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) is very small. The causal role of travel-related factors (e.g. stasis, dehydration, cramped seats and hypobaric hypoxia) is not yet proved but, given the plausible risk-free benefit, all passengers should be advised to maintain adequate hydration and exercise. There is currently no evidence for 'routine' thromboprophylaxis using stockings or drugs. In passengers with additional risk factors for VTE, thromboprophylaxis in the form of below-knee graduated compression stockings (providing 15–30 mmHg at the ankle) and/or prophylactic dose low-molecular-weight heparin may be considered. The evidence does not support the use of aspirin, which is associated with a significant rate of adverse gastrointestinal effects.

### Medical advice for commercial air travel [^67c4b473]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Air travel is generally safe, but the flight environment poses unique physiologic challenges such as relative hypoxia that may trigger adverse myocardial or pulmonary outcomes. To optimize health outcomes, communication must take place between the traveler, family physician, and airline carrier when there is any doubt about fitness for air travel. Travelers should carry current medications in their original containers and a list of their medical conditions and allergies; they should adjust timing of medications as needed based on time zone changes. The Hypoxia Altitude Simulation Test can be used to determine specific in-flight oxygen requirements for patients who have pulmonary complications or for those for whom safe air travel remains in doubt. Patients with pulmonary conditions who are unable to walk 50 m or for those whose usual oxygen requirements exceed 4 L per minute should be advised not to fly. Trapped gases that expand at high altitude can cause problems for travelers with recent surgery; casting; ear, nose, and throat issues; or dental issues. Insulin requirements may change based on duration and direction of travel. Travelers can minimize risk for deep venous thrombosis by adequately hydrating, avoiding alcohol, walking for 10 to 15 minutes every two hours of travel time, and performing seated isometric exercises. Wearing compression stockings can prevent asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis and superficial venous thrombosis for flights five hours or longer in duration. Physicians and travelers can review relevant pretravel health information, including required and recommended immunizations, health concerns, and other travel resources appropriate for any destination worldwide on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention travel website.

Graduated compression stockings (GCS) and pharmacologic prophylaxis for long-distance travelers at high risk — Graduated compression stockings appear to reduce asymptomatic DVT in travelers and are generally well tolerated. When the potential benefits of pharmacologic prophylaxis outweigh the possible adverse effects, anticoagulants rather than antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin) are recommended. There is no formally recommended dose for low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), but enoxaparin 40 mg or 1 mg/ kg SC about 4 hours before the flight has been suggested. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) currently have no evidence base for prevention of travel-associated VTE and any use would be off-label.

Prevention of VTE during air travel

The risk of VTE during air travel appears low overall, and prophylaxis is unnecessary for most travellers. Prolonged travel (exceeding 6 hours) and/or the coexistence of another risk factor for VTE increase the risk. The incidence of symptomatic VTE has been estimated at 0.5% on flights over 12 hours, but asymptomatic rates may be higher. The reasons for the increased risk are not entirely clear. Potential contributory factors include prolonged immobility and dehydration, but these are not conclusively proven. Other risk factors for VTE such as obesity, recent surgery, pregnancy, malignancy and previous VTE all increase the overall risk for travel-related VTE and may necessitate additional prophylaxis.

General measures, including getting up and walking around where possible every 2–3 hours; ankle and calf exercises and avoidance of alcohol or sedating drugs; are advisable for most travellers. Although there is no conclusive evidence that flying causes dehydration, the fall in cabin humidity along with alcohol consumption and reduced fluid intake, may increase the risk on long haul flights. Remaining well hydrated is, therefore, advisable. Wearing graduated compression stockings during travel may reduce the incidence of deep venous thrombosis. Data are sparse regarding the method or duration of pharmacological prophylaxis, and recommendations rely on consensus expert opinion. Physicians may wish to recommend pharmacological prophylaxis for those at higher risk of VTE, for example an obese patient planning a flight exceeding 6 hours with a history of recent surgery. The risks of prophylaxis are thought to be low. There is limited evidence for LMWH as prophylaxis. There is no formally recommended dose, but enoxaparin 40 mg at a dose of 40 mg or weight based 1 mg/kg injected once 4–5 hours before the flight has been suggested. The use of factor Xa inhibitors is off-licence in this situation and currently has no evidence base.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 6 family travel [^e6976778]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Pregnant travelers — air travel — most commercial airlines allow flying until 36 weeks' gestation, though some limit international travel earlier or require documentation, and travelers should check with airlines and consider the gestational age for both departure and return dates. Most commercial jetliner cabins are pressurized to an equivalent outside air pressure of 1,800–2,500 m (approximately 6,000–8,000 ft) above sea level; the lower oxygen tension under these conditions likely will not cause fetal problems in a normal pregnancy, but pregnancies complicated by conditions exacerbated by hypoxia, including severe anemia (hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL), could experience adverse effects associated with low arterial oxygen saturation. The pregnant traveler might benefit from an upgrade in airline seating and should seek convenient and practical accommodations, should consider selecting aisle seating when possible, and should wear loose-fitting clothing and comfortable shoes to enable movement during flights. Some experts report that the risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is at least 5 times greater among pregnant than non-pregnant women, although the absolute risk is low, and to help prevent DVT, pregnant travelers should stay hydrated, stretch frequently, walk and perform isometric leg exercises, and wear graduated compression stockings. Cosmic radiation during air travel poses little threat to the fetus but might be a consideration for pregnant travelers who fly frequently.

Prevention of VTE during air travel

See table 1.

Table 1
Summary of risk factors for VTE during air travel

Limit the risk of dehydration with adequate fluid intake.
Avoid alcohol.
Keep mobile, if possible, by walking around or doing seat-based exercises once an hour.
Consider graduated compression stockings (class 1 with 15–30 mm Hg).
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or a Direct Acting Oral Anticoagulant (DOAC) are advised for both outward and return long haul flights (long haul defined as flights of 6–12 hours) in high-risk patients including those with a history of VTE; local policy should be followed regarding liaison with primary care and/or haematology services to teach the patient how to administer the injection and dispose safely of the equipment. There is no formally recommended dose, but enoxaparin at a dose of 40 mg or weight based 1 mg/kg injected once 4–5 hours before the flight has been suggested.
The prophylactic doses of the DOAC may also be used.
All patients with a recent (< 6 weeks) history of VTE, especially any who presented with significant right ventricular strain and decompensation should be reassessed before air travel.

Air travel after VTE

Air travel should be delayed for 2 weeks after a diagnosis of DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE).

Pulmonary hypertension

Those in New York Heart Association (NYHA) WHO functional class 3 or 4 are usually advised to have in-flight oxygen. If there is no evidence of hypercapnia it seems reasonable to suggest 2 L/min by nasal cannulae. If there are concerns about hypercapnia, HCT should be considered if available.
Those eligible for LTOT (sea level PaO 2 < 8 kPa at rest on air) should have in flight oxygen at double the flow rate recommended at sea level, provided there is no evidence of hypercapnia.

Lung cancer and mesothelioma

Patients undergoing chemotherapy should not travel while they are at increased risk of infection or suffering from significant side effects, such as vomiting.

LMWH or a DOAC are advised for both outward and return long haul flights (long haul defined as flights of 6–12 hours) in high-risk patients including those with a history of VTE; local policy should be followed regarding liaison with primary care and/or haematology services to teach the patient how to administer the injection and dispose safely of the equipment. There is no formally recommended dose, but enoxaparin at a dose of 40 mg or weight based 1 mg/kg injected once 4–5 hours before the flight has been suggested.
The prophylactic doses of the DOAC may also be used.
All patients with a recent (< 6 weeks) history of VTE, especially any who presented with significant right ventricular strain and decompensation should be reassessed before air travel.

Air travel after VTE

Although the risks of prolonged air travel and development of VTE are well known, there are fewer data on the risks associated with flying after a diagnosis of VTE.

A patient with a confirmed diagnosis of PE is highly likely to start anticoagulation, with the aim of preventing the formation of new deep venous thrombi and further PEs. There is a general acceptance that flying immediately after a diagnosis of PE/DVT should be avoided. It appears reasonable to assume that the sooner air travel occurs after a PE the greater the likelihood that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction will exacerbate ventilation-perfusion mismatch and raise pulmonary pressures, affecting cardiac output.

Some authors, but not all, suggest that most clots are resolved after 14–21 days. Consensus opinion is to delay air travel, if possible, usually for at least 2 weeks, although there are no concrete data to support a safe time interval. Clearly the risk-benefit ratio needs to be assessed if more urgent air travel is needed. Clot resolution depends principally on in vivo fibrinolysis. Consideration should be given to the severity of the initial presentation. It is good practice, before any proposed air travel, to reassess clinically a patient who has presented with significant right ventricular strain and decompensation.

The probability of recurrent VTE while anticoagulated is extremely low. Recovered, stable patients who remain on anticoagulation should be reassured accordingly and advised to follow the above general measures.

### Annotation: travel and thrombosis [^cf7b206b]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Travel appears to be a weak risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is more relevant for passengers with additional VTE risk factors. The association is not limited to air travel and is related to duration of travel. Life-threatening pulmonary embolism (PE) is rare. There is limited evidence to support interventions, including 'sensible measures', graduated compression stockings (GCS) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). It is difficult to confidently define a population who would benefit from thromboprophylaxis and no validated risk assessment exists for this purpose. LMWH has traditionally been used for flight thromboprophylaxis but a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) would be a more appealing oral option.

### The pretravel consultation [^2238f7f2]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The increase in travel and travel medicine knowledge over the past 30 years makes pretravel counseling an essential part of comprehensive family medicine. Effective counseling begins with assessment of individual and itinerary-based risks, using a growing body of evidence-based decision-support tools and resources. Counseling recommendations should be tailored to the patient's risk tolerance and experience. An essential component of the pretravel consultation includes reviewing routine and destination-specific immunizations. In addition to implementing behavioral adaptations, travelers can guard against vectorborne disease by using N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET, 30%), a safe and effective insect repellent. Patients should also receive malarial chemoprophylaxis when traveling to areas of risk. Proper precautions can reduce the risk of food- and waterborne disease. Travelers should take appropriate precautions when traveling to high altitudes. Strategies for minimizing the risk of deep venous thrombosis during air travel include keeping mobile and wearing compression stockings. Accident avoidance and coping strategies for health problems that occur while abroad are also important components of the pretravel consultation.

Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion.

The absolute differences in the effects of compression devices and stockings in patient-important outcomes (thrombotic events and bleeding) are likely small. Thus, the final decision should consider contextual factors, such as the cost of the options and their availability. Also, some patients may prefer 1 option over the other, since compression devices use intermittent pression but are typically noisy and may interrupt sleep. On the other hand, stockings apply a continuous pressure that may be uncomfortable for some patients. Both, compression devices and stockings should be used according to the manufacturer's instructions to minimize harms.

In critically and medically ill patients who require pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, should we use a short period of prophylaxis or an extended period?

Recommendation 16

In acutely critically and medically ill patients who require pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, the ASH Latin American Guideline Panel suggests using a short period of prophylaxis (inpatients) over an extended period (inpatients and extended-duration outpatients) (conditional recommendation based on moderate certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁⨁⨁◯).

Summary of the evidence.

No additional evidence on the efficacy or safety of the intervention was identified. The EtD framework is shown online at.

Justification.

This recommendation changed its strength. The original panel made a strong recommendation in favor of a short prophylaxis, whereas the Latin American panel made a conditional recommendation in the same direction. The panel considered that there was some uncertainty regarding the baseline risk of VTE. Although for most patient the baseline risk of VTE is small, and thus, an extended prophylaxis will not result in a significant benefit, there are some patients with a higher baseline risk of VTE who maintain this risk after discharge, especially if they need a long rehabilitation and are not able to ambulate. Those patients may benefit from a longer prophylaxis.

Special considerations for travelers with chronic illnesses — Venous thromboembolism (VTE: deep venous thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary embolism [PE]) indicate that air travel is a risk factor, with increasing risk by duration "beginning 4 hours duration"; graded compression stockings are effective; prior VTE increases recurrence risk with air travel "of 4 hours or more", and travelers "should discuss need for anticoagulation" for prolonged air, car, or train travel "of 4 hours or more". For recent events, "delay travel until asymptomatic and stable on oral anticoagulants" after recent DVT with treating‑physician clearance, and "defer travel if recent PE (≤ 4 days since the event)" or if not on stable anticoagulation or with abnormal PaO2 on room air.

### Compression stockings for preventing deep venous… [^20d6bfdd]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Are compression stockings safe and effective for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis in airline passengers. Evidence-Based Answer Compression stockings are effective at reducing asymptomatic DVT in airline passengers taking flights longer than five hours in both high-risk and low-risk populations. 1 It is unclear if compression stockings prevent symptomatic DVT, pulmonary embolism, or death. There are no significant adverse events associated with their use. Practice Pointers DVT occurs through the formation of a blood clot in the deep veins, typically within the lower extremities. This can ultimately lead to a PE, a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Prolonged periods of immobility that occur during air travel are a risk factor for the development of venous thromboembolism.

This Cochrane review included nine randomized trials of 2, 821 patients comparing the use of bilateral, below-the-knee compression stockings vs. no stockings during flights lasting more than five hours. The follow-up period was immediately postflight through 48 hours postflight. Presence of DVT was assessed by ultrasonography or d-dimer and fibrinogen testing. Both groups demonstrated lower rates of asymptomatic DVT with compression stockings, but those in the high-risk population experienced a greater benefit. Four trials studied ankle compression strength of 20 to 30 mm Hg, and five trials studied over-the-counter compression strength of 10 to 20 mm Hg. The ideal compression strength could not be determined. Citing issues of cost and uncertain benefits, the American Society of Hematology advises against the routine use of compression stockings for low-risk travelers.

However, for long-distance travelers at high risk of VTE, the ASH recommends compression stockings or low-molecular-weight heparin for flights longer than four hours, or aspirin for those who are unable to tolerate those two options. 3 Although the optimal compression strength remains uncertain, this intervention is unlikely to be harmful. Insurance may cover compression stockings for specific medical conditions, and one pair typically costs $10 to $30 when bought over the counter. The practice recommendations in this activity are available at http: //www. cochrane. org/CD004002.

American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines for long-distance travelers — For long-distance travelers (> 6 hours travel) at increased risk of VTE, the ACCP recommends frequent ambulation, calf muscle exercise, sitting in an aisle seat, and using properly fitted below-the-knee GCS that provide 15–30 mmHg of pressure at the ankle during travel (grade 2C: weak recommendations, low or very low-quality evidence). For long-distance travelers not at increased risk of VTE, use of GCS is not recommended, and ACCP advises against the use of aspirin or anticoagulants to prevent VTE in long-distance travelers.

Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion.

In terms of prevention of VTE events, both LMWH and UFH have very similar effects. The same is true for their bleeding risk. However, in settings where the price of LMWH and its availability are not concerns, this option probably represents a more convenient alternative for patients and providers, since it requires only a single subcutaneous injection every day.

In critically and medically ill patients who cannot receive pharmacological prophylaxis, should we use mechanical prophylaxis?

Recommendation 14

In acutely critically and medically ill patients who cannot receive pharmacological prophylaxis, the ASH Latin American Guideline Panel suggests using mechanical prophylaxis over no prophylaxis (conditional recommendation based on moderate certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁⨁⨁◯).

Summary of the evidence.

No additional evidence on the efficacy or safety of the intervention was identified. The EtD framework is shown online at.

Justification.

This recommendation did not change its direction or its strength. The panel considered that mechanical prophylaxis, especially compression stockings, is generally available within the region.

Conclusion.

From a clinical standpoint, the most frequent reason to not be able to receive pharmacologic prophylaxis (heparins) is an increased risk of bleeding. In those scenarios, mechanical prophylaxis offers a small reduction of the VTE risk with no increase in the risk of bleeding. However, it is important to acknowledge that the risk of bleeding changes during the evolution of the disease. The risk typically decreases during hospitalization once the underlying factors or conditions are stabilized or resolved. The same is true with the risk of VTE. Once patients improve their condition and they can ambulate, the baseline risk of VTE sharply decreases. Therefore, clinicians should periodically reassess the decision regarding the use of mechanical prophylaxis and decide whether to switch to pharmacological prophylaxis or discontinue prophylaxis according to the clinical circumstances and patients' preferences.

In critically and medically ill patients who need mechanical prophylaxis, should we use pneumatic compression devices or graduated compression stockings?

Recommendation 15

In acutely critically and medically ill patients who need mechanical prophylaxis, the ASH Latin American Guideline Panel suggests using either pneumatic compression devices or graduated compression stockings (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Summary of the evidence.

No additional evidence on the efficacy or safety of the intervention was identified. The EtD framework is shown online at.

Justification.

This recommendation did not change its direction or its strength. The panel considered that, in general, compression stockings are more generally available than compression devices within the region.

### Knee versus thigh length graduated compression stockings for prevention of deep venous thrombosis: a systematic review [^6477fec1]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Graduated compression stockings are a valuable means of thrombo-prophylaxis but it is unclear whether knee-length (KL) or thigh length (TL) stockings are more effective. The aim of this review was to systematically analyse randomised controlled trials that have evaluated stocking length and efficacy of thromboprophylaxis.

Method

A systematic review of the literature was undertaken. Clinical trials on hospitalised populations and passengers on long haul flights were selected according to specific criteria and analysed to generate summated data.

Results

14 randomized control trials were analysed. Thirty six of 1568 (2.3%) participants randomised to KL stockings developed a deep venous thrombosis, compared with 79 of 1696 (5%) in the TL control/thigh length group. Substantial heterogeneity was observed amongst trials. KL stockings had a significant effect to reduce the incidence of DVT in long haul flight passengers, odds ration 0.08 (95%CI 0.03–0.22). In hospitalised patients KL stockings did not appear to be far worse than TL stockings, odds ratio 1.01 (95%CI 0.35–2.90). For combined passengers and patients, there was a benefit in favour of KL stockings, weighted odds ratio 0.45 (95% CI 0.30–0.68).

Conclusion

KL graduated stockings can be as effective as TL stockings for the prevention of DVT, whilst offering advantages in terms of patient compliance and cost.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: prophylaxis for hospitalized and nonhospitalized medical patients [^21f91693]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the third most common vascular disease. Medical inpatients, long-term care residents, persons with minor injuries, and long-distance travelers are at increased risk.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) intend to support patients, clinicians, and others in decisions about preventing VTE in these groups.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline-development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and adult patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 19 recommendations for acutely ill and critically ill medical inpatients, people in long-term care facilities, outpatients with minor injuries, and long-distance travelers.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations included provision of pharmacological VTE prophylaxis in acutely or critically ill inpatients at acceptable bleeding risk, use of mechanical prophylaxis when bleeding risk is unacceptable, against the use of direct oral anticoagulants during hospitalization, and against extending pharmacological prophylaxis after hospital discharge. Conditional recommendations included not to use VTE prophylaxis routinely in long-term care patients or outpatients with minor VTE risk factors. The panel conditionally recommended use of graduated compression stockings or low-molecular-weight heparin in long-distance travelers only if they are at high risk for VTE.

### Clinical and biochemical footprints of inherited metabolic disease. XVI. hematological abnormalities [^f2990b78]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

A long-haul flight is generally accepted as a flight duration of > 4 h. It is estimated that the relative risk of thrombosis during and immediately after a long-haul flight is doubled, which translates into only a very minor increase in the absolute risk of thrombosis. Nonetheless, the risk of VTE related to air travel is widely publicized, and very much in the public eye, making it a common question asked of hematologists. In order to reduce the risk of VTE, people with thrombophilia should be advised to stay mobile during the flight, stay well hydrated, avoid alcohol and sedative drugs, and wear compression stockings. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is very rarely indicated.

It is particularly worth mentioning that pediatric VTE is becoming increasingly common. The vast majority of pediatric VTE affects hospitalized children with underlying medical illness. Evidence suggests that children with IMDs make up a proportion of this, for example in a large study in the US, children with metabolic disorders made up 17% of children with a thrombotic event. Typically regarded as a disease of adults, there may be less awareness among pediatricians of VTE, and there is little evidence base on which to make recommendations. Ideally, each pediatric hospital should have a thromboprophylaxis risk assessment guideline to direct thromboprophylaxis, as this has been shown to greatly improve the rates of thromboprophylaxis provided to high-risk patients.

European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

It should be noted that some sporting or other leisure activities are associated with direct bodily contact or prone to trauma, and as such of major bleeding. Such activities should generally be avoided for the duration of anticoagulant therapy, as has also been advised for patients with atrial fibrillation. Personalized anticoagulation schedules during the long-term anticoagulation phase may be discussed on an individual basis with high-level athletes. These may include consideration of occasional anticoagulation dose delays or omission prior to high-risk activities.

Long-haul air travel is associated with an increased risk of PE after discontinuation of anticoagulation. We propose the use of either compression stockings or prophylactic intensity anticoagulation in all patients with prior PE who have discontinued anticoagulant therapy and plan long-haul air flights (> 4 h). Twelve of the 16 panel members would prescribe a NOAC when it is decided to treat with pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, while four preferred low molecular weight heparin. Fifteen of 16 panel members would start pharmacological thromboprophylaxis on the day of the flight rather than the day before, and 10 would extend the duration of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis to 2–4 days following the flight in light of the increased risk of VTE that may persist for several days.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 746 summary: air travel during pregnancy [^4079ec4e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

In the absence of obstetric or medical complications, occasional air travel is safe for pregnant women. Pregnant women can fly safely, observing the same precautions for air travel as the general population. Because severe air turbulence cannot be predicted and the subsequent risk for trauma is significant should this occur, pregnant women should be instructed to use their seat belts continuously while seated. Despite a lack of evidence associating lower extremity edema and venous thrombotic events with air travel during pregnancy, certain preventive measures can be used to minimize these risks, including use of support stockings and periodic movement of the lower extremities, avoidance of restrictive clothing, occasional ambulation, and maintenance of adequate hydration. For most air travelers, the risks to the fetus from exposure to cosmic radiation are negligible. However, aircrew or frequent flyers may exceed these limits. The Federal Aviation Administration and the International Commission on Radiological Protection consider aircrew to be occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation and recommend that they be informed about radiation exposure and health risks.

### Frequency and prevention of symptomless deep-vein thrombosis in long-haul flights: a randomised trial [^0bfc83d7]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

The true frequency of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) during long-haul air travel is unknown. We sought to determine the frequency of DVT in the lower limb during long-haul economy-class air travel and the efficacy of graduated elastic compression stockings in its prevention.

Methods

We recruited 89 male and 142 female passengers over 50 years of age with no history of thromboembolic problems. Passengers were randomly allocated to one of two groups: one group wore class-I below-knee graduated elastic compression stockings, the other group did not. All the passengers made journeys lasting more than 8 h per flight (median total duration 24 h), returning to the UK within 6 weeks. Duplex ultrasonography was used to assess the deep veins before and after travel. Blood samples were analysed for two specific common gene mutations, factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin G20210A (PGM), which predispose to venous thromboembolism. Asensitive D-dimer assay was used to screen for the development of recent thrombosis.

Findings

12/116 passengers (10%; 95% CI 4.8–16.0%) developed symptomless DVT in the calf (five men, seven women). None of these passengers wore elastic compression stockings, and two were heterozygous for FVL. Four further patients who wore elastic compression stockings, had varicose veins and developed superficial thrombophlebitis. One of these passengers was heterozygous for both FVL and PGM. None of the passengers who wore class-I compression stockings developed DVT (95% CI 0–3.2%).

Interpretation

We conclude that symptomless DVT might occur in up to 10% of long-haul airline travellers. Wearing of elastic compression stockings during long-haul air travel is associated with a reduction in symptomless DVT.

### Prophylaxis of travel-related thrombosis in women [^64f249f9]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

Travel-related thrombosis occurs in 1/6,000 individuals who fly long-haul flights. The risk is increased significantly in passengers with thrombophilia and during hormonal therapy. Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state with 5-10-fold increase in VTE risk. Mechanisms for hypercoagulation on air are related to cabin atmospheric conditions, with immobility and flight duration playing a major role. Prophylactic measures include frequent exercise in all passengers, elastic stockings and LMWH in travelers at high risk.

### Frequency of venous thromboembolism in low to moderate risk long distance air travellers: the New Zealand air traveller's thrombosis (NZATT) study [^ecb8d76c]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

The frequency and role of risk factors for venous thromboembolism related to air travel is uncertain. We aimed to establish the frequency of this disorder in a group of long distance air travellers and to investigate the role of potential risk factors.

Methods

We designed a prospective study into which we recruited individuals aged between 18 and 70 years, travelling for 4 h or more by aircraft. D-dimer measurement was done before and after travel. Participants with a negative D-dimer (< 500 ng/L) before travel were included in the study. Those who became D-dimer positive or developed high clinical probability symptoms during the 3 months after travel were investigated with bilateral compression ultrasonography and CT pulmonary angiography. Suspected clinical and thrombophilic risk factors, and use of prophylactic measures, were assessed.

Findings

1000 individuals were recruited, with 878 meeting inclusion criteria and completing the study. All participants travelled at least 10 h, with a mean total duration of air travel of 39 h (SD 12.5). 112 patients underwent radiological assessment on return. Frequency of venous thromboembolism associated with travel was 1.0% (9/878, 95% CI 0.5–1.9), which included four cases of pulmonary embolism and five of deep venous thrombosis. Six patients with venous thromboembolism had pre-existing clinical risk factors, two had a recognised thrombophilic risk factor, two travelled exclusively in business class, five used aspirin, and four wore compression stockings.

Interpretation

Our results suggest an association between multiple long distance air flights and venous thromboembolism, even in individuals at low to moderate risk. The role of traditional risk factors and prophylactic measures in air travel-related venous thromboembolism needs further investigation.

Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion.

The large majority of long-distance travelers have a minimal risk of VTE. Hence, harms, cost, and inconvenience likely outweigh any potential benefit.

In contrast, patients with an increased risk of VTE, for example, individuals with a recent surgery or history of VTE, postpartum women, and individuals with an active malignancy, may experience a thrombotic event as consequence of the travel. Therefore, the use of thromboprophylaxis may be justified.

Regarding the options for thromboprophylaxis, plenty of indirect evidence supports the use of LMWH or compression stockings. The evidence with aspirin is very limited, and there is no evidence of the potential effect of DOACs.

Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Justification.

This recommendation did not change its direction or its strength. The panel considered that mechanical compression devices may not be available in some settings within the region. In this situation, compression stockings are a reasonable alternative.

Conclusion.

As discussed in recommendation 7, mechanical prophylaxis may be preferred in individuals at high risk of bleeding in whom pharmacological prophylaxis may be considered risky. The decision regarding the use of compression devices or compression stockings, when both are available, may be guided by the risk of VTE. For patients with risk factors for VTE or previous VTE events, compression devices may have a larger benefit. Nevertheless, for the majority of patients at average risk of VTE, the difference between compression devices and stockings is likely small, and therefore, both are reasonable alternatives.

In surgical patients in whom pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is preferred, should we use short or extended prophylaxis?

Recommendation 9

In surgical patients in whom pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is preferred, the ASH Latin American Guideline Panel suggests short prophylaxis (7 to 10 days) over extended prophylaxis (30 days) (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Summary of the evidence.

No additional evidence on the efficacy or safety of the intervention was identified. The EtD framework is shown online at.

Justification.

This recommendation changed its direction. The original guideline panel made a recommendation in favor of extended prophylaxis, basing their judgment mainly on individuals at high risk of VTE, such as patients undergoing cancer surgery or orthopedic surgery. The Latin American panel considered that although extended prophylaxis may be an appropriate alternative for such patients, the VTE risk is likely lower in typical patients undergoing major surgery. Also, extended prophylaxis is an expensive intervention. Within the region, drugs and devices used outside the hospital are not generally reimbursed by health insurances. Thus, extended prophylaxis may be associated with an important out-of-pocket expenditure and health inequities.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for preventing venous insufficiency in a standing worker population [^ee2b675b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a common problem, affecting up to 50% of the population in industrialised countries. It is a chronic condition which, if untreated, can progress to serious complications that in turn can interfere with working ability. Standing at work is a known risk factor for CVI, yet the true effect of non-pharmacological preventive strategies remains unknown. This is an update of a review first published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of non-pharmacological strategies and devices to prevent CVI in a standing worker population.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched September 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 8). We also handsearched reference lists of relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials that recruited standing workers to evaluate non-pharmacological devices or strategies used to prevent CVI were eligible for inclusion. Trials had to report an objective measure of clinical features of CVI or complaints associated with this condition in order to be included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Selection of the trials, quality assessment and data abstraction were completed independently by two review authors. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Only one trial was eligible for inclusion in the review so we did not perform meta-analyses.

Main Results

The primary outcomes of this review were clinical features of CVI and its associated symptoms. No new included studies were identified for this update. One prospective cross-over trial was included in this review. It measured the effect of no compression followed by two phases with different gradients of compression stockings on symptoms in 19 female flight attendants who were required to stand, almost continuously, for long periods of time. The included study provided some evidence that compression stockings improved symptoms of leg fatigue in standing workers. However, the strength of the evidence in this review is weak as it is based on only one very small trial which was at high risk of bias. The included study did not address any of the secondary outcomes including quality of life or economic impact of the interventions. Nor did the study report the length of time that the population were required to stand at work. Furthermore, no trials were found which measured the effectiveness of other non-pharmacological interventions or strategies aimed at preventing CVI in standing workers.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the extremely limited number of trials, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for preventing CVI in standing workers. Further large-scale studies examining all possible non-pharmacological interventions and outcomes are required.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 746: air travel during pregnancy [^2d93090e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Air travel during pregnancy — safety, airline policies, precautions, and radiation guidance: In the absence of obstetric or medical complications, occasional air travel is safe for pregnant women, and pregnant women can fly safely, observing the same precautions for air travel as the general population. Most commercial airlines allow pregnant women to fly up to 36 weeks of gestation, some restrict pregnant women from international flights earlier in gestation and some require documentation of gestational age, and for specific airline requirements, women should check with the individual carrier; civilian and military aircrew members who become pregnant should check with their specific agencies for regulations or restrictions to their flying duties. Air travel is not recommended at any time during pregnancy for women who have medical or obstetric conditions that may be exacerbated by flight or that could require emergency care. Because severe air turbulence cannot be predicted and the subsequent risk for trauma is significant should this occur, pregnant women should be instructed to use their seat belts continuously while seated, and the seatbelt should be belted low on the hipbones, between the protuberant abdomen and pelvis. The risks associated with long hours of air travel immobilization and low cabin humidity, such as lower extremity edema and venous thrombotic events, have been noted; despite a lack of evidence associating these events with air travel during pregnancy, certain preventive measures can be used to minimize these risks, including use of support stockings and periodic movement of the lower extremities, avoidance of restrictive clothing, occasional ambulation, and maintenance of adequate hydration; several precautions may ease discomfort, for example, gas-producing foods or drinks should be avoided before scheduled flights and preventive antiemetic medication should be considered for women with increased nausea. For most air travelers, the risks to the fetus from exposure to cosmic radiation are negligible, but aircrew or frequent flyers may exceed these limits, and the Federal Aviation Administration and the International Commission on Radiological Protection consider aircrew to be occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation and recommend that they be informed about radiation exposure and health risks.

### Prevention of VTE in nonsurgical patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^c5d40005]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This guideline addressed VTE prevention in hospitalized medical patients, outpatients with cancer, the chronically immobilized, long-distance travelers, and those with asymptomatic thrombophilia.

Methods

This guideline follows methods described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement.

Results

For acutely ill hospitalized medical patients at increased risk of thrombosis, we recommend anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH) bid, LDUH tid, or fondaparinux (Grade 1B) and suggest against extending the duration of thromboprophylaxis beyond the period of patient immobilization or acute hospital stay (Grade 2B). For acutely ill hospitalized medical patients at low risk of thrombosis, we recommend against the use of pharmacologic prophylaxis or mechanical prophylaxis (Grade 1B). For acutely ill hospitalized medical patients at increased risk of thrombosis who are bleeding or are at high risk for major bleeding, we suggest mechanical thromboprophylaxis with graduated compression stockings (GCS) (Grade 2C) or intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) (Grade 2C). For critically ill patients, we suggest using LMWH or LDUH thromboprophylaxis (Grade 2C). For critically ill patients who are bleeding or are at high risk for major bleeding, we suggest mechanical thromboprophylaxis with GCS and/or IPC at least until the bleeding risk decreases (Grade 2C). In outpatients with cancer who have no additional risk factors for VTE we suggest against routine prophylaxis with LMWH or LDUH (Grade 2B) and recommend against the prophylactic use of vitamin K antagonists (Grade 1B).

Conclusions

Decisions regarding prophylaxis in nonsurgical patients should be made after consideration of risk factors for both thrombosis and bleeding, clinical context, and patients' values and preferences.

Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion.

Typically, patients who undergo major neurosurgical procedures have simultaneously a high risk of VTE and a high risk of bleeding. In addition, these risks may change over time during hospitalization, according to mobility conditions and complications or reinterventions. Therefore, the optimal strategy for each individual patient may be different and need to be decided taking into consideration the individual risk factors.

The panel considered that when the risk of bleeding is high, for example, on the initial days after surgery, mechanical prophylaxis may be a better alternative. However, once the risk of bleeding decreases, pharmacological prophylaxis, which is generally more accessible, may be used.

In surgical patients in whom thromboprophylaxis is preferred, should we use mechanical or pharmacological thromboprophylaxis?

Recommendation 7

In surgical patients in whom thromboprophylaxis is preferred, the ASH Latin American Guideline Panel suggests either mechanical or pharmacological prophylaxis (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁⨁◯◯).

Summary of the evidence.

No additional evidence on the efficacy or safety of the intervention was identified. The EtD framework is shown online at.

Justification.

This recommendation did not change its direction or its strength. The panel considered that within the region, pharmacological prophylaxis, especially UFH, is more generally available and accessible. Thus, this was the preferred option for the majority of patients. However, for patients with high risk of bleeding, efforts should be made to provide mechanical prophylaxis.

Conclusion.

For surgical patients at average risk of bleeding (eg, major general surgery), pharmacological prophylaxis may be the preferred alternative, given that is typically available and accessible within the region. However, for patients with an increased risk of bleeding (eg, transurethral resection of the prostate) or for patients in whom bleeding may result in a very unfavorable outcome (eg, major neurosurgical procedures), mechanical prophylaxis seems to be a better alternative.

In surgical patients in whom mechanical thromboprophylaxis is preferred, should we use compression devices or compression stockings?

Recommendation 8

For surgical patients in whom mechanical thromboprophylaxis is preferred, the ASH Latin American Guideline Panel suggests mechanical compression devices over compression stockings (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁⨁◯◯).

Summary of the evidence.

No additional evidence on the efficacy or safety of the intervention was identified. The EtD framework is shown online at.

Blood Advances (2022). High credibility.

Long-distance travelers — The large majority of long-distance travelers have a minimal risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and harms, cost, and inconvenience likely outweigh any potential benefit. In contrast, patients with an increased risk of VTE (for example, individuals with a recent surgery or history of VTE, postpartum women, and individuals with an active malignancy) may experience a thrombotic event as consequence of the travel; therefore, the use of thromboprophylaxis may be justified. Regarding the options for thromboprophylaxis, plenty of indirect evidence supports the use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or compression stockings, while the evidence with aspirin is very limited, and there is no evidence of the potential effect of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). This recommendation did not change its direction or its strength.

Diving and air travel — flying after diving — The risk of developing decompression sickness (DCS) increases when divers ascend to increased altitude too soon after a dive, and commercial aircraft cabins are generally pressurized to the equivalent of approximately 1,830–2,440 m (6,000–8,000 ft) above sea level. Asymptomatic divers should wait before any altitude exposures > 610 m (> 2,000 ft), with recommended pre-flight surface intervals of ≥ 12 hours after surfacing from a single no-decompression dive, ≥ 18 hours after multiple dives or multiple days of diving, and 24–48 hours after a dive that required decompression stops. These recommended pre-flight surface intervals reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk for DCS; longer surface intervals further reduce this risk. Symptomatic divers should seek evaluation to rule out possible decompression illness before attempting any exposure to increased altitude, and a diagnosis of decompression illness generally requires appropriate treatment before any flight or ascent to altitude.

### Compression for preventing recurrence of venous ulcers [^63d7c9bd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Up to 1% of adults will have a leg ulcer at some time. Most leg ulcers are venous in origin and are caused by high pressure in the veins due to blockage or damaged valves. Venous ulcer prevention and treatment typically involves the application of compression bandages/stockings to improve venous return and thus reduce pressure in the legs. Other treatment options involve removing or repairing veins. Most venous ulcers heal with compression therapy, but ulcer recurrence is common. For this reason, clinical guidelines recommend that people continue with compression treatment after their ulcer has healed. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000 and last updated in 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effects of compression (socks, stockings, tights, bandages) for preventing recurrence of venous leg ulcers.

Search Methods

In August 2023, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two ongoing trials registries. We also scanned the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews and health technology reports. There were no restrictions on language, date of publication, or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated compression bandages or hosiery for preventing the recurrence of venous ulcers.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. Our primary outcome was reulceration (ulcer recurrence anywhere on the treated leg). Our secondary outcomes included duration of reulceration episodes, proportion of follow-up without ulcers, ulceration on the contralateral leg, noncompliance with compression therapy, comfort, and adverse effects. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology.

Main Results

We included eight studies (1995 participants), which were published between 1995 and 2019. The median study sample size was 249 participants. The studies evaluated different classes of compression (UK class 2 or 3 and European (EU) class 1, 2, or 3). Duration of follow-up ranged from six months to 10 years. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for risk of bias (lack of blinding), imprecision, and indirectness. EU class 3 compression stockings may reduce reulceration compared with no compression over six months (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.76; 1 study, 153 participants; low-certainty evidence). EU class 1 compression stockings compared with EU class 2 compression stockings may have little or no effect on reulceration over 12 months (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.32; 1 study, 99 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in rates of noncompliance over 12 months between people using EU class 1 stockings and people using EU class 2 stockings (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.75; 1 study, 99 participants; low-certainty evidence). UK class 2 hosiery compared with UK class 3 hosiery may be associated with a higher risk of reulceration over 18 months to 10 years (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.91; 5 studies, 1314 participants; low-certainty evidence). People who use UK class 2 hosiery may be more compliant with compression treatment than people who use UK class 3 hosiery over 18 months to 10 years (RR for noncompliance 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; 5 studies, 1372 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between Scholl UK class 2 compression stockings and Medi UK class 2 compression stockings in terms of reulceration (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.28; 1 study, 166 participants; low-certainty evidence) and noncompliance (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84.1 to 12; 1 study, 166 participants; low-certainty evidence) over 18 months. No studies compared different lengths of compression (e.g. below-knee versus above-knee), and no studies measured duration of reulceration episodes, ulceration on the contralateral leg, proportion of follow-up without ulcers, comfort, or adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Compression with EU class 3 compression stockings may reduce reulceration compared with no compression over six months. Use of EU class 1 compression stockings compared with EU class 2 compression stockings may result in little or no difference in reulceration and noncompliance over 12 months. UK class 3 compression hosiery may reduce reulceration compared with UK class 2 compression hosiery; however, higher compression may lead to lower compliance. There may be little to no difference between Scholl and Medi UK class 2 compression stockings in terms of reulceration and noncompliance. There was no information on duration of reulceration episodes, ulceration on the contralateral leg, proportion of follow-up without ulcers, comfort, or adverse effects. More research is needed to investigate acceptable modes of long-term compression therapy for people at risk of recurrent venous ulceration. Future trials should consider interventions to improve compliance with compression treatment, as higher compression may result in lower rates of reulceration.

Thromboembolic disease is a significant cause of complications and mortality in hospitalized patients and a growing public health issue. Although anyone can develop a VTE, research shows that half of the VTE events in the outpatient setting are directly linked to a recent hospitalization. Many of these events can be prevented through pharmacological and/or mechanical VTE prophylaxis. Current guidelines that recommend mechanical devices demonstrate a preference for intermittent pneumatic compression-pc devices with no recommendations for graduated compression stockings, except for women at high risk for VTE after cesarean delivery. These intermittent pneumatic compression-pc devices minimize adverse effects to skin, promote patient comfort, and permit clinician assessment compared to graduated compression stockings.

Recommendation 15

Compression therapy and massage should be used to minimize scarring and manage oedema.

Compression can be achieved with bandaging, tubular elastic stockings, and pressure garments. While customised compression garments may not be available in resource-limited settings, compression should aim to achieve a pressure of 24 mmHg. Compression bandages or garments should be worn 23 h a day, with regular monitoring, until scar maturation. As patients with severe burns will continue to use compression and massage well beyond discharge, education in correct use/technique is critical in addition to education about on-going scar care. Encouraging participation during inpatient stay improves chances of continuity after discharge.

In the context of moderate and severe burns, compression therapy can reduce scar height and can alleviate some of the discomfort of immature scars, such as blood rush and itching. Scar massage similarly works to soften scars and can improve skin movement and reduce hypersensitivity.

Recommendation 16

Where an inhalation injury is suspected, early advice and respiratory care should be commenced.

Respiratory complications from inhalation injuries will affect each patient differently. Early respiratory rehabilitation and optimal early patient positioning can help alleviate symptoms and prevent future complications in addition to ensuring the patient is equipped to manage their symptoms on discharge. Where possible, early mobilisation should be encouraged to enable the patient to clear secretions and maintain cardiorespiratory system function. For children this may take the form of play. A programme of breathing exercises and manual techniques should be used to support the patient to maximise lung function and chest expansion.

Nitrogen narcosis and oxygen toxicity — depth and gas partial pressure effects are summarized: At increasing depths, generally 30 m (> 100 ft), the partial pressure of nitrogen within the breathing gas increases, causing narcosis in all recreational divers; nitrogen narcosis can be life threatening when it impairs appropriate and proper decisions, and it quickly clears on ascent and is not seen on the surface after a dive, which helps differentiate it from decompression illness (DCI); at increasing partial pressures of oxygen, blood levels can become high enough to cause seizures, which are not seen when diving with compressed air within recreational depth limits, and seizures have been reported with elevated partial pressures of oxygen when breathing gas with a higher percentage of oxygen, oxygen decompression, or closed-circuit rebreather diving.

### Compression bandages or stockings versus no compression for treating venous leg ulcers [^a6cd50d3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Leg ulcers are open skin wounds on the lower leg that can last weeks, months or even years. Most leg ulcers are the result of venous diseases. First‐line treatment options often include the use of compression bandages or stockings.

Objectives

To assess the effects of using compression bandages or stockings, compared with no compression, on the healing of venous leg ulcers in any setting and population.

Search methods

In June 2020 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions by language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that compared any types of compression bandages or stockings with no compression in participants with venous leg ulcers in any setting.

Data collection and analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, and risk‐of‐bias assessment using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool. We assessed the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE methodology.

Main results

We included 14 studies (1391 participants) in the review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 51 participants). Participants were recruited from acute‐care settings, outpatient settings and community settings, and a large proportion (65.9%; 917/1391) of participants had a confirmed history or clinical evidence of chronic venous disease, a confirmed cause of chronic venous insufficiency, or an ankle pressure/brachial pressure ratio of greater than 0.8 or 0.9. The average age of participants ranged from 58.0 to 76.5 years (median: 70.1 years). The average duration of their leg ulcers ranged from 9.0 weeks to 31.6 months (median: 22.0 months), and a large proportion of participants (64.8%; 901/1391) had ulcers with an area between 5 and 20 cm 2. Studies had a median follow‐up of 12 weeks. Compression bandages or stockings applied included short‐stretch bandage, four‐layer compression bandage, and Unna's boot (a type of inelastic gauze bandage impregnated with zinc oxide), and comparator groups used included 'usual care', pharmacological treatment, a variety of dressings, and a variety of treatments where some participants received compression (but it was not the norm). Of the 14 included studies, 10 (71.4%) presented findings which we consider to be at high overall risk of bias.

Primary outcomes

There is moderate‐certainty evidence (downgraded once for risk of bias) (1) that there is probably a shorter time to complete healing of venous leg ulcers in people wearing compression bandages or stockings compared with those not wearing compression (pooled hazard ratio for time‐to‐complete healing 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 3.10; I² = 59%; 5 studies, 733 participants); and (2) that people treated using compression bandages or stockings are more likely to experience complete ulcer healing within 12 months compared with people with no compression (10 studies, 1215 participants): risk ratio for complete healing 1.77, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.21; I² = 65% (8 studies with analysable data, 1120 participants); synthesis without meta‐analysis suggests more completely‐healed ulcers in compression bandages or stockings than in no compression (2 studies without analysable data, 95 participants).

It is uncertain whether there is any difference in rates of adverse events between using compression bandages or stockings and no compression (very low‐certainty evidence; 3 studies, 585 participants).

Secondary outcomes

Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that people using compression bandages or stockings probably have a lower mean pain score than those not using compression (four studies with 859 participants and another study with 69 ulcers): pooled mean difference −1.39, 95% CI −1.79 to −0.98; I² = 65% (two studies with 426 participants and another study with 69 ulcers having analysable data); synthesis without meta‐analysis suggests a reduction in leg ulcer pain in compression bandages or stockings, compared with no compression (two studies without analysable data, 433 participants). Compression bandages or stockings versus no compression may improve disease‐specific quality of life, but not all aspects of general health status during the follow‐up of 12 weeks to 12 months (four studies with 859 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

It is uncertain if the use of compression bandages or stockings is more cost‐effective than not using them (three studies with 486 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

If using compression bandages or stockings, people with venous leg ulcers probably experience complete wound healing more quickly, and more people have wounds completely healed. The use of compression bandages or stockings probably reduces pain and may improve disease‐specific quality of life. There is uncertainty about adverse effects, and cost effectiveness.

Future research should focus on comparing alternative bandages and stockings with the primary endpoint of time to complete wound healing alongside adverse events including pain score, and health‐related quality of life, and should incorporate cost‐effectiveness analysis where possible. Future studies should adhere to international standards of trial conduct and reporting.

Decompression sickness ("the bends") — mechanism and gas kinetics are described: Breathing air under pressure causes excess inert gas (usually nitrogen) to dissolve in and saturate body tissues; the amount of gas dissolved is proportional to and increases with total depth and time below the surface; if ascent allows supersaturation, bubbles form that interfere with blood flow and tissue oxygenation, and the excess dissolved gas must be cleared through respiration.

### Compression for preventing recurrence of venous ulcers [^91da9c44]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Up to 1% of adults will have a leg ulcer at some time. The majority of leg ulcers are venous in origin and are caused by high pressure in the veins due to blockage or weakness of the valves in the veins of the leg. Prevention and treatment of venous ulcers is aimed at reducing the pressure either by removing/repairing the veins, or by applying compression bandages/stockings to reduce the pressure in the veins. The majority of venous ulcers heal with compression bandages, however ulcers frequently recur. Clinical guidelines therefore recommend that people continue to wear compression, usually in the form of hosiery (tights, stockings, socks) after their ulcer heals, to prevent recurrence.

Objectives

To assess the effects of compression (socks, stockings, tights, bandages) in preventing the recurrence of venous ulcers. If compression does prevent ulceration compared with no compression, then to identify whether there is evidence to recommend particular levels of compression (high, medium or low, for example), types of compression, or brands of compression to prevent ulcer recurrence after healing.

Search Methods

For this update we searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 1 March 2012); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to February Week 4 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, February 29, 2012); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 08); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 1 March 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating compression bandages or hosiery for preventing the recurrence of venous ulcers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors undertook data extraction and risk of bias assessment independently.

Main Results

Four trials (979 participants) were eligible for inclusion in this review. One trial in patients with recently healed venous ulcers (n = 153) compared recurrence rates with and without compression and found that compression significantly reduced ulcer recurrence at six months (Risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.76). Two trials compared high-compression hosiery (equivalent to UK class 3) with moderate-compression hosiery (equivalent to UK class 2). The first study (n = 300) found no significant reduction in recurrence at five years follow up with high-compression hosiery compared with moderate-compression (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.12). The second study (n = 338) assessed ulcer recurrence at three years follow up and found that high-compression hosiery reduced recurrence compared with moderate-compression (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.81). Statistically significant heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis of the results from these studies. Patient-reported compliance rates were reported in both trials;, there was significantly higher compliance with medium-compression than with high-compression hosiery in one and no significant difference in the second. A fourth trial (166 patients) found no statistically significant difference in recurrence between two types of medium (UK class 2) compression hosiery (Medi versus Scholl: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.2). No trials of compression bandages for preventing ulcer recurrence were identified.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence from one trial that compression hosiery reduces rates of reulceration of venous ulcers compared with no compression. Results from one trial suggest that recurrence is lower in high-compression hosiery than in medium-compression hosiery at three years whilst another trial found no difference at 5 years. Rates of patient intolerance of compression hosiery were high. There is insufficient evidence to aid selection of different types, brands, or lengths of compression hosiery.

### Compression bandages or stockings versus no compression for treating venous leg ulcers [^3f57cd94]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Leg ulcers are open skin wounds on the lower leg that can last weeks, months or even years. Most leg ulcers are the result of venous diseases. First-line treatment options often include the use of compression bandages or stockings.

Objectives

To assess the effects of using compression bandages or stockings, compared with no compression, on the healing of venous leg ulcers in any setting and population.

Search Methods

In June 2020 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions by language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that compared any types of compression bandages or stockings with no compression in participants with venous leg ulcers in any setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We assessed the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE methodology.

Main Results

We included 14 studies (1391 participants) in the review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 51 participants). Participants were recruited from acute-care settings, outpatient settings and community settings, and a large proportion (65.9%; 917/1391) of participants had a confirmed history or clinical evidence of chronic venous disease, a confirmed cause of chronic venous insufficiency, or an ankle pressure/brachial pressure ratio of greater than 0.8 or 0.9. The average age of participants ranged from 58.0 to 76.5 years (median: 70.1 years). The average duration of their leg ulcers ranged from 9.0 weeks to 31.6 months (median: 22.0 months), and a large proportion of participants (64.8%; 901/1391) had ulcers with an area between 5 and 20 cm 2. Studies had a median follow-up of 12 weeks. Compression bandages or stockings applied included short-stretch bandage, four-layer compression bandage, and Unna's boot (a type of inelastic gauze bandage impregnated with zinc oxide), and comparator groups used included 'usual care', pharmacological treatment, a variety of dressings, and a variety of treatments where some participants received compression (but it was not the norm). Of the 14 included studies, 10 (71.4%) presented findings which we consider to be at high overall risk of bias. Primary outcomes There is moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded once for risk of bias) (1) that there is probably a shorter time to complete healing of venous leg ulcers in people wearing compression bandages or stockings compared with those not wearing compression (pooled hazard ratio for time-to-complete healing 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 3.10; I² = 59%; 5 studies, 733 participants); and (2) that people treated using compression bandages or stockings are more likely to experience complete ulcer healing within 12 months compared with people with no compression (10 studies, 1215 participants): risk ratio for complete healing 1.77, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.21; I² = 65% (8 studies with analysable data, 1120 participants); synthesis without meta-analysis suggests more completely-healed ulcers in compression bandages or stockings than in no compression (2 studies without analysable data, 95 participants). It is uncertain whether there is any difference in rates of adverse events between using compression bandages or stockings and no compression (very low-certainty evidence; 3 studies, 585 participants). Secondary outcomes Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that people using compression bandages or stockings probably have a lower mean pain score than those not using compression (four studies with 859 participants and another study with 69 ulcers): pooled mean difference -1.39, 95% CI -1.79 to -0.98; I² = 65% (two studies with 426 participants and another study with 69 ulcers having analysable data); synthesis without meta-analysis suggests a reduction in leg ulcer pain in compression bandages or stockings, compared with no compression (two studies without analysable data, 433 participants). Compression bandages or stockings versus no compression may improve disease-specific quality of life, but not all aspects of general health status during the follow-up of 12 weeks to 12 months (four studies with 859 participants; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain if the use of compression bandages or stockings is more cost-effective than not using them (three studies with 486 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

If using compression bandages or stockings, people with venous leg ulcers probably experience complete wound healing more quickly, and more people have wounds completely healed. The use of compression bandages or stockings probably reduces pain and may improve disease-specific quality of life. There is uncertainty about adverse effects, and cost effectiveness. Future research should focus on comparing alternative bandages and stockings with the primary endpoint of time to complete wound healing alongside adverse events including pain score, and health-related quality of life, and should incorporate cost-effectiveness analysis where possible. Future studies should adhere to international standards of trial conduct and reporting.

### Compression stockings and DVT in air travel passengers… [^0fa494bb]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Despite several studies on the frequency of deep venous thrombosis, little is known about the risk of DVT associated with prolonged air travel. A case-control study indicates that DVT risk may increase only after flights lasting longer than four hours. Many patients with DVT remain asymptomatic, and only small proportions of those who develop symptoms have clinically detectable pulmonary embolism. Scurr and colleagues prospectively studied DVT risk in patients undertaking long airline flights and the efficacy of wearing classI elastic compression stockings during the flight to prevent DVT formation. Two weeks before air travel and again within two days of the start of the first flight, 30 volunteers' legs were examined by duplex ultrasonography. Before the first flight, blood was drawn from all participants for a series of hemostatic tests. Following intake assessment, participants were randomly assigned to compression stocking use or no intervention.

All patients were re-examined by ultrasonography within 48 hours of the return flight. At this time, they were also interviewed about duration of air travel, use of the stockings, symptoms in the lower limbs and any illnesses or medications taken during the trip. Data collection was completed on 100 volunteers in each group. Symptomless DVT was detected in 12 volunteers not using stockings and in none of the 115 volunteers using stockings. Blood tests revealed that 11 volunteers were heterozygous for factor V mutation and four for prothrombin gene mutation. Two of the symptomless DVT volunteers were positive for factor V Leiden. Full blood count, platelet, and other assays were not predictive of DVT. The authors conclude that about 10 percent of air travel passengers older than 50 years develop symptomless DVT during prolonged flights. In this study, use of elastic compression stockings provided effective prevention of DVT formation.

Much remains to be understood about the natural history of venous stasis, clot formation, and spontaneous dissolution. Family physicians should counsel all patients to consider taking aspirin and wearing compression stockings before and during flights, and remind them of the importance of hydration and leg movements during flights. This advice is especially important for older patients and those with risk factors, including estrogen use of any type. — a. d. w.

### Compression therapy for prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome [^b180defa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a long-term complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that is characterised by chronic pain, swelling, and skin changes in the affected limb. One of every three people with DVT will develop post-thrombotic complications within five years. Several non-pharmaceutical measures are used for prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome during the acute phase of DVT. These include elevation of the legs and compression therapy. Clinicians and guidelines differ in their assessment of the utility of compression therapy for treatment of DVT. This is an update of a review first published in 2003.

Objectives

To determine relative effectiveness and rate of complications when compression therapy is used in people with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS).

Search Methods

For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (20 March 2017) and CENTRAL (2017, Issue 2). The CIS also searched trial registries for details of ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of compression therapy, such as bandaging and elastic stockings, in people with clinically confirmed DVT. The primary outcome was the occurrence of PTS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (DK and EvL) identified and assessed titles and abstracts for relevance, and a third review author (DA) verified this assessment independently. Review authors imposed no restrictions on date or language of publications. Three review authors (DA, DK, EvL) used data extraction sheets to independently extract study data. We resolved disagreements by discussion.

Main Results

We identified 10 RCTs with a total of 2361 participants that evaluated compression therapy. The overall methodological quality of these trials was low. We used only five studies in meta-analysis owing to differences in intervention types and lack of data. Three studies compared elastic compression stockings (pressure of 30 to 40 mmHg at the ankle) versus no intervention. Two studies compared elastic compression stockings (pressure 20 to 40 mmHg) versus placebo stockings. Overall, use of elastic compression stockings led to a clinically significant reduction in the incidence of PTS (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.01; P = 0.05; 1393 participants; 5 studies; low-quality evidence); no reduction in the incidence of severe PTS (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.15; P = 0.21; 1224 participants; 4 studies; low-quality evidence); and no clear difference in DVT recurrence (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.28; 1212 participants; 4 studies; P = 0.69; low-quality evidence). We did not pool data on the incidence of pulmonary embolism because this information was poorly reported, but we observed no differences between groups included in individual studies (low-quality evidence). Two studies evaluated effects of compression in the acute phase versus no compression treatment and found no differences in the incidence of PTS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.16; P = 0.2; 101 participants). One study reported that thigh-length stockings did not provide better protection against development of PTS than knee-length stockings (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.28; P = 0.6; 267 participants). Another trial reported that wearing compression stockings for two years seemed to be superior to wearing them for one year in terms of PTS incidence. Two of the 10 included studies described patient satisfaction and quality of life (moderate-quality evidence), using different measurement systems. The first study showed significant improvement in well-being and DVT-related quality of life with compression treatment (P < 0.05) compared with bed rest, and the second study showed no differences in quality of life scores between compression and placebo groups. Four studies poorly reported side effects (low-quality evidence) that included itching, erythema, and other forms of allergic reaction and described no serious adverse events. Compliance with wearing of compression stockings was generally high but varied across studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-quality evidence suggests that elastic compression stockings may reduce the occurrence of PTS after DVT. We downgraded the quality of evidence owing to considerable heterogeneity between studies and lack of or unclear risk of blinding due to clinical assessment scores. No serious adverse effects occurred in these studies. Large randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings because of current lack of high-quality evidence and considerable heterogeneity.

### Prevention of air travel-related deep venous thrombosis with mechanical devices: active foot movements produce similar hemodynamic effects [^2782e0f7]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

We compared the hemodynamic effects of different mechanical devices aimed for prevention of travel-related deep venous thrombosis with active foot movements.

Methods

Two battery-operated intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices and three foot and calf muscle pump facilitating devices (PFD) that claimed to prevent travel-related deep venous thrombosis were tested in 17 healthy volunteers on the ground and in 8 of same volunteers during flight. Flow changes during active foot movements were compared with the effects of each of the tested devices.

Results

There was no significant difference in hemodynamic effect between PFDs and active foot movements. The hemodynamic effects of IPC devices were significantly less compared with active foot movements. Values obtained during air flights were not significantly different from those obtained on the ground.

Conclusions

Whereas IPC use for prevention of venous stasis during flight can be justified for immobile patients or during sleep, PFDs do not provide additional hemodynamic benefits compared with simple movements of the foot.

Complications

Skin damage

Recommendations

In patients who had a stroke, maintaining sufficient nutrient intake, water supply and dynamic position management can effectively reduce the risk of skin damage (Class I recommendation, Level A evidence).
Special air bed is recommended to use to avoid skin friction (Class I recommendation, Level B evidence).

Contracture

A prospective cohort study found that the probability of multiple joint contractures has been estimated to be 12% to 28%. In a broad retrospective analysis of 328 stroke survivors, the health score of the patients with spasm were significantly lower than those in non-spasm patients (p < 0.05).

Recommendations

Active exercise training is reasonable to provide with patients who have a high risk of contracture (Class IIa recommendation, Level B evidence).
Functional electrical stimulation therapy and extracorporeal shock wave therapy is reasonable for relieving contracture (Class IIb recommendation, Level B evidence).
Oral anti-muscle tension drugs and local muscles for botulinum toxin targeted injection therapy is reasonable for long-term hypertonic contracture (Class IIa recommendation, Level B evidence).
When conservative treatment is ineffective, surgical lysis or orthopaedic adjuvant therapy may be considered (Class IIa recommendation, Level B evidence).

Deep venous thrombosis

Recommendations

Patients with DVT should receive regular anticoagulant therapy (Class I recommendation, Level A evidence).
Intermittent inflation and intermittently applying pressure to the calf muscles and blood vessels is reasonable to stimulate blood flow (Class IIa recommendation, Level A evidence).
Compression stockings should not be performed to treat and prevent the development of DVT and pulmonary embolism (Class III recommendation, Level B evidence).

Wearing compression stockings daily

Approximately one‐third of survey respondents reported that they would be willing to wear compression stockings (35%, n = 83); the interviewees showed very mixed views. Many participants felt it would not be feasible to wear compression stockings on a daily basis as they perceived them to be difficult to put on and uncomfortable to wear, more associated with flights and recovery after operations than everyday use and not practical to wear in the summer or with certain types of clothing. Some participants who had experience of wearing compression stockings reported similar reasons for being reluctant to wear compression stockings and associated them with reducing oedema but did not connect this to cellulitis prevention.

I find they're bloody awkward to put on; it takes two of you to put it on, it bloody hurts and I don't like them. If they had one out with a zip that means you put your foot in and zip it up: fine

In the summer, if I'm overheated, I don't want to be wearing socks or anything else, so that's not going to help. So, in theory, I'd say, yes, absolutely fine, but I can imagine, in practice, it might not be the thing to do in the middle of summer. Again, ultimately, if it was about my health, I probably would do it, but it wouldn't be my first choice. I'd rather stand and clean my feet for 20 minutes a day, for instance

Lesser compression strength, such as 20 to 30 mm Hg, is not as effective. Multilayer compression is effective only for symptoms and not for development of PTS. Use of compression stockings immediately after diagnosis of DVT and continued compression for at least 6 months to 2 years are supported.

### Extensive clinical experience: a simple guide to basal insulin adjustments for long-distance travel [^84590780]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

In this review we discuss general rules for adjusting insulin during travel for patients on multiple daily injection (basal-bolus) regimens. We also include our patient handouts for eastward and westward travel that incorporate a single insulin dose adjustment for basal insulin, and review examples for multiple travel scenarios. As there are only a limited number of publications that provide advice for adjusting insulin for travel, and little scientific evidence to support their recommendations, we must emphasize that the advice given in this review is expert opinion based on our extensive clinical experience and knowledge of insulin pharmacokinetics, and is not evidence based.

General rules for travel while taking insulin

Avoidance of hypoglycemia is the well-accepted primary goal during air travel. Hypoglycemia reportedly occurs in up to 10% of patients taking insulin while traveling abroad, either during travel or in the first 24 hours after arrival. Many factors contribute to this increased risk, including changes in dietary patterns and difficulties in adjusting insulin dose and timing appropriately. To reduce this risk of hypoglycemia recommendations have included removal and replacement of syringe plungers to allow pressure equalization prior to use for in-flight injections, and reduction in the amount of air normally injected into the insulin vials. Changes in air pressure also affect insulin pumps with a reduction in air pressure occurring during ascent potentially resulting in unintended insulin delivery, yet no specific practice guideline currently recommends changes to insulin pump settings for travel.

### Prevention of VTE in orthopedic surgery patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^c3f42c9a]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Mechanical interventions vs no prophylaxis — graduated compression stockings (GCS) and compression devices: There are few data for GCS vs no prophylaxis in major orthopedic surgery; a review identified nine trials overall but only one small trial in orthopedic patients, and pooled results failed to demonstrate or exclude an effect on pulmonary embolism (PE) (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.32–1.25) while showing benefit on asymptomatic venographically confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.36–0.73); evidence from a higher-quality large stroke trial showed only a trend toward reduced symptomatic DVT (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.77–1.09) offset by a fourfold increase in skin complications. Pneumatic compression devices have the potential advantage of reducing the incidence of VTE without the risk for increased bleeding, and an intermittent pneumatic compression device (IPCD) can be used in the contralateral leg even during surgery and the immediate postoperative period. Across seven randomized controlled trials including > 900 patients (six IPCD and one venous foot pump), a relative risk reduction of > 50% was observed for both PE (RR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.17–0.92) and DVT (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.35–0.61), with an estimated absolute risk difference of 16 fewer symptomatic VTE per 1,000 and no demonstrated mortality effect. Compliance is a major challenge: devices often are found not functioning when patients are out of bed or being transported, properly functioning IPCDs were encountered in < 50% in one study and as low as 19% in another, and studies reported no significant improvement in compliance.

Graduated compression stockings to prevent post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) after acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the leg — evidence and recommendation: AT9 suggested routine use of graduated compression stockings for 2 years after DVT to reduce the risk of PTS, but a much larger multicenter, placebo-controlled trial at low risk of bias found that routine use of graduated compression stockings did not reduce PTS or have other important benefits and did not reduce leg pain during the 3 months after DVT diagnosis; based on this trial, we suggest not using compression stockings routinely to prevent PTS (Grade 2B). For patients with acute or chronic symptoms, a trial of graduated compression stockings is often justified.

### Quality of lay person CPR performance with compression: ventilation ratios 15: 2, 30: 2 or continuous chest compressions without ventilations on manikins [^57d85da0]. Resuscitation (2006). Low credibility.

The new CPR guidelines emphasise chest compression depth and have increased the compression:ventilation ratio to cause less time intervals without chest compressions. How this change may influence the quality of chest compressions is not documented. Sixty-eight volunteers among travellers at Oslo international airport and a senior citizen centre performed 5 min of CPR on a manikin with compression:ventilation ratios 15:2, 30:2 or continuous chest compressions. Median age was 37.5 years (range 15–87), 59% were men, and 71% reported CPR training median 8 years (3–15) previously. Three of 22, 4 of 23 and 3 of 23 subjects in the 15:2, 30:2 and continuous compressions groups respectively stopped before 5 min had passed. Mean compression depth was 41 ± 11, 45 ± 8 and 30 ± 8 mm, respectively. Depth was reduced as a function of time in the continuous compression group. Number of compressions per minute was 40 ± 9, 43 ± 14 and 73 ± 24 and percent no flow time 49 ± 13%, 38 ± 20% and 1 ± 2%, respectively. In conclusion, continuous chest compressions without ventilations gave significantly more chest compressions per minute, but with decreased compression quality. No flow time for 30:2 was significantly less than for 15:2.

Risk of Bias

Included studies were at a mix of low, unclear, and high risk of bias. Older studies tended not to have published protocols and were at unclear or high risk of selective reporting. Many of the trials demonstrated incomplete outcome data, in part, this was due to difficulties in ensuring all patients had venography in the applicable trials. This was accounted for in the risk of bias assessment, but differential attrition between individual trial arms or lack of adequate explanation for attrition were considered as introducing a high risk of bias. Blinding was performed well across the trials, including the use of a double-dummy approach in many trials. Even when blinding was considered not possible to implement, many trials opted for a single-blinded approach, and knowledge of the intervention by trial participants was considered to have a low risk of influencing the outcome of objectively diagnosed VTE. Randomization sequence generation was well performed but details regarding allocation concealment were often omitted. A full risk of bias assessment is available in the Supplemental Table (Supplemental Digital Content Table 2).

Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations Assessment

The quality of evidence from the 2 trials included in the head-to-head meta-analysis was graded as high-quality evidence, with good consistency, directness, precision, and low risk of bias. The quality of evidence for the pooled rate of PE and VTE-related mortality was downgraded to moderate quality evidence in light of the risk of bias. The quality of evidence for the pooled rate of DVT in trial arms was downgraded to very low in light of the serious risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency.

Ocular and periocular barotrauma in diving — prevention and evacuation: When air in a closed space is exposed to higher atmospheres of pressure it is compressed, and while diving with a facemask the lids, skin, and eyes can be drawn out into the mask, causing periorbital ecchymosis, edema, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and potentially hyphema; prevention can be achieved by frequently filling one's mask with exhaled air from the nose to increase the volume of air in the mask. If hyphema is present, evacuation should be emergent; mask pressure equalization is graded Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence and hyphema evacuation is graded Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for chronic venous insufficiency, more specifically with respect to compression stockings, medically managed, ESVS 2022 guidelines recommend to offer compression treatment, using below knee elastic compression stockings, inelastic bandages or adjustable compression garments exerting a pressure of 20–40 mmHg at the ankle, to reduce edema in patients with chronic venous disease and edema (CEAP clinical class C3).

Compression device selection and practicality — elastic stockings may be challenging for some patients to don and doff, particularly among patients who are morbidly obese in whom very high leg venous pressure from increased intra-abdominal pressure can overwhelm an elastic product and lead to recurrent edema with a high risk for recurrent ulceration; aids for donning and doffing stockings are often awkward. Velcro compression devices are an alternative to elastic stockings because their inelastic nature produces higher compression during ambulation, which reduces venous stasis and edema; they are adjustable for tightening or loosening as leg volume changes and are easy to apply and remove, even in patients with physical limitations.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^7842fb71]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to compression stockings, after thrombus removal, SVS 2012 guidelines recommend to offer knee-high compression stockings (30–40 mmHg), to be worn for ≥ 2 years after the procedure, in patients with DVT managed with thrombus removal techniques.

### Quantifying the degree graduated elastic compression stockings enhance venous emptying [^e1ec5965]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Graduated elastic compression (GEC) stockings reduce reflux and venous volume but their performance on augmenting venous return is unproven. The aim of this study was to quantify the ability of stockings to increase venous outflow from the leg.

Design

A prospective study comparing venous emptying without compression, versus class 1 (18–21 mmHg) and class 2 (23–32 mmHg) compression, using air-plethysmography (APG).

Methods

The right legs of 20 healthy subjects were studied supine. A 12-cm thigh-cuff was inflated in 10 mmHg steps from 0 to 80 mmHg while the corresponding increase in calf volume was recorded using the APG sensor calf-cuff. At the 80 mmHg plateau, the thigh-cuff was released suddenly to measure the unrestricted venous emptying. Venous return was assessed by: (a) identifying the incremental thigh-cuff pressure causing the maximal incremental increase in calf volume (IPMIV); (b) measuring the percentage reduction in calf volume in 1 second following thigh-cuff release - outflow fraction (OF); (c) time to empty 90% of the venous volume - venous emptying time (VET90).

Results

Median and inter-quartile range (IQR) baseline values of IPMIV, OF, and VET90 without compression were 20 mmHg (range: 20–30 mmHg), 44% (39–50%) and 13 seconds (8.8–15.9 seconds), respectively. These improved significantly with all stockings. The application of any stocking raised the median IPMIV by 30 mmHg. The change from a class 2 stocking compared with no stocking versus the change from a class 1 stocking to no stocking had a more pronounced effect (p < .005). After sudden thigh-cuff deflation, the venous emptying was 41–45% greater and 9–10 seconds faster with all stockings (p < .005).

Conclusions

This is the first study to quantify the venous return of below-knee GEC stockings. Assessments of stockings in augmenting venous return may be of use as a way of optimising compression for individual patients unresponsive to standard conservative treatment.
