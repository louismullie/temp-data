## Question

How would you counsel a ypN0 patient after neoadjuvant chemotherapy about the efficacy and safety of regional nodal irradiation using NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 data?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to counsel a patient with ypN0 status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy regarding the efficacy and safety of regional nodal irradiation, using NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 data. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the exact question the trial answered. Then, I should verify the trial design, eligibility, and endpoints. Next, I will examine the efficacy results, including the primary and secondary outcomes and subgroup signals. After that, I need to review safety and quality metrics. Then, I should integrate these findings with prior evidence and current guideline positions. Finally, I will translate this into practical counseling points, including exceptions, uncertainties, and a bottom-line recommendation, while double-checking for any caveats that could change practice now or in the near future.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the precise question. The NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 trial enrolled patients with biopsy-proven clinically node-positive (cN1), T1–T3 breast cancer who converted to pathologically node-negative (ypN0) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and asked whether adding regional nodal irradiation improved the invasive breast cancer recurrence–free interval compared with no regional nodal irradiation, with additional analyses of locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival, as well as toxicity and quality of life [^115LoemB] [^116YHJc9].

> Wait, let me verify the trial design and key execution details so I don't over-interpret results. This was a multicenter, open-label, phase 3 randomized trial with centralized radiation planning and quality assurance, using modern 3D conformal or IMRT techniques to deliver 50 Gy in 25 fractions to regional nodal fields, and it achieved high protocol adherence with 97% completion of assigned radiation, which strengthens the internal validity of the findings [^116gKB5M] [^114cG18t].

> I will now examine the primary efficacy outcome. After a median follow-up of 59.5 months, regional nodal irradiation did not significantly improve the invasive breast cancer recurrence–free interval: 92.7% with RNI versus 91.8% without RNI, hazard ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.60–1.28, P = 0.51, indicating no statistically significant benefit from adding RNI in this ypN0 population [^116R7kwm] [^116gKB5M].

> Next, I should review secondary outcomes to ensure consistency. There were no significant differences in locoregional recurrence–free interval, distant recurrence–free interval, disease-free survival, or overall survival, and the absolute locoregional recurrence rates were very low in both arms, around 1% at 5 years, which aligns with the notion that modern systemic therapy and pathologic nodal clearance confer excellent regional control even without RNI [^116R7kwm] [^116gKB5M].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about subgroups. I need to check for any signals that might suggest heterogeneity of benefit. Exploratory subgroup analyses showed a potential benefit signal in hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative disease and a potential harm signal in triple-negative disease, but these are hypothesis-generating only, not definitive, and should not drive practice change without prospective validation, so I should frame them cautiously in counseling [^112bjKYA].

> I should confirm safety and tolerability next. There were no treatment-related deaths and no unexpected adverse events. Grade 4 events were rare and not significantly different, while grade 3 radiation dermatitis was more frequent with RNI (5.7% vs 3.3%), and overall grade 3 toxicity was modestly higher with RNI (10.0% vs 6.5%), supporting the conclusion that RNI adds toxicity without oncologic benefit in this setting [^114cG18t] [^116R7kwm].

> Let me consider how these results fit with prior evidence and current guideline positions. Historically, RNI has shown modest disease-free and regional control benefits in patients with pathologically positive nodes after upfront surgery, but those data do not directly apply to patients who achieve ypN0 after neoadjuvant therapy, and contemporary practice has been inconsistent pending randomized data; NCCN has long advised considering comprehensive RNI for cN+ patients who convert to ypN0, reflecting uncertainty rather than proven benefit, which this trial now addresses [^115ja1GC] [^116kdKk3] [^1132j211].

> But wait, what if the low event rate means the trial was underpowered? I should double-check the statistical plan. The trial was powered for a 35% hazard reduction and a 4.6% absolute risk reduction, but the observed 5-year event rate was only about 8% overall, lower than anticipated, and the final analysis was time-driven rather than event-driven; nonetheless, the point estimate is close to 1.0 and the confidence interval excludes clinically meaningful benefit, so a lack of benefit remains the most defensible interpretation at this time [^114C76Xv] [^116R7kwm].

> I need to ensure I translate this into practical counseling. For a patient with cN1 disease who becomes ypN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, omitting regional nodal irradiation does not worsen recurrence-free survival, locoregional control, distant control, or overall survival, and it avoids added toxicity such as grade 3 dermatitis and the broader risks of lymphedema and cardiopulmonary exposure, so the balance favors omission of RNI in this scenario [^116R7kwm] [^114cG18t].

> Hold on, I should verify exceptions and uncertainties so I don't overgeneralize. The trial did not include patients with cN2–N3 disease, inflammatory breast cancer, or T4 tumors, and it did not test patients with residual nodal disease, so for ypN1 or higher, or for very high-risk presentations, RNI may still be indicated based on existing evidence and guidelines; additionally, the exploratory subgroup signals in HR+/HER2− and TNBC warrant discussion but should not override the overall null result outside of a trial [^116R7kwm] [^1132j211] [^114WqaAD].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and make sure it aligns with evolving practice. The NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 results support a response-guided de-escalation approach: when axillary disease is sterilized by neoadjuvant therapy, omitting RNI is safe and does not compromise outcomes, and this joins other de-escalation paradigms in breast oncology that prioritize pathologic response over historical clinical stage when planning local therapy [^116R7kwm] [^111Bb1KQ] [^1163BkWy].

> Finally, I should confirm the practical recommendation and follow-up plan. I would recommend no regional nodal irradiation for cN1 patients who achieve ypN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, continue standard whole-breast irradiation after lumpectomy or consider omission of chest wall radiation after mastectomy in select low-risk ypN0 scenarios, and ensure continued surveillance given the ongoing follow-up in the trial and the possibility that longer-term data could refine risk estimates, especially in hormone receptor–positive disease [^116R7kwm] [^111TKHyH] [^116gKB5M].

Based on NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304, **regional nodal irradiation (RNI) does not improve survival or reduce recurrence** in patients who are ypN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^116R7kwm]. RNI increases **grade 3 dermatitis** and other toxicities without added benefit, so it should be omitted in this setting [^114cG18t]. Counsel patients that **RNI is not recommended** for ypN0 after neoadjuvant therapy, and standard whole-breast or chest-wall radiation suffices [^116R7kwm].

---

## Key findings from NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304

- **Primary endpoint**: No significant difference in invasive breast cancer recurrence–free interval (IBCRFI) between RNI and no RNI (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60–1.28; P = 0.51) [^116R7kwm].

- **Secondary endpoints**: No differences in locoregional recurrence–free interval, distant recurrence–free interval, disease-free survival, or overall survival [^116R7kwm].

- **Safety**: Higher grade 3 dermatitis with RNI (5.7% vs 3.3%) and more grade 3 adverse events overall (10.0% vs 6.5%) [^114cG18t].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Omission of RNI**: RNI can be safely omitted in ypN0 patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy without compromising oncologic outcomes [^116R7kwm].

- **Standard radiation therapy**: Whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery or chest-wall irradiation after mastectomy remains the standard of care [^113bDLa7].

- **Patient counseling**: Emphasize that RNI does not improve survival or reduce recurrence in this setting and adds toxicity [^116R7kwm].

---

## Patient counseling points

| **Counseling point** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|
| RNI not recommended | NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 showed no benefit from RNI in ypN0 patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^116R7kwm] |
| Standard radiation therapy | Whole-breast or chest-wall radiation is sufficient and remains standard of care [^113bDLa7] |
| Toxicity considerations | RNI increases grade 3 dermatitis and other adverse events without added benefit [^114cG18t] |
| Individualized decision-making | Discuss tumor characteristics, patient preferences, and potential risks and benefits [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 provides **strong evidence** that RNI does not improve survival or reduce recurrence in ypN0 patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and it increases toxicity. Therefore, **RNI should not be routinely recommended** in this setting, and standard whole-breast or chest-wall radiation should be used.

### Rewriting the radiation playbook: NSABP B-51 and the rise of pathologic precision [^1163BkWy]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction and contextualization

In the evolving era of biologically guided oncology, the NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 trial, recently published by Mamounas and colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine, stands as a landmark moment: not only for its findings, but for its philosophy. By demonstrating that regional nodal irradiation (RNI) offers no apparent oncologic benefit for patients with initially node-positive breast cancer who convert to pathologically node-negative (ypN0) status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the authors challenge decades of radiation practice and reaffirm the primacy of response-guided treatment. It also offers some hypothesis-generating insight on the mechanisms behind the findings.

### Omitting regional nodal irradiation after response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^111uA1d7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Our trial has some limitations. The observed rate of the primary end point (8.2%) was around one third lower than the rate projected on the basis of the combined analysis of the NSABP B-18 and B-27 trials, which had been adjusted downward by 15% to account for the fact that estimates of recurrence rates based on data from older clinical trials tend to be higher than actual recurrence rates in the current breast cancer population. This is a pattern that has been seen across other breast cancer trials. As a result of the low event rate, we conducted a time-driven analysis as specified in the protocol, but the number of primary-end-point events included was considerably less than the number that would have been included in an event-driven analysis (109 vs. 172). Patient follow-up continues, and we expect to report updated analyses when the number of events specified for the event-driven analysis is reached. Patients with negative axillary nodes after surgery were eligible for the trial even if they had isolated tumor cells remaining (ypN0i+ status). However, we did not collect this information upon trial enrollment, so we do not know the proportion of patients with ypN0i+ status or the specific outcomes in these patients. Previous studies{q43} have shown that the prevalence of ypN0i+ status is low (approximately 1.5 to 6.0%), and thus the effect of including such patients in our trial would probably be negligible.

INTRODUCTION

Adjuvant regional nodal irradiation has been shown to reduce the risk of locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, and death from breast cancer among patients with early-stage breast cancer who undergo surgery first and have pathologically involved axillary lymph nodes. These benefits are evident irrespective of the number of lymph nodes involved.

Preoperative or neoadjuvant chemotherapy reduces the burden of disease in the breast and axillary lymph nodes and can allow for patients to become candidates for lumpectomy rather than mastectomy. Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated equivalent efficacy between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Potential clinical advantages of neoadjuvant chemotherapy include reduction in the extent of surgery and improvement in prognosis stratification Achieving pathologic complete response (pCR) in the breast and axilla has been consistently shown to predict for improved outcomes and can be utilized for tailoring subsequent adjuvant systemic therapy.

With the increasing use and efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, clinicians often encounter patients who present with axillary-lymph-node involvement (i.e. clinically node-positive status) but whose axillary lymph nodes are pathologically tumor free (ypN0) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. For such patients, no prospective outcome data show benefit from regional nodal irradiation. This lack of data has led to clinical uncertainty and variability in practice with respect to the use of regional nodal irradiation due to positive axillary nodes at diagnosis or its omission due to negative axillary nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Retrospective studies have shown that patients with clinically positive axillary nodes whose nodes convert to ypN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy have better outcomes compared to those whose nodes remain pathologically node-positive, creating uncertainty regarding the need for regional nodal irradiation. The largest retrospective analysis of two National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (B-18 and B-27) attempted to identify independent predictors of locoregional recurrence in 3,088 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by breast irradiation in patients who underwent a lumpectomy, but no regional nodal irradiation and no radiation therapy to the chest wall in patients who underwent a mastectomy. In multivariate analyses, pCR in the breast with ypN0 was a significant predictor of lower risk for locoregional recurrence irrespective of breast surgery type. Moreover, patients with clinically positive axillary lymph nodes before neoadjuvant chemotherapy who became ypN0 at surgery had low rates of chest wall and regional nodal recurrence compared to those who remained ypN+.

### Postmastectomy radiation therapy: an ASTRO / ASCO / SSO clinical practice guideline [^112jeCu4]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Postmastectomy radiation therapy after neoadjuvant systemic therapy — ongoing randomized trials address axillary management and PMRT use in ypN0. Results from the Alliance A011202 trial (NCT01901094) are evaluating whether RT to the undissected axilla and other regional lymph nodes after sentinel lymph node biopsy is noninferior to axillary lymph node dissection and will further clarify the value of extensive axillary surgery and appropriate RT volumes. For patients initially cN1 who convert to ypN0, the NSABP B-51/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1304 trial (NCT01872975) randomly assigned patients to PMRT or no RT to resolve equipoise, with eligibility requiring cN1 before neoadjuvant chemotherapy by palpation, ultrasound, CT, MRI, PET, or PET/CT and ineligibility for N2–3 disease detected clinically or by imaging.

### Is elective nodal irradiation beneficial in patients with pathologically negative lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and breast-conserving surgery for clinical stage II-III breast cancer? A multicentre retrospective study (KROG 12–05) [^111B63KX]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is an effective treatment modality for patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Patients with operable disease may also benefit from NAC in terms of breast-conserving surgery (BCS). A certain proportion of patients receive BCS after NAC, though this varies widely according to inclusion and selection criteria. According to the combined analysis of National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-18 and B-27 trials, the 10-year cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence (LRR) after BCS plus breast radiotherapy (RT) was 10.3%, which was similar to that observed after mastectomy (12.3%).

Although adjuvant RT has a significant role in breast-conserving treatment, it is also indicated for patients receiving BCS after NAC. It remains unclear, however, whether the addition of regional irradiation is needed. After NAC, the pathologic extent of disease is modified in 80–90% of patients, whereas pathologic complete response (CR) in both the breast and axilla was achieved in 13–26% of patients. In addition, about 20–40% of patients with axillary nodal involvement at the time of diagnosis were without pathologic lymph node (LN) involvement after NAC. Along with age, clinical tumour characteristics before NAC, breast tumour responses after NAC, and pathologic nodal status are predictive factors for LRR after NAC. In two NSABP NAC trials that previously used breast RT without regional irradiation after BCS, the LRR rate was < 10% in patients with pathologically negative LN (ypN0). Although the LRR rate was low after breast RT only, whether further benefit could be achieved from the addition of regional irradiation is unknown. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for patients treated with NAC, adjuvant RT should be based on the worst stage pre-treatment or post-treatment tumour characteristics. In contrast, a recent study compared the outcomes of patients with ypN0 after NAC plus BCS according to whether they also received regional irradiation. The 5-year LRR-free survival (LRRFS) rates were 89.4% and 86.2% with and without regional irradiation, respectively, which were not significantly different from each other regardless of pre-chemotherapy tumour status.

Notably, a prospective randomised trial has not yet been conducted to address this issue. In order to gather preliminary data, the Korean Radiation Oncology Group (KROG) conducted a multicentre retrospective study to evaluate the effects of regional irradiation in patients with ypN0 after NAC followed by BCS and RT.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^116kdKk3]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Breast cancer — RT after preoperative therapy and breast-conserving surgery (BCS): Patients who have clinically negative nodes at diagnosis and remain pathologically node-negative at definitive surgery after systemic therapy should receive adjuvant RT to the whole breast with the addition of boost to the tumor bed after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Patients who have clinically/radiographically positive nodes at diagnosis and convert to clinically/radiographically node-negative after preoperative chemotherapy are candidates for the NSABP B-51 trial assessing the benefit of regional nodal irradiation (RNI); until the results of this trial become available, existing data suggest that node-positive disease at presentation is at high risk for locoregional recurrence and should be considered to receive comprehensive RNI with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla at risk. If a neoadjuvant therapy patient with node-positive disease (ypN1+) does not undergo a complete axillary dissection, all levels of the undissected axilla should be included with the radiation treatment.

### NSABP B-51 / RTOG 1304: randomized phase III clinical trial evaluating the role of postmastectomy chest wall and regional nodal XRT (CWRNRT) and post-lumpectomy RNRT in patients (pts) with documented positive axillary (Ax) nodes before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) who convert to pathologically negative Ax nodes after NC… [^113hu64Q]. ASCO (2014). Low credibility.

Abstract TPS1141 Background: This phase III randomized post-NC trial will evaluate if CWRNRT after mastectomy or whole breast irradiation with RNRT after breast-conserving surgery significantly reduces the rate of IBCR-FI in pts who present with histologically positive Ax nodes but become histologically negative Ax nodes →NC. Secondary aims are OS, LRR-FI, DRFI, DFS-DCIS, and second primary cancer. Correlative science will examine the effect of RT by tumor subtype, molecular predictors of outcome for pts with residual disease, and the development of predictors of degree of reduction in loco-regional recurrence. Methods: Eligible pts with clinical T1-3, N1 breast cancer with pathologic Ax nodes must complete ≥ 12 wks of NC. HER2-positive pts must receive neoadjuvant trastuzumab or other anti-HER2 therapy. After NC either BCS or Mx will be performed.

Ax nodes must be histologically cancer free on sentinel node biopsy with or without axillary dissection or AND alone. ER/PR and HER-2 neu status before NC is required. All pts will receive additional required systemic tx. Site radiation credentialing with a facility questionnaire and case benchmarking is required. Randomization for Mx pts will be to no CWRNRT or CWRNRT and for BCS pts to WBI or WBIRNRT. 1, 636 pts will be enrolled over 5 yrs with definitive analysis at 7. 5 yrs. The study is powered at 80% to test the main hypothesis that RT reduces the annual hazard rate of events for IBCR-FI by 35% for an absolute risk reduction in the 5-year cumulative rate of 4. 6%. Analysis will be on intent-to-treat with 3 formal interim analyses at 43, 86, and 129 events, with a 4th/final analysis at 172 events. Current accrual is 10. 736 enrolled pts will be evaluated with targeted pt-reported outcome instruments focusing on the effect of RT.

Pt assessments will be prior to randomization and then at 3, 6, 12, and 24 mos. Clinical trial information: NCT01872975.

The NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 trial represents a paradigm shift in breast cancer management, showing that patients achieving nodal clearance after neoadjuvant chemotherapy derive no added benefit from regional nodal irradiation. These results challenge long-standing practice, promotes de-escalation, and raise biologically significant questions, particularly regarding immunologic mechanisms and clinical subgroup variations.

Background

The benefit of regional nodal irradiation in the treatment of breast cancer is well established for patients with pathologically positive axillary nodes, but whether it is also beneficial for patients whose nodes become pathologically tumor free (ypN0) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains unclear.

Methods

We evaluated whether regional nodal irradiation improves outcomes in patients with biopsy-proven, node-positive breast cancer who reach ypN0 status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with breast cancer with a clinical stage of T1 to T3 (tumor size, ≤ 2 cm to > 5 cm), N1, and M0 (indicating spread to movable, ipsilateral level I and II axillary lymph nodes but no distant metastasis) who had ypN0 status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive regional nodal irradiation or no regional nodal irradiation. The primary end point was the interval of freedom from invasive breast cancer recurrence or death from breast cancer (invasive breast cancer recurrence–free interval). Secondary end points included the locoregional recurrence–free interval, the distant recurrence–free interval, disease-free survival, and overall survival. Safety was also assessed.

Results

A total of 1,641 patients were enrolled in the trial; 1,556 were included in the primary-event analysis: 772 in the irradiation group and 784 in the no-irradiation group. After a median follow-up of 59.5 months, 109 primary end-point events (50 in the irradiation group and 59 in the no-irradiation group) had occurred. Regional nodal irradiation did not significantly increase the invasive breast cancer recurrence–free interval (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 1.28; P = 0.51). Point estimates of survival free from the primary end-point events were 92.7% in the irradiation group and 91.8% in the no-irradiation group. Regional nodal irradiation did not increase the locoregional recurrence–free interval, the distant recurrence–free interval, disease-free survival, or overall survival. No deaths related to the protocol-specified therapy were reported, and no unexpected adverse events were observed. Grade 4 adverse events occurred in 0.5% of patients in the irradiation group and 0.1% of those in the no-irradiation group.

Conclusion

The addition of adjuvant regional nodal irradiation did not decrease the risk of invasive breast cancer recurrence or death from breast cancer in patients who had negative axillary nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

### Omitting regional nodal irradiation after response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^111tF7B1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 was published by Eleftherios P Mamounas and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Breast cancer. In the NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of adjuvant regional nodal irradiation in patients with breast cancer who had negative axillary nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy? In the NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 study, the population was: 1556 female patients. The inclusion criteria were patients with node-positive breast cancer who had negative axillary nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The key exclusion criteria were definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease; T4 tumors including inflammatory breast cancer; N2 or N3 disease detected clinically or by imaging; histologically positive axillary nodes post neoadjuvant therapy; microscopic positive margins after definitive surgery; history of non-breast malignancies within 5 years prior to randomization. In the NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 study, the interventions were: n = 772 regional nodal irradiation (50 Gy in 25 fractions delivered to the retained portion of level I to III axillary nodes along with chest wall after mastectomy or the whole breast after lumpectomy) n = 784 no regional nodal irradiation (no radiation therapy after mastectomy or whole-breast irradiation after lumpectomy). In the NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in invasive breast cancer recurrence-free interval (93.5% vs. 92.5%; HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.67). In the NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in locoregional recurrence-free interval (99.2% vs. 98.6%; HR 1.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 4.76) No significant difference in distant recurrence-free interval (94% vs. 93.9%; HR 1, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.49) No significant difference in disease-free survival (89% vs. 89.4%; HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.27). In the NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in grade 4 adverse events. In the NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 study, the conclusion was: in patients with node-positive breast cancer who had negative axillary nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, regional nodal irradiation was not superior to no regional nodal irradiation with respect to invasive breast cancer recurrence-free interval.

### The role of postmastectomy radiation therapy in patients with breast cancer responding to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^1133u4mB]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

When surgery is the first line of breast cancer treatment, numerous randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) improves locoregional control and survival for many women with axillary lymph node-positive disease. In contrast, there are no randomized data regarding the use of PMRT in women who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) first followed by mastectomy. This has led to controversy regarding which patient with breast cancer will benefit from PMRT after NAC, particularly in women with clinically node-positive axillary disease that responds well and is down staged to pathologically negative disease at surgery (ypN0). We review the current evidence on this topic, which forms the underlying basis for the ongoing phase III clinical trial-National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B51/RTOG 1304-that is examining the role of regional nodal irradiation in patients with clinical N1 disease that responds to NAC and becomes ypN0 at surgery.

### Postmastectomy radiation therapy following pathologic complete nodal response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a prelude to NSABP B-51? [^112HkTk3]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The utility of post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in women with a nodal complete response (CRn) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is unknown. The NSABP B-51 trial is evaluating this question, but has not reported results thus far. Therefore, we sought to answer this question with the National Cancer Database.

Methods

The National Cancer Database was queried for women with cT1-4N1-3M0 breast cancer who had undergone NAC and were ypN0 upon mastectomy. Statistics included multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier overall survival (OS) analysis, Cox proportional hazards modeling, and construction of forest plots.

Results

Of 14,690 women, 10,092 (69%) underwent adjuvant PMRT and 4598 (31%) did not. The median follow-up was 55.6 months. In all patients, the 10-year OS was 76.3% for PMRT and 78.6% without (p = 0.412). There were no notable effects of PMRT on OS based on age or the axillary management (number of nodes removed). Specifically, in the NSABP B-51 population of cT1-3 cN1 patients, the 10-year OS was 82.6% for PMRT and 80.0% without (p = 0.250). PMRT benefitted women with increasing cT stage (i.e. cT3-4), increasing ypT stages (with the exception of ypT4 potentially owing to small sample sizes), and cN3 cases (p < 0.05 for all).

Conclusions

In the absence of published results from NSABP B-51, this assessment of over 14,000 women from a contemporary US database revealed that PMRT may be most useful for a "moderately-high" risk group - women with more advanced primary and/or nodal disease at diagnosis, yet with tumor biology favorable enough that the disease does not progress or remain stable after NAC. The OS findings notwithstanding, this study cannot exclude potential differences between groups in recurrence-free survival, which is the primary endpoint of NSABP B-51, While the results of the NSABP B-51 will confirm optimal management for patients with limited nodal disease having a CRn following NAC, the present results suggest PMRT should remain the standard of care for more advanced disease than NSABP B-51 eligibility criteria.

Future

With advances in systemic treatment, de-escalation trials for breast cancer patients with response to NAC and axillary pathologic complete response continue to evolve. Results of the NRG Oncology/NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 trial evaluating invasive breast cancer recurrence in this population of patients with positive axillary nodes who are ypN0 after NAC may lead to omission of regional nodal radiotherapy, and excision of the clipped node may help guide radiation oncologists in their decision for de-escalation. For patients with residual tumor-involved sentinel lymph nodes after NAC, Alliance A11202 will guide the decision for axillary radiation as an alternative to axillary lymph node dissection for local control of axillary disease.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 Breast Cancer — RT after preoperative therapy and breast-conserving surgery (BCS) indicates that those who have clinically negative nodes at diagnosis that remain pathologically node-negative at definitive surgery should receive adjuvant RT to the whole breast with the addition of boost to the tumor bed after SLNB; patients who convert from clinically/radiographically positive nodes at diagnosis to node-negative after preoperative chemotherapy are candidates for the NSABP B-51 trial assessing the benefit of RNI, and until results are available existing data suggest that node-positive disease at presentation is at high risk for locoregional recurrence and should be considered to receive comprehensive RNI with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla at risk; additionally, those who convert to clinically/radiographically negative nodes but have persistent nodal disease on SLNB are candidates for the ALLIANCE 11202 trial assessing whether ALND can be safely replaced with axillary RT, and because ALND is the standard arm of this trial, if a neoadjuvant therapy patient with node-positive disease (ypN1+) does not undergo a complete axillary dissection, all levels of the undissected axilla should be included with the radiation treatment.

### Evaluating regional nodal irradiation allocation and association with oncologic outcomes in NSABP B-18, B-27, B-40, and B-41 [^113RVpoa]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

There is a lack of level I evidence to guide radiation therapy recommendations for patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. We used 4 neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials to determine which patients benefit from regional nodal irradiation (RNI).

Methods and Materials

We obtained data from the NSABP (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project) B-18, B-27, B-40, and B-41 clinical trials. B-40 and B-41 allowed RNI at physician's discretion. We evaluated locoregional recurrence (LRR), distant recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier, Peto-Peto, χ 2, Fisher exact, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for survival estimates and comparison.

Results

Median follow-up for B-18, B-27, B-40, and B-41 was 13.7, 9.7, 4.5, and 5.1 years, respectively, including 742, 2254, 1154, and 504 patients for analysis. On multivariable analysis, factors significantly associated with RNI included tumor size, ypN status, and tumor subtype; Hispanic patients were less likely to receive RNI. Patients with ypN+HER2+ disease who received RNI had improved OS. B-40 patients with ypN+HR+ disease had improved LRR. On multivariable analysis for the B-40 and B-41 study population, RNI was not associated with significantly improved OS, disease-free survival, distant recurrence, or LRR.

Conclusions

RNI was associated with a clinical benefit for patients with ypN+HER2+ and ypN+HR+ disease. RNI was not significantly associated with a clinically beneficial outcome for the entire cohort. Prospective phase 3 clinical trials are needed to establish guidelines for patients who should receive RNI after neoadjuvant treatment, and action is necessary to eliminate the disparity in care delivery shown for Hispanic women.

### Clinical outcomes and prognostic factors in patients with stage II-III breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and postmastectomy radiation therapy in the modern treatment era [^114FtJpM]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Similarly, Shim et al analyzed the clinical outcomes and risk factors for LRR and DFS in 151 patients with clinical stage II and III breast cancer who achieved ypN0 after NAC, and found PMRT not to be a significant prognostic factor. In our study, the 5-year LRFS rate for patients with ypN0 disease was significantly better than those with ypN + disease (97.2% vs 89.5%, respectively; P = 0.03). Nevertheless, whether PMRT for patients with ypN0 disease can be omitted after NAC is unclear. The results of prospective, randomized studies such as the NSABP B 51/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 1304 phase 3 clinical trial and the Alliance A011202 trial will help address this issue.

The Collaborative Trials in Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer (CTNeoBC) pooled analysis enrolled approximately 12,000 patients and aimed to establish the association between pCR and event-free survival (EFS) and OS to determine the definition of pCR that best correlates with EFS or OS. The analysis found that the best definition of pCR is the absence of invasive disease in the breast and lymph nodes (ypT0/ypTis ypN0). Using this definition, achieving a pCR resulted in a 64% reduction in the risk of death and a 52% reduction in relapse or death. In the trial-level analysis, the authors recorded little association between increases in the frequencies of pCR and EFS and OS. This pooled analysis did not validate pCR as a surrogate endpoint for improved EFS and OS.

In our study, we defined pCR as the absence of invasive disease in the breast and lymph nodes (ypT0/ypTis ypN0) and found that the predictive value of pCR was not statistically significant. Although the rate of achieving pCR was the greatest in HR-negative/HER2-positive patients, the clinical outcomes of these group were worse than those of the HR-positive/HER2-positive or HR-positive/HER2-negative groups. Therefore, we could not designate pCR as a surrogate marker for survival in concordant with the results of these studies. In our analysis, the clinical outcomes of patients with HR-positive/HER2-positive subtypes were the best among the 4 subtypes; therefore, PMRT could potentially be omitted for these patients even though their pCR rates were not high.

Ongoing axillary management trials after neoadjuvant chemotherapy — Several ongoing prospective randomized and non-randomized trials aim to assess whether omission of ALND or radiotherapy could be oncologically safe for both ypN0 and ypN+ patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or targeted axillary dissection (TAD), and studies also will evaluate patient-reported outcomes such as lymphedema and quality of life.

### Management of the axilla after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients [^117CPgTq]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Future directions

Two ongoing trials are addressing the local management of the axilla in patients with clinically node positive disease at presentation. These will likely add significantly to the evolving management of the axilla after NACT. The NRG Oncology/NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 study is examining the need for regional nodal irradiation in patients who were initially node positive and converted to node negative after NACT, and this trial has invasive breast cancer recurrence free interval as the primary outcome. Meanwhile, the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology A011202 examines the need for ALND in patients found to have a low positive axillary nodal burden after NACT. In this study patients with a positive sentinel node biopsy after NACT are randomised to completion ALND and regional nodal irradiation or to regional nodal irradiation only, with the primary outcome again being invasive breast cancer recurrence free interval. Both studies are likely to reduce the need for ALND or nodal irradiation after NACT in these select populations.

METHODS

Trial Design and Eligibility

This prospective, phase 3, multicenter, randomized trial was designed, conducted, and overseen by NRG Oncology, a member of the National Clinical Trials Network, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. The protocol was approved by either the Institutional Review Board at each participating institution or by the NCI Central Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was required for enrollment. The first three authors had full access to the data, analyzed the data, and they vouch for the accuracy of the data and analyses and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol (available with the full text of this article at). The first three authors wrote the first draft of the manuscript and made the final decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The funders had no role in the design of the trial; the collection, analysis, or interpretation of the data; the writing of the manuscript; or the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The trial received no financial support from industry.

Eligible patients had breast cancer that was clinical stage T1 to T3 (tumor size, T1, ≤ 2 cm; T2, > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm; T3, > 5 cm), N1, and M0 (indicating spread to movable, ipsilateral level I and II axillary lymph nodes but no distant metastasis) and operable at diagnosis, with pathological confirmation of the involvement of axillary nodes by either fine-needle aspiration or core-needle biopsy. Patients must have completed ≥ 8 weeks of standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy with an anthracycline and/or taxane-based regimen. Patients with HER2-positive tumors must also have received neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy (either with all or part of neoadjuvant chemotherapy), unless medically contraindicated. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients had either lumpectomy or mastectomy plus pathologic axillary lymph node assessment with either sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with ≥ 2 SLNs removed, or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) +/− prior SLNB. At surgery, all removed axillary nodes had to be pathologically negative (ypN0). Patients could receive additional adjuvant systemic therapy at the investigator's discretion.

### Rewriting the radiation playbook: NSABP B-51 and the rise of pathologic precision [^1157zpnd]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Nodal vs. breast pathologic response

Notably, about 20% of patients in the trial had residual invasive disease in the breast while achieving a pathologic complete response in the axilla. Even in this subgroup, traditionally considered high-risk due to residual tumor burden and often receiving additional boost, the omission of regional nodal irradiation did not compromise outcomes. This finding challenges the long-standing assumption that residual breast disease mandates regional radiation and instead elevates nodal response as the more clinically consequential endpoint. The implication is clear: in the modern era of response-guided care, it is the eradication of nodal disease — not breast pCR — that best predicts regional control and survival.

### Rewriting the radiation playbook: NSABP B-51 and the rise of pathologic precision [^114SgJ4q]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for high-risk subsets

This shifts the treatment compass decisively from "where disease began" to "how disease responded". Even in patients with T3 N1 tumors, 14.3% of the B-51 cohort, who underwent mastectomy and had no residual nodal disease, the study protocol permitted no radiation at all in the control arm, no chest wall radiation, no nodal irradiation; and yet these patients fared as well as their radiated counterparts. The trial also included a meaningful proportion of patients under age 50, reinforcing the relevance of these findings even in groups historically considered at higher risk. In the setting of robust pathologic clearance, additional radiation is unnecessary and may be unwarranted.

One might expect resistance to such a conclusion, particularly from radiation oncology, where postoperative chest wall and regional nodal radiation have been foundational. While current guidelines still recommend radiation in patients with T3 tumors or initial N1 disease, the trial results presented here are likely to modify those guidelines.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 Breast Cancer — RT after preoperative therapy and mastectomy states that those with clinically positive nodes at diagnosis who become node-negative after preoperative systemic therapy should be strongly considered to receive RT to the chest wall and comprehensive RNI with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla at risk; for those with positive nodes (ypN1+) after preoperative systemic therapy, axillary dissection is the standard treatment arm of the ongoing Alliance 11202 trial, and if RT is indicated it should include chest wall along with comprehensive RNI with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla at risk; those with node-negative disease at diagnosis and after preoperative systemic therapy whose axilla was assessed by SLNB or axillary node dissection may forego RT; two prospective trials are ongoing to prospectively evaluate the benefit of RT with neoadjuvant therapy (NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 [NCT01872975] and the Alliance A011202/MAC19 trial [NCT01901094]).

### A survey of practice patterns for clinical nodal staging prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer [^114mauP7]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent trials and ongoing clinical trials might change the paradigm of post-NST treatment. From the low recurrence rate following SLNB alone in patients with cN1 breast cancer who achieved cN0 after NST, the post-NST response is used to determine axillary management. Trials such as the ASLAN trial (Avoid Sentinel Lymph Node After Neoadjuvant chemotherapy; NCT04993625) and the EUBREAST-01 trial (Omission of SLNB in Triple-negative and HER2-positive Breast Cancer Patients With rCR and pCR in the Breast After NAST; NCT04101851) are recruiting participants according to the pre-NST clinical nodal status to forego SLNB. The RAPCHEM study (De-escalation of radiotherapy after primary chemotherapy in cT1-2N1 breast cancer; NCT01279304) showed that de-escalating radiotherapy based on locoregional recurrence risk in cN1 patients is oncologically safe, and the NSABP B-51 will further elucidate the de-escalated radiotherapy approach toward patients with ypN0 after NST. The biological subtype of breast cancer is also an important factor that must be considered. The pathological complete response rates from NST differ according to the biological subtypes. Therefore, some suggest that knowing the subtype could help decide treatment approaches after NST.

This study has some limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. First, this study was performed in a single country using unified national health insurance coverage. This might not reflect the circumstances in other clinical settings. Second, although we tried to include the most challenging clinical scenarios in the survey, these scenarios cannot represent every challenging situation faced in the real world. Another potential limitation of this study is that radiation oncologists, who do not routinely participate in initial nodal staging, were the most well-represented group of breast oncologists in our cohort; however, nodal status can be assessed during any stage of treatment, and any discrepancies among physicians involved in the care team — including radiation oncologists — could significantly alter the course of treatment. Lastly, the decision-making policies regarding staging and treatment differ among institutions. Therefore, the results of this survey might not be applicable to real-world practices.

### Influence of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on radiotherapy for breast cancer [^1113FUuq]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a standard treatment option for patients with locally advanced operable breast cancer and is increasingly used in early breast cancer. Initial randomized trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy established equivalency to adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of survival, but they also demonstrated improved rates of breast conservation and the ability to modify the risk of locoregional recurrence after a favorable response to chemotherapy. High-quality nonrandomized data have helped to tailor radiotherapy treatment recommendations after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy. Results from an ongoing phase 3 randomized trial (NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304) will help to clarify the value of locoregional radiotherapy for patients with clinical N1 disease that becomes node negative after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

### Omitting regional nodal irradiation after response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^111TKHyH]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

One of the challenges in de-escalating loco-regional therapy (radiotherapy or surgery) is the potential for escalation of adjuvant systemic therapy. This was not observed in our study, as only 1% of the patients received adjuvant chemotherapy (no regional nodal irradiation: < 1%; regional nodal irradiation:1%).

It is likely that outcomes of breast cancer patients will continue to improve based on several additional important developments in neoadjuvant systemic therapy, such as use of dual anti-HER2 therapy for HER-2 positive breast cancer, as well as carboplatin and checkpoint inhibitors for TNBC. These treatments will likely continue to increase the number of patients whose axillary lymph nodes convert from positive to negative, making the findings from this trial applicable to more patients in the future. In addition, new developments in post-neoadjuvant systemic therapy such as antibody-drug conjugates for HER-2 positive breast cancer, capecitabine for TNBC, CDK4/6 inhibitors for ER/PR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, and PARP inhibitors for patients with deleterious mutations in BRCA genes, will likely continue to improve outcomes of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, further minimizing the potential benefit from loco-regional treatments. Most of these developments were not part of standard clinical practice during patient accrual to our study.

In conclusion, our study has demonstrated that for patients who present with biopsy-proven axillary lymph node involvement whose positive axillary lymph nodes convert to ypN0 with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, use of regional nodal irradiation does not improve oncologic outcomes at five years. Using pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy to optimize use of regional nodal irradiation expands the clinical utility of the neoadjuvant approach. Patient follow-up continues for evaluation of longer-term outcomes.

De-escalation of radiotherapy after neoadjuvant systemic therapy — In the Dutch RAPCHEM registry (cT1-2N1, n = 838), radiotherapy (RT) was assigned by risk category with 5-year locoregional recurrence rates of 2.3% for low risk with no RT, 1.0% for intermediate risk with local RT-only and no regional nodal irradiation (RNI), and 1.4% for high risk with local RT and RNI. In NSABP B51/RTOG1304, among 1556 cT1–3 cN1 patients with nodal pCR after neoadjuvant systemic therapy, outcomes did not differ between receipt of RNI or not, with 5-year invasive disease-free survival of 92.7% versus 91.8% and 5-year overall survival of 93.6% versus 94%, highlighting potential to de-escalate radiotherapy for complete responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Clinical efficacy and toxicity

The authors should be commended for the precision of the trial's design and the discipline of its execution. Radiation planning was based on CT simulation and subjected to centralized quality assurance. Adverse event monitoring was comprehensive, and the absence of unexpected toxicity enhances the credibility of the findings. Grade 3 dermatitis occurred in 10.3% of patients in the RNI group versus 6.5% in the no-RNI group, a clinically meaningful difference. But perhaps their greatest contribution is philosophical: a recalibration of how we think about risk, benefit, and the architecture of treatment.

This study convincingly answers a practical clinical question that has long hovered in the space between guideline, judgment, and bias rooted in institutional practice patterns, training, or interpretation of retrospective literature: does a patient who presents with N1 disease, sterilized by systemic therapy, still require nodal irradiation? The answer, based on this well-executed trial, is no; though some important questions remain.

The trial met its rigorous design objectives and had high protocol adherence (97% completed their assigned radiation regimen), with a five-year event rate of invasive breast cancer recurrence or death of 2.9% in the no-RNI group versus 2.1% in the RNI group (hazard ratio, 0.88; P = 0.51). Locoregional recurrence was uncommon in both groups (1.4% vs. 0.8%), and there were no significant differences in distant recurrence, disease-free survival, or overall survival. While the follow-up is limited to five years, relatively short for hormone receptor–positive disease, the absolute number of events was low in both arms. This limits the likelihood that large absolute differences would emerge in the ensuing years. Furthermore, as CDK4/6 inhibitors become standard in high-risk HR+ disease, the baseline recurrence risk may decline further, potentially diminishing the marginal benefit of regional radiation in this population. Though a non-significant trend toward benefit in HR+ patients was observed (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.49–1.06), this requires continued observation.

This is a practice-altering study. And it lands at a moment when breast oncology is increasingly defined not by what we add, but by what we safely omit. Just as the ACOSOG Z0011and AMAROStrials shifted the axillary surgery paradigm for patients with minimal nodal disease, and as MINDACTand TAILORxhave enabled endocrine therapy to replace chemotherapy for many genomically low-risk patients, NSABP B-51 invites us to abandon an outdated heuristic: that initial clinical stage should dictate final local-regional treatment.

### Ten-year survival after postmastectomy chest-wall irradiation in breast cancer [^111igsDK]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

We recognize the recent shift from axillary node clearance to regional nodal irradiation as primary treatment. The EBCTCG overview of trials of regional nodal irradiation shows it achieves a modest reduction in breast cancer mortality in patients with N1 disease, whereas SUPREMO shows no evidence of a survival benefit from the CWI component of post-mastectomy radiotherapy. If regional nodal irradiation is required, modern radiotherapy techniques can deliver homogeneous dose to the lymph node target volumes whilst avoiding the chest wall or reconstructed breast.

Our trial has some limitations. First, SUPREMO was initiated nearly two decades ago. There have been many improvements in practice since then, which have led to lower local recurrence rates. Second, many intermediate risk patients are now treated with neo-adjuvant systemic therapy but this practice was very limited in SUPREMO. The EBCTCG meta-analysisshowed no difference in survival between patients treated with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The NSABP-B51/RTOG-1304 trialincluded patients with cN1 disease who converted to ypN0 after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. There was no effect of post-mastectomy radiotherapy in the mastectomy patients on the invasive breast cancer recurrence-free interval. Overall survival at 5 years (approximately 92%) is similar to the survival seen in SUPREMO at the same time point. Third, considerable reductions in axillary surgery have become standard practice. In SUPREMO axillary node clearance was mandatory for N1 disease. Since then, it is apparent that no particular axillary node staging procedure influences overall survival in early breast cancer. Published trials show that axillary node clearance has been replaced by Sentinel Node Biopsy, axillary radiation or no further treatment, including patients treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Finally, the importance of identifying the number of pathologically involved axillary nodes in predicting prognosis is evolving and superseded by a multimodal approach to predict risk of recurrence and death from breast cancer based on a combination of tumor characteristics, axillary imaging and gene expression profiling. The TAILOR RT trial (NCT03488693) for example is utilizing gene expression profiling with Oncotype DX in N1, ER+ and HER2- disease to tailor indications for adjuvant locoregional radiotherapy. The TRANS-SUPREMO tissue archive is available for investigating prognostic and predictive biomarkers.

### Omitting regional nodal irradiation after response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^114cG18t]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

DISCUSSION

Safety information was available for 1,559 patients (759 in the irradiation group and 800 in the no-irradiation group). There were no trial-related deaths and no unexpected adverse events. Grade 4 adverse events occurred in 0.5% of patients in the irradiation group and 0.1% of those in the no-irradiation group; grade 3 adverse events occurred in 10.0% and 6.5%, respectively. The most common grade 3 adverse event was radiation dermatitis, which occurred in 5.7% of patients in the irradiation group and 3.3% of those in the no-irradiation group (Table S5).

Our trial has multiple important aspects. Although numerous prior clinical trials have demonstrated benefit from regional nodal irradiation in patients with positive axillary lymph nodes who undergo surgery first, this trial evaluated regional nodal irradiation in patients who present with node-positive breast cancer but whose axillary lymph nodes convert to pathologically negative after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our study results demonstrate that pCR in axillary lymph nodes is predictive of lack of benefit from regional nodal irradiation.

In previous regional nodal irradiation trials for patients treated with upfront surgery, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative subtype predominated, reflecting the typical distribution of newly diagnosed disease. In contrast, given the higher likelihood of pathologic response in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer patients, these subtypes comprise the majority (79%) of our trial's patient population (HER2+ 57%; TNBC 22%).

This multicenter trial is the first to require volume-based CT planning for regional nodal irradiation, with the use of three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy or intensity-modulated radiation therapy, and the protocol specified goals based on dose–volume histograms for target coverage and avoidance of organs at risk. A centralized program of quality assurance ensured accurate delivery of radiation therapy, so variation in treatment quality or delivery cannot explain the lack of benefit from regional nodal irradiation. The incidence of grade 3 dermatitis, a common adverse event, was 5.7% among patients who received regional nodal irradiation, reflecting the safety achievable with the use of these methods for the delivery of regional nodal irradiation when indicated. Radiation therapy was delivered with conventional fractionation (a total dose of 50 Gy was given in 25 fractions); however, our findings are equally applicable to moderately hypofractionated radiation therapy.

### ASO author reflections: residual disease in the breast after neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not mandate routine post-mastectomy radiation therapy / regional nodal irradiation [^113V52EF]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Past:

Postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) and regional nodal irradiation (RNI) improve survival among patients who are at high risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR). While PMRT/RNI is routinely recommended to patients with nodal metastases, the benefit of PMRT/RNI in node negative patients remains poorly defined despite their inclusion in two randomized trials of PMRT/RNI. While data to inform decisions regarding PMRT/RNI following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) are limited, multiple studies, including the joint analysis of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-18 and B-27 trials, have identified absence of pathologic complete response (pCR) as a predictor of LRR.

However, while residual disease is associated with increased LRR among patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive and triple negative (TN) tumors, patients with hormone receptor positive (HR+) tumors have low LRR rates regardless of NAC response. Whether the absolute risk of LRR is high enough to justify PMRT/RNI for node-negative patients with residual disease in the breast after NAC is uncertain.

### A survey of practice patterns for clinical nodal staging prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer [^113W17YJ]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Historically, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy were performed following an upfront surgery for breast cancer. Recently, the use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) in breast cancer has increased based on studies, including the landmark National Surgical Bowel and Breast Project (NSABP) B-18 and B-27 trials.

Before the use of NST, the nodal stage was mostly pathologically determined after upfront surgery, and it affected all treatment processes. Whether a patient receives chemotherapy and with which regimen is determined according to their nodal stage. The pathological nodal stage also plays an important role in determining the extent of axillary surgery. Recent trials reported that the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone shows comparable outcomes to those of axillary lymph node dissection in patients with breast cancer with a low burden of axillary metastasis. Additionally, adjuvant radiotherapy has been administered to patients based on pathological staging. Moreover, radiation fields in terms of regional nodal irradiation are influenced by the presence or number of positive nodes after surgery. These issues remain debatable in each area, especially in detailed clinical situations.

After the use of NST, the clinical stage was used more frequently than before and became as important as pathological staging before the NST era. The clinical nodal stage plays an important role in determining whether to apply NST as well as in deciding its regimen and assessing NST response. Presently, it is considered safe to perform SLNB for patients who were initially lymph node-positive but have no suspicious lymph nodes after NST. Regarding radiation therapy after NST, it is recommended to determine the field and dose based on the maximal disease stage before NST and after surgery. As downstaging is frequently achieved after NST, radiation therapy is performed based on the clinical stage before NST in most cases.

This strategy of determining the treatment plan based on the clinical stage in patients with NST presupposes that the concept or prognostic impact of the clinical and pathological stages is consistent. However, the criteria for clinical and pathological nodal staging are different in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) breast cancer staging, thereby rendering it difficult to decide the optimal treatment. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how specialists determine the clinical nodal staging before NST and the factors that clinicians should consider in assessing clinical nodal staging.

### Nodal positivity in patients with clinically and radiologically node-negative breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy: multicentre collaborative study [^1155Wct7]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Nodal status remains important to guide administration of post-mastectomy radiotherapy and regional nodal irradiation in patients with low-volume nodal disease (1–2 positive sentinel nodes) after BCS or mastectomy. A potential concern associated with the omission of SLNB is the inability to identify patients who may benefit from radiotherapy on the basis of nodal involvement. Notably, the rate of ypN+ in select patients is low (less than 3% in those with an rCR) and less than the accepted FNR (less than 10%) of SLNB post-NACT. Patient preference and shared decision-making will be important if considering omission. The adjunctive role of genomic assays and biomarker-directed approaches in predicting the benefit of radiotherapy and guiding treatment strategies is an evolving area of interest. The Adjuvant Radiotherapy Intensification Classifier ('ARTIC'), comprising 27 genes and patient age, was found to be highly prognostic for locoregional recurrence (LRR) in patients treated with radiotherapy and predictive of radiotherapy benefit. In patients with a significantly elevated risk of LRR, regional nodal irradiation could be considered. Conversely, patients with a low risk of LRR may potentially be spared radiotherapy. Similarly, the 16-gene POLAR genomic signature identified patients with a low risk of LRR, despite not receiving radiotherapy, and thus possible candidates for omission. Patients categorized as POLAR low-risk without radiotherapy had a 10-year LRR of 6% in the SweBCG91-RT cohort and did not derive a significant benefit from radiotherapy. These studies did not focus on patients treated with NACT and thus the role of genomic markers in guiding locoregional radiotherapy in the setting of NACT is unclear. The National Cancer Institute of Cancer Clinical Trials Group MA.20 trial found that the addition of regional nodal irradiation to whole-breast radiation, after BCS in women with high-risk breast cancer (for example oestrogen receptor negativity or grade 3 disease), did not improve overall survival, but did reduce breast cancer recurrence. Patients with clinically and radiologically node-negative breast cancer treated with NACT (for example TNBC) may be considered as having unfavourable disease biology from the outset. Whether the presence of unfavourable biology is a relative indication for nodal irradiation remains to be determined. The need for SLNB in patients with cN0 breast cancer is currently being investigated in several clinical trials. These trials (SOUND, INSEMA, NAUTILUS, and BOOG 2013–08) are randomizing patients with cN0 breast cancer (all subtypes) to SLNB (and axillary lymph node dissection if indicated) versus no axillary staging procedure. Their primary endpoints are disease-free survival and regional recurrence. Notably, these trials are not in the setting of NACT.

### Clinical trials for the surgical oncologist: opportunities and hurdles [^113ytfZU]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Advancements in clinical practice usually require level one evidence from clinical trials that directly compare new approaches to standard of care. While clinical trials have provided data to guide advances in practices across surgical oncology, all too often accrual to clinical trials is slower than anticipated, and once results are presented and published, adoption in clinical practice is slow. Why and how can surgeons be successfully involved with clinical trials? An expert panel discusses the basic infrastructure of clinical trials, investigator-initiated trials, the National Clinical Trials Network, and opportunities for surgeon involvement. Two national clinical trials, NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 and PROSPECT N1048, are discussed to highlight the role of the surgical oncologist.

### Omitting regional nodal irradiation after response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^112bjKYA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The effect of regional nodal irradiation in subgroups defined according to stratification variables (the type of breast surgery [lumpectomy vs. mastectomy], hormone receptor status, HER2 status, the presence or absence of a pathological complete response in the breast, and the receipt or lack of adjuvant chemotherapy) was consistent with the effect among the trial population overall (Figure 3A). In an exploratory analysis, the effect of regional nodal irradiation was examined according to age, race, breast cancer subtype, and the type of axillary surgery (Figure 3B); the results indicated potential differences in the effect of regional nodal irradiation among patients with cancer that was triple negative (hazard ratio for primary end point event, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.00 to 5.25) or hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (hazard ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.99).

Safety

Toxicity information had been received for 1,559 patients (No regional nodal irradiation:800; regional nodal irradiation:759). There were no study-related deaths and no unexpected toxicities. Grade 4 toxicity was rare (No regional nodal irradiation: 0.1%, vs. regional nodal irradiation: 0.5%); Grade 3 toxicity was uncommon (No regional nodal irradiation: 6.5%, regional nodal irradiation:10%). Most common Grade 3 toxicity was radiation dermatitis (No regional nodal irradiation: 3.3%, regional nodal irradiation: 5.7%) (Table S5).

NCCN Breast cancer — RT after preoperative therapy and mastectomy: Those who have clinically positive nodes at diagnosis that respond to preoperative systemic therapy and become node-negative should be strongly considered to receive RT to the chest wall and comprehensive regional nodal irradiation (RNI) with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla at risk. For those with positive nodes (ypN1+) after preoperative systemic therapy, if RT is indicated it should include chest wall along with comprehensive RNI with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla at risk. Those who have node-negative disease at diagnosis and after preoperative systemic therapy and whose axilla was assessed by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary node dissection may forego RT.

Ongoing and upcoming clinical trials addressing axillary disease management

NSABP-51/RTOG 1304 trial

With the acknowledgement that selected clinically node-positive patients who have a response to NCT may not undergo ALND in the future, cooperative groups are organizing trials to evaluate the optimal locoregional treatment for patients. One such trial, NSABP-51/RTOG 1304, is currently enrolling patients with biopsy-proven node-positive (N1) disease who undergo NCT and have no residual nodal disease (by SLND or ALND), and randomizes them to axillary radiation versus no axillary radiation. The primary endpoints will be recurrence and survival, but information on toxicity, effect of radiation on cosmetic outcome, and quality of life will also be collected.

ALLIANCE trial A11202

Another cooperative group trial is enrolling patients with biopsy-proven N1 disease who do not achieve a nodal pCR with NCT. The goal of the Alliance A11202 trial is to compare the efficacy of ALND plus radiation to radiation alone clinically node-positive patients who remain node-positive at SLND after NCT. The primary end points of the trial are locoregional recurrence and survival; however, there is a strong correlative component of the trial dedicated to lymphedema that should help delineate the differences in toxicity between axillary surgery and radiation together versus radiation alone.

MD Anderson Trial 2013–0877

If it is feasible to identify abnormal axillary nodes and prove metastases by percutaneous needle-biopsy before NCT, might it be possible to do this after NCT and potentially spare patients from any axillary nodal surgery? This concept and hypothesis is being tested in MD Anderson trial 2013–0877, which is designed as a study to correlate fine needle aspiration to surgical excision to assess for eradication of nodal metastases after NCT in breast cancer.

### Comparison of targeted axillary dissection with sentinel node biopsy alone on nodal recurrence for patients who have node-positive breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^111xWehU]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

The strength of our study was the comparison of patients who had SLNB alone and those who underwent TAD. In our study, both groups similarly showed no axillary recurrences at a median of 28 months despite a statistically significant higher clipped node retention in the SLNB-alone group.

Another benefit of retrieving the clipped node is the potential sparing of nodal radiation for those who achieve an axillary pCR. Three of the five patients who did not have the clipped node retrieved received nodal irradiation. It may be important to excise this clipped node because results of the NRG Oncology/NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 trial evaluating invasive breast cancer recurrence in this population of patients with positive axillary nodes who are ypN0 after NAC become applicable.

In the Netherlands, Nijveldt et al.implemented TAD procedures using radioactive I-125 seeds in 309 patients and showed during a median follow-up period of 2.8 years that 14% of the patients experienced recurrence, and only 3.5% had an axillary ecurrence. Although they similarly demonstrated that axillary recurrences were low in this group, they did not report a comparison group to evaluate outcomes for patients who did not have the clipped node retrieved.

Although data have emerged demonstrating low axillary recurrence with either TAD or SLNB alone, data on institutions comparing methods of TAD and SLNB alone are limited. Our study demonstrated low axillary recurrences for both the patients who had SLNB alone and those who had TAD despite a higher non-retrieval of the clipped node in the SLNB-alone group. This allowed for a more balanced comparison of patients during the same period, when medical treatments with chemotherapy and immunotherapy were similar.

Some limitations in applying TAD to the community setting must be considered. Availability of radiologists and surgeons who can perform axillary localizations before or after chemotherapy can be challenging because of difficulty identifying the clipped node. Also, the surgical technique has some limitations. Clips can migrate and be lost or suctioned out, and clips may not be in the actual lymph node. Localizations can lead to larger resections of axillary tissue, and the clipped node may not be retrieved despite the targeted effort.

### Omitting regional nodal irradiation after response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^114C76Xv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Statistical Analysis

The primary analysis was based on the intent-to-treat principle. Differences between treatment arms were assessed by stratified log rank test, controlling for stratification factors. Pooling strategy for stratification factors was implemented so the number of events per treatment group within any individual stratum was ≥ 5. The stratified Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios and confidence intervals. Assumption of proportionality of hazards between treatment groups was tested for all time-to-event endpoints. Statistical tests were two-sided and were carried out at the 0.05 level. No adjustment for multiplicity was planned for the analyses of the secondary endpoints and subgroup analyses.

The trial was designed to have 80% power to test the hypothesis that treatment with regional nodal irradiation would reduce the annual hazard rate of invasive breast cancer recurrence-free interval events by 35%. Accrual of 1,636 patients during a five-year period (~28 patients/month) with two additional years of follow-up was planned. Three formal interim analyses of the primary endpoint for efficacy and futility were scheduled before definitive analysis - - after 43, 86, and 129 events were observed, respectively. Final analysis was planned for when 172 events were observed. The protocol also specified that if at 10-years post-trial activation the total number of events was less than the number required for final analysis, consideration would be given to report the results.

The first two interim analyses were conducted based on 10/31/2019 and 10/31/2021 data cutoff. As of the 10-year anniversary of the trial activation, the number of events required for the third interim analysis had not been achieved. This triggered the final, time-driven analysis, as prespecified in the protocol. Analyses reported here include all data as of 09/14/2023.

### The impact of postmastectomy and regional nodal radiation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for clinically lymph node-positive breast cancer: a national cancer database (NCDB) analysis [^1165z8AU]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), the optimal strategies for postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) and regional nodal irradiation (RNI) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) are controversial. In this analysis, we evaluate the impact of these radiotherapy (RT) approaches for women with clinically node-positive breast cancer treated with NAC in the National Cancer Database (NCDB).

Patients and Methods

Women with cT1-3 cN1 M0 breast cancer treated with NAC were divided into four cohorts by surgery [Mastectomy (Mast) versus BCS] and post-chemotherapy pathologic nodal status (ypN0 versus ypN+). Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and RT approaches were analyzed using the log-rank test, multivariate Cox models, and propensity score-matched analyses.

Results

From 2003 to 2011, 15 315 cases were identified including 3040 Mast-ypN0, 7243 Mast-ypN+, 2070 BCS-ypN0, and 2962 BCS-ypN+ patients. On univariate analysis, PMRT was associated with improved OS for both Mast-ypN0 (P = 0.019) and Mast-ypN+ (P < 0.001) patients. On multivariate analyses adjusted for factors including age, comorbidity score, cT stage, in-breast pathologic complete response, axillary surgery, ypN stage, estrogen receptor status and hormone therapy, PMRT remained independently associated with improved OS among Mast-ypN0 [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.729, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.566–0.939, P = 0.015] and Mast-ypN+ patients (HR = 0.772, 95% CI 0.689–0.866, P < 0.001). No differences in OS were observed with the addition of RNI to breast RT for BCS-ypN0 or BCS-ypN+ patients. Propensity score-matched analyses demonstrated identical patterns of significance. On subset analysis, OS was improved with PMRT in each pathologic nodal subgroup (ypN0, ypN1, and ypN2-3) (all P < 0.05).

Conclusions

In the largest reported analysis of RT for cN1 patients treated with NAC, PMRT was associated with improved OS for all pathologic nodal subgroups. No OS differences were observed with the addition of RNI to breast RT.

### Oncologic safety of sentinel lymph node biopsy alone after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer [^1119MjYv]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The oncologic safety of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone for clinically node-positive (cN1-2) patients who convert to pathologic node-negativity (ypN0) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is not well established.

Methods

This study retrospectively identified 244 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of cT1-3cN0-2 breast cancer who underwent NAC followed by SLNB at the authors' institution between 2013 and 2018. The patients were categorized as clinically node-negative (cN0) or cN1-2 before the onset of NAC, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare locoregional and distant recurrence rates after SLNB alone for ypN0 patients.

Results

Among 244 patients who underwent NAC followed by surgery with SLNB for axillary staging, 112 (45.9%) were cN0 at presentation, whereas 132 (54.5%) had biopsy-proven cN1-2 disease and converted to cN0 after treatment. Of the patients presenting with cN0 disease, 102 (91.1%) were ypN0 on SLNB pathology compared with 60 cN1/2 patients (45.5%; p < 0.001). Regional nodal irradiation was administered to 5% of the cN0/ypN0 patients compared with 70.7% of the cN1-2/ypN0 patients (p < 0.001). Overall, 211 patients were treated with SLNB alone and had a median follow-up period of 36 months (interquartile range [IQR], 24–53 months). For 101 cN0/ypN0 patients who underwent SLNB alone, the 5-year local and regional recurrence rates were respectively 5.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4–13.8) and 1% (95% CI 0.1–7.0). For 58 cN1-2/ypN0 patients who underwent SLNB alone, the 5-year local and regional recurrence rates were respectively 4.1% (95% CI 1.0–15.5) and 0%, with no axillary recurrences noted.

Conclusion

For ypN0 patients, SLNB alone after NAC is associated with low and acceptable short-term axillary recurrence rates. Additional follow-up data from prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm long-term oncologic safety and define optimal local therapy recommendations.

### An overview of the importance of neoadjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer patients: from the Society of Surgical Oncology and the American Society of Breast Surgeons [^115Z9mVz]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Clinically node-negative breast cancer (cN0) — sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NST has been proven feasible and oncologically safe, with comparable locoregional outcomes to upfront surgery. In an MD Anderson Cancer Center study with a median follow-up period of 47 months, local recurrences were 1.2% vs. 2.1% (p = 0.5) and regional recurrences were 0.9% vs. 1.2% (p = 0.1) between upfront surgery (n = 3171) and NST (n = 575). In a European Institute of Oncology cohort, among 466 cN0 patients who were ypN0, there were only 7 axillary recurrences (1.5%) at 9.2 years. It is widely accepted that SLNB can and should be performed after NST for cN0 patients because pre-NST SLNB leads to higher ALND rates.

### The role of the neo-bioscore staging system in guiding the optimal strategies for regional nodal irradiation following neoadjuvant treatment in breast cancer patients with cN1 and ypN0-1 [^117QPk4o]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in patients with cN1 breast cancer following neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) is still controversial. The Neo-Bioscore staging system has shown promising prospect in assessing individual prognosis after NAT, and we sought to evaluate the role of Neo-Bioscore in guiding RNI following NAT.

Methods

Medical records of 163 women with cN1 and ypN0-1 disease treated with NAT between 2009 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed and a Neo-Bioscore was assigned to each patient. Survivals were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was used to identify independent predictors by using Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

The median follow-up after surgery was 59.4 months. Of all 163 patients, 119 received RNI. At surgery, 36 patients (22.1%) had pathological complete response (pCR), while 89 patients (54.6%) achieved ypN0. In the whole cohort, RNI significantly improved distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) on multivariable analysis. In the subgroup of patients with a Neo-Bioscore of 1–3, RNI significantly improved the 5-year DMFS rate of 97.0% versus 76.9% (p = 0.002), 5-year regional node recurrence-free survival rate of 95.5% versus 76.9% (p = 0.007), and 5-year overall survival rate of 100% versus 89.2% (p = 0.005). No significant difference in outcomes was found between the RNI and non-RNI groups in patients with a score of 4–6.

Conclusions

In patients with cN1 and ypN0-1, RNI was found to significantly improve DMFS following NAT. Patients with a Neo-Bioscore of 1–3 are more likely to benefit from RNI, however a large prospective study is needed to confirm this finding.

Invasive breast cancer — post-mastectomy adjuvant therapy after neoadjuvant treatment: Adjuvant systemic therapy (BINV-16) + PMRT is guided as follows — cN+ and ypN0: strongly consider PMRT to the chest wall and comprehensive RNI including any portion of the undissected axilla at risk; any ypN+: PMRT is indicated to the chest wall + comprehensive RNI including any portion of the undissected axilla at risk; cT4, any N: RT is indicated to the chest wall + comprehensive RNI including any portion of the undissected axilla at risk; and cT3, cN0, and ypN0: consider PMRT to the chest wall + comprehensive RNI including any portion of the undissected axilla at risk. When adjuvant systemic therapy (BINV-16) is given with no PMRT, any cN0, ypN0 applies if the axilla was assessed by SLNB or axillary node dissection.

Post-NAC radiotherapy outcomes and ongoing trials — observational and randomized evidence: In mastectomy patients treated with NAC, propensity score–matched analysis showed overall survival benefits with postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT), including 92% survival in node-negative patients with PMRT versus 90% without PMRT (HR, 0.695; 95% CI, 0.518 to 0.929; P = 0.014) and 80% versus 76% in node-positive patients (HR, 0.845; 95% CI, 0.738 to 0.968; P = 0.015). In breast-conserving surgery cohorts, adding locoregional nodal irradiation (LRNI) did not provide a statistically significant overall survival benefit, with 93% versus 92% survival in node-negative patients (HR, 1.028; 95% CI, 0.716 to 1.47; P = 0.880) and 84% versus 85% in node-positive patients (HR, 0.962; 95% CI, 0.785 to 1.175; P = 0.704). In mastectomy patients with T1–T2 tumors, PMRT did not improve locoregional recurrence (HR, 0.94; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.95; P = 0.86). Two ongoing randomized trials are cited: MAC.19 (NCT01901094) to be completed in 2024 and RTQG 1304/NSABP B51 (NCT01872975) to be completed in 2028 with first data available in 2023; MAC.19 compares ALND with LRNI in cT1–T3 N1 patients who remain node-positive after NAC, while RTQG 1304/NSABP B51 tests added chest wall/breast irradiation plus LRNI strategies in patients converting to node-negative after NAC.

### Patterns of practice of regional nodal irradiation in breast cancer: results of the European organization for research and treatment of cancer (EORTC) NOdal radiotherapy (NORA) survey [^116eG9MW]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Predicting outcome of breast cancer (BC) patients based on sentinel lymph node (SLN) status without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is an area of uncertainty. It influences the decision-making for regional nodal irradiation (RNI). The aim of the NORA (NOdal RAdiotherapy) survey was to examine the patterns of RNI.

Methods

A web-questionnaire, including several clinical scenarios, was distributed to 88 EORTC-affiliated centers. Responses were received between July 2013 and January 2014.

Results

A total of 84 responses were analyzed. While three-dimensional (3D) radiotherapy (RT) planning is carried out in 81 (96%) centers, nodal areas are delineated in only 51 (61%) centers. Only 14 (17%) centers routinely link internal mammary chain (IMC) and supraclavicular node (SCN) RT indications. In patients undergoing total mastectomy (TM) with ALND, SCN-RT is recommend by 5 (6%), 53 (63%) and 51 (61%) centers for patients with pN0(i+), pN(mi) and pN1, respectively. Extra-capsular extension (ECE) is the main factor influencing decision-making RNI after breast conserving surgery (BCS) and TM. After primary systemic therapy (PST), 49 (58%) centers take into account nodal fibrotic changes in ypN0 patients for RNI indications. In ypN0 patients with inner/central tumors, 23 (27%) centers indicate SCN-RT and IMC-RT. In ypN1 patients, SCN-RT is delivered by less than half of the centers in patients with ypN(i+) and ypN(mi). Twenty-one (25%) of the centers recommend ALN-RT in patients with ypN(mi) or 1-2N+ after ALND. Seventy-five (90%) centers state that age is not considered a limiting factor for RNI.

Conclusion

The NORA survey is unique in evaluating the impact of SLNB/ALND status on adjuvant RNI decision-making and volumes after BCS/TM with or without PST. ALN-RT is often indicated in pN1 patients, particularly in the case of ECE. Besides the ongoing NSABP-B51/RTOG and ALLIANCE trials, NORA could help to design future specific RNI trials in the SLNB era without ALND in patients receiving or not PST.

### The evolving and multidisciplinary considerations in nodal radiation in breast cancer [^114uFF8p]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

The therapeutic management of regional lymph nodes in breast cancer has seen a remarkable change in the past 2 decades. Clinical trials have refined our knowledge regarding the biology of the disease including the prognostic significance of disease in the regional lymph nodes. The contemporary management of lymph nodes is also influenced by advances in surgical technique, radiation oncology delivery systems, and effective systemic therapy regimens. This paper describes the role of regional nodal irradiation in the context of the de-escalation of axillary surgery, improved understanding of the molecular and pathologic features, and increasing use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

### Elective regional nodal irradiation in prostate cancer [^113W81Xx]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Elective nodal radiotherapy (ENRT) targets microscopic pelvic lymph node metastases to improve locoregional control in prostate cancer. Recent randomized trials report improved outcomes, particularly in high-risk cohorts, albeit with modest increases in Grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities. Molecular imaging has markedly refined patient selection, enabling precise identification of occult nodal disease and enhancing application of ENRT beyond traditional clinical parameters. Modern radiation therapy approaches, including image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), have enhanced ENRT efficacy and safety by employing stringent organ-at-risk constraints. Recent evidence supports SBRT-based ENRT (25 Gy in 5 fractions), demonstrating both efficacy and acceptable toxicity profiles. In the postoperative adjuvant context, ENRT shows promise for patients with pathological nodal involvement (pN+), particularly those with ≥ 3 positive nodes, high-grade disease, or positive surgical margins. In the salvage setting, combining ENRT with short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may benefit patients with biochemical recurrence and adverse pathological features, even in node-negative cases. Until definitive data emerges from ongoing randomized trials, multidisciplinary evaluation and integration of modern imaging and radiotherapy techniques remain essential for optimal ENRT in prostate cancer.

### Omission of axillary lymph node dissection is associated with inferior survival in breast cancer patients with residual N1 nodal disease following neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^111FRpf2]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The appropriateness of substituting sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) and regional nodal irradiation (RNI) for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with residual lymph node (LN) disease following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is unknown. We used the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to compare survival following SLND and ALND in breast cancer patients with residual LN disease.

Methods

We analyzed NCDB patients, treated between 2006 and 2014, with cT1-3, cN1, cM0 breast cancer and residual disease in 1–3 axillary LNs (ypN1) following NAC. Patients were grouped into those who received SLND (defined as removal of ≤ 4 LNs) and RNI, or ALND and RNI. Patients were matched for all patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics.

Results

We identified 1313 eligible patients in the ALND group and 304 patients in the SLND group. For the matched cohorts, SLND was associated with significantly lower survival in both univariate and doubly robust multivariable analyses (MVA) (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3–2.2, P < 0.001 for MVA), with estimated 5-year OS of 71%, compared with 77% in the ALND group (P = 0.01). Exploratory subgroup analyses showed that SLND was comparable with ALND in patients with luminal A or B tumors with a single metastatic LN (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.59–1.8, (P = 0.91).

Conclusions

Our analysis suggests that, while an ALND may not be needed for patients with limited residual nodal burden and biologically favorable tumors, SLND should not be routinely substituted for ALND in patients with ypN1 disease following NAC until its efficacy is confirmed by prospective trials.

### Omitting regional nodal irradiation after response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^116YHJc9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Eligible patients were stratified according to the type of surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy), estrogen-progesterone hormone receptor status, HER2 status (negative or positive), the use of adjuvant chemotherapy (yes or no), and the presence or absence of a pathological complete response in the breast and then randomly assigned to undergo regional nodal irradiation (chest-wall irradiation plus regional nodal irradiation after mastectomy or the addition of regional nodal irradiation to whole-breast irradiation after lumpectomy) or to omit regional nodal irradiation (with no irradiation after mastectomy or whole-breast irradiation only after lumpectomy) (Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).

The primary aim of the trial was to evaluate whether patients who received regional nodal irradiation (the irradiation group) would have a longer invasive breast cancer recurrence-free interval than patients who did not receive regional nodal irradiation (the no-irradiation group). The invasive breast cancer recurrence-free interval (referred to as the recurrence-free interval according to Standardized Definitions for Efficacy End Points [STEEP] criteria) was defined as the time from randomization to invasive locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, or death from breast cancer.

Secondary aims (reported here) were to compare the two study arms for overall survival (defined as time from randomization to death from any cause); loco-regional recurrence-free interval (LRRFI) (defined as time from randomization to breast cancer recurrence within the breast [invasive or DCIS] or in lymph nodes of the ipsilateral axilla, infraclavicular fossa, or ipsilateral internal mammary chain without evidence of distant disease or death from breast cancer); distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI) (defined as time from randomization to development of distant recurrence or death from breast cancer), and disease-free survival (DFS-DCIS). Also, toxicity within each study arm was evaluated. Additional secondary endpoints, including Quality-of-life substudy, will be reported separately.

### Standardized definitions for efficacy end points in neoadjuvant breast cancer clinical trials: neoSTEEP [^116c8e3F]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

PURPOSE

The Standardized Definitions for Efficacy End Points (STEEP) criteria, established in 2007 and updated in 2021 (STEEP 2.0), provide standardized definitions of adjuvant breast cancer (BC) end points. STEEP 2.0 identified a need to separately address end points for neoadjuvant clinical trials. The multidisciplinary NeoSTEEP working group of experts was convened to critically evaluate and align neoadjuvant BC trial end points.

METHODS

The NeoSTEEP working group concentrated on neoadjuvant systemic therapy end points in clinical trials with efficacy outcomes — both pathologic and time-to-event survival end points — particularly for registrational intent. Special considerations for subtypes and therapeutic approaches, imaging, nodal staging at surgery, bilateral and multifocal diseases, correlative tissue collection, and US Food and Drug Administration regulatory considerations were contemplated.

RESULTS

The working group recommends a preferred definition of pathologic complete response (pCR) as the absence of residual invasive cancer in the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes (ypT0/Tis ypN0 per AJCC staging). Residual cancer burden should be a secondary end point to facilitate future assessment of its utility. Alternative end points are needed for hormone receptor–positive disease. Time-to-event survival end point definitions should pay particular attention to the measurement starting point. Trials should include end points originating at random assignment (event-free survival and overall survival) to capture presurgery progression and deaths as events. Secondary end points adapted from STEEP 2.0, which are defined from starting at curative-intent surgery, may also be appropriate. Specification and standardization of biopsy protocols, imaging, and pathologic nodal evaluation are also crucial.

CONCLUSION

End points in addition to pCR should be selected on the basis of clinical and biologic aspects of the tumor and the therapeutic agent investigated. Consistent prespecified definitions and interventions are paramount for clinically meaningful trial results and cross-trial comparison.

### Management of the axilla in early-stage breast cancer: Ontario health (cancer care Ontario) and ASCO guideline [^113jXBd5]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Early-stage breast cancer — literature search results (Objectives 1–5) report that for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) versus no dissection, a systematic review pooled two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in older women, then was updated with two additional RCTs and identification of six ongoing trials including a subgroup with 1–2 positive nodes; trials included SOUND, BOOG 2013–08, INSEMA, an Italian trial, NCT01821768, and NCT02167490. For women without nodal metastases who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), the panel endorsed Recommendation 1 of the ASCO guideline for surgical interventions, used the Early Breast Cancer Collaborative Group individual patient data meta-analysis for radiotherapy with three primary studies, and noted that 10% of MA.20 participants had node-negative high-risk features. For sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)–positive women without NAC, four comparisons were considered — no further axillary surgery beyond SLNB versus ALND; radiotherapy plus surgery versus no locoregional nodal irradiation; radiotherapy versus ALND; and radiotherapy versus no treatment — with endorsement of Recommendation 2.1 for comparison A, use of an updated review with an individual patient data meta-analysis of 22 trials for comparison C, and identification of two trials for comparison D in women treated with mastectomy and either chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. For women treated with NAC, the ASCO guideline and three systematic reviews were outdated and no RCTs were identified; there were no completed studies for initially pathologically node-negative patients, three observational studies for node-positive patients on direct outcomes, no completed trial comparing radiotherapy with ALND, and no meta-analysis was conducted because of heterogeneity; two RCTs are recruiting (MAC.19, NCT01901094; NSABP-B-51, NCT01872975). For axillary staging modalities, no existing guidelines provided relevant recommendations; three systematic reviews were included, evidence covered single versus dual tracer and ultrasound (US)-guided versus traditional SLNB, with one primary study and nine diagnostic studies for single versus dual tracer, and two direct patient outcome studies plus 15 test accuracy studies for US versus SLNB; meta-analysis was not performed because of heterogeneity.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112yGkdb]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — resectable/borderline resectable setting: Data are limited to support specific treatment options, but data suggest that radiation therapy (RT) in the neoadjuvant setting may lead to an increased likelihood of a margin-negative resection and local control. If RT is being administered in the neoadjuvant setting, it is generally recommended that patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to RT. Neoadjuvant therapy for patients with resectable tumors should ideally be conducted in a clinical trial, and subsequent chemoradiation is sometimes an option following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The optimal timing for surgical resection following RT has not been firmly established. For chemoradiation, reported RT doses include 36 Gy in 2.4 Gy fractions to 45–54 Gy in 1.8–2.0 Gy fractions (doses higher than 54 Gy may be considered in a clinical trial). Optimal elective irradiation target remains undefined, but broad coverage of mesenteric vasculature ± nodal regions should be considered when feasible. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Ten-year survival after postmastectomy chest-wall irradiation in breast cancer [^111XCkEX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Our results fit with the hypothesis that survival benefit from local therapy increases with more effective systemic therapy but only to a threshold and then declinesWe suggest that contemporary systemic therapy has breached this threshold and therefore we are observing a decline in benefit from CWI.

Compliance with systemic therapy guidelines was high. The radiotherapy QA program and observed relative reduction in local recurrence – albeit a clinically insignificant absolute reduction of 11 patients in 10 years – provides reassurance that the lack of impact of CWI on overall survival is unlikely to be due inadequate radiotherapy. We believe our pragmatic pathology and treatment guidelines with the broad global spread of trial participants reflect real-world experience and underpin the generalizability of the findings. Since the inclusion period of SUPREMO, advances in systemic therapy have further improved survival, strengthening the rationale for omitting CWI for intermediate-risk patients.

Chest wall recurrence at 10 years was rare in SUPREMO (< 3% without CWI), much lower than the 5–15% estimate for intermediate-risk disease at the time of the trial design. Other studies have also reported similarly low incidence of local recurrences with modern multi-modality therapy. The 5-year local recurrence rate in the NSABP-B51/RTOG-1304 trial, which also recruited patients with 1–3 positive nodes, was < 1% in unirradiated patients. This is similar to SUPREMO at 5 years. If very few patients experience loco-regional recurrence as a first event without radiotherapy, CWI is unlikely to reduce mortality. The apparent lack of effect of omission of CWI on disease-free and metastatis-free survival is reassuring.

### Quality of regional nodal irradiation plans in breast cancer patients across a large network-can we translate results from randomized trials into the clinic? [^113JC8qB]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Regional nodal irradiation (RNI) improved disease-free survival by 3% to 5% in 2 large randomized trials, but this small absolute advantage relies on accurate contouring and dose delivery. We audited our network to determine compliance on regional nodal coverage, contouring, and dosimetric parameters with respect to accepted guidelines.

Methods and Materials

In our network, we have established a clinical pathway for patients with node-positive breast cancer that guides indications for RNI and dosimetric goals. We reviewed records of 183 patients with nodal macrometastases after upfront surgery or involved nodes of any size after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Radiation treatment plans were examined to determine lymph node volumes treated, whether nodes were contoured, quality of nodal contours, and whether target coverage and normal organ dosimetric constraints were met when RNI was delivered.

Results

Despite the presence of macrometastases on sentinel lymph node biopsy, no lymph nodes were treated in 2.2% (4 of 183). Of 179 patients who received nodal irradiation, 18 received radiation to axillary levels 1 and 2 only, and 161 patients received RNI. Overall, regional nodes were not treated despite strong indications in 7.6% (14 of 183). Treated nodes were not contoured for 2.2% (4 of 179), and lymph node contours were unacceptable in 15.4% (27 of 175). Of patients receiving RNI, 14.9% (24 of 161) did not have adequate nodal target volume coverage, mean heart dose was > 4 Gy for 3.1% (5 of 161), and lung V20 Gy was > 35% for 8.7% (14 of 161).

Conclusions

Adherence to indications for regional nodal treatment was high, but nodes were either not contoured or had unacceptable contour quality in 18% of plans, and coverage was inadequate in 15%. Because the small disease-free survival advantage seen in trials may be decreased with these deviations, routine clinical practice requires detailed peer review to fully translate results of clinical trials.

### Use of regional nodal irradiation and its association with survival for women with high-risk, early stage breast cancer: a national cancer database analysis [^111tmccR]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer remains the most common cancer in women, with over 246,000 new cases estimated annually in the United States. Given this high incidence, clinicians are constantly challenging standards of care in the hopes of improving quality of life and survival. The traditional treatment for most breast cancers is multimodality therapy that consists of definitive surgery (ie, mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery [BCS]), systemic therapy, and radiation therapy.

For patients who undergo BCS, the benefit of whole-breast irradiation (WBI) is uncontested, with an associated 50% reduction in disease recurrence and a reduction in the breast cancer death rate of approximately one sixth. Similar long-term survival benefits have been reported for patients with significant or even low nodal disease burden, defined as 1 to 3 positive regional lymph nodes, who undergo postmastectomy radiation therapy. Although regional, undissected, draining lymphatics are typically included in radiation target volumes after mastectomy, whether regional nodal irradiation (RNI) had any additional value for patients with early stage breast cancer undergoing BCS remained largely unanswered and thus prompted several large, randomized clinical trials.

Of these trials, the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) MA.20 trial randomized 1,832 women diagnosed with early stage, node-positive (pN1-3) or high-risk node-negative (pN0) breast cancer who had received BCS and adjuvant chemotherapy into 2 radiation treatment groups: WBI versus WBI with comprehensive RNI (WBI+RNI). At 10 years, WBI+RNI was found to confer a significant improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) from 77% to 82% (P = 0.01) but no improvement in overall survival (OS; 81.8% vs 82.8%; P = 0.38). These results are comparable to those of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22922 clinical trial, which randomized the use of RNI for women with either a central/medial primary tumor or an externally located tumor with axillary involvement treated with BCS or mastectomy. Directly after the demonstration of a DFS benefit from these studies, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network changed its recommendations for patients with 1 to 3 positive axillary lymph nodes; it removed the category 2b designation that was associated with WBI+RNI and no longer left to physician discretion the inclusion of internal mammary lymph nodes as a target.

Breast-conserving surgery — quantitative effects of systemic therapy on local control show that, within irradiated patients in NSABP B06, node-positive patients receiving chemotherapy had lower IBTR (5% vs 12%) at 12 years; endocrine and chemotherapy trials similarly reduced IBTR, including NSABP B14 (11.6% control vs 5.0% tamoxifen, P < .001), NSABP B13 (15.3% control vs 5.4% treated, P < .001), and NSABP B19 (8.2% vs 4.8%, P < .03); lack of pathologic complete response increased local-regional recurrence risk (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.01–2.59); among ER-positive patients, 10-year IBTR was 18.6% without tamoxifen and 8.7% with tamoxifen; aromatase inhibitors yielded an average HR reduction of approximately 0.67; and trastuzumab further reduced the crude hazard of IBTR with HRs of 0.47 and 0.66.

### Pathological complete response and long-term clinical benefit in breast cancer: the CTNeoBC pooled analysis [^112DS5Mj]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Pathological complete response has been proposed as a surrogate endpoint for prediction of long-term clinical benefit, such as disease-free survival, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS). We had four key objectives: to establish the association between pathological complete response and EFS and OS, to establish the definition of pathological complete response that correlates best with long-term outcome, to identify the breast cancer subtypes in which pathological complete response is best correlated with long-term outcome, and to assess whether an increase in frequency of pathological complete response between treatment groups predicts improved EFS and OS.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Medline for clinical trials of neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer. To be eligible, studies had to meet three inclusion criteria: include at least 200 patients with primary breast cancer treated with preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery; have available data for pathological complete response, EFS, and OS; and have a median follow-up of at least 3 years. We compared the three most commonly used definitions of pathological complete response — ypT0 ypN0, ypT0/is ypN0, and ypT0/is — for their association with EFS and OS in a responder analysis. We assessed the association between pathological complete response and EFS and OS in various subgroups. Finally, we did a trial-level analysis to assess whether pathological complete response could be used as a surrogate endpoint for EFS or OS.

Findings

We obtained data from 12 identified international trials and 11955 patients were included in our responder analysis. Eradication of tumour from both breast and lymph nodes (ypT0 ypN0 or ypT0/is ypN0) was better associated with improved EFS (ypT0 ypN0: hazard ratio [HR] 0.44, 95% CI 0.39–0.51; ypT0/is ypN0: 0.48, 0.43–0.54) and OS (0.36, 0.30–0.44; 0.36, 0.31–0.42) than was tumour eradication from the breast alone (ypT0/is; EFS: HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.55–0.66; OS 0.51, 0.45–0.58). We used the ypT0/is ypN0 definition for all subsequent analyses. The association between pathological complete response and long-term outcomes was strongest in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (EFS: HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.18–0.33; OS: 0.16, 0.11–0.25) and in those with HER2-positive, hormone-receptor-negative tumours who received trastuzumab (EFS: 0.15, 0.09–0.27; OS: 0.08, 0.03, 0.22). In the trial-level analysis, we recorded little association between increases in frequency of pathological complete response and EFS (R(2) = 0.03, 95% CI 0.00–0.25) and OS (R(2) = 0.24, 0.00–0.70).

Interpretation

Patients who attain pathological complete response defined as ypT0 ypN0 or ypT0/is ypN0 have improved survival. The prognostic value is greatest in aggressive tumour subtypes. Our pooled analysis could not validate pathological complete response as a surrogate endpoint for improved EFS and OS.

### Use of regional nodal irradiation and its association with survival for women with high-risk, early stage breast cancer: a national cancer database analysis [^114MJk3V]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although the long-term survival benefit of comprehensive radiation therapy, which encompasses undissected regional lymphatics within the radiation fields, has been validated through several high-quality studies of women with stage III breast cancer, the use of RNI for subgroups of women with stage I-II breast cancer remains controversial. Part of the dilemma stems from the substantial heterogeneity of this population, which makes it difficult to properly assess and balance their estimated recurrence risk after surgery and systemic therapy with the potential benefit and morbidity of RNI.

The NCIC MA.20 clinical trial sought to address this and supports the use of RNI in patients with node-positive or high-risk, node-negative early stage breast cancer given the significant improvement in 10-year DFS and limited radiation-related toxicity. However, this optimization in locoregional control failed to translate into a significant OS benefit, although there was a trend toward improvement with RNI. Moreover, the MA.20 trial comprised 1,832 patients, of whom only 177 had pN0 disease. This led to inadequately powered subgroup analyses and raised the question of whether a larger cohort was necessary to discern significant differences in OS by subset. Our retrospective analysis, based on a modern, matched cohort of more than 10,000 patients, externally validates the findings of the NCIC MA.20 randomized clinical trial in that no survival benefit was seen with the addition of RNI to WBI in this patient population.

Improved locoregional and distant DFS are other meaningful endpoints that may translate into a systemic benefit from nodal irradiation. The MA.20 trial did show that WBI+RNI significantly improved the 10-year DFS rate, at 82% compared with 77% for WBI (P = 0.01). These findings were comparable to those of the EORTC 22922/10925 trial, which reported a 10-year DFS rate of 72% with WBI+RNI versus 69% without WBI+RNI (P = 0.04). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that reducing recurrence by using comprehensive nodal irradiation is a clinically relevant goal that should be discussed with every patient. Other pertinent patient and tumor characteristics that were found to be associated with poorer outcomes in the current study (eg, increasing age, greater comorbidity, negative hormone receptor status, larger tumors, higher tumor grade, or nodal involvement) should also be considered in discussions of treatment options.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^115o3vAQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Breast cancer axillary management after mastectomy with positive sentinel nodes — regional nodal irradiation guidance states that RT with regional nodal irradiation (RNI) is recommended in place of completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for patients with clinically node-negative invasive breast cancer that is ≤ 5 cm who receive mastectomy and have one to two positive sentinel nodes. Decisions regarding the addition of RNI may be based on the increasing number of involved sentinel nodes and metastasis size with RNI reserved for macrometastasis versus micrometastasis, and in patients who receive mastectomy and have ≥ 3 positive nodes, ALND followed by RNI RT should be recommended.

### Surgical standards for management of the axilla in breast cancer clinical trials with pathological complete response endpoint [^114jnL76]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

The definition of pCR varies across different clinical trials. Of the three most common definitions of pCR — ypT0/is, ypT0/is ypN0, ypT0 ypN0 — those that best correlate with survival incorporate assessment of both the breast and the lymph nodes (ypT0/is ypN0, and ypT0 ypN0). Therefore, for clinical trials of novel agents in which pCR is the primary endpoint, these definitions — the absence of tumor in the breast as well as in the axillary lymph nodes — are the preferred definitions, reinforcing the importance of accurate assessment of axillary nodes for disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

One significant advance in the surgical management of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the potential to allow less invasive surgical intervention in the axilla for those patients who have an excellent response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Staging of axillary lymph nodes has generally been performed by sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery. However, SLN surgery in all settings is associated with a false negative rate (FNR). SLN in the absence of neoadjuvant therapy is associated with a FNR of 6–11% –; in the setting of node-negative disease treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical staging of the axilla after NAC by SLN has a similar FNR of 6–12%. – Historically, in node positive disease, ALND was recommended to ensure resection of all nodes in level I and II of the axilla for pathologic evaluation. However, there is now evidence from prospective clinical trials to support the use of SLN surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients presenting with clinically node positive disease who have a good clinical and imaging response. –

### Postoperative chemotherapy may not be necessary for patients with ypN0-category after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy of rectal cancer [^114BiLp5]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

After neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy and surgery, there is no general agreement about whether postoperative chemotherapy is necessary. With the help of clinical and pathohistologic data, prognostic factors were determined as a basis for the decision to spare a patient additional chemotherapy or to urgently recommend it.

Results

Ninety-five patients treated with neoadjuvant 5-fluorouracil-based radiochemotherapy (November 4, 1997 and June 15, 2004) without distant metastases and an R0 (microscopically complete) resection were evaluated. Adjuvant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil or 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid) was given to 65 of 95 patients (68.4 percent). The disease-free survival rate after 36 months was chosen as the target parameter (median follow-up, 36 months).

Methods

The five-year survival rate for all patients was 80.3 ± 5.6 percent; the five-year disease-free survival was 78.1 ± 5.1 percent; the five-year local control rate was 94.2 ± 5.1 percent. In the univariate and multivariate analysis of the disease-free survival, the pathohistologic lymph node status after radiochemotherapy (ypN) was the only significant prognostic parameter. Disease-free survival (36 months) for patients without lymph node metastases (ypN0) was excellent, independent of whether they had received postoperative chemotherapy (n = 43; 87.5 ± 6.0 percent) or not (n = 29; 87.7 ± 6.7 percent). Patients with ypN2 status have, despite chemotherapy, a poor disease-free survival at 30 ± 17.6 percent after 36 months.

Conclusions

These retrospective data suggest that, for some patients, postoperative chemotherapy can be spared. For patients with ypN2 status, an intensification of the postoperative chemotherapy should be considered. Further evaluation in prospective studies is urgently recommended.

### Prognostic impact of postoperative lymph node metastases after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus: from the results of NEOCRTEC5010, a randomized multicenter study [^113VgE9C]. Annals of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the prognostic impact of pathologic lymph node (LN) status and investigate risk factors of recurrence in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients with pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT).

Summary Background Data

There are no large-scale prospective study data regarding ypN status and recurrence after pCR in ESCC patients receiving NCRT.

Methods

The NEOCRTEC5010 trial was a prospective multicenter trial that compared the survival and safety of NCRT plus surgery (S) with S in patients with locally advanced ESCC. The relationships between survival and cN, pN, and ypN status were assessed. Potential prognostic factors in patients with ypN+ and pCR were identified.

Results

A total of 389 ESCC patients (NCRT: 182; S: 207) were included. Patients with pN+ in the S group and ypN+ in the NCRT group had decreased overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) compared with pN0 and ypN0 patients, respectively. Partial response at the primary site [hazard ratio (HR), 2.09] and stable disease in the LNs (HR, 3.26) were independent risk factors for lower DFS, but not OS. For patients with pCR, the recurrence rate was 13.9%. Patients with distant LN metastasis had a median OS and DFS of 16.1 months and 14.4 months, respectively. Failure to achieve the median total dose of chemotherapy was a significant risk factor of recurrence and metastasis after pCR (HR, 44.27).

Conclusions

Persistent pathologic LN metastasis after NCRT is a strong poor prognostic factor in ESCC. Additionally, pCR does not guarantee a cure; patients with pCR should undergo an active strategy of surveillance and adjuvant therapy.

### Prognostic value of pathological node status after neoadjuvant radiotherapy for rectal cancer [^114xo3RR]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The prognostic value of pathological lymph node status following neoadjuvant radiotherapy (ypN) remains unclear. This study was designed to determine whether ypN status predicted overall survival.

Methods

Patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent neoadjuvant long-course radiation between 2005 and 2014 were identified from the National Cancer Data Base, and divided into ypN0, ypN1 and ypN2 groups. The primary outcome was overall survival. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to determine factors associated with overall survival.

Results

Of 12271 patients, 3713 (30.3 per cent) were found to have residual nodal positivity. A majority of patients with ypN1 (1663 of 2562) and ypN2 (878 of 1151) disease had suspected lymph node-positive disease before neoadjuvant therapy, compared with 3959 of 8558 with ypN0 tumours (P < 0.001). Moreover, ypN1 and ypN2 were significantly associated with ypT3-4 disease (65.7 and 83.0 per cent respectively versus 39.4 per cent for ypN0; P < 0.001). In unadjusted analyses, survival differed significantly between ypN groups (P < 0.001). Five-year survival rates were 81.6, 71.3 and 55.0 per cent for patients with ypN0, ypN1 and ypN2 disease respectively. After adjustment for confounding variables, ypN1 and ypN2 remained independently associated with overall survival: hazard ratio (HR) 1.61 (95 per cent c.i. 1.46 to 1.77) and 2.63 (2.34 to 2.95) respectively (P < 0.001). Overall survival was significantly longer in patients with ypN1-2 combined with ypT0-2 status than among those with ypT3-4 tumours even with ypN0 status (P = 0.031). Clinical nodal status before neoadjuvant therapy was not significantly associated with overall survival (HR 1.05, 0.97 to 1.13; P = 0.259).

Conclusion

Both ypT and ypN status is of prognostic significance following neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer.

### Regional recurrence rates with or without complete axillary dissection for breast cancer patients with node-positive disease on sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^111EDhYW]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

We found that physicians seem to tailor surgical and radiation treatments according to the burden of nodal metastases, with significantly more patients with macrometastases receiving ALND and regional nodal irradiation. In our study 16.7% of patients did not receive standard-of-care regional nodal irradiation, about half of whom had either isolated tumor cells or micrometastases. Although this could have affected our results, we did a subset analysis of patients who underwent regional nodal irradiation and found that the regional control rates for SLNB alone versus SLNB plus ALND (90.2% vs 95.5%) for this subset seemed to be similar to the rates for the entire cohort.

A post hoc analysis of radiation treatment details from the ACOSOG Z1071 trial, which had no specific guidelines regarding radiation therapy indications or field design, showed wide variability in practice patterns with an even lower utilization rate of regional nodal irradiation compared with our study. In that trial, supraclavicular radiation was omitted in 47.3% of patients with residual node-positive disease. The ACOSOG Z1071 post hoc analysis highlights the need for standardization in radiation field design. Clinical pathways may be a helpful tool in standardizing treatment practice patterns in this regard. We have previously shown that at our institution, utilization of a clinical pathway mandating regional nodal irradiation for women with macrometastases on SLNB and adverse risk factors significantly increased the percentage of patients receiving regional nodal irradiation in the upfront setting, from 24.6% to 56.9%. We updated our clinical pathway in February 2015 to mandate regional nodal irradiation for pathologically node-positive patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy as well, resulting in an increase in the rate of regional nodal irradiation usage from 73.8% to 93.4% (P = 0.001).

### Long-term outcomes for neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy in early breast cancer: meta-analysis of individual patient data from ten randomised trials [^113NvhPu]. The Lancet: Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

We sought data from all randomised trials in early (ie, operable) breast cancer that began before 2005 and compared NACT with the same chemotherapy begun after surgery (ie, standard adjuvant chemotherapy). NACT always started before surgery, although in some trials, some of the chemotherapy in the NACT group was given postoperatively, whereas all chemotherapy in the control group had to be postoperative (so trials such as NSABP B-27were ineligible).were as reported previously, and conformed to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (Individual Patient Data). For every woman, we requested information from the trial's principal investigator or another appropriate member of their research group about patient and tumour characteristics, treatments, dates of any local recurrence (breast, chest wall, or regional nodes), distant recurrence, contralateral breast or other second primary cancer, and date last known to be alive or date and underlying cause of death. To avoid bias, we sought data for tumour characteristics recorded before randomisation since these characteristics can be altered by neoadjuvant treatment. We also requested tumour response after NACT (assessed mostly by palpation and mammography). To investigate the influence of NACT on extent of surgery, we sought details of surgery planned at randomisation and surgery actually done. When planned surgery was unknown, it was inferred from clinical tumour size. Patient-level data for radiotherapy were unavailable.

### Use of regional nodal irradiation and its association with survival for women with high-risk, early stage breast cancer: a national cancer database analysis [^116ZB1XA]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

For patients with pN0 axillary breast cancer, the risk of internal mammary nodal involvement has previously been reported to be approximately 4% to 9%. However, this percentage, as well as the risk of locoregional failure, may be greater when combined with several adverse features, thereby arguing for a potential benefit of WBI+RNI. In our study, 834 patients (7.6%) had high-risk pN0 disease compared with 177 patients (9.7%) in the NCIC MA.20 trial. However, whereas the NCIC MA.20 trial results noted that WBI+RNI was associated with a trend toward improved outcomes (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61–1.02), our subset analysis showed the contrary (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.96–2.67; P = 0.07). This again may reflect limitations in our study population with regard to the effects of selection bias or the presence of high-risk clinical features that are not standardly reported or accessible via the NCDB. Conversely, it might indicate that some patients with early stage breast cancer may derive a marginal benefit from WBI+RNI.

As advancements in both surgical and nonsurgical therapies continue, the quest remains for treatments that have a low toxicity profile without compromising therapeutic benefit. Treatment of the axilla has been predominately surgical (ie, ALND), given its diagnostic and therapeutic properties. However, the significant morbidity of ALND, particularly lymphedema, has led to alternative methods of managing the axilla, such as sentinel lymph node dissection or axillary radiation therapy in select patients. Most of the women in our analysis fit what are considered to be acceptable criteria for sentinel lymph node dissection instead of ALND (T1-2 disease with 1–2 positive sentinel lymph nodes, not treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy); thus, without a more nuanced characterization of the pathologic features of the patient population in our study, it is possible that they required neither ALND nor WBI+RNI. Indeed, a nuanced approach to electing for WBI+RNI is indicated for patients with 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes on the basis of published level I data.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with early-stage breast cancer: status of the national clinical trials [^112U7Ler]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Just as the NSABP B-04 and B-06 trials have advanced our understanding of the survival impact of surgical therapy of breast cancer over the past 25 years, the current international clinical trials underway through NSABP and ACOSOG offer similar hope for improved treatment of the patient with breast carcinoma. Information from these three trials will offer: (1) survival data on sentinel node negative patients who undergo no further axillary therapy; (2) prognostic information on the importance of IHC positive sentinel lymph nodes and ICC positive bone marrow, which will lead to further studies on selective distribution of adjuvant chemo-hormonal therapy; and (3) survival data on sentinel node-positive patients who undergo no further axillary therapy. In keeping with past successes, the continued participation of surgeons in clinical trials contributes to the advancement of evidence-based therapeutic strategies for patients diagnosed with breast cancer.

### Society of Surgical Oncology-American Society for Radiation Oncology consensus guideline on margins for breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast irradiation in stages I and II invasive breast cancer [^116XmKF6]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Breast-conserving surgery margins — evidence from meta-analysis and trials shows the median prevalence of IBTR across included studies was 5.3%; with this overall rate, an OR of 0.77 for wider margins translates to an absolute benefit on the order of 1% to 2%, and observed advantages of 5-mm versus 1–2 mm margins lacked statistical significance; NSABP B-06, which defined negative margin as no ink on tumor, reported a 5% IBTR at 12 years with systemic therapy; data were insufficient to compare no ink versus ≥ 1 mm margins in one model, and the totality of evidence did not support a distinction between no ink on tumor and 1 mm.

### Prognostic value of residual lymph node status in patients with pathological T0 rectal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy [^116cYEoi]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although more intensive adjuvant treatment was used in patients with ypT0N1–2 disease (86.4% vs 71.7%), the DFS was still lower than that in patients with ypT0N0 disease. In addition, a positive ypN status was an independent prognostic factor for DFS. This finding is consistent with those of previous studies emphasizing the prognostic value of nodal status in ypT0 rectal cancer after neoadjuvant treatment. By contrast, residual nodal involvement in patients with ypT0 disease often indicates poor lymph node regression. A few previous studies have reported that lymph node regression is associated with DFS in rectal cancer.

Interestingly, no signiﬁcant difference was observed in the OS of the two groups. This result contradicts previous reports in which OS was affected by residual lymph node status. Elshami et al.reported that the development of ypT0N+ was associated with a lower 5-year OS than that of ypT0N0. Similarly, Erkan et al.found that ypT0N+ status was independently associated with lower OS. Nevertheless, a notable shortcoming of their research was the failure to compare the DFS disparities between the two groups. In our study, the difference in DFS did not translate into a difference in OS. We speculate that patients who achieve complete regression of the primary rectal wall tumor may have better inherent biological tumor behavior and a good response to treatment. Even if recurrence or metastasis occurs, they remain sensitive to subsequent treatments, and OS is unaffected. Moreover, patients who achieve complete regression of primary rectal wall tumors have a high 5-year OS rate, and a longer follow-up period may be needed to observe differences in OS. As in our study, a study in the Republic of Koreashowed that ypN+ was a significant independent risk factor for recurrence, but no factors were associated with the 5-year OS.

The current study had certain limitations. First, as this was a retrospective study, it was inherently susceptible to selection bias, which may influence the generalizability of the findings. Second, the study encompassed a diverse array of neoadjuvant therapy regimens and lacked a focused exploration of any particular type of neoadjuvant therapy. This lack of concentration may have hindered a more in-depth analysis of specific effects and outcomes associated with a single well-defined neoadjuvant treatment regimen.

Residual lymph node metastasis may indicate poor DFS, but not OS, in patients with pathological T0 disease who have received neoadjuvant therapy followed by radical surgery for LARC.

### Adapting radiation therapy treatments for patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic: hypo-fractionation and accelerated partial breast irradiation to address World Health Organization recommendations [^114dJimP]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

The focus on breast radiation therapy is crucial because of its significant impact on radiation therapy resources. The adoption of hypofractionation for patients, including those requiring locoregional irradiation, and the option of APBI for suitable patients based on international consensus guidelines can serve to significantly reduce the number of radiation therapy fractions and, as a result, minimize patient exposure during treatment and counteract increased pressure on the health care system.

Hypofractionation regimens, such as 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions or 40 Gy in 15 fractions, have demonstrated equivalent local control and cosmetic outcomes in most patients after breast conserving therapy. Although less commonly used in postmastectomy with regional nodal irradiation, hypofractionation is comparable to standard fractionation with favorable long-term efficacy results and low overall toxicity. More recently, 1-week 5-fraction regimens have been compared with the 40 Gy in 15 fractions whole breast radiation in the UK FAST FORWARD trial for treatment of early stage disease, with favorable acute toxicity. We are now awaiting the local control and survival data outcomes from this trial. Compared with the conventional 5-week fractionation of 50 Gy in 25 fractions, these shortened courses save patients between 9 and 20 visits to the cancer center.

The evidence supporting APBI for early stage breast cancer is also maturing. In 2019, 2 separate phase 3 randomized control trials — RAPID and NSABP B39/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0413 — reported on the efficacy of APBI fractionation regimens compared with whole breast irradiation. The results are favorable, showing no statistical difference in overall survival and comparable local control for patients treated in the APBI arm. The evidence supporting APBI agrees with the American Society of Radiation Oncologypatient selection guidelines. Many centers have adopted the use of APBI in a limited capacity, primarily for patients on clinical trials. Publications describing APBI techniques that meet major trial constraints with simple 3-dimensional conformal techniques, and more recently advanced techniques for improved dosimetry, are available to support radiation planning. Implementing an APBI fractionation of 27 Gy in 5 fractions can save a further 10, 11, or 20 treatment visits for select patients.

### YpN0 rectal cancer patients with sterilized lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy are of greater risk of recurrence [^111n9rda]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Indication for adjuvant chemotherapy in ypN0 rectal cancer patients after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is debated. The clinical significance of the presence of sterilized lymph nodes (LNS) in ypN0 patients remains to be determined.

Aims

To assess the prognostic value of LNS in ypN0 rectal cancers after neoadjuvant CRT.

Methods

From 2006–2016, 235 patients underwent TME surgery for non-metastatic mid-low rectal cancer after CRT. A lymph node was considered sterilized if there were signs of treatment response (fibrosis, necrosis or mucus) without residual tumor cells.

Results

180 patients (77%) were classified ypN0 and 55 (23%) ypN+. LNS was present in 20 patients (9%). In ypN0 patients, 5-year OS was similar between patients with and without LNS. In contrast, 5-year DFS was significantly lower in ypN0/LNS + patients (58% vs. 78%, p = 0.043) and was similar to those staged ypN+. In multivariate analysis, two factors were independent predictors of DFS: mesorectal grading (OR = 3.14; 95%CI: 1.10–8.34; p = 0.033) and the presence of LNS (OR = 3.93, 95% CI: 1.06–11.81, p = 0.042) CONCLUSION: The presence of LNS in ypN0 rectal cancer after neoadjuvant CRT is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and may be taken into account for the discussion of adjuvant chemotherapy.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^112iEBcV]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 — Principles of neoadjuvant therapy in cutaneous melanoma — state that there is improved event-free survival with neoadjuvant immunotherapy compared to upfront surgery followed by adjuvant immunotherapy, without negative impact on surgical morbidity, and that major pathologic response (MPR) to preoperative immunotherapy (single-agent anti-PD-1 or ipilimumab 1 mg/kg plus nivolumab 3 mg/kg) correlates with durable improved survival outcomes and may be seen after a very short course (≤ 3 doses). Opportunities include allowing targeted dissection of isolated nodal metastases and potentially obviating adjuvant nodal basin irradiation to optimize regional lymph node field control, with potential to de-escalate or alter planned adjuvant therapy based on pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy. Cautions include that there is no proven OS benefit compared to upfront surgery alone or followed by adjuvant immunotherapy, that radiographic response does not always correlate with pathologic response, and that there is the possibility of disease progression or significant toxicity preventing curative surgery for which close monitoring of the lymph node basin is warranted throughout neoadjuvant therapy with consideration to expedite surgery if needed for progressive disease; efficacy of limited nodal dissection is unknown, and in the PRADO trial index lymph node marking followed by two cycles of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg and nivolumab 3 mg/kg with ILN resection was studied in 99 patients, with sixty patients who had MPR in the ILN not undergoing TLND and having 98% RFS at 2 years. Candidates for preoperative therapy include clinically evident resectable stage III melanoma with nodal basin disease or isolated in-transit metastasis, extensive nodal metastases if upfront resection is deemed too morbid, resectable oligometastatic stage IV disease, and clinically evident recurrent nodal basin disease following a formal nodal basin resection; all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Hypofractionated postmastectomy radiation therapy [^113euPYZ]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

For decades, adjuvant RT has been an established standard of care after mastectomy for locally advanced breast cancer. Although standard fractionation over a course of 5 to 7 weeks has been historically used to achieve excellent tumor control with low toxicity, this regimen can be inconvenient for patients and can increase health care costs. Although HF-WBI has been established as a standard of care for the majority of patients with early-stage breast cancer, the expanded use of an HF approach in the settings of postmastectomy and regional nodal irradiation is an area of active investigation. Early results support the safety and efficacy of HF-PMRT. Based on long-term data and results of ongoing trials, HF-PMRT may evolve into a new standard of care.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: bladder cancer, version 3.2024 [^116a3rkL]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for bladder cancer - NCCN, more specifically with respect to radiation therapy, NCCN 2024 guidelines recommend to treat the whole bladder with or without pelvic nodal radiation therapy at 39.6–50.4 Gy using conventional or accelerated hyperfractionation. Elective treatment to the lymph nodes is optional and should consider patient comorbidities and the risks of toxicity to adjacent critical structures. Then boost either the whole or partial bladder between 60–66 Gy. For node-positive disease, consider boosting grossly involved nodes to the highest achievable dose that does not violate dose-volume histogram parameters based on the clinical scenario. Reasonable alternatives to conventional fractionation include taking the whole bladder to 55 Gy in 20 fractions or using simultaneous integrated boosts to sites of gross disease.

### Definitive and postoperative radiation therapy for basal and squamous cell cancers of the skin: executive summary of an American Society for Radiation Oncology clinical practice guideline [^114Yx8Lv]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2019). High credibility.

ASTRO Radiation for Basal and Squamous Cell Cancers Guideline — conclusion and future directions: The paucity of prospective and randomized data hinders RT use in BCC and cSCC and supports the need for further research, including standardizing fractionation, defining optimal management of microscopic perineural invasion (PNI) and regional nodal basins, and optimizing technique, dose and fractionation in lymph node basin treatment. Microscopic extensive PNI has been reported to portend a worse prognosis and to derive a greater benefit from adjuvant RT compared to focal PNI, but the definition of extensive PNI is variable and needs further validation; the elective volume to be irradiated beyond an involved nerve must be balanced against morbidity and requires further study. Additional studies are needed to identify patients at highest risk for regional recurrence after lymphadenectomy, including non-head and neck cases. At publication, systemic therapy was only approved for palliative treatment of metastatic or locally advanced disease where curative RT or surgery is not an option; therefore, investigation is warranted in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and definitive settings, with several trials ongoing of immunotherapy combined with RT and neoadjuvant systemic therapy noted as an attractive option. In summary, prospective trial design and multidisciplinary collaboration to define optimal RT roles aim to increase curability while minimizing toxicity.
