## Question

What's the difference between hydrocortisone and prednisone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the differences are between hydrocortisone and prednisone, including classification, potency and pharmacokinetics, mineralocorticoid effects, guideline-based indications, dosing strategies, tapering and HPA-axis recovery, safety, and how to choose between them in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental pharmacology and relative potencies. Then, I should verify mineralocorticoid differences and their clinical implications. Next, I will review guideline-backed indications and dosing regimens. After that, I should assess HPA-axis considerations during tapering. I will then examine safety profiles and special populations, and finally synthesize a decision framework with practical dose equivalence and crisis management considerations, anchoring to high-credibility guidelines and FDA labels throughout.

> Let me first confirm the drug identities and core pharmacology. Hydrocortisone is pharmacologic cortisol, a short-acting glucocorticoid with intrinsic mineralocorticoid activity, while prednisone is a synthetic, intermediate-acting glucocorticoid given as an inactive prodrug that requires conversion by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 to prednisolone, which largely lacks mineralocorticoid effect compared with hydrocortisone [^112H2qya] [^115mb83u] [^116tR9on].

> I should double-check potency and duration because dose conversions drive clinical decisions. Standard equivalence tables place prednisone at roughly 4-fold the glucocorticoid potency of hydrocortisone, so about 5 mg prednisone approximates 20 mg hydrocortisone, and the functional duration is longer with prednisone/prednisolone than with hydrocortisone, enabling once- or twice-daily dosing versus multiple daily doses for hydrocortisone; pharmacokinetic data support a short elimination half-life for hydrocortisone and a longer one for prednisolone, with modified-release hydrocortisone developed to better mimic circadian physiology [^112cbbz1] [^111Yb1up].

> Hold on, I should verify the mineralocorticoid differences and their consequences. Hydrocortisone's salt-retaining effects can raise blood pressure and promote sodium retention and potassium loss, which is sometimes helpful in primary adrenal insufficiency where aldosterone is deficient, whereas prednisone's synthetic profile confers far less mineralocorticoid activity, making separate fludrocortisone replacement necessary in primary adrenal insufficiency when prednisone/prednisolone is used as the glucocorticoid backbone [^112H2qya] [^111SBonv] [^115DHpmT].

> Next, I need to align indications and dosing with guidelines. For primary adrenal insufficiency, hydrocortisone 15–25 mg/day in 2–3 divided doses is first-line, with prednisolone 3–5 mg/day in 1–2 doses as an alternative when adherence favors fewer daily doses; both approaches aim to approximate physiologic cortisol exposure while minimizing over-replacement, and secondary adrenal insufficiency follows similar principles for glucocorticoid replacement, though mineralocorticoid supplementation is generally unnecessary in secondary forms [^115DHpmT] [^115XL78B]. For systemic inflammatory diseases, prednisone is commonly used due to dosing convenience and minimal mineralocorticoid effects, consistent with FDA-labeled indications across rheumatic, allergic, dermatologic, and other conditions [^115zq33K].

> Wait, let me verify tapering and HPA-axis recovery guidance before I draw conclusions. Long-acting agents like dexamethasone suppress the axis more, so guidelines recommend switching to short- or intermediate-acting steroids such as hydrocortisone or prednisone to facilitate recovery when feasible, avoiding nighttime dosing because evening glucocorticoids more strongly inhibit the early-morning ACTH surge; however, evidence is inconclusive that switching from prednisone to hydrocortisone specifically accelerates recovery, so tapering should be individualized with either gradual dose reduction at physiologic-range doses or assessment with morning cortisol to guide discontinuation [^111Ve9bU] [^113Eguj6] [^112zPiSU] [^113uLZzA].

> Let me think about practical dosing patterns and circadian mimicry. A typical hydrocortisone regimen splits the total dose with a larger fraction on awakening and a smaller dose early afternoon to align with physiologic rhythms and to minimize late-day ACTH suppression; initially I said these regimens must avoid any dose after 5 PM, but wait, I should clarify that while guidelines discourage nighttime dosing because it blunts ACTH, some patients may need carefully titrated late-afternoon or early-evening dosing for symptom control, emphasizing the trade-off and need for individualized timing, whereas prednisolone 3–5 mg/day once or twice daily improves adherence but may be less physiologic in diurnal patterning for some patients [^115DHpmT] [^111Ve9bU]. I should also confirm that hydrocortisone exposure and biomarkers can fluctuate markedly post-dose, which complicates interpretation and reinforces the value of consistent timing and clinical assessment in addition to labs [^113zpWgp].

> I will now examine comparative outcomes, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Modified-release hydrocortisone has shown modest improvements in weight and HbA1c versus standard regimens in meta-analysis, suggesting pharmacokinetics matter for metabolic outcomes, yet the evidence base is relatively small; a large retrospective cohort suggested higher adjusted mortality in primary adrenal insufficiency patients on prednisolone compared with hydrocortisone, but confounding and channeling bias are likely, so I should treat those findings as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive when choosing an agent for replacement therapy [^1165A4ai] [^117Mz2nF].

> I need to ensure safety profiles are fully considered. Both drugs share class adverse effects that are dose- and duration-dependent, including metabolic derangements, hypertension, weight gain, osteoporosis, infection risk, and neuropsychiatric effects, and the FDA labels underscore stress dosing needs, ocular risks, immunosuppression, and electrolyte effects, with the mineralocorticoid effects more pronounced for hydrocortisone at higher doses; minimizing cumulative exposure and monitoring blood pressure, glucose, bone health, weight, and mood are essential regardless of the agent chosen [^114o24VM] [^111SBonv] [^116apfWj].

> Let me consider special populations and a couple of nuanced points, and I should double-check my assumptions. Because prednisone is a prodrug requiring 11β-HSD1 activation, significant hepatic dysfunction could plausibly impair conversion to prednisolone, so hydrocortisone or active prednisolone may be preferable in such settings, but I need to acknowledge that our provided references emphasize the conversion biology without offering clinical outcome data in hepatic impairment, so I will flag this as a pharmacologic consideration rather than a firm evidence-based directive; regarding pregnancy, I first thought prednisone crosses the placenta less than hydrocortisone, but wait, I should verify placental pharmacology specifically, and since the provided sources do not directly compare placental transfer between these two agents, I will avoid over-claiming and instead recommend individualized selection with careful monitoring in pregnancy per label cautions and specialist guidance [^115mb83u] [^111SBonv].

> I should confirm stress dosing and crisis management since this often dictates the practical choice in emergencies. In suspected adrenal crisis, immediate hydrocortisone 100 mg IV or IM followed by 200 mg over 24 hours with aggressive fluids is recommended, and in any patient on chronic steroids facing major stress, rapidly acting glucocorticoid coverage should be increased peri-stress per FDA and endocrine guidance, which favors hydrocortisone for its mineralocorticoid contribution and rapid onset in acute care settings [^116CBZ8p] [^111SBonv].

> Next, I should review dose equivalence to support safe switching. Using standard potency ratios, 20 mg hydrocortisone is approximately equivalent to 5 mg prednisone or prednisolone for anti-inflammatory effect; when converting for adrenal replacement, clinical response, weight, comorbidities, and timing relative to circadian physiology should guide fine-tuning beyond simple calculators, with careful reassessment after any conversion [^112cbbz1].

> But wait, what if the clinical context is glucocorticoid withdrawal rather than replacement or anti-inflammatory therapy. In tapering from supraphysiologic doses, the overall exposure, potency, and duration matter most for HPA-axis suppression risk; slower tapers at near-physiologic doses and avoidance of nighttime dosing support recovery, and the 2024 guidance notes no compelling evidence that switching from an intermediate-acting agent like prednisone to hydrocortisone further accelerates HPA recovery, so individualized strategy with symptom monitoring or morning cortisol testing is appropriate [^1171fF7m] [^112zPiSU] [^113Eguj6].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I should confirm it aligns with guidelines. Choose hydrocortisone when physiologic replacement is paramount, mineralocorticoid effect is acceptable or desired as part of primary adrenal insufficiency management, or when you need rapid titration and predictable acute effects; choose prednisone or prednisolone when adherence with fewer daily doses is critical, mineralocorticoid effects are undesirable in inflammatory disease management, or formulary and cost considerations favor a synthetic intermediate-acting agent, always ensuring separate mineralocorticoid replacement in primary adrenal insufficiency and close monitoring for class toxicities in all scenarios [^115DHpmT] [^115XL78B] [^111Ve9bU].

> Final check and bottom line. Hydrocortisone is endogenous cortisol with mineralocorticoid activity and short action that better mimics physiologic rhythms with divided dosing, whereas prednisone is a synthetic prodrug with greater glucocorticoid potency, minimal mineralocorticoid activity, and simpler dosing; guidelines favor hydrocortisone for primary adrenal replacement and prednisone for many inflammatory conditions, but the optimal choice depends on clinical goals, comorbidities, adherence, and the need to protect or recover the HPA axis, with stress dosing and crisis protocols anchored to hydrocortisone in emergencies [^115DHpmT] [^115zq33K] [^116CBZ8p].

Hydrocortisone and prednisone differ in **potency and duration**: hydrocortisone is a short-acting, lower-potency glucocorticoid with significant mineralocorticoid activity [^112H2qya], which makes it the first-line choice for adrenal insufficiency replacement therapy [^115DHpmT]. Prednisone is an intermediate-acting, higher-potency glucocorticoid with minimal mineralocorticoid activity [^115wPe2B], used primarily for **anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive** therapy in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases [^115zq33K]. Prednisone requires hepatic activation to prednisolone [^115mb83u], so hydrocortisone is preferred in liver impairment. Prednisone's longer half-life allows **once-daily dosing** [^115wPe2B], whereas hydrocortisone typically requires multiple daily doses [^115DHpmT] [^111Yb1up]. Both can cause adrenal suppression and metabolic side effects [^114o24VM], but prednisone's higher potency increases the risk of HPA axis suppression [^111Ve9bU] with prolonged use [^1171fF7m].

| **Parameter** | **Hydrocortisone** | **Prednisone** |
|-|-|-|
| Potency | Lower (reference standard) [^112cbbz1] | Higher (≈4× hydrocortisone) [^112cbbz1] |
| Duration of action | Short-acting (8–12 h) [^112cbbz1] | Intermediate-acting (12–36 h) [^115wPe2B] |
| Mineralocorticoid activity | Significant [^116tR9on] | Minimal [^115wPe2B] |
| Clinical use | Adrenal insufficiency replacement [^113Vas8Y] | Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive [^115zq33K] |
| Hepatic activation | Not required | Required (prodrug) [^115mb83u] |
| Dosing frequency | Multiple daily doses [^115DHpmT] | Once daily [^112BkPP8] |
| HPA axis suppression | Lower risk | Higher risk with prolonged use [^111Ve9bU] |

---

In practice, **hydrocortisone is used for adrenal replacement** [^115DHpmT], whereas prednisone is favored for anti-inflammatory therapy [^115zq33K] and convenient once-daily dosing [^112BkPP8].

### Extended-release hydrocortisone formulations: Is there a clinically meaningful benefit [^111Yb1up]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Despite best practice replacement therapy with corticosteroids, patients with adrenal insufficiency report diminished quality of life and face increased mortality and morbidity. Conventional formulations of hydrocortisone have short half-lives (about 90 minutes), requiring multiple dosing during the day. Since 2011, extended-release hydrocortisone (ER-HC) formulations have been available, enabling once- or sometimes twice-daily dosing. Most studies comparing ER-HC formulations with conventional hydrocortisone therapy report reductions in body weight, blood pressure, and glucose levels, along with improved quality of life. However, it is still unclear if the reported beneficial effects are due to differences in cortisol exposure or alterations in pharmacokinetics. Here, we review studies comparing conventional and ER-HC treatment in adrenal insufficiency and discuss whether these novel formulations are safe and offer clinically significant benefits.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111Ve9bU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes individuals to more pronounced suppression of the HPA axis and subsequent adrenocortical function impairment. This is due to the continuous and non-circadian glucocorticoid effect of these drugs, especially when administered systemically.

Long-acting glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone or betamethasone, even in physiologic daily dose equivalents, are more likely to cause HPA axis suppression, exogenous Cushing syndrome, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome when being tapered. HPA axis recovery is impossible with the continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids. In contrast, intermediate- or short-acting glucocorticoids — which have both a shorter biological half-life and lower glucocorticoid potency — are more likely to allow HPA recovery, provided that they are not administered at nighttime, when they can more pronouncedly inhibit ACTH production and the early-morning rise of endogenous cortisol.

If treatment with long-acting glucocorticoids is no longer needed, we recommend switching to shorter-acting formulations such as prednisone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, or cortisone acetate to promote the recovery of the HPA axis. For patients on non-oral glucocorticoids, such as inhaled steroids, where there is a concern for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids is appropriate when non-oral glucocorticoids are no longer needed. Prednisone and hydrocortisone have a wider variety of available doses, enabling more effective dose adjustments.

### Potency and duration of action of glucocorticoids. Effects of hydrocortisone, prednisone and dexamethasone on human pituitary-adrenal function [^112cbbz1]. The American Journal of Medicine (1977). High credibility.

Corticosteroids differ in their potency, duration of action, and mineralocorticoid activity. The clinical calculator "Steroid Dose Conversion" ensures safe and effective dose equivalence during steroid conversions by using standard relative potencies. This calculator is designed to convert a user's steroid dose to an equivalent dose of a different steroid, aiding medical professionals in aligning treatments with the intended therapeutic effects when switching from one corticosteroid to another. For this conversion, the user must provide three inputs: the type of the steroid, the dose of that steroid in milligrams (mg), and the target steroid to which they wish to convert.

The available steroid types for both source and target steroids are:

- Hydrocortisone
- Cortisone
- Prednisone
- Prednisolone
- Methylprednisolone
- Dexamethasone
- Betamethasone
- Triamcinolone

The relative potencies of these steroids compared to hydrocortisone (assigned a potency of 1) are as follows:

| **Steroid** | **Relative potency** |
|-|-|
| Hydrocortisone | 1 |
| Cortisone | 0.8 |
| Prednisone | 4 |
| Prednisolone | 4 |
| Methylprednisolone | 5 |
| Dexamethasone | 25 |
| Betamethasone | 25 |
| Triamcinolone | 5 |

The computation for the equivalent dose begins by extracting the potencies of the source and target steroids from the table provided.

### Novel insights into glucocorticoid replacement therapy for pediatric and adult adrenal insufficiency [^115wPe2B]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Structural changes in the basic steroid nucleus and its side groups determine the pharmacological differences between long-acting glucocorticoids, in terms of bioavailability, GR and MR interaction, and genomic modulation. A decisive structural characteristic is the polarity of the substituent in position 6 or 16. Potency is stimulated by 6-α methyl, 16-methylene hydrophobic substitution, the Δ1-dehydro-configuration (prednisolone), and 6α and 9α-fluorination (dexamethasone). The first two mechanisms also attenuate mineralocorticoid potency. Hence, prednisone and prednisolone exert minimal mineralocorticoid activity, while dexamethasone has none.

Once in the bloodstream, 60% of the prednisolone binds to CBG and 99% of dexamethasone binds to albumin, creating protein-bound fractions (60–70%) which are concentration-independent. Meanwhile, prednisolone is concentration dependent with an affinity ranging from 90% in lower concentrations to 60% in higher ones. This results in non-linear pharmacokinetics, where higher doses generate more rapid clearance rates. An increase in intravenous dose administration from 5 mg of prednisolone to 40 mg corresponds to a 75% increase in clearance. The timing of administration also influences prednisolone clearance, which is lower by up to 25% in the morning.

Inactivation occurs through hepatic reduction of the Δ double bond and of the 3-keto group, followed by glucuronidation and sulfation. The elimination half-life is 1 hour for prednisone, 3 hours for prednisolone, and 4 hours for dexamethasone.

Naturally occurring glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone and cortisone, possess salt-retaining properties and are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are primarily employed for their potent anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of disorders affecting many organ systems.

Glucocorticoids exert profound and varied metabolic effects. Additionally, they modify the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli.

Regarding medical management for primary adrenal insufficiency, particularly concerning corticosteroid replacement, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend considering the use of hydrocortisone (15–25 mg/day PO, divided into two or three doses daily) or cortisone acetate (20–35 mg PO, divided into two or three doses daily) as initial therapy. The highest dose should be administered in the morning upon awakening, followed by the next dose either in the early afternoon (2 hours after lunch; two-dose regimen) or at lunch and again in the afternoon (three-dose regimen).

### A retrospective study on weaning glucocorticoids and recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [^117CkkqF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, there is only one study comparing reactivation of the HPA axis between patients on prednisolone and hydrocortisone. Although comparison of the weaning success between the two glucocorticoids was not the primary aim of their study, the authors reported a recovery rate in the prednisolone group higher than hydrocortisone (71% vs. 27%). However, it was a retrospective study of rheumatology patients who were not matched for glucocorticoid doses, and the mean baseline cortisol in the hydrocortisone group was lower than the prednisolone group, limiting the direct comparison between the two glucocorticoids. In addition, little information was provided on potential confounding factors.

In our study, we questioned whether converting patients on long-term prednisolone, who were symptomatic on physiological dosing and who failed their AST, to hydrocortisone had any impact on their rate of recovery. In our dose-matched analysis between these patients and those on long-term prednisolone, converting to hydrocortisone did not improve recovery rates, irrespective of there being no difference in duration of glucocorticoids, underlying etiology, or mean baseline cortisol/ACTH between the groups. There were more females (non-significant) in the hydrocortisone group; however, this is unlikely to have impacted the tertiary AI rate of recovery, as there is no such reported association in the literature. We also found that there was a statistical difference in the use of opioids between the groups, but all the users were in our prednisolone rather than the hydrocortisone group. Nonetheless, our analysis…

### The optimal use of steroids in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: No easy answers [^1167Vdxh]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are an integral component of therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), but usage differs between cooperative group protocols. All groups use glucocorticoids during induction, but they vary on whether to use dexamethasone or prednisone. Issues to consider in the choice of induction steroid include impact on event-free and overall survival, acute morbidity such as infection risk, diabetes, and behavioural disturbances, and long-term complications such as avascular necrosis.

It is generally agreed that dexamethasone is the steroid of choice for groups using a delayed intensification phase, but dosing schedules (intermittent versus continuous) vary. There is no consensus on the potential benefit of steroid administration during maintenance therapy. This review will summarize the available data on steroid use in paediatric ALL, highlighting outcomes as well as major toxicities.

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad [^116RSd7o]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

All glucocorticoids (GCs), both endogenous and synthetic, bind and activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with differing potencies and have distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Many GCs, though not all, are capable of activating the mineralocorticoid (MC) receptor (MR) to varying extents. Additionally, there are numerous routes of administration, including oral, intravenous, inhaled, and topical. This diversity results in a vast array of available drugs and formulations, with the choice of agent determined by clinical utility, efficacy, and a balance against potential adverse effects.

All steroidal synthetic GCs are structurally related to hydrocortisone (cortisol), often modified to bind to the GR with higher affinity, resulting in more potent glucocorticoid actions or a prolonged half-life. Most synthetic GCs are 21-carbon polycyclic compounds with a basic steroid structure, featuring a fused 17-carbon atom ring system with an aliphatic side chain at carbon-17, a keto-group at carbon-3, one or two double bonds in the A-ring, and an oxygen at carbon-11. Differences in GR and MR activation are determined by the side groups. GC potency is increased by an 11-hydroxy group, while MC potency is enhanced by a 9α or a 6α-fluoro substituent. In contrast, a hydrophilic substituent at position 16 decreases both MC and GC properties. The metabolism of both endogenous and synthetic GCs is a crucial determinant of their ability to activate GR and MR.

### Comparative effect of different corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^114eWhAi]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Of the 11 trials included, the primary outcome of all-cause mortality was pooled across 2042 participants, comparing hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and placebo. The network meta-analysis revealed that hydrocortisone was significantly more effective in reducing mortality than placebo (RR, 0.35; 95% CrI, 0.14–0.64). No significant differences were observed between dexamethasone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and placebo. Additionally, we combined individual head-to-head studies to evaluate the differences in efficacy among corticosteroids. No evidence was found to suggest that any corticosteroid treatment was superior to others. These data for the primary outcomes are summarized in the league table.

- **Results visualization**: A network meta-analysis results for all-cause mortality include the following:
	- A forest plot comparing all corticosteroid treatments with placebo.
	- The league table displays the network meta-analysis estimates for all treatment comparisons, with relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals. Items in bold indicate statistical significance.
	- A SUCRA-based cumulative probability graph for all-cause mortality.

In terms of mortality for severe CAP, hydrocortisone appears to be the most effective treatment, as indicated by a SUCRA value of 88.7%. Dexamethasone and methylprednisolone yielded SUCRA values of 56.9% and 41.9%, respectively, while prednisolone was found to be the least beneficial, with a SUCRA of 36.3%. We did not observe significant overall heterogeneity in mortality (heterogeneity test results, I² = 7).

### The glucocorticoid receptor: Isoforms, functions, and contribution to glucocorticoid sensitivity [^115mb83u]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Over time, there has been the development and discovery of a wide range of glucocorticoids with varying potencies, degrees of mineralocorticoid activity, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Hydrocortisone is the pharmacologic name for cortisol, and progressive alterations of the molecule have yielded a range of synthetic glucocorticoids, with the common feature being a 17-carbon androstane structure of three hexane rings and one pentane ring, with a hydroxyl group at carbon-11 being critical for glucocorticoid activity. Cortisone acetate and prednisone are inactive precursors that require conversion by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) to the active hydrocortisone and prednisolone, respectively.

Adverse effects from glucocorticoid treatment are predictable and dose- and duration-dependent, significantly contributing to morbidity and mortality in those being treated. In hormone replacement for adrenal insufficiency, traditional doses were supraphysiological based on earlier estimates of endogenous cortisol production. More recent studies have focused on replicating the 5 to 8 mg/m² (body surface area) per day. Guidelines recommend hydrocortisone 15 to 25 mg per day with consideration of weight-based dosing for some patients. Weight-based dosing and administering hydrocortisone in the fasted state have been shown to reduce cortisol area under the curve (AUC) variability and provide levels closer to physiological replacement than fixed dosing.

Currently, the optimal type and dose of glucocorticoids to use during the taper has not been established. There is also a lack of reliable data comparing different strategies, and tapering regimens vary widely in clinical practice. Moreover, there is no compelling evidence to switch intermediate-acting glucocorticoids such as prednisone to hydrocortisone or cortisone acetate to further promote the recovery of the HPA axis. The evidence of the effect of different types and dosages of glucocorticoid taper on the timing of HPA axis recovery and possible symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal remains limited and inconclusive. Consequently, an individualized approach to glucocorticoid taper is possible and necessary.

- **Recommendation 2.6**: We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol (⊕○○○).

During the initial glucocorticoid tapering, ACTH and cortisol levels remain suppressed. When the dose of glucocorticoid therapy is lowered, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland start to recover, resulting in increased production of ACTH. An ACTH increase can promote the recovery of adrenal function, leading to an increase and recovery in cortisol. Complete recovery of cortisol production can remain impaired in a minority of patients.

### Crenessity [^1123FX4L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The mean age of participants was 12 years, ranging from 4 to 17 years old. Of the participants, 41% were Tanner Stage 1 or 2, 52% were male, 63% were White, and 11% were Hispanic or Latino. Regarding glucocorticoid use at baseline, 92% of patients were receiving hydrocortisone alone, while 8% were receiving prednisone (or equivalent), with or without hydrocortisone. At baseline, subjects were receiving a mean glucocorticoid total daily dose in hydrocortisone equivalents of 16 mg/m²/day (SD 4). The mean androstenedione level was 431 ng/dL (SD 461), and the mean serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone level was 8682 ng/dL (SD 6847) prior to the morning glucocorticoid dose.

At Week 4, following a treatment period at a stable glucocorticoid dose regimen, the least-squares (LS) mean reduction from baseline in serum androstenedione in the CRENESSITY group was statistically significantly different at -197 ng/dL compared to an increase of 71 ng/dL in the placebo group [as shown in Table 9].

### Solu-cortef [^116tR9on]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoids, both naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids that are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone and cortisone, also possess salt-retaining properties and are utilized as replacement therapy in cases of adrenocortical deficiency. Their synthetic analogs are primarily employed for their anti-inflammatory effects across many organ systems.

Hydrocortisone sodium succinate exhibits similar metabolic and anti-inflammatory actions as hydrocortisone. When administered parenterally in equimolar quantities, the two compounds are equivalent in biological activity. The highly water-soluble sodium succinate ester of hydrocortisone allows for the immediate intravenous administration of high doses in a small volume of diluent, making it particularly effective in rapidly achieving high blood levels of hydrocortisone. Following intravenous injection, noticeable effects are apparent within one hour and persist for a variable duration. Nearly complete excretion of the administered dose occurs within 12 hours. Therefore, to maintain consistently high blood levels, injections should be administered every 4 to 6 hours. When administered intramuscularly, this preparation is also rapidly absorbed and excreted in a pattern similar to that observed post-intravenous injection.

Glucocorticoids lead to profound and varied metabolic effects and modify the body's immune response to a variety of stimuli.

### Prednisone [^111SBonv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses.

	- **Usage in pregnancy**: Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers, or women of childbearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism.

	- **Effects on blood pressure and electrolyte balance**: Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives, except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion.

While on corticosteroid therapy, patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should be considered carefully.

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad [^114o24VM]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

It is estimated that 2% to 3% of the population are currently prescribed systemic or topical glucocorticoid treatment. The potent anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids to deliver therapeutic benefit is not in doubt. However, the side effects associated with their use, including central weight gain, hypertension, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and osteoporosis, often collectively termed iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome, are associated with a significant health and economic burden.

The precise cellular mechanisms underpinning the differential action of glucocorticoids to drive the desirable and undesirable effects are still not completely understood. Faced with the unmet clinical need to limit glucocorticoid-induced adverse effects alongside ensuring the preservation of anti-inflammatory actions, several strategies have been pursued.

The coprescription of existing licensed drugs to treat incident adverse effects can be effective, but data examining the prevention of adverse effects are limited. Novel selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists and selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators have been designed that aim to specifically and selectively activate anti-inflammatory responses based upon their interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor. Several of these compounds are currently in clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy.

More recently, strategies exploiting tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism through the isoforms of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase have shown early potential, although data from clinical trials are limited.

### Cortef [^113tvrjr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Dosage and administration: The initial dosage of Cortef tablets may vary from 20 mg to 240 mg of hydrocortisone per day, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity, lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients, higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If, following a reasonable period of time, there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, Cortef should be discontinued, and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy.

It should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be individualized based on the disease under treatment and the patient's response. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. Constant monitoring is essential regarding drug dosage. Situations that may necessitate dosage adjustments include changes in clinical status due to remissions or exacerbations of the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the impact of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In such situations, it may be necessary to increase the Cortef dosage for a period consistent with the patient's condition.

### Glucocorticoids and their actions in cells [^114k3VS6]. Retina (2009). Low credibility.

The biologic responses to the administration of exogenous glucocorticoids (GCs) are specific to cell type. Progress in understanding how to improve the benefit-to-risk ratio of GC therapies for the eye will depend on better characterization of both the receptors and the proteins induced when these receptors are stimulated. The complexity and diversity of the GC receptors in human tissue are underscored by evidence that up to 6,000 genes are expressed or suppressed within hours of GC exposure. The enormous potential to use exogenous GC agents to downregulate processes involved in age-related macular degeneration must be balanced against a similar potential for counterproductive effects. Recent progress predicts an increasing precision with which GC steroids can be used to influence biologic functions.

### Rayos [^112BkPP8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Naturally occurring corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone and cortisone, possess salt-retaining properties and are often used as replacement therapy in states of adrenocortical deficiency. Synthetic analogs, like prednisone, are primarily used for their potent anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of disorders affecting many organ systems.

Corticosteroids, for instance, prednisone, induce profound and varied metabolic effects and alter the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli. Prednisone, a synthetic adrenocortical steroid drug, exhibits predominantly corticosteroid properties. While some of these properties mirror the physiological actions of endogenous glucocorticosteroids, others do not align with the normal functions of adrenal hormones and are only observed following the administration of large therapeutic doses. The pharmacological effects of prednisone, attributed to its corticosteroid properties, include the promotion of gluconeogenesis, increased glycogen deposition in the liver, inhibition of glucose utilization, anti-insulin activity, increased protein catabolism, enhanced lipolysis, stimulation of fat synthesis and storage, increased glomerular filtration rate leading to increased urinary excretion of urate (while creatinine excretion remains unchanged), and increased calcium excretion.

There is a depressed production of eosinophils and lymphocytes, yet erythropoiesis and production of polymorphonuclear leukocytes are stimulated. Inflammatory processes, such as edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilatation, and migration of leukocytes, are impacted as well.

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad [^111are7U]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Despite clinical awareness of the adverse effects of glucocorticoid treatment, its use has remained remarkably constant over many years. Currently, 1% to 3% of the worldwide population are prescribed glucocorticoid therapy, and long-term prescriptions have increased by more than 30% over the past 20 years. All routes of glucocorticoid administration — topical, inhaled, intranasal, and intra-articular — are associated with the development of systemic adverse effects, notably affecting mortality, infection risk, and metabolic, cardiovascular, and bone health. However, the precise contribution of dose and duration of treatment is difficult to establish.

Glucocorticoids mediate their beneficial (anti-inflammatory) and undesired effects through classical (genomic) and nongenomic actions. Complementary approaches are currently being used to treat and limit the adverse effects of glucocorticoids. These include antihypertensive therapies, glucose-lowering medications, and the use of bone antiresorptive therapy. Novel drugs are currently in development that aim to separate the negative side effects from the beneficial anti-inflammatory actions. These include selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitors.

Currently, 1% to 3% of the worldwide population are prescribed glucocorticoid (GC) therapy. There are differences in the prevalence of GC prescriptions between countries, which may reflect local prescribing and treatment practices, as well as the methodology used to collate the data. Chronic use is reported in…

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1142FRtj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The overall duration, type, and daily dose of glucocorticoid used should be considered when designing a glucocorticoid taper. Patients treated with higher glucocorticoid doses, long-acting glucocorticoids, and for a longer duration of time are likely to have more glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. Patients with features of exogenous Cushing syndrome are more likely to have a challenging glucocorticoid taper course because of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome.

A slow decrease in glucocorticoid dose is the only known intervention that may help prevent severe glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. In patients following curative surgery for endogenous hypercortisolism, the baseline clinical severity score was associated with the severity of glucocorticoid withdrawal. Symptoms worsened once the total daily glucocorticoid dose reached below 30 to 35 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent (e.g. 7.5 mg prednisone). Clinical severity was calculated based on the presence of physical features and comorbidities potentially related to glucocorticoid excess. This method may also be applied to patients treated with supraphysiologic glucocorticoids when deciding on the rapidity of glucocorticoid taper, with a slower taper in patients with a high clinical severity score, and a more rapid taper in patients with a lower clinical severity score.

In a patient with severe glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome despite a slower glucocorticoid taper, increasing the glucocorticoid dose temporarily may be necessary.

### Prednisolone versus dexamethasone for croup: A randomized controlled trial [^112LUMHy]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Use of either prednisolone or low-dose dexamethasone in the treatment of childhood croup lacks a rigorous evidence base despite widespread use. In this study, we compare dexamethasone at 0.6 mg/kg with both low-dose dexamethasone at 0.15 mg/kg and prednisolone at 1 mg/kg.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, double-blind, noninferiority randomized controlled trial based in one tertiary pediatric emergency department and one urban district emergency department in Perth, Western Australia. Inclusion criteria included age over 6 months, a maximum weight of 20 kg, contactable by telephone, and English-speaking caregivers. Exclusion criteria were a known allergy to prednisolone or dexamethasone, immunosuppressive disease or treatment, steroid therapy or enrollment in the study within the previous 14 days, and a high clinical suspicion of an alternative diagnosis. A total of 1252 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg; n = 410), low-dose dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg; n = 410), or prednisolone (1 mg/kg; n = 411). Primary outcome measures included the Westley Croup Score 1-hour after treatment and unscheduled medical re-attendance during the 7 days after treatment.

- **Results**: The mean Westley Croup Score at baseline was 1.4 for dexamethasone, 1.5 for low-dose dexamethasone, and 1.5 for prednisolone. The adjusted difference in scores at 1 hour, compared with dexamethasone, was 0.03 (95% confidence interval -0.09 to 0.15) for low-dose dexamethasone and 0.05 (95% confidence interval -0.07 to 0.17) for prednisolone. Re-attendance rates were 17.8% for dexamethasone, 19.5% for low-dose dexamethasone, and [Information truncated].

### Why is the management of glucocorticoid deficiency still controversial: A review of the literature [^1148DpSe]. Clinical Endocrinology (2005). Low credibility.

All endocrinologists aim to make glucocorticoid replacement therapy for their hypoadrenal patients as physiological as possible. Many seek the reassurance of a method to monitor such treatment, confirming that this goal is being achieved. Advances in our understanding of normal physiology are relevant to these efforts. The cortisol production rate in normal subjects is lower than previously believed. The normal pattern of glucocorticoid secretion includes both a diurnal rhythm and a pulsatile ultradian rhythm.

Glucocorticoid access to nuclear receptors is 'gated' by the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes, which interconvert active cortisol and inactive cortisone. These complexities make the target of achieving physiological glucocorticoid replacement therapy challenging. The available evidence suggests that conventional treatment of hypoadrenal patients may have adverse effects on some surrogate markers of disease risk. These include a lower bone mineral density than age-sex-matched controls, and increases in postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations.

Although the quality of life of hypoadrenal patients may be impaired, studies show no evidence of improvement on higher doses of steroids. However, quality of life is better if the hydrocortisone dose is split, with the highest dose taken in the morning. Thus, the evidence suggests that most patients may be safely treated with a low dose of glucocorticoid (e.g. 15 mg hydrocortisone daily) in two or three divided doses. It emphasizes the importance of educating patients on the appropriate actions to take in the event of intercurrent illnesses or stress.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112zPiSU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoids should only be tapered if the underlying disease no longer requires glucocorticoid therapy. In general, glucocorticoid taper can be faster and in larger decrements if the total daily glucocorticoid dose is high (e.g. greater than 30 mg of prednisone). As the total daily glucocorticoid dose approaches the physiologic daily dose equivalent (greater than the equivalent of 15–25 mg hydrocortisone or 4–6 mg prednisone, see Table 1), the taper should be slower and with smaller decrements (Table 4). In certain patients with glucocorticoid-induced complications, such as uncontrolled hypertension and hyperglycemia, glucocorticoid-induced psychosis, or herpetic keratitis, a more rapid glucocorticoid taper towards physiologic daily dose equivalent may be required. The pre-test probability of adrenal atrophy and consequent adrenal insufficiency is high for patients taking long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses; therefore, adrenal function testing is unnecessary until a physiologic glucocorticoid dose is achieved.

- **Suggested tapering regimen depending on glucocorticoid dose**: HPA recovery is possible once the glucocorticoid therapy has been tapered to a near-physiologic daily dose (e.g. 4–6 mg prednisone). At this time, tapering or assessment for HPA recovery could be performed unless glucocorticoids at this dose are required for control of the underlying condition (for example, transplant or polymyalgia rheumatica).

It is helpful to consider the likelihood of adrenal insufficiency and the risk of underlying disease flare before planning further tapering.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^116CBZ8p]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Adrenal crisis is a clinical diagnosis and should be suspected in patients with recent use of any glucocorticoid formulation presenting with hypotension, collapse, or acute abdominal symptoms. Hyponatremia may also be associated. A high degree of clinical suspicion is paramount, as patients may not have been tested for suspected glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency prior to the acute event, and adrenal crisis may be the first manifestation of the disease. Treatment must not be delayed by laboratory or imaging investigations.

- **Immediate intervention**: If an established or impending adrenal crisis is suspected, the patient should immediately receive an injection of 100 mg hydrocortisone intravenously or intramuscularly, followed by rapid volume resuscitation with intravenous administration of 0.9% saline solution (or equivalent).

- **Ongoing management**: Patients with confirmed adrenal crisis should be maintained on hydrocortisone at a dose of 200 mg per 24 hours (preferably by continuous intravenous infusion, alternatively by intravenous or intramuscular injection of 50 mg hydrocortisone every 6 hours) until clinical recovery and further guidance by an endocrinology specialist. In patients with very high body weight, higher doses might be considered. Some centers use equivalent parenteral doses of other glucocorticoids, such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone; head-to-head comparison data of different treatment strategies for adrenal crisis are lacking.

Prednisolone has unknown growth-suppressing effects relative to other steroids. We retrospectively studied 9 children (6 with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, CAH) receiving hydrocortisone replacement after switching to prednisolone (dose ratio, 1:5). Growth velocity and, in patients with CAH, 17-OHP decreased significantly. Dose reduction reversed these effects. Roughly, growth suppression relative potency for prednisolone:hydrocortisone was 15:1.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^116QSan5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids suppress HPA axis activity by inhibiting the production of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) by the hypothalamus and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary. Inhibition of CRH and ACTH induced by exogenous glucocorticoids is similar to the mechanisms involved in the physiologic cortisol negative feedback. Prolonged duration of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy often leads to a reduction in the overall responsiveness of the anterior pituitary gland. In rodent models, glucocorticoids exert pro-apoptotic effects on the pituitary gland and promote protein degradation, as represented by Crooke's hyaline in corticotroph cells. This ultimately results in atrophy of the adrenal cortex. Conversely, following withdrawal of glucocorticoids, there is a resurgence of ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex. In most instances, the adrenal cortex will recover and produce adequate levels of cortisol. Despite these adaptive responses, the time to full biochemical and clinical restitution of the HPA axis is highly variable.

Any glucocorticoid dose above the physiologic daily dose equivalent can potentially lead to suppression of the HPA axis. The degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure, which, among other factors, is determined by the potency of the glucocorticoid, glucocorticoid dose, length of therapy, and individual susceptibility.

Glucocorticoid treatment regimen highlights that overall, hydrocortisone was used by 75% of the participants, prednisone/prednisolone by 11%, cortisone acetate by 6%, and dexamethasone by 4% of the participants. A high proportion of participants (40%) in Australia reported using cortisone acetate. Among the countries with at least 20 respondents, the use of prednisone/prednisolone was most common in Canada (27%), the US (14%), and Australia (11%) and dexamethasone was most commonly used in Australia (5%) and the US (4%). The distribution of therapies was similar between patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI). The majority of the patients were on BID (42%) or TID (32%), while 10% were on an OD regimen.

- **Dosing regimens**: Of the patients on a BID regimen, 58% took their medication in the morning and afternoon, and 42% in the morning and evening. Patients with secondary AI took their BID dosing in the morning and afternoon (39%) rather than in the morning and evening (9%). Additionally, 53% of the patients on prednisone/prednisolone were on BID and 5% were on TID.

### The glucocorticoid receptor: Isoforms, functions, and contribution to glucocorticoid sensitivity [^114hwxW8]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoids exert pleiotropic effects on all tissues to regulate cellular and metabolic homeostasis. Synthetic forms are used therapeutically in a wide range of conditions due to their anti-inflammatory benefits, albeit with dose and duration-dependent side effects. Significant variability occurs between tissues, disease states, and individuals regarding both the beneficial and deleterious effects. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is the site of action for these hormones, and a vast body of work has been conducted to understand its function.

Traditionally, it was thought that the anti-inflammatory benefits of glucocorticoids were mediated by transrepression of pro-inflammatory transcription factors, while the adverse metabolic effects resulted from direct transactivation. This canonical understanding of GR function has been brought into question over the past two decades due to advances in scientific techniques and the discovery of multiple isoforms of the receptor present in most tissues. Here, we review the structure and function of the GR, the nature of the receptor isoforms, and the contribution of the receptor to glucocorticoid sensitivity or resistance in health and disease.

### A path to glucocorticoid stewardship: A critical review of clinical recommendations for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^114m8hza]. Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

The discovery of glucocorticoids (GCs) resulted in the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1950, and they have since revolutionized the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), effectively reducing disease activity and preventing flares. GCs can have effects on both genomic and non-genomic pathways, providing powerful anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant actions.

GCs activate the genomic pathway at dosages as low as 2.5–5 mg/day prednisone equivalent and inhibit inflammatory cytokine gene transcription while increasing anti-inflammatory gene expression. Conversely, the non-genomic pathway is activated by higher dosages of prednisolone but more potently by methylprednisolone (MP) and dexamethasone. This leads to reduced lymphocyte activity, providing rapid symptom relief.

Despite its pivotal role in SLE management, GC use is overshadowed by concerns over adverse effects (AEs) and increased healthcare costs associated with GC-related toxicities. Nevertheless, global studies suggest that up to 88% of patients with SLE are exposed to GCs, with many receiving them long term.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1171fF7m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

We recognize that there is great inter-individual variation in responses to glucocorticoids, likely affecting the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Consequently, glucocorticoid exposure should be considered a multidimensional risk factor, including dose and frequency, administration mode, duration of therapy, potency of glucocorticoid, and individual susceptibility. Glucocorticoid exposure via oral administration that poses risk for adrenal insufficiency is expected to at least exceed both of the following thresholds:

- **Duration of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency**: 3–4 weeks or greater.
- **Dose of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency**: Any dose greater than the daily hydrocortisone equivalent of 15–25 mg (4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisolone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone).

The following defined terms will be used in the remainder of these guidelines:

- **Physiologic daily dose equivalent**: Daily glucocorticoid dose equivalent to average daily cortisol production (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisolone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Endogenous production of cortisol is estimated to be 9–10 mg/day. The above-mentioned doses are based on an estimate of bioavailability.

- **Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy**: Any dose greater than the physiologic daily dose equivalent (see above).

- **Short-term glucocorticoid therapy**: Any glucocorticoid therapy of less than 3–4 weeks duration.

- **Long-term glucocorticoid therapy**: Glucocorticoid therapy greater than three weeks in duration.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113uLZzA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Once glucocorticoids are tapered down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy. Selecting one approach over the other might be driven by patient-related aspects, including co-morbidities, co-medication, age, and pre-test probability for adrenal insufficiency, or by the medical context, such as the training and experience of the treating clinician or accessibility to laboratory diagnostics. There are no studies showing the superiority of any of these approaches in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-benefit.

- **Proposed approach to systemic glucocorticoid discontinuation**: Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, the glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of the HPA axis is documented. If the patient does not experience any symptoms, the tapering proceeds until glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Alternatively, patients may undergo testing with a morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00) for the determination of HPA axis recovery. If adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges to ensure adequate replacement for adrenal insufficiency, yet still providing a stimulus for HPA-axis recovery. Patients should be retested according to recommendations and further signs.

### Prednisone [^112aRjAD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy:

- **Basic principles and indications**: Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of alternate day therapy (ADT) should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids.

- **Therapeutic technique**: ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.

- **Disease severity considerations**: In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible, particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended.

Once control has been established, two courses are available:

	- Change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day.
	- Following control of the disease process, reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, the first course may be preferable.

- **Advantages of ADT**: Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g. patients with rheumatoid arthritis), since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the metabolic effects of modified-release hydrocortisone versus standard glucocorticoid replacement therapy in adults with adrenal insufficiency [^1165A4ai]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Low credibility.

Published studies explore the metabolic effects of modified-release hydrocortisone (MR-HC) replacement in patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI). The objective was to compare the metabolic effects of MR-HC with standard glucocorticoid (SG) replacement in adults with AI. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were meta-analyzed, while non-RCT studies were described narratively with critical appraisal.

Data sources included PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL. These databases were searched to identify relevant articles published before August 2019.

The study selection involved all study types that reported the metabolic profile, including anthropometric, glucose, and lipid-related parameters, of patients switched from SG to MR-HC replacement. Following independent screening by two reviewers, 390 studies were identified, of which 9 studies were included in the review (RCT, n = 2; non-RCT, n = 7).

For data extraction, two independent reviewers assessed each paper for bias and conducted data extraction.

Meta-analysis results from two RCTs involving 104 patients switched from SG to MR-HC replacement showed significant treatment effects at 3 months post-therapy switch. There was a notable reduction in body weight (-0.82 kg; 95% CI: -1.24 kg to -0.40 kg; P < .001) and HbA1c (-0.13%; 95% CI: -0.214% to -0.045%; p = 0.003). In the subgroup with diabetes mellitus (DM), the reduction in HbA1C was more pronounced (-0.52%; 95% CI: -0.82% to -0.23%; P < .001). Non-RCT studies showed improved anthropometric measures and glucose metabolism for up to 48 months following the switch from SG to MR-HC replacement.

In conclusion, in adults with AI, replacement with MR-HC showed beneficial metabolic effects compared to SG replacement.

### Corticosteroids for acute severe asthma in hospitalised patients [^111Egr2h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are currently used routinely in the management of acute severe asthma. The optimal dose and route of administration continue to be debated. Some investigators have reported a greater benefit of higher doses of corticosteroids in the management of severe asthma, while others have not.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether higher doses of systemic corticosteroids (oral, intravenous, or intramuscular) are more effective than lower doses in the management of patients with acute severe asthma requiring hospital admission.

- **Search strategy**: Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group Asthma Register. In addition, primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews, and texts were also searched.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were selected for inclusion in the review if they met the following broad inclusion criteria: described as randomised controlled trials, included patients with acute severe asthma, compared different doses of corticosteroids (any route) in two or more treatment arms, and had a minimum period of follow-up of 24 hours. Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for inclusion, and disagreement was resolved by third-party adjudication.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers if the authors were unable to verify the validity of information. Missing data were obtained from authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. The data were analysed as weighted mean differences.

### Dexamethasone [^114k5pJh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoids, both naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids that are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. These compounds cause varied metabolic effects and modify the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli.

Naturally occurring glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone and cortisone, also possess sodium-retaining properties and are thus used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. In contrast, their synthetic analogs, including dexamethasone, are primarily employed for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders affecting various organ systems. Notably, at equipotent anti-inflammatory doses, dexamethasone almost completely lacks the sodium-retaining properties found in hydrocortisone and its closely related derivatives.

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad [^111mbNDB]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

There are many questions that remain regarding exogenous glucocorticoids (GCs), which are often administered for their anti-inflammatory action. While our own data suggest that the majority of these actions may be preserved, this study was conducted in healthy male individuals as a proof-of-concept with no underlying inflammatory conditions. This relative preservation of anti-inflammatory actions could potentially be explained by the tissue distribution of 11β-HSD1, which is highly expressed in the liver, fat, muscle, skin, and bone, with significantly lower expression in immune-inflammatory cells.

Rodent data have added a note of caution. 11β-HSD1 knockout mice develop a more florid phenotype when challenged with specific inflammatory stimuli. The response of these conditions to GC therapy, in some but not all aspects, is blunted in the 11β-HSD1 knockout mice; however, the muscle loss associated with GC treatment of chronic inflammation was improved. Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 in mouse models of inflammatory conditions treated with GCs has not been performed.

Considering the well-described differences in GC metabolism and the effects of 11β-HSD1 deletion or inhibition between mice and humans, the clinical significance of the observations in rodents is yet to be determined. This should not detract from the need to undertake dedicated clinical studies, which are planned and currently in the set-up phase.

### Prednisolone acetate [^113CXd3v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prednisolone acetate is a glucocorticoid that, on the basis of weight, has 3 to 5 times the anti-inflammatory potency of hydrocortisone. Glucocorticoids inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, and phagocytic migration of the acute inflammatory response, as well as capillary proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation.

### Do we need to administer fludrocortisone in addition to hydrocortisone in adult patients with septic shock? An updated systematic review with Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and an observational study with target trial emulation [^113MJPUG]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

- **Key points**:

	- **Question**: Is administering fludrocortisone in addition to hydrocortisone to adult patients with septic shock necessary?

	- **Findings**: We conducted an updated systematic review using Bayesian network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone, hydrocortisone alone, or placebo in adult patients with septic shock. Among the tested therapies, hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone showed the highest likelihood of improving short-term survival.

	- **Meaning**: On the basis of the aforementioned evidence, the combined administration of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone may be considered for adult patients with septic shock.

Despite the implementation of aggressive treatment approaches, septic shock continues to exhibit high mortality rates exceeding 30% in numerous studies. This is mainly a result of the activation of proinflammatory and procoagulant pathways. Corticosteroids have been considered as a potential strategy for modulating the dysregulated immune response associated with septic shock.

Growing concerns among intensivists are centered around critical-illness-related corticosteroid and mineralocorticoid deficiencies. The International Guideline of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign conditionally recommended the administration of IV hydrocortisone at a typical dose of 200 mg/d to adult patients with septic shock necessitating vasopressor support. However, the 2020 Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for Sepsis and Septic Shock proposed the adjunctive use of fludrocortisone with hydrocortisone based on a meta-analysis of two randomized controlled trials.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency, and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^111XJUZy]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The risk of adrenal insufficiency (AI) is related to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the oral corticosteroids (OCS) used, including factors such as bioavailability, protein-binding affinities, plasma half-life, and metabolic inactivation and clearance. Repeat courses of OCS are also a risk factor for AI. Patients predisposed to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction due to other underlying conditions or medications may be particularly susceptible to AI caused by OCS. The risk of AI can be reduced — though not fully negated — by using the lowest effective dosage of OCS for the shortest possible duration.

Although the absolute risk of developing AI following a short course of OCS is often assumed to be low, clinically relevant HPA axis suppression may be substantially under-recognized and under-reported in clinical practice. In a study by Schuetz and colleagues, a 14-day course of systemic corticosteroids (a 40 mg methylprednisolone injection, followed by 13 days of 40 mg oral prednisone) led to HPA axis suppression, as gauged by response to the 1 µg corticotropin (synthetic ACTH 1–24) stimulation test, in 7 of 9 patients on the first day following the commencement of corticosteroid treatment; this increased to 8 of 9 by the last day of therapy. Moreover, 21 days after the discontinuation of treatment, 3 patients still showed evidence of adrenal dysfunction. Although all 9 patients had an underlying diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 5 were on inhaled corticosteroids at the time of admission, none had received systemic corticosteroid therapy in the preceding 6 months.

Perhaps even more compelling are the findings…

### Drug insight: Selective agonists and antagonists of the glucocorticoid receptor [^113p6Bfb]. Nature Clinical Practice. Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoid hormones exert a wide spectrum of metabolic and immunological effects. They function through the glucocorticoid receptor, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Glucocorticoids are particularly effective as anti-inflammatory agents but often cause severe side effects. The structure of the ligand-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor has now been elucidated, and a series of studies have shown that even subtle changes to the ligand structure alter the final conformation of the ligand-receptor complex, with consequences for both protein recruitment and the function of the receptor.

This has led to concerted efforts to find selective ligands for the glucocorticoid receptor that preserve the beneficial anti-inflammatory activity but reduce the side-effect profile. The direct health-care benefits of such a simple, safe, orally active agent targeting the underlying inflammatory process in, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, would be considerable in terms of reduced patient suffering; furthermore, the indirect benefits in terms of reducing the costs of therapeutic delivery and preventing loss of productivity would be even greater.

### A novel specific bioassay for the determination of glucocorticoid bioavailability in human serum [^111nTydD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

Some patients develop side effects even on relatively low doses of topically administered glucocorticoids (GCs), while others appear to be less sensitive to GCs. We have developed and validated a bioassay that can measure glucocorticoid bioavailability directly from small amounts of human serum to help elucidate underlying mechanisms.

- **Methods**: We have stably transfected the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 with a plasmid expressing the glucocorticoid receptor and a plasmid containing the luciferase gene preceded by three concatenated steroid response elements, bringing luciferase expression under the control of the liganded glucocorticoid receptor.

- **Results**: The assay, with an intra- and inter-assay coefficient of variance (CV) better than 10%, showed the expected difference in potency between different GCs (fluticasone propionate > budesonide > dexamethasone > hydrocortisone). No cross-reactivity was detected with other steroid hormones such as progesterone, testosterone, and oestradiol. The bioassay easily detects the rise and subsequent fall of bioavailable GCs in human serum following ingestion of only 0.5 mg dexamethasone and clearly reflects the diurnal cortisol rhythm. Moreover, systemic availability following inhalation of 2 x 250 micro g fluticasone propionate using a pressure dose inhaler could be demonstrated.

- **Conclusions**: This assay can be used to determine levels of bioavailable GCs in serum, both endogenous and administered, and thus may help in optimizing treatment regimens. The small amount of serum needed to perform an analysis makes this a valuable tool in clinical settings.

Naturally occurring glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone, which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are primarily utilized for their potent anti-inflammatory effects in disorders affecting many organ systems.

Glucocorticoids exert profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition, they modify the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli.

### The influence of foetal prednisone exposure on the cortisol levels in the offspring [^115pjNwq]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Pregnant women suffering from autoimmune disease use glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids can partially diffuse to the foetus and may influence the development of the foetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, especially in the early stages of pregnancy. This study aimed to investigate whether prednisone exposure in utero influences the cortisol levels of prepubertal children.

- **Design**: Mothers participated in a prospective cohort study on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and pregnancy. Children were either exposed (n = 44) or nonexposed (n = 65) to prednisone in utero. Salivary cortisol levels were collected from all children at four time points during the day: at awakening, 30 minutes after awakening, 1 p.m., and bedtime. Cortisol levels between groups were analyzed using the area under the curve (AUC), cortisol awakening response (CAR), and slope.

- **Results**: The mean age (SD) of the children was 6.98 (1.23). The difference in mean (SD) cortisol level at 1 p.m. was 5.42 nm (4.08) in the prednisone-exposed group and 3.97 nm (4.00) in the nonexposed group (P = 0.03). Prednisone-exposed children had a higher AUC (β = 13.28; P = 0.02), even after correction for RA disease activity. No differences were found in CAR, slope, or blood pressure. The cortisol levels of the nonexposed children were more similar to the age-specific references than those of the prednisone-exposed children.

- **Conclusion**: Prednisone use during pregnancy is associated with higher daytime cortisol levels in prepubertal offspring, although this is not yet accompanied by clinical outcomes. This finding does not have immediate clinical consequences but raises questions concerning prednisone use during pregnancy.

### Clinical pharmacology of corticosteroids [^111Eg3UJ]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids have numerous applications in treating inflammation and diseases of immune function due to their significant anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. These agents modulate immune function through various effects in the nucleus of numerous cells. When used in pharmacologic doses to suppress allergic responses or inflammation, corticosteroids can cause numerous adverse effects associated with an excess of glucocorticoid activity. Prolonged use (greater than two weeks) results in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which necessitates tapering of doses.

Dosing strategies for systemic corticosteroids aim to minimize the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression. Topical administration, including oral inhalation, is often employed to avoid the significant adverse effects associated with chronic use. Inhaled corticosteroids are potent synthetic agents that primarily exert their actions locally in the airways but can cause systemic effects depending on several factors influencing systemic bioavailability.

Inhaled corticosteroids form the cornerstone of asthma therapy and are important options for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in patients who experience frequent exacerbations. When administered nasally, they are the most effective therapy for treating moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis.

### Dexamethasone in the era of COVID-19: Friend or foe? An essay on the effects of dexamethasone and the potential risks of its inadvertent use in patients with diabetes [^116YSvLq]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Low credibility.

The critical functions of glucocorticoids for survival involve the presence of receptors for these molecules in the regulation of gene transcription processes. The glucocorticoid receptor can function at least at three levels: first, recruitment of the general transcription machinery; second, modulation of transcription factor action through direct protein–protein interactions; and third, modulation of chromatin structure to allow the assembly of other gene regulatory proteins and the general transcription machinery on the DNA. Interactions between corticosteroid receptors and target genes, especially those related to the immune system, appear to be among the mechanisms responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects observed with pharmacological doses of these medications.

In addition to the genomic effects, glucocorticoids have non-genomic actions of significant therapeutic relevance. These effects are mediated by three different mechanisms: physicochemical interactions with cellular membranes, membrane-bound glucocorticoid receptor-mediated effects, and cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor-mediated effects. Although the mechanisms are not yet fully understood, the non-genomic actions of glucocorticoids may play a role in the management of inflammatory diseases.

Since 1950, when cortisol was first synthesized, several studies have been conducted with the aim of synthesizing a steroid with a specific anti-inflammatory action. It quickly became apparent that it was possible to alter the steroid molecule so that the glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid activity…

### Effects of glucocorticoids on inflammation and arthritis [^114Ln3VR]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are used in the treatment of most rheumatic diseases and are employed chronically in up to 50% of rheumatoid arthritis cases. The frequent use of glucocorticoids has previously been supported by incomplete trial evidence of their benefit and an incomplete understanding of their mechanisms of action. This review examines significant recent publications relating to glucocorticoids in the field of rheumatology.

- **Recent findings**: The basic science of glucocorticoid action has advanced considerably during the review period. Major advances include the demonstration of the function of glucocorticoid-induced anti-inflammatory proteins such as mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1. There has been an expanded understanding of alternatively spliced isoforms of the glucocorticoid receptor, as well as significant steps in comprehending the factors regulating glucocorticoid sensitivity in disease. Clinical studies have also seen significant developments, notably with the publication of two randomized prospective studies on the efficacy of glucocorticoids in preventing erosions in rheumatoid arthritis.

Despite over 50 years of glucocorticoid use in rheumatology, both basic science and clinical studies continue to yield intriguing new data. The quest for therapeutic agents with the beneficial effects of glucocorticoids but lacking their harmful effects is supported by this ongoing progress.

### Mortality risk in patients with adrenal insufficiency using prednisolone or hydrocortisone: A retrospective cohort study [^117Mz2nF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Prednisolone has been recommended rather than hydrocortisone for glucocorticoid replacement in adrenal insufficiency due to its longer duration of action and lower cost.

- **Objective**: To determine mortality rates with prednisolone versus hydrocortisone.

- **Methods**: In this observational study, we used data extracted from a UK primary care database (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) to measure the relative mortality of patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, who were treated with either prednisolone or hydrocortisone, and control individuals who were individually matched for age, sex, period, and place of follow-up.

- **Results**: As expected, mortality in adrenal insufficiency irrespective of cause was increased, based on 5478 patients (4228 on hydrocortisone; 1250 on prednisolone) and 54,314 controls (41,934 and 12,380, respectively). Overall, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was similar with the two treatments (prednisolone, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.54–2.01] vs. hydrocortisone 1.69 [1.57–1.82]; P = 0.65). This was also the case for secondary adrenal insufficiency. In primary disease (1405 on hydrocortisone vs. 137 on prednisolone; 13,965 and 1347 controls, respectively), prednisolone users were older, more likely to have another autoimmune disease and malignancy, and less likely to have mineralocorticoid replacement. Nevertheless, after adjustment, the HR for prednisolone-treated patients remained higher than for those taking hydrocortisone (2.92 [2.19–3.91] vs. 1.90 [1.66–2.16]; P = 0.0020).

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad [^113LCpHG]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Subsequently, in a 12-week, phase II, controlled trial involving 323 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) randomized to once-daily fosdagrocorat (1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg), prednisone (5 mg or 10 mg), or placebo, fosdagrocorat (10 mg and 15 mg) showed noninferior anti-inflammatory effects compared to prednisone 10 mg. Nonsignificant improvements in glycaemic control and bone formation biomarkers were reported with equipotent anti-inflammatory effects in patients treated with fosdagrocorat. However, the development of this compound has been discontinued for undisclosed reasons.

More recently, the results of a novel nonsteroidal selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulator, AZD9567, have been published. Two phase I trials were designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of AZD9567. Secondary outcomes for both studies included the effect of AZD9567 on glucose homeostasis as measured with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Exploratory outcomes aimed to test the effects of AZD9567 on inflammation, measured by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated TNFα and inflammatory cytokine response in whole blood cells, HPA axis activity, evaluated by plasma cortisol or 24-hour urinary cortisol, and on biomarkers of bone turnover, specifically osteocalcin. Prednisolone was used as the comparator. The first trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, single-ascending dose study conducted with 72 healthy men, whereas the second trial was a randomized, active-controlled (prednisolone), single-blind, multiple-ascending dose trial involving 75 healthy men and women. AZD9567 and prednisolone exerted similar and potent anti-inflammatory effects. However, prednisolone at doses of 20 mg and 40 mg caused…

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad [^113fTF6g]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Mechanisms of selective GR agonists action

While glucocorticoids (GCs) are extremely potent for their intended target, as discussed earlier, they are associated with debilitating side effects. Therefore, substantial work has aimed to develop so-called selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists (SEGRAs) in order to try to separate the negative side effects from the beneficial anti-inflammatory actions (see Fig. 3). This was often based on the idea that a monomer/dimer dichotomy existed regarding repression/activation. However, as discussed in the Classical Steroid Hormone Action section, this model of GC action is no longer clear-cut. Monomers have been found to activate and not simply repress gene expression, and also to activate anti-inflammatory genes that are required for the full effects of GCs to act as anti-inflammatory agents.

Early reports identified compound A as a selective agonist that seemed to have limited ability to activate genes via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) but efficiently repressed genes involved in inflammation. However, recent work highlighted that the differential effects of compound A are likely due to alternative cofactor recruitment rather than an effect on tethering, and data supporting selective binding of compound A to the GR is unconvincing.

Regarding the medical management of corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, particularly in relation to tapering corticosteroids, the ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend considering a switch from long-acting corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone or betamethasone) to shorter-acting corticosteroids (such as hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting corticosteroids are no longer necessary.

### Interpretation of steroid biomarkers in 21-hydroxylase deficiency and their use in disease management [^113zpWgp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Wide variability of adrenal steroid concentrations within a 2-hour time frame after the morning hydrocortisone dose was observed in a representative child with 21OHD. The observed cortisol, 17OHP, and A4 concentrations were studied over 6 hours. A shaded area depicts a 2-hour time window from 1 to 3 hours post the morning 6 mg hydrocortisone dose. Concentration levels of each adrenal steroid showed a change of more than 60% within this 2-hour time frame. The child's regular total daily hydrocortisone dose was 12 mg/m²/day. Abbreviations: 17OHP, 17-hydroxyprogesterone; 21OHD, 21-hydroxylase deficiency; A4, androstenedione.

- **Discordance of biomarker concentrations**: Discordance between 17OHP and A4 concentrations can be observed, with one adrenal biomarker disproportionately high while the other remains in the normal range, potentially confounding the interpretation of disease control. In a large cohort of adults and children with 21OHD, Jha et al. found a discrepancy between 17OHP and A4 concentrations in 17% of more than 2,700 laboratory assessments. Among those with discrepant biomarkers, elevated serum 17OHP with A4 within range was the most frequent finding (86%), with a higher prevalence in children (92%). Among 46 patients who either had elevated 17OHP but A4 within range or vice versa, 65% of the patients were categorized as being in good clinical control.

- **Clinical control categorization**: Within the 41 patients with elevated 17OHP but A4 within the reference range, the study reported a median elevation of 11KT as high as 2.5 times relative to control. Thirteen of these 41 patients (28%) were in poor clinical control, indicating that abnormally high levels of 17OHP in the absence of concomitant high A4 can still signal poor disease management.

### Solu-medrol [^114McPoe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**: Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids that are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone and cortisone, which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are primarily used for their potent anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.

Glucocorticoids cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition, they modify the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli.

Methylprednisolone is a potent anti-inflammatory steroid with greater anti-inflammatory potency than prednisolone and even less tendency than prednisolone to induce sodium and water retention. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate has the same metabolic and anti-inflammatory actions as methylprednisolone. When given parenterally and in equimolar quantities, the two compounds are equivalent in biologic activity. Following the intravenous injection of methylprednisolone sodium succinate, demonstrable effects are evident within one hour and persist for a variable period. Excretion of the administered dose is nearly complete within 12 hours. Thus, if constantly high blood levels are required, injections should be made every 4 to 6 hours. This preparation is also rapidly absorbed when administered intramuscularly and is excreted in a pattern similar to that observed after intravenous injection.
