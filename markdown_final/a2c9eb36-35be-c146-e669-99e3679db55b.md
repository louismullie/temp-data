## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best captures what advocates of care ethics argue. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core claims of care ethics as described in the literature. Then, I should verify how each answer choice maps onto those claims. Next, I will check for common misconceptions and eliminate distractors. Finally, I will select the best-supported option and briefly justify it with the source material.

> Let me first confirm the foundational claims of care ethics. Care ethics emphasizes relationality, interdependence, and the centrality of care and compassion in moral life; it also critiques traditional moral theories for privileging abstract, universal principles and for struggling to account for the moral significance of attitudes, emotions, and contextual relationships, which care ethics treats as morally salient features rather than mere side effects [^dfbd79bb].

> Now, Option A claims care ethics is an important development of virtue ethics. Wait, let me verify whether care ethics is typically framed as a development of virtue ethics or as a distinct tradition. The literature situates care ethics as a feminist moral philosophy that starts from the observation that interrelatedness and dependency are universal, and it explicitly contrasts with principle-based ethics rather than being presented as an extension of virtue ethics, so I should be cautious about endorsing this option as the best answer [^dfbd79bb].

> Option B states that traditional moral theories have difficulty explaining the rightness or wrongness of attitudes. Hold on, I should verify whether care ethicists actually make this critique. Yes, care ethics argues that mainstream moral theories often fail to capture the moral weight of attitudes, emotions, and relational contexts, and that they undervalue the moral significance of care, compassion, and responsiveness within relationships, which is a central plank of the care ethics critique of traditional ethics [^dfbd79bb].

> Option C claims that the only important moral concepts are care and compassion. Hmm, wait a minute, that sounds too strong. Let me reconsider whether care ethicists assert exclusivity or instead emphasize primacy. Care ethics elevates care and compassion as central moral concepts, but it does not claim they are the only important ones; it integrates them into a broader relational and contextual moral framework, so this absolutist phrasing overstates the position and should be rejected [^dfbd79bb].

> Option D suggests we should think about welfare and happiness in terms of sympathy. I need to check whether care ethics equates welfare with sympathy. Care ethics links welfare to attentive, responsive caregiving within relationships and to the well-being of both caregiver and care receiver, but it does not reduce welfare to sympathy; sympathy is a feeling, whereas care ethics emphasizes practices, relationships, and outcomes, so this option mischaracterizes the theory [^dfbd79bb].

> Comparing the options, Option B most accurately reflects a core argumentative move made by care ethicists: they contend that traditional moral theories have difficulty accounting for the moral significance of attitudes, emotions, and relational contexts, and they propose care ethics as a corrective that treats these as morally central rather than peripheral, which is precisely the point articulated in the source material [^dfbd79bb].

---

The correct answer is **B. that traditional moral theories have difficulty explaining the rightness or wrongness of attitudes**. Care ethics emphasizes relational, context-sensitive moral reasoning and argues that conventional, principle-based ethics (e.g. utilitarianism, deontology) often fail to adequately address the moral significance of attitudes, emotions, and caring relationships [^dfbd79bb]. Options A, C, and D misstate care ethics: it is not simply a development of virtue ethics, it does not claim care and compassion are the only important moral concepts, and it does not reduce welfare to sympathy.

---

## Core claims of care ethics

Care ethics is a **relational and contextual approach** to morality that prioritizes:

- **Relationality and interdependence**: Moral reasoning is embedded in relationships and social contexts, not abstract principles [^dfbd79bb].
- **Emotions and attitudes**: Emotions such as empathy, compassion, and attentiveness are morally significant and guide ethical decision-making [^dfbd79bb].
- **Contextual moral judgment**: Moral decisions should consider specific circumstances, relationships, and the needs of those involved [^dfbd79bb].

---

## Critique of traditional moral theories

Care ethicists argue that traditional moral theories — such as utilitarianism and deontology — often **struggle to account for the moral significance of attitudes and emotions**. These theories typically emphasize abstract principles, universal rules, or consequences, which can overlook the relational and emotional dimensions of moral life. For example, utilitarianism focuses on maximizing overall happiness or utility, while deontology emphasizes adherence to moral rules or duties. Care ethics contends that these approaches can neglect the importance of caring attitudes, empathy, and the moral significance of relationships [^dfbd79bb].

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Analysis** |
|-|-|
| A. Care ethics is an important development of virtue ethics. | Incorrect. While care ethics shares some similarities with virtue ethics, such as emphasizing character traits and moral virtues, it is not simply a development of virtue ethics. Care ethics emerged as a distinct ethical framework, primarily influenced by feminist thought, and emphasizes relationality, emotions, and contextual moral judgment, which are not central to traditional virtue ethics [^dfbd79bb]. |
| B. Traditional moral theories have difficulty explaining the rightness or wrongness of attitudes. | Correct. This aligns with the core critique of care ethics regarding traditional moral theories. Care ethicists argue that these theories often fail to adequately address the moral significance of attitudes, emotions, and relational contexts, which are central to care ethics [^dfbd79bb]. |
| C. The only important moral concepts are care and compassion. | Incorrect. Care ethics emphasizes the importance of care and compassion but does not claim that these are the only important moral concepts. It recognizes the significance of other moral considerations, such as justice, autonomy, and beneficence, while prioritizing relational and emotional dimensions of morality [^dfbd79bb]. |
| D. We should think about welfare and happiness in terms of sympathy. | Incorrect. Care ethics does not reduce welfare and happiness to sympathy. While sympathy and empathy are important, care ethics emphasizes a broader understanding of welfare and happiness that includes relational well-being, contextual considerations, and the needs of individuals within specific relationships [^dfbd79bb]. |

---

## Conclusion

Care ethics advocates argue that traditional moral theories have difficulty explaining the moral significance of attitudes and emotions. Care ethics emphasizes relationality, emotions, and contextual moral judgment, offering a distinct alternative to conventional ethical frameworks [^dfbd79bb].

### Animal research nexus: a new approach to the connections between science, health and animal welfare [^313f994b]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

Our use of nexus is thus not a rejection of conceptual relational scholarship around multispecies health, but rather an attempt, following Williams et al, to mobilise 'the conceptual and methodological insights of assemblage thinking to advance research on nexus issues' 26 and engage this diverse intellectual lineage within interdisciplinary-focused, policy-focused and public-focused research. The idea of the animal research nexus provides a way to convey the complex, contradictory and contested interconnections between scientific practices, human health and animal welfare into conversations between disciplines, policy and the public. We propose the nexus itself as a starting point, both to recognise the importance of these interconnections, but also to avoid prioritising the status of either biomedical research or animal welfare in advance and avoid recapitulating the polarisations around animal research. There is an invitation for different disciplines to think about how understandings of human health are entangled with animal welfare science and the practices of animal care, how knowledge about animals also develops through biomedical research and how both are complexly enmeshed in the changing cultures, economy and governance of scientific research. As Stein et al argue, 'what is new about the nexus approach is that it considers multiple sectors equally important providing multiple entry points for actors from different policy sectors to get involved'. 27 We suggest the mobility of the concept of nexus, across disciplines and into policy, 'has the power to open up new spaces for critical debate' 28 and draw together previously disparate actors in addressing broad, complex and entangled systems.

### Using natural experimental studies to guide public health action: turning the evidence-based medicine paradigm on its head [^3ad9e043]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

What do we need to know?

We should reflect on the extent to which our research is aligned with the societal processes it is intended to inform. To that end, we must distinguish between 'behaviour change' as a population goal on the one hand, that is, the outcome we ultimately wish to achieve; and on the other, 'behaviour change' as an intervention strategy or moral imperative, that is, a way of framing both the problem (people are making poor behavioural choices) and the solution (they need to make different choices). An approach too narrowly focused on people and their behaviour or lifestyle as the problem, and thereby on interventions that often seek 'to persuade the poor to change their behaviour', is not compatible with a social ecological understanding of the causes of ill health that are not amenable to individual control.

The evidence available to guide policy has long been subject to an 'evaluative bias' in favour of behavioural interventions targeting people at higher risk because such interventions are generally easier to evaluate and, in particular, easier to randomise. This type of evidence tends to overshadow that for strategies that act on whole populations by targeting critical leverage points in the systems that generate and sustain less healthy behaviour patterns. This implies a need to direct greater policy and research attention to where the underlying problems are located: not merely among individuals at higher risk, nor even among groups of more deprived individuals, but in the more fundamental causes of 'dis-ease' (sic)in communities — for example, in the unhealthy environments created as a consequence of the structural conditions of the planning, transport and welfare systems and the housing and labour markets.

### Putting health in all welfare policies: is it warranted? A Southern European perspective [^2dfeacf2]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2010). Low credibility.

'Welfare' is a vague term, the meaning of which depends on ideology, values and judgements. Material resources are just means to enhance people's well-being, but growth of Gross Domestic Product is still the standard measure of a society's success. Fortunately, recent advances in measuring social performance include health, education and other social outcomes. Because 'what we measure affects what we do', it is hoped that social policies will change, and that a contribution will be made by Health in All Policies and associated health impact assessment methodology. The task consists of designing transversal policies that consider health and other welfare goals, the short-term and long-term implications and intergenerational redistributions of resources. Cross-sectoral policies are required for efficiency and fairness. Unless inefficiencies in current healthcare systems are reduced, welfare states will fail to consolidate and overall economic well-being could be in serious trouble. In this essay, some policy solutions are sketched. An independent agency, the National Institute for Welfare Enhancement, is proposed for long-term fair and efficient social policies in which health plays a central role.

### Animal research nexus: a new approach to the connections between science, health and animal welfare [^3416ad1c]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

Such interest-based approaches have much to offer our understanding of policy processes. However, here we consider how they might be seen to feed into a broader nexus type thinking. This thinking would demand close attention to the inter-relationships and dependencies between science, health and welfare, including the way in which stakeholders and publics are imagined through regulatory practices, and the historic way in which these connections have been forged. Here, we consider this approach via three specific examples.

First, how does legislation draw boundaries between what types of bodies are included and excluded from categories of regulatory protection? This differs across national contexts, often for reasons to do with the operation of governance, rather than a priori ethical commitments. In the UK under ASPA, experiments which use certain species (primates, horses, dogs, cats) require further justification. A nexus approach encourages us to look at the complex, contingent nature of this provision. Many of these animals can arguably experience greater suffering, according to scientific understandings of sentience and assumptions about welfare. However, this legislation also responds to the imaginary of public concern, previously defined as 'societal sentience', 72 where society itself is assumed to experience varying levels of ethical harm. One could dismiss this special protection as speciesism, as have many critics. 73 But our point here is that nexus thinking encourages us to consider how things could have been different or could be in the future, for example, as ideas about sentience or publics are transformed over time.

### Twenty-first century ethical challenges for psychology [^6528d800]. The American Psychologist (2007). Low credibility.

Foreseeable social and technological changes will force us to reevaluate our thinking about ethically appropriate ways to fulfill our mission of using psychology to advance human health and welfare in the twenty-first century. Three categories of challenge related to societal and technological changes have become particularly evident. First, increasing patterns of delivering services over substantial distances by electronic means (i.e., telepsychology) demand consideration. Second, we must parse our ethical obligations to individuals, to groups, and to society at large as our influence working behind the scenes as "invisible" psychologists grows. Finally, as we witness the accelerating demise of psychiatry, we must take care not to follow a similar path. As we face new ethical challenges, we must continually ask ourselves where our responsibilities lie as individuals and as a profession. We must learn not to repeat the mistakes of the past and focus instead on optimizing the future for a science and practice of psychology focused on human health and welfare.

### Evolving vision of regulatory science in the global medical community [^79176d30]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

"Regulatory science" (RS) has been defined in various ways, but, nevertheless, the definitions of RS in different parts of the world include many common elements. It seems to be a common view that RS is not basic or applied science but, rather, focuses on the estimation and prediction of safety and efficacy. Thus, we think RS overall should incorporate not only RS specifically for medical product assessment but also RS engineering to provide prediction and estimation tools for those purposes, including guideline/guidance development. It is important as well to consider the potential contribution of RS to rational medicine (i.e., to evidence-based medicine in a broader context), and especially to real-world evidence generation. We will look at how definitions of RS have evolved, and how we believe RS might develop in the future. Taking a patient-centric view, we re-emphasize RS is an ethical science contributing to society and human welfare.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and management of youth involved with the child welfare system [^ff03391e]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

AACAP practice parameter — terminology and definitions: Clinicians working with youth involved with the child welfare system should be familiar with some commonly used child welfare system terms; in this Parameter, the terms "child" and "youth" are used interchangeably, "family" is used in a broad sense to include relatives, close family friends, and nontraditional families, and "caregiver" includes family and, when specified, other childcare providers in out-of-home placements. The child welfare system is defined as a group of services designed to promote the well-being of children by ensuring safety, achieving permanency, and strengthening families to care for their children successfully, and it is not a single entity and involves many organizations.

### Animal researchers shoulder a psychological burden that animal ethics committees ought to address [^886370ae]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

However, current standards do mean AECs should have regard for AUB, because this may make laboratory animal personnel less able to maintain high animal welfare standards, and some refinements to mitigate AUB are also refinements to promote animal welfare (eg, environmental enrichment). Therefore, AUB is indirectly relevant for protecting animal welfare, which is a key aim of AECs under their current standards.

However, the standards that AECs use should include a direct focus on AUB. The spirit of AECs is benevolent paternalism. They act to protect and advance the well-being of animals used in research, and the people who may benefit from it. They also ought to protect laboratory personnel from AUB where possible. Paternalism is a less controversial ethical option with animals — later, we will respond to an objection that the paternalism we advocate wrongs laboratory animal personnel, since they are moral agents.

Can AECs do this work? It would be a problem if we were arguing that they ought to do what they cannot do, even were standards changed. As argued, AECs standardly have regard to welfare, including human benefit from research, which shows that it would not be unfamiliar to them to be considering human welfare cost in the form of AUB. If applications to AECs explained and accounted for any AUB in the research including strategies to reduce or mitigate it, AEC members could reasonably be expected to be able to interpret and consider this, like any other information in an application. Other established ways of thinking on AECs, such as the three Rs could be adapted to be applied to AUB. Reducing animal numbers, refining techniques and replacing animals with non-sentient alternatives so that killing of sentient animals is unnecessary are obvious ways of reducing AUB which are a consequence of standard AEC operation currently. However, techniques can also be refined specifically so that they reduce or mitigate AUB, as we have described. Must humans be involved in the harming of animals, or is it possible for automation to replace them in ways that reduce harm to them while also satisfying the other requirements of ethical research?

### Should healthcare professionals respect autonomy just because it promotes welfare? [^d583e679]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2009). Low credibility.

Respect for autonomy is an important moral principle within medical ethics. However, the question of whether the normative importance of respect for autonomy is derived from other moral principles (such as welfare) or has independent moral value is debatable. In this paper it is argued that the normative importance of autonomy is derived from both welfare and non-welfare considerations. Welfare considerations provide two types of reason to respect autonomy, one related to the role of autonomy in creating welfare and one related to its role in constituting welfare. In addition, autonomy seems to have normative importance that is unrelated to welfare considerations. This type of normative role is difficult to defend within medical ethics, because most non-welfare justifications of autonomy work for only a proportion of the autonomous decisions that patients make and give no clear guidance on how to respond to autonomous yet welfare-reducing treatment requests. A recent account of autonomy (Stephen Darwall's "demand" account) provides a nuanced defence of autonomy that does not rely on welfare considerations. Darwall's approach seems to work well within medical ethics and provides a principled explanation of how to respond to autonomous patient requests for treatment options that may not be in their best medical interests. It is argued that to fully respect autonomy within a medical consultation, practitioners must consider non-welfare autonomy as well as instrumental and intrinsic welfare-related autonomy.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and management of youth involved with the child welfare system [^59365449]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Child welfare clinical guidance — Clinicians should recognize that maltreatment and trauma can be complex and chronic, leading to a confusing clinical presentation that might be difficult to differentiate from other mental health conditions. Clinicians must understand the youth's status in the child welfare system, promote youth understanding of the process, and address issues associated with movement through the child welfare system; clinicians who elect to work with the child welfare system must be willing to accept that placement decisions ultimately rest with dependency court judges and hearing commissioners, yet clinicians can effectively advocate by working as a member of the child and family team and presenting clear reasoning for their recommendations, and clinicians should advocate for consistency, stable and nurturing placements, clinically appropriate transitions, minimal disruptions, maintenance of supportive relationships and familiar settings, permanency, and well-being. An individual youth's adjustment to placement depends on numerous factors, and the factors include pre-removal functioning, individual youth characteristics, the circumstances of removal, the stability and supportsiveness of the current placement, access and connections to support from previous ecologies, and the youth's perceptions of current circumstances. Clinicians assessing and managing youth involved with the child welfare system must collaborate and coordinate with medical providers and stakeholders from other child-serving systems, and youth in foster care face medical challenges at significantly higher rates than other children. Youth involved with the child welfare system are at increased risk for involvement in other child-serving systems; clinicians must understand the youth's status in these other systems and collaborate to coordinate care and receive feedback, and clinicians also should attend to youth functioning in multiple domains because prior disruptions place the youth at greater risk for problems and problems in one domain can disrupt the current placement. The circumstances surrounding youth can give rise to strong emotions and differences of opinion; clinicians should be conscious of transference and countertransference issues.

Principle 8. Clinicians should maintain high standards of record keeping with due attention to youth outcomes and confidentiality, and the content of medical records and specific feedback and written reports to child welfare workers should be thoughtfully considered. Documentation should add value to the understanding of the child's situation and inform the work and decision making of other stakeholders, and clinical documents should be clear and unambiguous so they are not misunderstood or misinterpreted in adversarial legal proceedings. Clinicians must pay particular attention to record keeping and be aware of the possible tensions between the need for detailed records and confidentiality issues or privacy concerns that can arise for youth involved with the child welfare system. On the one hand, continuity of a child's treatment can rely heavily on the accuracy and details of records passed from one clinician to another, while on the other hand, copies of medical records provided to child welfare workers and other stakeholders will be read by many different individuals.

### Animal research nexus: a new approach to the connections between science, health and animal welfare [^1d9110af]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

We also propose the humanities have an important role to play in opening up nexus approaches and attending to how the values and experiences of those affected by these issues are included and interpreted. Earlier nexus approaches have been criticised for methods that prioritise 'quantifying and cataloguing the relationships between constituent elements', 29 which the humanities can supplement through an openness to different voices, affects and experiences. The humanities also have a vital contribution to make in understanding the centrality of dialogue and debate, and thus reflexivity, as an integrative imaginary within nexus thinking. The discussion of nexus within the context of cultural poetics by DuPlessis and Quartermain's 30 is valuable here. In their conceptualisation, nexus thinking 'allows one to appreciate difference and disparity, to pinpoint perhaps radical disagreements, to attend to rupture as well as continuity and to dispersion as well as origin'. 31 The inclusion of the humanities in nexus approaches is thus vital for thinking about how dialogues open to difference can be staged, so retaining an interpretative openness. In this view, nexus approaches provide a mode of working, 'a shifting place of dialogue, debate and reconfiguration', 32 that enlivens the study of interconnectivity in ways that can address unstable, difficult, technical and governmental complexities. 33 Rather than privileging the sciences in setting the parameters for how integration is to be understood, DuPlessis and Quartermain draw on the humanities to conclude that a nexus is 'a continuous and continuing construction that embraces contradiction, variousness and dispute'. 34 They argue that inter-relatedness can be teased out in ways that support interdisciplinary dialogue and new ways of thinking and problem-solving.

The potential for nexus approaches to encapsulate both integration and contradiction fits well with our commitment to researching the close connections and ongoing disputes around animal research. In the 'Nexus thinking in previous work on animal research' section, we develop this argument through introducing some precursors to a nexus approach in the study of animal research.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and management of youth involved with the child welfare system [^564430cd]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Principle 1 — child welfare process and interfaces: Clinicians should understand the child welfare process and how youth and family may interface with the child welfare system. Involvement with the child welfare system typically begins with a report of suspected maltreatment to the CPS, after which CPS personnel review the report and decide whether sufficient information exists to open a case, or use family assessment responses (alternative response, differential response, multitrack response or dual-track response). Situations meeting local CPS criteria for safety and/or risk concerns will be assigned to an "urgent" or "regular" response, and investigations conclude with determinations such as "substantiated" or "unsubstantiated", with some states using "unable to determine". For cases of substantiated maltreatment in 2011, national frequencies were 78.5% for neglect, 17.6% for physical abuse, 9.1% for sexual abuse, 0.9% for psychological maltreatment, and 2.2% for medical neglect.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and management of youth involved with the child welfare system [^a6abfc4d]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Principle 2 — child welfare system core values and principles: Clinicians should be familiar with child welfare system core values and principles and should elicit and attempt to understand a youth's and/or family's perspective and explanatory model of behavioral health concerns and child welfare system involvement. Child welfare systems value and prioritize a family's right to raise their children and the principle that youth are ideally best raised by their families, and it is considered to be in a youth's best interest to be raised by his or her own family, unless there are compelling reasons to terminate parental rights. Child welfare systems value strengths-based approaches and resilience, and a resilience orientation promotes a strengths-based approach that identifies and enhances protective factors in a youth's ecology. Clinicians using a culturally informed approach attempt to understand youth and families in the context of their culture, some minority groups, including African Americans and American Indians, are overrepresented at each decision point of the child welfare system, youth of color in foster care are underrepresented in accessing mental health services, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning their gender identity or sexual orientation (LGBTQ) youth also are overrepresented in the child welfare system. Many stakeholders endorse a trauma-informed approach; however, there is no single accepted definition of trauma-informed care, and trauma-informed service systems should routinely screen for trauma exposure and symptoms, emphasize safety and resiliency, and have specific training in the impact of maltreatment and recognizing trauma responses, including complex trauma responses; the National Child Traumatic Stress Network Web site provides a Child Welfare Trauma Training Toolkit.

### FIGO position statement on surrogacy: ethical considerations [^bd558adb]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSION

Surrogacy presents complex ethical challenges that require a balanced approach — one that respects the rights and well‐being of the surrogate, the intended parents, and the child. FIGO discourages traditional surrogacy, and advocates for gestational surrogacy practices rooted in informed consent, autonomy, non‐exploitation, and the best interests of all parties involved. Ongoing research, thoughtful policy development, and international collaboration are essential to address the evolving ethical landscape of surrogacy.

FIGO recommends that all countries adopt legislation designed to protect the interests of everyone involved. Such legislation should provide clear guidance for resolving potential disputes, with the welfare of the future child placed at the center of all decision‐making.

This FIGO position statement underscores the importance of ethically sound gestational surrogacy practices that uphold the dignity, rights, and health of all participants. It aims to offer a framework for medical professionals and policymakers navigating the complex ethical dimensions of surrogacy.

4.1 recommendations on ethical surrogacy practices

Gestational surrogacy arrangements should be supported when aligned with ethical principles, including respect for autonomy, informed consent, non‐exploitation, and prioritization of the future child's welfare.
All surrogacy agreements must explicitly prevent exploitation and coercion by ensuring fair compensation and humane contract terms without capitalizing on socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Surrogates must have access to independent legal advice to fully understand their rights and responsibilities.
Comprehensive health care, including physical, psychological, and emotional support, must be provided to the surrogate throughout pregnancy and postpartum. The surrogate should retain autonomy regarding decisions on medical procedures and mode of delivery. Efforts should be made to minimize risks associated with multiple pregnancies.
The welfare and best interests of the future child must remain central to all surrogacy arrangements. Children have the right to know their genetic and birth origins, and protection from discrimination and stigmatization must be explicitly ensured.
Cross‐border surrogacy arrangements require international regulatory frameworks to ensure ethical standards, equitable health care, robust legal protections for surrogates, and protection against exploitation and coercion.

### Welfare-to-work interventions and their effects on the mental and physical health of lone parents and their children [^6a1cc928]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

If we assessed studies included in a meta‐analysis as being at high risk of bias, we downgraded the evidence once. Where a study was deemed to be at very high risk of bias, we downgraded the evidence twice (for instance where severe or systematic attrition was present). The only exception to this was where the study contributed 10% or less of the overall weight of a meta‐analysis, in which case we did not downgrade for very high risk of bias. We downgraded once for inconsistency if I² was greater than 50%, effects were in opposing directions, and we could not identify a plausible explanation for heterogeneity. However, if I² was above 50% but all effects were in the same direction, or if we could identify a plausible explanatory hypothesis, we did not downgrade for inconsistency (Schünemann 2011b). We did not downgrade for risk of bias caused by contamination because since it leads to underestimation of impacts, it is deemed to be of less concern than risk of bias in domains likely to cause overestimated impacts (Higgins 2011a). To assess indirectness, we considered the extent to which the population and setting of the included studies was similar to those of interest for the review, and whether any outcome measures used were indirect or proxy measures.

### Animal research nexus: a new approach to the connections between science, health and animal welfare [^3e15927d]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

Animals used in biological research and testing have become integrated into the trajectories of modern biomedicine, generating increased expectations for and connections between human and animal health. Animal research also remains controversial and its acceptability is contingent on a complex network of relations and assurances across science and society, which are both formally constituted through law and informal or assumed. In this paper, we propose these entanglements can be studied through an approach that understands animal research as a nexus spanning the domains of science, health and animal welfare. We introduce this argument through, first, outlining some key challenges in UK debates around animal research, and second, reviewing the way nexus concepts have been used to connect issues in environmental research. Third, we explore how existing social sciences and humanities scholarship on animal research tends to focus on different aspects of the connections between scientific research, human health and animal welfare, which we suggest can be combined in a nexus approach. In the fourth section, we introduce our collaborative research on the animal research nexus, indicating how this approach can be used to study the history, governance and changing sensibilities around UK laboratory animal research. We suggest the attention to complex connections in nexus approaches can be enriched through conversations with the social sciences and medical humanities in ways that deepen appreciation of the importance of path-dependency and contingency, inclusion and exclusion in governance and the affective dimension to research. In conclusion, we reflect on the value of nexus thinking for developing research that is interdisciplinary, interactive and reflexive in understanding how accounts of the histories and current relations of animal research have significant implications for how scientific practices, policy debates and broad social contracts around animal research are being remade today.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and management of youth involved with the child welfare system [^c4b406c6]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Principle 3 — legal status and consent for care: Clinicians should be aware of a referred child's current legal status, including who has the authority to give consent for evaluation and treatment, and consent should be addressed before the first appointment. Every child and adolescent in foster care has a representative of the state's child welfare agency responsible for managing his or her case, and each step in the child welfare process (e.g., placed but not in court dependency, legal guardianship, shared social services/juvenile justice custody, etc.) has different implications for consent, release of information, and treatment.

Searching other resources

We handsearched the bibliographies of both included and highly relevant publications and reviews, and we contacted the authors of included studies in order to locate unpublished or ongoing research. Since independent research organisations and government departments conduct many evaluations of welfare‐to‐work interventions, we handsearched a large number of relevant websites (see Appendix 3). Websites with search interfaces or searchable databases were searched using terms such as 'lone parent', 'lone parent welfare', 'welfare reform' or 'welfare health'. Otherwise, we screened the relevant publications topic on the website. Where this was possible, we list the number of initial 'hits' from these websites in Appendix 3. We searched a number of websites belonging to research organisations known to conduct research in this area, and in an effort to also locate research conducted outside of North America, we searched websites carrying research sponsored or conducted by the national governments of OECD countries. We only handsearched publications in English.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

Two authors independently screened abstracts and titles of retrieved publications against the inclusion criteria described above. We retrieved the full text of publications appearing to meet the inclusion criteria and independently assessed them for inclusion. We systematically recorded the reasons for exclusion of publications at the second stage of screening. We documented disagreements and resolved them by consensus, with arbitration by a third member of the team if we could not achieve consensus.

### Ethical considerations in xenotransplantation of thoracic organs-a call for a debate on value based decisions [^66e986ef]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

Animal welfare and environmental considerations in xenotransplantation (XTx) — The text contrasts human-to-human donation ethics with XTx, stating that "the conditions for XTx are different", since "Genetically modified animals would be developed and bred for the purpose of supplying organs", with ethical focus on "welfare and the use of humane procedures". It notes there are many additional topics "beyond the scope" here and asks, "Is animal welfare appropriately ensured considering the highly artificial conditions that are necessary to produce animals that would be suitable to supply organs for humans?"

### Harm is all you need? Best interests and disputes about parental decision-making [^86848ec1]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

Reducing indeterminacy

Almost 30 years ago Morenoobserved:

in the case of non-competent patients — those who never have been in a position to develop relevant preferences such as young children some best interests test, founded on the ethical principle of beneficence, seems required. But, in itself, the notion of best interests is vacuous, and so further principles must be invoked in its interpretation.

Rather than specify some of these principles, advocates of the harm threshold seek to simplify the best interests test. Diekema'stying of the threshold to the concept of basic needs is alert to this problem, since an 'objective' list of such welfare needs would answer this criticism — although reaching agreement on the specifics of such a list is problematic. However, harm does not describe all the parental behaviours that merit state intervention, and Diekema errs in suggesting that it does. 'Harm' is a catch-all term with which few could disagree. It captures the wrongness of hitting a child around the head with a saucepan or abusing a child for pleasure. Yet these situations do not represent genuine dilemmas when we would need the guidance of a harm threshold, since almost nobody would argue that such actions were permissible. It is in situations of genuine ethical complexity that a focus on harm becomes inadequate, and, if used in such situations, harm merely frames more complex ethical judgements. Once harm is invested with complexity, unless the complex rules it follows are explained, it becomes open to charges of indeterminacy. All we have done is rename the best interests test while dealing with none of its failings. Moreover, because harm is implicitly evaluative, it is problematic when there is genuine cause to intervene in parental behaviour, but no cause for public condemnation. In fact, I suggest that in these situations the technical language of best interests is actually helpful, precisely because it can house complex concepts without attaching condemnation.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and management of youth involved with the child welfare system [^46c09bd5]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Principle 4 — Referral clarification and scope of services in the child welfare system — Before accepting a referral, the clinician should clarify the circumstances and goals of the referral and the limits of which services can and cannot be provided. Multiple individuals (e.g., parent, child welfare worker, judge) can refer a youth who is involved in the child welfare system for a psychiatric assessment, and clinicians should understand the reason and timing for a referral to psychiatry. Assessment includes that multiple guidelines and federal statutes call for early universal mental health screening of all youth entering the child welfare system, followed by a more comprehensive mental health evaluation for youth who screen positive, and that screening and evaluations must include assessments of trauma exposure and trauma related symptoms using assessment techniques with adequate reliability and validity. Treatment and teamwork include that, as indicated, clinicians can provide ongoing psychiatric care to youth involved with the child welfare system, that when providing clinical care clinicians join the child and family team, and that mental health clinicians working with youth in the child welfare system should coordinate care with caregivers, primary care providers, educators, and other stakeholders. For level-of-care recommendations, clinicians are sometimes asked to provide a recommendation for the level of mental health care and/or treatment intensity to address a youth's mental health needs, and for all youth, but especially for those with a history of maltreatment, clinicians must carefully consider the effects of more restrictive placements and interventions, including seclusion and restraint. For consultation, child welfare agencies and departments increasingly turn to mental health clinicians to provide consultation and/or evaluations for youth in state care and their families, and they can provide consultation to child welfare agency personnel and treating clinicians, case-specific and/or systemic oversight of psychotropic medication use, and education for stakeholders. For psychiatric medication consent and oversight, some jurisdictions place psychiatric medication consent for youth in foster care within a central or regional authority made up of expert clinicians, review and consultation can accompany the psychotropic medication consent, and examples of programs include second opinions, tracking compliance with pertinent policies, and/or expert review of behavioral health care. For forensic assessment, it is critical that clinicians understand the distinction between therapeutic and forensic roles and the difference between a fact witness and an expert witness, and clinicians must be aware there is no known method to determine the veracity of a child's statements, so care must be taken to not overstate one's opinion. For system advocacy, clinicians should advocate for the development of systems that facilitate and promote effective behavioral health care and for the safety, permanency, and well-being of youth involved with the child welfare system.

### Interpretation of population health metrics: environmental lead exposure as exemplary case [^c5f875f0]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Our objective was to gain insight in the calculation and interpretation of population health metrics that inform disease prevention. Using as model environmental exposure to lead (ELE), a global pollutant, we assessed population health metrics derived from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988 to 1994), the GBD (Global Burden of Disease Study 2010), and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the hazard ratio relating mortality over 19.3 years of follow-up to a blood lead increase at baseline from 1.0 to 6.7 µg/dL (10th-90th percentile interval) was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.17–1.60). The population-attributable fraction of blood lead was 18.0% (10.9%-26.1%). The number of preventable ELE-related deaths in the United States would be 412 000 per year (250 000–598 000). In GBD 2010, deaths and disability-adjusted life-years globally lost due to ELE were 0.67 million (0.58–0.78 million) and 0.56% (0.47%-0.66%), respectively. According to the 2017 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development statistics, ELE-related welfare costs were $1 676 224 million worldwide. Extrapolations from the foregoing metrics assumed causality and reversibility of the association between mortality and blood lead, which at present-day ELE levels in developed nations is not established. Other issues limiting the interpretation of ELE-related population health metrics are the inflation of relative risk based on outdated blood lead levels, not differentiating relative from absolute risk, clustering of risk factors and exposures within individuals, residual confounding, and disregarding noncardiovascular disease and immigration in national ELE-associated welfare estimates. In conclusion, this review highlights the importance of critical thinking in translating population health metrics into cost-effective preventive strategies.

### 2020 American Heart Association and American college of cardiology consensus conference on professionalism and ethics: a consensus conference report [^dc083e74]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Principles of professionalism — primacy of patient welfare requires dedication to serving the interest of the patient and that "market forces, societal pressures, and administrative exigencies must not compromise this principle". Patient autonomy requires that physicians "must have respect for patient autonomy", must be honest with patients and empower informed decisions, and that patients' decisions "must be paramount" when in keeping with ethical practice and not demanding inappropriate care. Social justice requires promoting justice in the healthcare system with fair distribution of resources, and physicians "should work actively to eliminate discrimination in health care" across specified social categories.

### What's in it for the animals? Symbiotically considering' therapeutic' human-animal relations within spaces and practices of care farming [^0bf8973d]. Medical Humanities (2019). Medium credibility.

The farms are not passive spaces, but require a level of work and labour to maintain their status, both as a farm, and as a place with a reputation for therapeutic experiences. There are tasks that must be completed to maintain the farm enterprise and uphold a level of care for the animals which are part of that enterprise. Focusing on assuring human well-being diverts time and labour from animal care:

It is a fine balance between making sure that the visitors are getting our utmost care and they always are a priority, but you also have priority of welfare of animals as well Yeah so there'll always be negative sides, and I think also, some days it is a real battle to get everything done, and we think actually, I wish I could have cleaned those chickens out better, or, I wish I could have given them a bit more food that day, but we always do the best we can and like I said, the key thing is always to reach the visitors. (Valerie, care farming project coordinator)

As Valerie describes, with often a finite amount of time to dedicate to this upkeep, the relations between humans and animals become framed and focused around a parasitic exchange that takes away care from the non-human. A focus on optimising the welfare of human participants can result in a converse reduction on animal welfare. The anthropocentric focus here produces a parasitising siphoning which diminishes the totality of relations and opportunities for the non-human actants to instead profit a proliferation of capabilities and capacities for humans. Human needs and desires become dominant over animals. Attempts are made to manage the relations and affects available in an ambition to allow for the place of the farm to act as a vector in affecting the human body's power of acting 49 — in ways which parasitise non-human capabilities. Animals' health and well-being can become neglected in the pursuit of fulfilling positive and healthful relations for the human visitors. Parasitism produces new bodily capacities by seizing and steering the relations available. 67

### Global health equity: evidence for action on the social determinants of health [^39d9ee63]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2008). Low credibility.

More than 30 years ago, the older of us published a paper with the proposal that all scientific papers should start with a statement along the lines of: "These are the opinions on which I base my facts". Why pretend? To take a topical example, if you are on the nature side of the nature/nurture debates, is it likely that your next paper will be an apologia: "I take it all back; genes don't matter at all; it is all environment"? Unlikely. Similarly, if you are on the other side. (We know. It's both.) Here, we are not in any way arguing for a relativist credo that would say opinions are all. Along with other readers of this journal, we spend a good part of our working lives gathering, analysing and interpreting empirical evidence. Evidence matters. But everyone has values and they do affect our positions.

### Decision makers' perceptions on implementing welfare technology in Swedish municipal elder care: a qualitative study [^978aafcc]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The encounter between welfare technology and bureaucratic structures

To ensure sustainable solutions in municipal elder care, participants highlighted the need for long-term strategic implementation strategies, financial support, and encouragement from both political and administrative management. They emphasized the importance of an entire chain perspective, from procurement to usage, to ensure effective integration of welfare technology, leading to more efficient and effective care solutions. The participants emphasized the necessity to identify existing needs, whether for staff or older people, and match these needs with available technologies or developers who can create solutions. Participants stressed that technology should always aim to address real problems and meet existing needs within elder care to be truly effective and meaningful.

"Instead of matching needs to the solutions already available on the open market, we say, 'These are the needs of our end-users. What solutions are available for them?" (Official, small municipality 3).

Small municipalities were portrayed to often lack specialized project managers and resources for new welfare technologies. For example, controllers and IT support are too busy with daily tasks to prioritize projects about welfare technology, causing delays and challenges in managing and implementing welfare technologies. Participants stated that some projects like medication dispensers get stuck in municipal bureaucracy, causing delays in implementation due to the involvement of various stakeholders and the need for substantial investments in terms of economy and staff engagement. The focus on innovation procurement and staying at the forefront of innovation requires a huge commitment to continuously improving and updating the technologies used, to ensure that the best and most effective solutions are available. This commitment was described as greatly challenging for decision-makers, especially in smaller municipalities.

Stricter European and national regulations on digitalization were raised by a few participants as requiring municipalities to actively work on meeting requirements by ensuring the necessary digital infrastructure, while also continuing to progress in welfare technology implementation. Participants also argued that without national regulations and standardized implementation plans, staff may not receive uniform training and support, resulting in varying competencies and potentially impacting the effectiveness of implemented welfare technology:

"We don't really have, what should I say, a very clear implementation plan for welfare technology in general, but each project, if you say implementation project, that plans for the implementation and support, meaning what type of training that is available or how much support that is provided from the project manager or the project group, it largely depends on how big the effort needed is. So, there is no general, implementation strategy". (Official, small municipality 4).

### Family caregivers' involvement in caring for frail older family members using welfare technology: a qualitative study of home care in transition [^f76b98b0]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Recruitment

The management of the home care service had knowledge of the family caregivers who were actively involved in caring for their family members where different types of welfare technology were used. The management contacted, informed, and recruited potential participants by combining their knowledge of the family caregivers with the inclusion criteria and our request for both genders to be represented, different ages and relation to the caregiver. The management did not state how many family members were asked and if any refused to participate; they only informed about the number of participants that accepted the invitation. The management collected signed informed consent forms and passed them to the first author before the interviews. When the management invited potential participants, they told the family members that the study focused on their experiences of user involvement and the care receivers use of welfare technology. A definition of welfare technology was included in the consent form: 'With welfare technology, we think of technical solutions that are adapted to users' needs, for example, safety alarms, door and windows sensors, GPS trackers, digital door locks and various types of robots such as medication dispensers'. The family caregivers also received an information letter about the study to give to the care receiver and asked for their oral consent before the interviews. The caregivers were asked to withdraw if the care receiver did not want them to participate in the study. The first author contacted the participants by phone to schedule the interviews.

To be included in the study as a family caregiver, a person had to be mentioned as the closest family member in the care receivers' electronic medical record. In addition, the caregivers' family members who received home care services had to have used welfare technology for at least six months and be over 65 years old. Eighteen family caregivers participated: eight men and ten women aged 54 to 77 years (average 64). The participants consisted of two spouses, six sons, nine daughters and one sibling.

### Beyond patient-centered care: person-centered care for Parkinson's disease [^ae171b02]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Care, comfort, compassion, and consolation are as important as finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD). For some healthcare professionals, the source of such values is patient-centered carebecause 'The good physician treats the disease; the great physician treats the patient who has the disease'. However, critics of patient-centered care view this model as less a solution than a problem because privileging the welfare of the patient can deny the same attention to the welfare of others, which may impact the quality of patient care they can provide. Under these conditions, patient-centered care can struggle to optimize care of the patient and other healthcare participants. Resolving this concern may require person-centered care.

Calling this latter model, 'people-centered care', the World Health Organization has recognized it as a 'major shift in thinking' and warned against confusing it with patient-centered care. Many health systems nevertheless promote both models of care without distinguishing between them. Therefore, how the models differ and why the differences matter is poorly understood. To address these issues, we apply each model in turn to a hypothetical patient, Ann, before considering its conceptual underpinnings.

### Animal researchers shoulder a psychological burden that animal ethics committees ought to address [^85da85ad]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

For those who find seat belt and motorcycle helmet laws unjustified, this will be an appealing argument, and we accept that our proposal is unlikely to be convincing for them. For the rest, the fact that some lines of work affect the well-being of those doing the work is a legitimate public concern. Moreover, AUB, as we have argued, may affect not just the individuals working with laboratory animals but also their colleagues and broader institutions, as well as the quality of care they provide animals. This would therefore not be a purely paternalistic intervention by AECs focused on self-regarding choices.

The second relates to the moral appropriateness of AUB. Some may argue that harming or killing animals, even if justified, should elicit taxing emotions. To mitigate these would be wrong. This may be spelled out deontologically in terms of what we owe other animals, 5 or through a virtue theory lens as requirements for good character. However, it is not immediately clear what precisely is an appropriate response to justifiably (we are presuming) harming or killing animals in research that has passed ethical review. A case may be made that a sense of gratitude and an appreciation of the sacrifice made of laboratory animals are more fitting, and our proposal is compatible with this line of argument. Moreover, it is compatible with our proposal that those who administer these harms feel some negative emotion towards their actions. Our argument, as highlighted in the Welfare impact of harming animals in research section, focuses on AUB that is significantly disruptive to personnel's welfare and capacity to fulfil their professional roles.

### Evaluating a patient's request for life-prolonging treatment: an ethical framework [^81453c1f]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

(A) If a patient with a realistic understanding of the medical situation requests a treatment that — in the physician's judgement — has a questionable or nil net benefit, the physician should inform the patient that everybody in the healthcare system bears some responsibility for cost-sensitive decisions. The physician should point out to the patient that the requested treatment does provide only a small or no net benefit in this situation, and a lot of resources could be saved if the patient would not insist on the treatment. As a result, competent patients are invited to factor costs into their deliberations, however, they should ultimately be free to opt for the expensive treatment strategy. Hence, in this case, sound autonomy-based reasons take precedence over cost considerations at the bedside.
(B) If patients lack a realistic understanding of their medical situation, and the benefit-harm ratio of the treatment is neither clearly positive nor clearly negative, however, the required resources could play a decisive role. As long as the treatment is inexpensive, the physician may offer it, even if it provides a questionable benefit. However, if the treatment draws heavily on the resource pool (financial, material or staff), cost considerations may justify a unilateral decision to withhold the requested treatment since resource consumption is counterbalanced against neither a clear net benefit nor by sound autonomy-based reasons on behalf of the patient.

It is controversial whether clinicians should inform their patients when they withhold interventions based on cost considerations, and we also acknowledge that healthcare systems differ when speaking of the cost of care, especially with respect to different cultures. For example, physicians in Europe report that they did ration health services on the basis of some small expected benefit, low chances of success and low quality of life. Problematically, it is often done in a covert and unpredictable manner. A more explicit process, like the one proposed here, contributes to the transparency of the underlying reasons of a decision against treatment, and to the patients' awareness about the costs of the requested care. In the long run, physicians should establish a 'culture' of responsibly discussing cost issues with their patients. However, implementing this last step of considerations requires a broader societal consensus about the physician's role in making resource-sensitive decisions at the bedside.

### The capability approach and the WHO healthy ageing framework (for the UN decade of healthy ageing) [^45165e62]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

A third aspect of a capability focus is the CA requires and demands a greater attention to the profound influence of social conditions, from the local to the global, that impact an individual's abilities to pursue or have good quality of life. It is not mere coincidence that researchers of social determinants of health (e.g. illness, disease and death) and health equity advocates have been analysing social inequalities and the social gradient in health in terms of the relative inequalities in the freedoms or opportunities of individuals and groups to live healthy and full lifespans. There is no debate on whether healthcare is a profoundly important aspect of supportive conditions for good health outcomes and capabilities, but healthcare is just one of a wide range of social conditions that can develop, protect, expand, recover, or indeed, constrain and sometimes, extinguish capabilities. This expansion of the scope of analysis beyond the individual body to include surrounding environments when assessing health and wellbeing has been a longstanding pillar of disability advocates and the social model of disability.

A fourth aspect of the CA is the moral or ethical dimension. The approach robustly engages with concepts such as wellbeing, freedom, equality, human rights, social equity and justice. By conceptualising human wellbeing in terms of capabilities, human capabilities become moral goods. They are things that we can agree to ensure for each other as members of a good society or global community. Or, we can think of every human being as having moral rights to a set of basic capabilities that constitute a decent human life. Most national constitutions and international human rights law reflect just such rights to basic capabilities. Seen in these moral terms, and recognising the sheer scale of preventable deaths, disability, mental suffering and constrained lives of older people and others because of unsupportive social choices and policy neglect, the calls for 'health justice' should now make more sense. So many geriatricians, gerontologists, academic panels and others have been identifying the enormous social neglect and harms older people are facing, and sometimes reaching for the language of human rights. The WHO's FA framework and its underlying CA theory provides formidable intellectual resources to support such intuitions, analyses, and advocacy.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and management of youth involved with the child welfare system [^481e1679]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Consent and psychiatric medication authorization in child welfare–involved youth — In some circumstances, courts require their consent for evaluation and/or treatment, and the individual with physical custody might not be able to provide consent because legal custody and/or authority for consent might rest with a child welfare agency, biological parent, or other designated party. Most jurisdictions have specific laws and procedures for prescribing psychiatric medications to youth involved with dependency court, and psychiatric medications should not be prescribed without first obtaining consent from the designated consenting authority, although exceptions can apply in emergencies. Questions about a child's legal status and requests for consent for evaluation and treatment, informed consent, release of information, and coordination of treatment should be directed to the child welfare worker.

### Family caregivers' involvement in caring for frail older family members using welfare technology: a qualitative study of home care in transition [^b21b51c9]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Concerns about inequality

Several participants reflected on the close relationship between the level of services received, the number of follow-up visits from home care service, the availability of welfare technology and well-educated family members with insights or interests in welfare technology advocating for the care receiver.

'I am an engineer by education, so I am all for implementing welfare technology. I read up on everything about it. I always like to ask, and I think that is the reason why we got the technology'.

The participants mentioned that in some situations the home care services did not offer the requested technology. Instead, the health professionals recommended the care receiver or the family caregiver to buy or rent it themselves. However, this was not possible for all families; the cost of buying or renting technology devices was a matter of concern. Since home care services are financed through taxes in Norway, some participants felt that such additional costs placed an unfair burden on them or the care receivers.

### Redefining child protection: addressing the harms of structural racism and punitive approaches for birthing people, dyads, and families affected by substance use [^b0ca2bc5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

There has been growing attention on the effect of substance use, including opioid use disorder, on pregnant and birthing people and their infants. Although effective medication treatment for opioid use disorder is the standard of care, racial disparities are evident in access during pregnancy. Structural racism affects treatment access and approaches to reporting to child welfare services. Black people and their newborns are more likely to be drug tested in medical settings, and Black newborns are more likely to be reported to child welfare services. Child welfare models often focus on substance use as being the dominant issue that drives risk for abuse or neglect of a child, and current reporting practices, which vary by state, contribute to these disparities. This commentary proposes an alternate way of thinking about family-based support. We suggest changes to law, institutional policy, clinical care, and ideology. Specifically, we propose realigning around shared goals of supporting the birthing person-infant dyad and recognizing that substance use is not synonymous with abuse or neglect; creating an anonymous notification process outside of the child welfare system to meet federal data-collection requirements; limiting perinatal drug testing and requiring written, informed consent for parental and neonatal testing; and developing integrated care teams and hospital settings and policies that support dyadic care.

### Deprivations, futures and the wrongness of killing [^53634165]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

In my essay, Why abortion is immoral, I criticised discussions of the morality of abortion in which the crucial issue is whether fetuses are human beings or whether fetuses are persons. Both argument strategies are inadequate because they rely on indefensible assumptions. Why should being a human being or being a person make a moral difference? I argued that the correct account of the morality of abortion should be based upon a defensible account of why killing children and adults is wrong. I claimed that what makes killing us wrong is that our premature deaths deprive us of our futures of value, that is, the goods of life we would have experienced had we survived. This account of the wrongness of killing explains why killing is one of the worst of crimes and how killing greatly harms the victim. It coheres with the attitudes of those with cancer or HIV facing premature death. It explains why we believe it is wrong to kill infants (as personhood theories do not). It does not entail that it wrongs a human being to end her life if she is in persistent vegetative state or if her future must consist only of unbearable physical suffering and she wants to die (as sanctity of human life theories do not). This account of the wrongness of killing implies (with some defensible additional assumptions) that abortion is immoral because we were fetuses once and we know those fetuses had futures of value. Mark Brown claims that this potential future of value account is unsound because it implies that we have welfare rights to what we need to stay alive that most people would reject. I argue that Brown is incorrect in two ways: a welfare right to what we need to stay alive is not directly implied by my account and, in addition, most of us do believe that dependent human beings have substantial welfare rights to what they need to stay alive. Brown argues that depriving us of a future of value of which we have mental representations both is a better explanation of the wrongness of killing and does not imply that abortion is immoral. I reply that (a) if Brown's arguments against my view were sound, those arguments could be easily adapted to show that his view is unsound as well and (b) Brown's view is both ambiguous and unsound on any interpretation. The most popular class of pro-choice argument strategies appeals to the view that some or all fetuses lack either a mental state or function or a capacity for a mental state or function necessary for possession of the right to life. Desires, interests, sentience, various concepts, moral agency, and rationality have all been suggested as candidates for this crucial mental role. Brown's analysis is one member of this class of strategies. I believe that it is possible to show that none of these strategies is reasonable. However, there are so many of these strategies that the required argument demands something more like a book and less like a short essay. The argument of the following essay is a piece of this larger argument.

### Making healthcare decisions in a person's best interests when they lack capacity: clinical guidance based on a review of evidence [^e262f6ce]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Undertaking the best interests process

This second half of the article considers how significant healthcare decisions can be made using the best interests process that has been discussed above. This section covers the range of possible decisions, including those relating to life-sustaining treatments, but it is applicable to all other significant decisions. The supplementary data gives aide memoires to support anyone running or participating in a meeting, covering preparation and the meeting.

Although this section focuses on a best interests meeting, making decisions in someone's best interests really requires a process that encompasses both preparatory work (e.g. collecting and collating information) and actions after the meeting, often including further reviews or meetings.

Initiating the process – recognizing need

The starting point must be to recognize when someone lacks the capacity to make complex healthcare decisions. This is covered in the companion article. If someone lacks capacity, it is usually possible to triage a person into one of four groups:

Definitely lack capacity, are unlikely to recover it soon, and need or will need significant decisions made (including people who never developed capacity);
Are lacking capacity, but: no significant (irreversible and/or risky) immediate decisions are needed, and capacity is likely to be regained before any significant decisions are needed;
Definitely have sufficient capacity to make all necessary decisions some patients will need extra time and help;
Very uncertain whether they have capacity and needs a significant decision to be made. This will include people who have fluctuating capacity

Patients in Group C simply need to be given more time by and support from the clinical team to make an informed decision. Support is not always given, but it is a legal requirement. Patients in Group D will need further assessment, usually by all those involved, and will usually need a meeting both to decide about capacity and to plan further management; if there is an attorney or deputy, they should be involved, as should family and friends.

For patients in Groups A and B, if there is a valid and applicable Advance Decision or an appointed attorney or deputy with the relevant powers in place, then the healthcare team needs to adhere to the Advance Decision or to ask the deputy or attorney to act as decision-maker; if the deputy or attorney does not wish to act as decision-maker, decision-making will revert to the doctor with overall responsibility for the patient's care.

### "It was time I could have spent better"-the barriers, enablers, and recommendations for improving access to financial aid when a child has cancer [^1246e20f]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Enablers

Advocacy, whether carried out by families themselves or through a general practitioner or social worker, was seen as crucial for improving administrative processes (social work participant 3) and addressing families' needs (parents 2, 3, 5). Social work participants indicated that having a designated contact person in government offices has helped address missed applications (social work participant 3), and having welfare officers in their team (funded by a charity) assisted them in managing their workload effectively, staying updated on changing eligibility criteria, connecting families to support services, and adhering to their model of care (social work participant 1).

it's (been) really, really hard for a while but now we've got another worker on board… and the difference that's made is enormous. So I think since then, we've really been able to focus on some people before I just couldn't get to in time; they were going on sometimes 5 weeks before I even got to speak with them, which I felt terrible about. But now I think we're really sticking to our model of care better, focusing more on and taking the time with families, rather than trying to get through a bunch of 6 phone calls in a day because you don't even have time to go to the ward. – social work participant 4, 2 years in current role.

The importance of having a well-staffed welfare team was raised, as navigators are often better equipped emotionally to manage these processes (charity representative 2). Additionally, the social work team have also frequently served as the sole source of financial aid information for many families (parents 2, 3, 7).

I do believe that the role of navigators and nurse consultants that actually stay with the patient from diagnosis, until they're at least in a stable and settled situation, is essential… I had a client say to me this morning, "I don't understand how you all do this. How do you keep up with it all?" And I go, "Because we're not going through what you're going through. We're in a place of being able to manage our time and know what our day holds. You don't have that… cut yourself a little bit of slack, you're in another zone". – charity representative 2, 18 months in current role.

### Stem cell research: paths to cancer therapies and regenerative medicine [^49f62c8d]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Most tissues in complex metazoans contain a rare subset of cells that, at the single-cell level, can self-renew and also give rise to mature daughter cells. Such stem cells likely in development build tissues and are retained in adult life to regenerate them. Cancers and leukemias are apparently not an exception: rare leukemia stem cells and cancer stem cells have been isolated that contain all of the tumorigenicity of the whole tumor, and it is their properties that will guide future therapies. None of this was apparent just 20 years ago, yet this kind of stem cell thinking already provides new perspectives in medical science and could usher in new therapies. Today, political, religious, and ethical issues surround embryonic stem cell and patient-specific pluripotent stem cell research and are center stage in the attempts by governments to ban these fields for discovery and potential therapies. These interventions require physicians and physician-scientists to determine for themselves whether patient welfare or personal ethics will dominate in their practices, and whether all aspects of stem cell research can be pursued in a safe and regulated fashion.

### Ethics considerations for medical device R&D [^bfafa0d6]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Medical devices have emerged as an important clinical option to treat certain serious diseases for which there are no equivalently effective surgical or pharmaceutical alternatives. Although all clinical activities impose high ethical standards of comportment to protect patients, medical device R&D and product application have a number of relatively unique aspects that distinguish them from other technologies such as pharmaceuticals. These include the following: R&D project selection; regulatory requirements, and their intended and unintended effects; when is a new product design sufficiently safe and effective for routine use in patients; and, physician-industry relationships in the innovation process in the context of real or perceived conflict of interest (COI). Each of these factors has implications for the delivery of care, health care leadership, and patient well-being.

KDIGO living kidney donor guideline recommendation grading — within each recommendation, the strength of recommendation is indicated as Level 1 or Level 2, and the certainty of the supporting evidence is shown as A, B, C, or D. Level 1 implies for patients that "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", for clinicians that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and for policy that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 implies for patients that "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", for clinicians that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and for policy that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". Certainty-of-evidence grades are A High ("We are confident that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect".), B Moderate ("The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different".), C Low ("The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect".), and D Very low ("The estimate of the effect is very uncertain, and often it will be far from the true effect".).

### Two roads successful aging model: a new paradigm [^804c9c66]. The Gerontologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Successful aging is a central theme in social gerontology. However, two perspectives have been drawing rebuttals: the paradox of de-ageism in successful aging and the dualist thinking of successful aging theories. This study aims to address the paradox of de-ageism in successful aging and the dualist thinking of successful aging theories. Drawing on critiques on successful aging theories and analysis of the chapter titled, Equalizing Assessments of Things from Zhuangzi's Taoist philosophy, this study proposes a new paradigm called, two roads successful aging, juxtaposed against Eastern and Western theories of aging. The two roads successful aging model claims that everyone can age successfully when they employ the two roads approach. Three principles, with three related attributes, namely, equality, freedom, and being, govern the use of the two roads successful aging paradigm. The implications of the two roads successful aging paradigm can be synthesized as follows: it debunks the myth of the paradox of de-ageism in successful aging; serves as an inclusive East-West paradigm to address the dilemma of dualism in aging theories; and provides a new two roads approach for intergenerational interactions, a two roads successful aging welfare model, and a feasible two roads outlook for coping with aging and aging-related stressors.

### How should doctors approach patients? A confucian reflection on personhood [^dddf514a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

The modern doctor-patient relationship displays a patient-centred, mutual-participation characteristic rather than the former active-passive or guidance-cooperation models in terms of medical decision making. Respecting the wishes of patients, amounting to more than mere concern for their welfare, has become the feature central to certain modern bioethics theories. A group of ethical principles such as respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice has been proposed by bioethicists and widely adopted by many medical societies as an ethical guide to how doctors, in their daily practice, should treat their patients. However, seeing patients as persons who are rational, self-conscious beings capable of valuing their own lives, and who are consequently entitled to the liberty and rights to choose for themselves, is in general the backbone of Western bioethical principles. Since Confucian philosophy has long been a representative of the East-Asia cultural tradition and Confucian bioethics has recently been developed as a theory of applied ethics, examining Confucius's idea of "persons" may shed some light on the current bioethical debates. Confucius's concept of persons, which is best interpreted via his theories of "chun-tze", (the morally ideal person) encapsulating a two-dimensional approach, (the "autonomous person" and the "relational person"), provides a more comprehensive model regarding what a person is and how he/she should be treated. This two-dimensional approach sees a person not only as a rational, autonomous agent but also as a relational, altruistic identity whose self actualisation involves incessant participating in and promoting of the welfare of his fellow persons. Hence this may balance the current bioethical trend whereby "respect for autonomy" often triumphs.

### 'Rhyme or reason?' saying no to mass vaccination: subjective re-interpretation in the context of the A (H1N1) influenza pandemic in Sweden 2009–2010 [^bfde82dc]. Medical Humanities (2015). Low credibility.

Solidarity and/or autonomy — messages and counter messages

Besides the 'bureaucratic reflex', I suggest that the pandemic also caused an emotionally framed reaction rooted in decades of earlier Swedish welfare health politics that had consolidated trust in successful vaccination programmes. This reaction manifested itself in an articulation of solidarity in the argumentation for successful mass vaccination. Angus Dawson has argued that it is very rare that the concept of solidarity is used in public health ethics. In Sweden, however, the solidarity argument was used both as a substantive and rather emotional value and as a procedural value in the decision to recommend vaccination for the whole population. Vaccination was emphasised to protect other people (besides oneself), and the argument implied solidarity as a core value and a building block in public health work. One official explained the solidarity argument:

I think the argument holds. I think it is one of the best arguments for vaccination in society. It is not only to protect other people, you don't know where you will end up next time, maybe you are in the risk group yourself. So it is not only about solidarity. I think it is a rather fine argument, so to speak. (Interview with health official, 26 February 2013).

This quotation shows solidarity to be a combination of 'both cognitive and affective recognition of human interdependencies'. One of the highest-ranking health officials in Sweden commented on the use of emotional arguments:

You really don't want to play with emotions as a governmental authority. That would only be ridiculous. I think we should be very careful not to enter an emotional level.

### Changing the way "we" view and talk about frailty… [^366e10ca]. Age and Ageing (2017). Low credibility.

This commentary discusses the perception of frailty by different key stakeholders-most notably older people. It considers the need to integrate predominantly medically driven understandings of frailty within a wider conceptual framework. This is imperative if the potential of frailty as a construct, around which the optimisation of health and well-being of older people can take place, is to be realised.

### Making healthcare decisions in a person's best interests when they lack capacity: clinical guidance based on a review of evidence [^0b91a66f]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

We can never achieve a complete understanding of how any person would reach a conclusion, nor can we even know all the information a person would use and what importance he would give to each item. Nonetheless, it seems likely that most people will have a general disposition towards a certain style for making decisions and rely on a certain small set of important values or attitudes. Furthermore, to a variable extent, most people will also be influenced by their family and by general social attitudes and values.

If the paragraph above is accepted, then we should accept that, even with incomplete information, we should be able to approximate the relatively few factors a person would rely on, and their general disposition when making decisions. Furthermore, we should acknowledge families' and friends' views and applicable cultural views as relevant, within limits derived from the patient (e.g. taking note of whether the individual has broken with their family's religious or cultural traditions and followed a different path). Among the broader cultural influences to be considered are such matters as respect of the individual, maintaining dignity and consideration of their life's narrative– what sort of life did the person live and how would that influence any decision when considering the potential outcomes.

In conclusion, the best interests approach is an exercise in being as person-centred as possible with all the uncertainties and difficulties that implies. The holistic and person-centred approach was succinctly set out by Mr Justice Charles, who said (para 57) that a best interests test 'requires the decision maker to perform a weighing or balancing exercise between a range of divergent and competing factors' and (para 58) that the decision is influenced by 'the force, clarity or certainty of conclusions' and that 'competing factors will affect the weight to be given to them and that the weighing exercise is not a linear or binary exercise'. Other examples from court judgements can be found on pages 63–64 of recent guidance concerning application of the process to decisions about life-sustaining treatment.

### Consent in the time of COVID-19 [^4a468d08]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In a pandemic, as in other times, doctors should ensure that they offer appropriate medical treatment, based on the needs of an individual. They should aim to provide available treatment that is beneficial and should not offer treatment that is unavailable or contrary to the patient best interests. It is ethical; indeed it is vital within a public healthcare system, to consider distributive justice in the allocation of treatment. Where treatment is scarce, it may not be possible or appropriate to offer to patients some treatments that would be beneficial and desired by them.

Informed consent needs to be individualised. Doctors are obliged to tailor their information to the needs of an individual. We suggest that in the current climate this should include, for most patients, a nuanced open discussion about alternative treatments that would have been available to them in usual circumstances. That will sometimes be a difficult conversation, and require clinicians to be frank about limited resources and necessary rationing. However, transparency and honesty will usually be the best policy.

Theme 2: economic security

While the working families, in general, are critically affected by the economic downturn due to job loss or underemployment under the COVID-19 pandemic, many older adults are retired and receiving social welfare from the government. Compared with those younger working adults, the financial situation of older adults appeared to be more stable. For example, Case F, a 70-year-old man, thought that the social welfare provided by the government made him feel secured under the pandemic.

"(It seems that you are quite optimistic. Do you think so? And why?) Well, indeed I am not a typical optimistic person. One thing is crucial to me. It is economy security. There is no need to be rich, but economically stable. I usually tell my friends you can go gambling, but do not lose all your money. I mean, at least we should keep some money in hand. We are all older adults, we can get old age allowance from the government. This makes us feel safe". (Case F, male, 70, public housing)

Another retired older adult, Case B, also thought that he did not need to worry under the pandemic because he received stable income from the government.

"The government gives me money to buy facial masks. (Social security?) I am a retired civil servant and I get pension from the government every month. That is why I do not have financial worry. (Do you think the economic downturn may affect your pension?) I don't think so". (Case B, male, 68, elderly home)

### Justification of principles for healthcare priority setting: the relevance and roles of empirical studies exploring public values [^d8f403a8]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

The notion of reflective equilibrium

Reflective equilibrium is primarily a theory about what makes moral judgements epistemically justified; however, it is often related to as a method for moral reasoning. 3 Moreover, it is sometimes used to denote the goal or endpoint of such a process, namely where moral judgements cohere (and then, supposedly, are justified). Since it is doubtful that one ever reaches such an ideal state, as also acknowledged by Rawls, it is more appropriate to think about the goal of the process of moral reasoning as arriving at 'resting points' rather than 'end-points'. In the following, we shall primarily relate to reflective equilibrium as a theory about epistemic justification of the moral judgements in a given resting point. That being said, any such theory will be closely related to the method of moral reasoning according to which one arrives at that resting point.

The process of reflective equilibrium is a working back and forth between: (a) one's considered moral judgements about particular cases, and (b) ethical principles. In the following, we shall illustrate the process by dividing it into four separate steps. We primarily structure the process in these separate steps for clarificatory reasons, in practice the steps will often interplay.

Identifying and filtering judgements — first step

The first step may be described in the words of Tersman: it '… begins with filtering one's moral views so that one is left only with those qualifying as considered judgements… ' (p. 47). 4 For a judgement to qualify as a considered, rather than a raw unreflected moral judgement, it should meet a number of requirements. It should be of the kind in which one has strong faith, that one has the relevant information about and it should not be best explained by one's self-interest or prejudices (more on such filtering below).

Formulating principles — second step

The second step is to formulate ethical principles that can account for the considered judgements. These principles may vary in their degree of specificity, they may be of the general kind such as 'euthanasia is wrong' or more specified such as 'euthanasia is wrong when offered to patients who are not terminally ill'. Note that the considered moral judgements may also vary in their degree of specificity. Accordingly, there is no clear-cut line between what qualifies as a considered moral judgement and what qualifies as an ethical principle.

### Barriers to providing internet-based home care services for urban older adults in China: a qualitative study of the service providers [^4bbb5cb0]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Communication barriers

Service providers think that most older adults and their family members are very friendly in communication, but conflicts also occur sometimes, blocking the services supply process. Domestic workers and nursing workers experience these negative experiences many times during their home visits:

Some older people and their children think it (Home Care Service Voucher) is a free service that they can use at no expense. They make me do everything exceeding the amount of the voucher… I had to explain repeatedly, and some didn't listen to me, thinking I was cheating… This kind of customer is too troublesome. (Participant 13, domestic worker)

Some of the free services are targeted at a specific demographic. However, some families are not aware of the eligibility requirements of welfare beneficiaries, making judgment only by subjective comparison with the beneficiaries. In this way, many families think they should also receive free services. In order to obtain these services, they repeatedly communicate with the center manager and staffs through "complaint", "comparison" and other ways. This kind of behavior also adds many additional communication problems for center managers and center staff:

Some families come to us because they think they are poor, but others have free services, and they do not. It's not our decision, and we have to explain it over and over again. (Participant 1, center staff)

Career dissatisfaction

In addition to the barriers mentioned above, staff members' dissatisfaction with their careers inhibits quality service provision. They think that the salary is low and unstable, the task at hand is heavy, social acceptance of their occupation is poor, and there is no professional value, so they are not enthusiastic about the work (Table 2).

### Long-term care provision and the well-being of spousal caregivers: an analysis of 138 European regions [^dd4d9946]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Regarding the behavioral pathway, research showed that when formal long-term care options were available, care tasks differed in character and intensity because informal caregivers took over the less intense and spontaneous support tasks (voluntarily) and formal caregivers fulfilled the more demanding and regular duties.found that instrumental support from professional home care services was connected to caregivers' well-being by reducing the hours spent providing care. Furthermore, research found that formal home care does not substitute for informal care but that the relationship is often complementary and that the welfare state context affects the amount of informal care provided.

Concerning the cognitive-emotional pathway, experimental research showed that experiencing a sense of control had a positive effect on health and well-being, especially in old age. for example, found that relocation to a nursing home was experienced as less stressful when the older people had control over the move. So far, few studies have explicitly focused on the role of control in care givers ' well-being:showed that freedom in the decision whether to take over care was linked to higher caregiver well-being. A second study showed that perceived control over the care situation was directly related to higher life satisfaction and less depression and indirectly related to lower stress of caregivers.

All in all, there is a limited body of research on contextual effects on caregivers' well-being on the country level and, to the best of our knowledge, no analyses on the regional level. Studies tend to focus on the behavioral pathway whereas there is little research analyzing the cognitive-emotional pathway (perceived control) in the care context. We will thus focus on the cognitive-emotional pathway by analyzing the concept of "control" as an important mediator of the links between contexts and caregiver well-being. We expect that the well-being of spousal caregivers is higher in regions with many formal care services than in regions with low formal care provision, partly due to higher perceived control. We will analyze whether the connection between LTC context and well-being is affected by caregivers' perceived control, and whether the extent of control that caregivers perceive is linked to the LTC availability in a region.

### To nudge or not to nudge: cancer screening programmes and the limits of libertarian paternalism [^f2226e3f]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2012). Low credibility.

'Nudging — and the underlying idea 'libertarian paternalism' — to an increasing degree influences policy thinking in the healthcare sector. This article discusses the influence exerted upon a woman's choice of participation in the Danish breast screening programme in light of 'libertarian paternalism'. The basic tenet of 'libertarian paternalism' is outlined and the relationship between 'libertarian paternalism' and informed consent investigated. Key elements in the process of enrolling women into the Danish mammography screening programme are introduced. It is shown that for several reasons the influence exerted upon women's choices of participation cannot be justified within a welfare-enhancing libertarian paternalistic framework. The article suggests that screening programmes alternatively adopt a liberty-enhancing approach and considers the practical implications of this alternative.

### Making healthcare decisions in a person's best interests when they lack capacity: clinical guidance based on a review of evidence [^89af26ef]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

For each decision, the factors that need to be considered include the following:

The person's beliefs, wishes, feelings, values and any other factors they would consider if they were able to do so.
Their current quality of life, best broken down into Personal experiences; pain, distress, pleasure and happiness Functional autonomy; the behaviours and goals within their capacity Social interaction; roles, availability of others to interact with Meaning in life; having future expectations and wishes.
Their potential future quality of life (as they would see it) judged on same features Including the effect of any possible change in placement.
The effect of any intervention, or stopping of any intervention, considered in probabilistic terms covering Risks, pain, time taken, distress etc, set against Effect on one or more aspects of quality of life, broken down as above Length of life.

In principle, each decision should be articulated as what the person would decide, were they able to, given the facts about their situation, prognosis and treatment considered at the meeting.

At the end of the meeting it is vital to:

State explicitly what has been decided, checking that all agree and understand If there was disagreement, then the reasons behind the decision must also be made explicit publicly.
Either, if there is agreement confirm: What actions will follow, including Who will undertake them, and when by When the next meeting will be specifying
Either a date, time and place,
Or an event that will precipitate a meeting
Or, in the case of disagreement, specify what the next steps will be, usually one or more of: Obtaining further information and/or a further opinion, and/or Involving a mediation expert, and/or Starting the process of involving the Court of Protection.
Confirm that a documented record will be written and distributed to all present, and agree who else will get a copy.

But then we must also see EA for what it is, and frankly discuss its normative claims, its potential shortcomings, and the ways in which it might perpetuate injustice despite its best intentions. Our aim should not simply be to do good better, but to do better justly.

### Beyond costs and benefits: understanding how patients make health care decisions [^6c9e4ec0]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

Many medical decisions are "preference sensitive", where the best choice depends on the values a specific patient places on relevant outcomes. For example, a decision may require a patient to make a trade-off between a small increase in chance for survival and a large out-of-pocket expense. In such situations, patients need to understand the costs and benefits of the health care alternative, in order to decide the best course of action. However, findings from decision science research have demonstrated that people's decisions are often influenced not only by their perceptions of these costs and benefits, but also by subtle contextual factors that trigger intuitive and emotional decision processes. In this article, I describe some of these contextual factors, and lay out the challenges these factors raise for clinicians' efforts to help their patients make informed decisions.

### Evaluating a patient's request for life-prolonging treatment: an ethical framework [^a9cbc273]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

Five guiding questions to approach conflicts about limiting treatment

Decisions about medical treatments require both medical expertise and value judgements. Therefore, a dissent between patient and physician about what is the best course of action can result either from medical (factual) or normative (evaluative) aspects of the decision. One main goal of this article is to distinguish these two dimensions and to propose practical criteria that can guide decisions about patients' requests for life-prolonging treatments. These criteria are: the expected effectiveness of the intervention in question, the benefit-harm ratio of the intervention, and the patient's understanding of his or her medical situation. Under conditions of scarcity, resources required for the treatment may also play a role in the decision, especially if the treatment has a low likelihood of success or an unfavourable benefit-risk ratio. These criteria need careful evaluation and are therefore built into an ethical decision model with five guiding questions. The starting point is a situation in which a competent patient requests a treatment that might be perceived as inappropriate by the healthcare team (figure 1). We do not include proxy requests for incompetent patients because surrogate decision making requires other ethical considerations and decision processes. However, the family is often involved in the patient's decision-making process and is, therefore, considered throughout the decision pathway.

Figure 1
Systematic ethical decision model with five guiding questions for situations in which patients request a treatment that might be perceived as inappropriate by the healthcare team (see explanation of the guiding questions in the text). *Implementing this last step of considerations requires a broader societal consensus about the physician's role in making resource-sensitive decisions at the bedside.

### The right not to know and the obligation to know [^bbf4db5b]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

However, this position does not rule out all moral constraints on individual citizens in their pursuit of the good life. In particular, we may still hold that in our free actions, individual citizens have an obligation to reduce where reasonable the costs to others in society. If I face two possible ways of pursuing my goals, and one involves imposing greater burdens on the rest of society, it is consistent with liberal political values to say that I ought to choose the less burdensome option. Note that the argument is importantly not that anyone has the right to force me to pursue the less burdensome method of pursuing my reasonable goals. As I detail further on, there are many things that I have a moral obligation to do or refrain from doing, but which nobody has a right to force me to do, or coercively prevent me from doing. For instance, I ought not knowingly give misleading directions to tourists, and I ought not snap at innocent questions from my children just because I have had a bad day. But while people might morally condemn or chastise me for these behaviours, nobody ought to force me to act differently.

In some cases, patients who refuse relevant medical information will make their health problems worse, more complicated and more expensive to treat. If such patients live in a society that provides publicly funded healthcare, and they make a claim for such care (as they have every right to do), then their initial refusal of information has increased the overall costs to the rest of society. When their refusal of information was unreasonable (I discuss this below), then they have violated a moral obligation not to unreasonably impose burdens on others. However, this does not mean that anyone is entitled to force them to hear the relevant information. While there might be some levels of burden that would justify this latter choice, there is no reason to suppose that the two levels — that is, the degree of burden at which one has a moral obligation not to impose it, and the degree at which others have a right to stop you imposing it — are the same.

### Where the ethical action is [^e0fcff95]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

It is common to think of medical and ethical modes of thought as different in kind. In such terms, some clinical situations are made more complicated by an additional ethical component. Against this picture, we propose that medical and ethical modes of thought are not different in kind, but merely different aspects of what it means to be human. We further propose that clinicians are uniquely positioned to synthesise these two aspects without prior knowledge of philosophical ethics.

### Ethics and the 2018 practice guideline on disorders of consciousness: a framework for responsible implementation [^e430983d]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

In framing costs, it is also important for clinicians to avoid biased assumptions about futility. The concept of futility is important to evidence-based medicine, as it can support withholding medically ineffective treatment and facilitate dialogue with families about end-of-life decisions. But the meaning of futility might differ from the vantage point of clinicians and families. Clinicians are often justified in making futility judgments when the requested intervention departs from standards of care, but this is complicated when standards are evolving. A different interpretation of futility might be consonant with value-laden assumptions about the worth of continued treatment. These sorts of judgments may conflate questions of futility with health care rationing.

Clinicians should therefore be exceptionally careful to avoid futility pronouncements when discussing costs. Families might have nonmedical reasons for requesting interventions irrespective of cost or clinical recommendations (e.g. decisional balance skewed toward optimism or cultural preferences). Clinicians do not need to acquiesce to these requests. But unreflective responses may lead families to think that clinicians have negative attitudes toward their loved ones; that their lives are "not worth" the cost of continued care. This can undermine communication with the clinical team and have a lasting negative impact on how families view health systems generally.

### Australian football league concussion guidelines: what do community players think? [^986f7328]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Preventing concussion in sport is a global challenge. To assess community-level adult male Australian Football players' views on following the Australian Football League's (AFL) concussion guidelines.

Methods

3 focus groups, each comprising 6 players from 1 regional league, were conducted until saturation of issues raised. Discussions followed a semistructured script and were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was conducted by 2 coders independently.

Results

Identified advantages of the guidelines included highlighting the seriousness of concussion; changing the culture around playing with concussion and shifting return-to-play decision responsibility from players to others. Disadvantages included players being removed from play unnecessarily; removal of players' rights to decide if they are fit to play and players changing their behaviours to avoid being removed from play. Identified facilitators to guideline use included local league enforcement; broad information dissemination and impartial medically trained staff to assess concussion. Identified barriers to guideline use included players' desire to play at all costs; external pressure that encouraged players to return to play prematurely; and inconvenience and cost.

Conclusions

Players generally understand that the AFL concussion guidelines protect their long-term welfare. However, their desire to play at all costs and help their team win is a common barrier to reporting concussion and adhering to guidelines. Leagues should take a lead role by mandating and enforcing the use of the guidelines and educating coaches, game day medical providers and players. The return-to-play component of the guidelines is complex and needs further consideration in the context of community sport.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and management of youth involved with the child welfare system [^7753ba8e]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Child welfare policy history — key U.S. statutes shaping foster care include the following elements: In 1909, the first White House Conference on the Care of Dependent Children recommended family foster care rather than orphanages. All states have statutes requiring that the child's best interests be considered in at least some aspect of child welfare decision making, although no standard definition exists and the term generally refers to the primacy of the child's safety and well-being. The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 mandates that, if possible, a tribal court will hear all child welfare cases involving American Indian children and also sets specific placement guidelines to preserve cultural identity. The Social Security Act of 1935 first established national standards and provides federal grants to states. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (PL 96–272) created the Title IV-E program and requires a permanency hearing within 18 months of entry into foster care. The Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994 (PL 103–382) prohibits delaying, denying, or otherwise discriminating in foster/adoption placement decisions based on race, color, or national origin. The 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act (PL 105–89) modifies Title IV-E to establish 3 national goals — safety, permanency, and youth well-being — and the Foster Care Independence Act, signed into law in 1999, provides more funding and flexibility to help youth transition to self-sufficiency.

### How economics could extend the scope of ethical discourse [^e8d6a8e4]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

Ethical discourse is typically inconclusive, and with good reason. But this inconclusiveness is a distinct disadvantage when it comes to helping publicly accountable policy-makers in the health care system provide an ethical justification for their decisions. It is suggested that instead of ending with platitudinous statements such as that a balance has to be struck between the rival ethical considerations, empirical research should be undertaken to elicit the quantitative trade-offs that the affected general public would be prepared to accept when striking this balance. In the expected absence of any consensus, it is further suggested that the views of the median person be taken as the best approximation to the group view. Finally it is argued that, far from this quantitative approach lacking humanity by treating individuals as "mere statistics", it shows greater compassion than the proponents of those approaches whose fellow feeling can only be stirred by information pertaining to identified individuals.

### Medical futility procedures: what more do we need to know? [^104a764f]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Unilateral medical futility policies, which allow health-care providers to limit or withdraw life-sustaining treatment over patient or surrogate objections, are increasingly designed around a procedural approach. Medical or ethics committees follow a prespecified process, the culmination of which is a justified decision about whether ongoing treatment should be withheld or withdrawn. These procedures have three stages. First, health-care providers must decide to refer patients for consideration of whether ongoing treatment is futile. Second, the committees involved must decide whether ongoing treatment is actually futile. Third, there is a clinical outcome that often is, but not always, patient death. We review the available data on procedure-based futility policies, arguing that there is limited information on their potential harms and how these harms are distributed. We consider the ethical implications of policy-making under informational uncertainty, invoking the precautionary principle — in the absence of clear data, if a policy has significant risk of significant harm, the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those recommending the policy — as the guiding moral standard for hospitals and professional organizations considering whether to adopt a procedural approach to medical futility. On the basis of this principle, we argue that any new futility guideline must include a significant commitment to collecting prospective data on its application.

### 'A contradiction between our state and the tobacco company': conflicts of interest and institutional constraints as barriers to implementing article 5.3 in Bangladesh [^c8126dc5]. Tobacco Control (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bangladesh has not yet adopted measures to implement Article 5.3 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The National Tobacco Control Cell (NTCC) has drafted a guideline for implementation, but progress has stalled amid high levels of tobacco industry interference in public policy. This paper examines the barriers to minimising industry interference in a context of close relationships between government officials and tobacco companies.

Methods

In-depth interviews were conducted with government officials, representatives from civil society, think tank and media organisations, and academic researchers. The data were analysed using a '3 Is' framework developed within the political sciences, emphasising the interactive role of ideas, interests and institutions in policy change.

Results

The findings indicate that policy ideas about protecting public health policy making from tobacco industry interests are largely restricted to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and the NTCC specifically. Both individual and institutional conflicts of interest emerge as key barriers to progress to minimising industry interference and for tobacco control governance more broadly. The data also suggest that development of an Article 5.3 guideline has been shaped by the perceived interests of political actors and institutions, and the institutional position of the NTCC, constrained by limits on its resources, authority and isolation from other ministries.

Conclusion

NTCC's initiatives towards implementing Article 5.3 constitute an important opportunity to address conflicts of interest that restrict tobacco control in Bangladesh. Progress in minimising industry interference is essential to realising the commitment to being smoke free by 2040.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^1777a63c]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) recommendations — rating framework and implications are defined as follows: "Within each recommendation, the strength of recommendation is indicated as Level 1, Level 2, or Not Graded, and the quality of the supporting evidence is shown as A, B, C, or D". Level 1 ("We recommend") implies for patients that "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", for clinicians that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and for policy that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 ("We suggest") implies for patients that "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", for clinicians that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and for policy that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". The additional category "Not Graded" "was used, typically, to provide guidance based on common sense or where the topic does not allow adequate application of evidence", and "are generally written as simple declarative statements, but are not meant to be interpreted as being stronger recommendations than Level 1 or 2 recommendations". Evidence quality meanings are: A (High) — "We are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect". B (Moderate) — "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different". C (Low) — "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect". D (Very low) — "The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often will be far from the truth".

### Toward a more comprehensive concept of successful aging: disability and care needs [^dfbd79bb]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Proposition 6: Care Related Strategies and Resources for Successful Aging When Facing Disability and Care Needs

When an older person experiences the transition into a situation of frailty, this is for the traditional notion of successful aging, the opposite of success. Not only the scientific discourse, but also everyday and political discourse on frailty and need of care have been characterized by the concept of burden: Being in need of care is seen as a burden to the person, caring as a burden on informal and formal caregivers, and funding long-term care as a burden on society. The preconditions for successful aging in long-term care have been rarely analyzed.

Broadening the perspective and taking theories on care and nursing into account might change this perception. When looking at the concept of care — the provision of support which is necessary for someone's protection, health, and welfare — it is crucial that care always implies a relationship between a care recipient and a care provider. Theories of care (e.g.;) differ in their focus, but they converge in emphasizing the relevance of the relationship between care provider and care recipient who interact in supporting self-determination and well-being of the care recipient. As a consequence, successful aging might not only describe an individual achievement (maintaining one's health, functioning, and participation into old age) but also a joint endeavor of a care receiver and a care provider, striving to maintain self-determination and quality of life of an older person with care needs.

Similarly, care ethics — a moral philosophy strongly anchored in a feminist tradition — starts with the observation that interrelatedness and dependency are universals in human development. The needs and preferences of both caregivers and care receivers have to be respected when caring for individuals with disabilities and care needs. For aging individuals with care needs, successful aging could be seen as the outcome of a joint process of caregiver and care recipient based on a process in which caregivers provide care in an attentive, responsible, and competent manner and care receivers respond to these acts of support. This even applies to end-of-life care: Protecting autonomy, dignity and well-being while caring for a dying person is essential in psychosocial approaches to care. It may indeed be seen as the societal litmus test of successful aging. In this sense, "successful dying" is not an oxymoron, but a necessary element of successful aging (cf.).

### The limits of shared decision making [^11c5f068]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The foundation of shared decision making (SDM) is the view that people should be aware of relevant choices, and that their personal views, priorities and preferences are relevant factors when determining action. The degree to which people wish to engage in decisions will vary, as will the level to which they will be made aware that decisions exist, or become informed about the relevant information. There is increasing interest in SDM, an ethical imperative, and supporting evidence that well-designed tools help people compare options and make more informed choices. We as authors, are strong advocates of SDM, and think the approach can be applied widely, perhaps more widely than many health professionals think possible.

Nevertheless we have identified situations where we consider there to be clear limits to SDM, where wider interests can override the priority given to individual preferences. While we think individual priorities and preferences should be respected where possible, there are situations where other factors determine decisions.

We feel it is essential to make these situations clear. SDM can be too easily dismissed as an impossible ideal if we do not acknowledge that the approach has limitations. In addition, delineating exceptions will serve to illustrate the demarcation between what can be thought of as the pinnacle of patient-centred care and situations where the approach is rightly constrained by ethical, professional or societal factors.

First, let's agree that decisions come in different forms: some are conscious and episodic, as in 'Shall I have this procedure?'. Some are the result of commitment decisions, such as when agreeing to take medication for a long-term illness. Others go unnoticed in conversations, such as when a clinician suggests a solution and results in assumed acceptance. Such subtle decisions may well occur because of deference to an expert or an unwillingness to disagree.SDM makes the process of determining decisions more explicit, and in healthcare the skills of supporting people to become aware, consciously deliberate, and arrive at better-considered decisions, whether for irreversible or continuous actions, are of utmost value. The steps suggested to achieve SDM have been extensively described elsewhere.

### Patients' priorities for health research: focus group study of patients with chronic kidney disease [^06547757]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The inclusion of consumer preferences in prioritizing research topics is widely advocated, but prioritization is driven largely by professional agendas.

Methods

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were purposively sampled from four kidney dialysis and transplant centres in Australia to participate in nine focus groups (three each for pre-dialysis, dialysis and transplant patients), which were conducted from July 2006 to September 2006. Each involved 6–8 participants. Transcripts were coded and thematically analysed to identify recurrent research topics and the participants' reasons for their choices.

Results

Participants suggested eight research priorities: prevention of kidney disease, better access to and improvement in kidney transplantation, reduction of symptoms of CKD and complications associated with treatment, new technological therapies, psychosocial aspects of living with CKD, whole body not organ-specialized care, and improvement in dialysis and caregiver support. Five major reasons for the selections were identified: normalization of life (developing therapies and regimens that fit into daily living), altruism (considering the welfare of others before personal needs), economic efficiency (channelling resources for maximum economic gain), personal needs (preferences based on feelings, values, personal needs) and clinical outcomes (improving health states and the physiological condition of patients with CKD).

Conclusions

A patient-focused research agenda is possible to elicit for CKD, and by inference for other healthcare issues. Unlike researchers who focus on specific interventions and questions, consumers think in terms of broad themes and quality of life outcomes. Effective methods for translating a patient-focused agenda into research priority setting and resource allocation are now needed.

### Challenges and improvements associated with transitions between hospitals and care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study with care home and healthcare staff in england [^c65cf423]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Creating fear

Many participants understood at an emotional level how infection control practices including wearing PPE had induced fear in care homes: 'I think it's quite an invasive process, as well, for the client, which I think can be quite difficult because, when they come in, we have to wear full body suits and things like that, and masks, and visors, and gloves, and all the full PPE… They're probably thinking, like, "What on earth is going on?" It must be so scary for them' (Care Staff — P25a). The pressure to discharge patients quickly was sometimes executed with a lack of respect for patient welfare and in demeaning circumstances (i.e. invasive infection control protocols and quarantining) creating fear amongst patients transitioning. Many participants viewed poor communication with the patient at the point of discharge as causing unnecessary stress and fear.

### "I' D recommend… " how to incorporate your recommendation into shared decision making for patients with serious illness [^34db4943]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2018). Low credibility.

Patients and families facing serious illness often want and need their clinicians to help guide medical decision making by offering a recommendation. Yet clinicians worry that recommendations are not compatible with shared decision making and feel reluctant to offer them. We describe an expert approach to formulating a recommendation using a shared decision-making framework. We offer three steps to formulating a recommendation: 1) evaluate the prognosis and treatment options; 2) understand the range of priorities that are important to your patient given the prognosis; and 3) base your recommendation on the patient's priorities most compatible with the likely prognosis and available treatment options.

### Best practices in the development and use of experimental models of bacterial pneumonia: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^2ea4edc9]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2025). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop — analgesia and supportive care in pneumonia animal models — states that pain management is always an important ethical consideration in pneumonia research and that researchers must consider how analgesic medications can impact outcomes. The report explains that opioids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents are well known to depress respiratory function and alter immune responses and may have systemic and off-target effects, and therefore when possible adjusting experimental design to account for the use of analgesic agents should be considered. It adds that opioid analgesic agents are rarely given in human clinical medicine for pneumonia symptom relief, and if immune parameters are an outcome measure of importance, supportive care may be a better choice for refinement and could include subcutaneous fluids, wet food, and heating pads; for institutions without standing animal care and use committees, the ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines can be used as a good starting point and note that an animal use bioethics panel can be recommended even if not required.

### Designing clinical practice guidelines for equitable, inclusive, and contextualised care [^e3216bb8]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Naming gaps and targeting innovation

Current European CPGs include few sex/gender specific recommendations, and their applicability beyond high income country settings is limited. To prevent these limitations, CPG processes must build on resource awareness and contextual relevance from the outset. Target groups and implementation settings should be interwoven into the development process (fig 3) in alignment with approaches from the public health field — for example, the World Health Organization's INTEGRATE framework, which integrates human rights and equity considerations into decision making. Checklists for under-represented aspects should be adopted throughout the process to ensure attention to under-represented groups and settings.

Importantly, CPGs must not only inform clinical care but also guide future research and retrospectively evaluate which relevant aspects have been ignored. If clinical trials under-represent, for example, women, CPGs cannot incorporate this information even though it might be essential for tailored care. CPGs should clearly flag these gaps as limitations and signal them as priority research needs, in line with AGREE II's domain 3 (rigour of development). These research gaps could then be transformed into funding calls through partnerships between guideline developers, national research councils, and innovation funders.

Resource intensive recommendations could be stratified according to relevant economic, logistic, and practical aspects, offering a stepwise process tailored to opportunity and priority. Aspects to take into account could be national gross income and available global and human resources for healthcare delivery and logistics, as well as gender budgeting considerations in line with AGREE II domain 5 (applicability). Exploratory approaches to develop "context tailored" recommendations are under way and could inform these developments.

### Ethics and healthcare worker exposure considerations… [^23e44e43]. CDC (2023). Medium credibility.

Ethics and Healthcare Worker Exposure Considerations Ethics is a generic term that covers several different ways of examining, understanding, and applying moral principles that guide behavior and actions to address specific problems or dilemmas. Ethical principles provide guidance for how people reason, problem-solve, and respond. Codes of ethics from professional societies have existed, in some cases, for over 200 years such as that of the American Medical Association and nearly 100 years for the American Nurses Association. Once established, healthcare–related societies typically develop a code of ethics or code of conduct for providers to use to guide practice and ethical decision-making. It is important to note that ethical principles and codes of ethics are not legal requirements and are not public policy documents.

Basic ethical principles provide guidance for healthcare workers to protect the rights of individuals and support an ethical culture for safety, health, and well-being for all. There are four basic principles: autonomy; nonmaleficence; beneficence; and justice.

### Development of the "living well" concept for older people with dementia [^f0eaa642]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Social relationship dimensions

The social relationship dimensions included "maintaining social relations and community connectivity" and "government support". The first attribute comprised support from the primary caregiver, social engagement, and relationship building. Participants felt that the support of the family primary caregiver significantly impacted their ability to live well. However, some older people with dementia were concerned regarding the primary caregiver's support load. Participants thought it was necessary to maintain and participate in a participatory and active life, and have community connectivity.

"I am not good at talking, and it is hard for me to recognize people, but my wife does everything. I think it is good to be with my wife and live happily with her for the rest of my life". (Older people 2).

"Even though I cannot help my children, it is a parent's duty not to burden them. I think I am blocking the future of my sons and daughters". (Older people 3).

Government support included facilities for older people with dementia, financial support, and professional workforce support. Notably, families and nurses — rather than older people with dementia — were aware of the importance of receiving support via a social welfare system, such as facilities that can alleviate the financial burden of older people with dementia and caregivers who can provide sufficient specialized services.

"I think the Ministry of Health and Welfare should provide a lot of support to geriatric hospitals like ours so that older people with dementia can live well, and provide workforce support so that more people can work to ensure the older people with dementia can receive care with dignity". (Nurse 3).

### Relational solidarity and conflicting ethics in dementia care in urban India [^f4499e86]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Relational Solidarity and Care

Bruce,) developed the concept of relational solidarity to argue that our lives and agency are interconnected with the well-being, health, and dignity of others and that these interdependent relationships are responsible for sustaining care.describes these relational practices of solidarity and care as ways to overcome malignant psychologies that dehumanize people with dementia.) made a similar point in his conceptualizing of person-centered care, arguing that to deny the humanity of a person with dementia and fail to acknowledge them was afflicting a form of social death on them. Thus, a relational approach includes mutual recognition, empathy, and concern with those who are more vulnerable, alongside a commitment to give them respect, support, and advocate for their needs. Solidarity is about affirming the rights and dignity of others; care is about being attentive to their welfare, suffering, and vulnerability.

In focusing on relational solidarity and care, attention is given to how ethical principles such as autonomy, equality, dignity, and personhood are interpreted in everyday practices. This is done via examining how an individual's agency is affected by their interactions and interdependencies with others, and the impact of institutional power, sociocultural meanings, and local lifeworlds on these interactions. This mode of theorizing looks at ethical practice rather than assuming that ethical principles are static, universally understood, and consistently applied across institutions and societies.

By examining how ethical practices are applied over time, the tensions and contradictions involved in such actions are also revealed as past histories and imagined future inform practices of solidarity and care. So do authority, power, distribution, and exchange as well as values of goodness and rightness.contend that not everyone subscribes to the same types or understandings of relational practices of solidarity and care in pluralistic, liberal democratic societies and that many policies and practices are "subject to the political business of competing moral claims" (p. 380).makes the further point that the success of relational practices of solidarity and care is very much contingent on a suitably resourced, skilled, and appropriately rewarded care staff, not just idealized notions of personhood and care.

### Randomised placebo-controlled trials of surgery: ethical analysis and guidelines [^5e9662d2]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

The moral of the story is that if the risk of serious side effects is low, then the chance a treatment is efficacious can be low for it to be justified from the patient's perspective (the issue of distributive justice and resource allocation is a separate issue). Thus, it is rational to take statins, provided that the side effects are low. (At best, they probably lower the chance of a fatal event by about 1%.) The chance that any individual will have his or her life saved by a statin is incredibly low, but because the alternative is death, it is rational to take them.

Where the risk of serious side effects of a treatment is small, and the condition the person suffers from is serious, even very low levels of confidence would make it rational to accept the treatment. The balance between risks and benefits occurs when the expected utility of the treatment equals the expected utility of not taking it; in this example, if there is a 1/10 000 chance the treatment works. As the risk of side effects increases, or as the severity of the underlying condition decreases, the level of confidence should rise. Thus paradoxically, in the case of life-enhancing surgery for increase in function or reduction of symptoms, higher levels of confidence of efficacy are required than for interventions into life-threatening conditions. That is, there is a stronger incentive for placebo-controlled trials of surgery in these conditions.

### Ethics round table: choice and autonomy in obstetrics [^4a482d2f]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

A key element of this is building rather than undermining trust. This requires supportive communication; a willingness to take the pregnant person's concerns seriously; and consistent reassurance that their right to decide what is done to them will always be respected.

But in 'outside guidelines' cases, like the ones discussed here, healthcare providers are often concerned about the risk to the mother and the baby. How do healthcare providers best meet their ethical and professional obligations to provide safe and just care in such cases, all the while respecting women's autonomy and building trust?

Draft Dutch guidelines, based on extensive ethical analysis, recommend that care providers take the steps outlined in box 1:

We can apply this to both Felicity and Rosa. In both cases, the care provider should take time to identify the underlying concerns (step 1). Why does Felicity want minimal interventions? What are her underlying beliefs, values and concerns? Only with an adequate understanding of these can the care provider give accurate, relevant and unbiased information about the pros and cons of induction (step 2). They can express concern about Felicity's decision if they feel that is warranted, but only while making clear that they will respect what Felicity choses, and do their utmost to care for Felicity and her baby in any scenario (step 3). If Felicity continues to prefer not to induce, the care provider and Felicity should make a care plan for the safest possible care consistent with Felicity's values and concerns. This should involve, for instance, discussing at what stage Felicity would consider induction, when this decision can be rediscussed, her preferences around intermittent auscultation (given a preference against continuous fetal heart rate monitoring) and so on (step 5). The plan needs to be clearly written down and communicated to the rest of the team that is (or is likely to become) involved in her care.

The investigation and/or regulation of potential harm reduction strategies — ethical guidance specifies that marginal harm reduction calculations must use best available options as the comparator, rather than the no-intervention condition, and that harm reduction claims should be accompanied by clear statements of their methodologic decisions. The hazards inherent to prospective population-based evaluations may qualify as "greater than minimal risk", and care should be taken to assess research risks in comparison to current standards of care for reducing harm among people unprepared to quit, rather than to the no-intervention condition. Harm reduction researchers must protect the autonomy of subjects by discussing the unique nature of risk inherent to harm reduction protocols, and promoting an understanding sufficient for subjects to legitimately assume risk protects subjects through fair methods that promote just outcomes. Harm reduction policies should state the perspective(s) from which they are derived, guard against inequitable allocation of resources, provide assurance of longitudinal surveillance, and inform the public of important developments in understanding. Although elimination of risk should remain the goal of public health authorities, this statement highlights the special requirements for ethically pursuing the reduction of harm within the complex social/biological context of tobacco dependence.

### Palliative care best practices guidelines [^599a56f6]. ACS (2017). Medium credibility.

Palliative care best practices — breaking bad news in the emergency department (ED) prioritizes preparation and clarity. When breaking bad news in the ED, the environmental considerations and strategies described in Tables 2 and 3 are important. In anticipation of breaking bad news, the team needs to review all relevant information, including what transpired in the field. Determine who the recipient of the news might be, particularly when identification of the patient is uncertain. It is important to ensure that the recipient is appropriate and any personal health information is consistent with HIPAA privacy requirements. Introduce yourself and identify the roles of your team members, and confirm the relationship to the deceased with all the recipients of bad news. Families are often on edge waiting for bad news, and typically they first want to know if the patient is dead or alive; deliver this news first in about 30 to 60 seconds. Using the "D" word (died, dying) when delivering news of death is important and is a best practice. Allow for silence, and this is not the time to go into details about the medical care, injuries, or anything else. Expressions of empathy (verbal and nonverbal) are welcome, but they need to come naturally. The goal is to deliver the information in a clear and compassionate manner, free of jargon or medical short hand.

Gratefully, Levy is moved by the psychological research on judgment and decision-making that documents people's inaccuracy when identifying courses of action will best promote their subjective well-being. But Levy is quick to favour the patient's present preferences, to ensure they get "final say" about their treatment. I urge the opposite inclination, raising doubts about whether the patient's "present preferences" are the best expression of their "final say". When there is adequate evidence that people, by their own lights, overemphasize their present preferences about the future, we should carefully depreciate those preferences, in effect biasing them to make the right decision by their own lights.

### Do we really know how many clinical trials are conducted ethically? Why research ethics committee review practices need to be strengthened and initial steps we could take to strengthen them [^3b951bc7]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This essay has reviewed voluminous evidence showing, for example, that too many phase 1 trials may be launched on the basis of false-positive preclinical findings and that too many later phase trials may not only be incapable of improving healthcare but may actually end up making it worse. Clearly, RECs are not the cause of the false-positive findings or the socially wasteful or harmful later phase trials. RECs do continue to approve the trials though. The point of this essay has been to call attention to this fact in hopes both that RECs might be persuaded to make changes and to show a feasible first step toward change. Change is clearly needed if there are to be fewer ethically deficient trials going forward that enrol unwitting research participants into countless early trials who can be subjected to major risks that for all anyone knows may be disproportional to their benefits and into countless later trials that for all anyone knows may lack sufficient social value. Surely those people deserve better from the RECs with jurisdiction over those trials.
