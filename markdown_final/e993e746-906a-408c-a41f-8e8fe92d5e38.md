## Question

chest radiograph fluid overload

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret chest radiographs for fluid overload, including key signs, limitations, differentials, and how to integrate CXR with other modalities and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core radiographic signs of fluid overload and their pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic performance and limitations of CXR, especially in supine/portable films and in special populations. Next, I will review objective tools like vascular pedicle width and scoring systems. After that, I need to distinguish cardiogenic from non-cardiogenic edema and consider ARDS mimics. Finally, I should integrate CXR with lung ultrasound, echocardiography, biomarkers, and guideline-based pathways, and close with practical takeaways and caveats for serial monitoring and de-resuscitation strategies.

> Let me first confirm the core radiographic signs of fluid overload on chest radiograph. Cardiomegaly suggests chamber enlargement and is common in heart failure, while pulmonary vascular redistribution ("cephalization") reflects elevated left atrial pressure with upper-lobe vessel dilation, and interstitial edema manifests as Kerley B lines and peribronchial cuffing; alveolar edema appears as bilateral perihilar "bat-wing" opacities, and pleural effusions are frequent in severe congestion, all of which align with ACC/AHA data element definitions and standard teaching on CXR in heart failure [^111TS1VV] [^1177uUQn] [^111TS1VV].

> Wait, let me verify the objective markers that can improve detection beyond subjective reads. The vascular pedicle width (VPW), measured from the right superior vena cava to the left subclavian artery, correlates with intravascular volume and filling pressures; a VPW greater than 70 mm, especially when combined with a cardiothoracic ratio above 0.55, increases the likelihood of elevated pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and a hydrostatic component to edema, and serial changes in VPW track fluid balance in ICU cohorts, which can be particularly useful when invasive hemodynamics are unavailable [^112SA6QD] [^115xrWRm] [^1112Yfj6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about sensitivity. I need to check the diagnostic performance and limitations of CXR in real-world settings. CXR has moderate sensitivity and specificity for pulmonary edema, with studies showing sensitivity around 57–65% and specificity around 89–90%, and up to 20% of patients with heart failure may have initially negative CXRs; portable AP films further degrade performance, with sensitivity for pleural effusions as low as 60% in supine patients, and extravascular lung water must increase by roughly 30% before becoming radiographically visible, which explains why early or mild overload is often missed [^114maeHQ] [^116kKPT5] [^111J1s76].

> I should double-check special populations where CXR underperforms. In obesity, the dampening of breath sounds and exam findings can mask congestion, making imaging more important yet technically challenging; in dialysis patients, CXR typically detects pulmonary edema only when volume overload is already substantial, limiting its utility for early detection; and in pediatric critical care, clinical signs of fluid overload often lag and CXR interpretation is confounded by postoperative states and ventilation, reinforcing the need for adjunct tools [^115kXkwF] [^115fjKWG] [^116pZGf7] [^116zCCoT].

> Next, I should review how to differentiate cardiogenic from non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema on CXR. Cardiogenic edema tends to be perihilar, symmetric, with cardiomegaly, vascular redistribution, and pleural effusions, whereas non-cardiogenic edema (e.g. ARDS) shows more peripheral, patchy, asymmetric, gravity-dependent consolidations with air bronchograms and less cardiomegaly; however, I need to ensure I do not overstate this, because ARDS and cardiogenic edema can coexist, and the Berlin and updated global ARDS definitions explicitly require that bilateral opacities are not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload, underscoring the need for clinical context and echocardiography rather than relying on CXR pattern alone [^112U549N] [^115vRXwx] [^113d8vmd].

> Let me consider objective scoring systems to reduce interobserver variability. The Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) score, which multiplies consolidation extent by density in each quadrant, correlates with extravascular lung water and predicts oxygenation and mortality in ARDS; standardized bedside CXR scoring approaches have also been explored to improve correlation with extravascular lung water, though they require prospective validation and careful attention to technique and patient position [^112w37or] [^112afsAn] [^116MCBQT].

> I will now examine how to integrate CXR with lung ultrasound, because I need to ensure we are not missing early edema. Lung ultrasound B-lines are highly sensitive and specific for pulmonary edema, outperforming CXR and physical examination in multiple studies; three or more B-lines in two or more bilateral intercostal spaces is diagnostic of pulmonary edema, and B-line burden tracks response to decongestion, while thoracic ultrasound is superior to CXR for detecting and characterizing pleural effusions, which can mimic consolidation on CXR and mislead management [^114maeHQ] [^116YdQfN] [^115g9K21].

> But wait, what if the edema is cardiogenic rather than permeability-driven? I should confirm that focused echocardiography is used to assess cardiac function, filling pressures, and right-sided pressures, because distinguishing HFpEF, acute valvular disease, or pulmonary hypertension changes therapy; guidelines endorse echocardiography in suspected HFpEF and emphasize that CXR signs of congestion have low sensitivity compared with invasive wedge pressures, so a normal CXR does not exclude clinically significant congestion [^1172j4p3] [^111TS1VV].

> Next, I should review biomarkers and invasive references to triangulate the diagnosis. BNP and NT-proBNP support the diagnosis of heart failure and have high negative predictive value when low, but levels can be confounded by obesity, renal dysfunction, and chronic HF; when available, invasive hemodynamics or validated noninvasive surrogates like ReDS can quantify extravascular lung water and correlate with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, though they are not universally accessible and should be interpreted in clinical context [^116kKPT5] [^114GKvpG].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline-based pathways so I do not over-order imaging. ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines recommend obtaining a CXR in suspected or new-onset HF to assess heart size, pulmonary congestion, and alternative diagnoses, but caution that CXR should not be the sole determinant of HF presence or cause; Choosing Wisely advises against routine daily CXRs in the ICU without a specific question, given low yield and potential harms, so CXR should be targeted to clinical triggers or serial assessments of de-resuscitation [^113sYqT2] [^111TS1VV] [^113HfdFF].

> Let me think about serial monitoring and de-resuscitation. Serial CXRs with VPW can track response to diuresis, and protocolized de-resuscitation has been associated with improved outcomes in selected ICU cohorts; integrating CXR with lung ultrasound and fluid balance helps titrate diuretics and ultrafiltration, and in pediatrics, bedside ultrasound of the IVC and lungs supports early recognition of fluid overload when clinical signs are subtle [^115xrWRm] [^116pZGf7].

> I should confirm the practical takeaways. CXR remains a useful first-line tool to detect overt congestion, cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, and alveolar edema, but it is insensitive for early or mild overload and is technique dependent; objective markers like VPW and standardized scoring improve reproducibility, lung ultrasound detects interstitial edema earlier and more reliably, and echocardiography clarifies cardiac etiologies; in parallel, I must actively exclude ARDS mimics and coexisting processes, using clinical context and, when needed, CT to resolve atypical patterns or complications [^111TS1VV] [^114maeHQ] [^113okpc8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost concluded that a normal CXR excludes fluid overload — let me reconsider and correct that. A normal CXR does not exclude clinically significant congestion, especially early or in supine/portable studies, so I should integrate CXR with exam, ultrasound, biomarkers, and hemodynamics, and avoid anchoring on a single modality when the clinical picture suggests volume overload despite a nondiagnostic radiograph [^116kKPT5] [^111TS1VV].

Chest radiography is a **first-line tool** for detecting fluid overload, with key findings including cardiomegaly, vascular redistribution, interstitial edema (Kerley B lines), alveolar edema (bat-wing opacities), pleural effusions, and an enlarged vascular pedicle [^115nEuos] [^112SA6QD]. These features reflect increased intravascular volume and **pulmonary congestion** [^1112Yfj6], but CXR has limited sensitivity in early or mild overload, especially in supine or portable films [^116kKPT5] [^111TS1VV]. Lung ultrasound is more sensitive for early interstitial edema (B-lines) and can detect pleural effusions missed by CXR [^114maeHQ] [^116YdQfN]; use CXR to screen and guide therapy, and confirm or monitor with ultrasound or CT when needed [^112SA6QD].

---

## Radiographic signs of fluid overload

Several **characteristic findings** on chest radiography indicate fluid overload:

- **Cardiomegaly**: Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, indicating cardiac chamber enlargement or pericardial effusion [^115nEuos].

- **Pulmonary vascular redistribution**: Dilatation of upper lobe vessels ("cephalization"), reflecting increased pulmonary venous pressure [^115nEuos].

- **Interstitial edema**: Kerley B lines (horizontal septal lines), peribronchial cuffing, and interlobular septal thickening [^1172j4p3].

- **Alveolar edema**: Bilateral perihilar "bat-wing" or "butterfly" opacities, indicating fluid accumulation in alveolar spaces [^111TS1VV].

- **Pleural effusions**: Blunting of the costophrenic angles, more common in right-sided heart failure or severe volume overload [^115nEuos].

- **Enlarged vascular pedicle**: Widening of the mediastinal vascular pedicle (> 70 mm), correlating with increased intravascular volume [^112SA6QD].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and limitations

Chest radiography is **moderately sensitive and specific** for fluid overload, with sensitivity around 57% and specificity around 89% [^114maeHQ]. Accuracy is reduced in early or mild overload, supine or portable films, obesity, chronic lung disease, and chronic heart failure [^116kKPT5] [^111J1s76]. Up to 20% of patients with heart failure may have a normal initial CXR [^116kKPT5].

---

## Differentiation from other conditions

Chest radiography helps **differentiate fluid overload** from other causes of dyspnea and pulmonary opacities:

- **Pneumonia**: Typically presents with focal, lobar infiltrates, whereas fluid overload shows diffuse, bilateral opacities [^116mGrfY].

- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: Bilateral opacities not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload, often requiring clinical correlation and additional imaging [^113d8vmd].

- **Pulmonary embolism**: May present with pleural effusions, but the clinical context and additional imaging (CT pulmonary angiography) are required for diagnosis [^116EM7hE].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend chest radiography as an **initial diagnostic test** for suspected fluid overload or acute heart failure [^113sYqT2]. It is useful for assessing heart size, pulmonary congestion, pleural effusions, and alternative diagnoses [^113sYqT2]. However, CXR should not be the sole determinant of fluid status due to its limited sensitivity and specificity [^116kKPT5].

---

## Alternative and complementary imaging modalities

Given CXR limitations, **alternative imaging modalities** are recommended:

- **Lung ultrasound (LUS)**: Highly sensitive for detecting interstitial edema (B-lines) and pleural effusions, and often superior to CXR in early fluid overload [^114maeHQ] [^116YdQfN].

- **Echocardiography**: Essential for assessing cardiac function, ventricular filling pressures, and differentiating cardiogenic from non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^113okpc8].

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Provides detailed imaging of pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and other thoracic abnormalities, useful when CXR is inconclusive or when alternative diagnoses are suspected [^112U549N].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Radiographic evidence of fluid overload **guides clinical management**, including diuretic therapy, fluid restriction, and monitoring of response to treatment [^117WTWeY]. Serial CXRs can document improvement or progression of pulmonary congestion and pleural effusions, aiding ongoing management decisions [^112w37or].

---

Chest radiography is a **valuable initial tool** for detecting fluid overload, with characteristic findings such as cardiomegaly, vascular redistribution, interstitial and alveolar edema, pleural effusions, and an enlarged vascular pedicle [^115nEuos]. However, its limited sensitivity and specificity necessitate **complementary imaging**, particularly lung ultrasound and echocardiography, to accurately assess and manage fluid overload [^114maeHQ].

### Modern tools for optimizing fluid management in dialysis patients: a comprehensive review [^115fjKWG]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in patients with ESRD on dialysis. Fluid overload contributes to hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and increased mortality in this population. Conversely, excessive ultrafiltration can lead to intradialytic hypotension, myocardial stunning, and a decline in residual renal function. Accurate fluid status assessment and careful ultrafiltration management are crucial for optimal care of patients on dialysis.

Volume overload is an excess of extracellular fluid beyond the body's homeostatic capacity which manifests as increased total body water leading to venous and pulmonary congestion. Traditionally, nephrologists have relied on clinical parameters such as blood pressure, physical examination findings, and changes in body weight to evaluate the patient's volume status. However, these methods have limitations and can often be misleading. Findings such as edema and pulmonary rales have poor sensitivity and specificity for detecting volume overload in dialysis patients. Chest X-ray, another commonly used tool, can only detect pulmonary edema when a significant degree of volume overload is already present. Even the use of dry weight, a fundamental concept in dialysis management, has its limitations. There is a need for more objective ways to assess volume status. This review focuses on emerging techniques that enable direct visualization of organ congestion or objective measurement of fluid status, complementing established methods like relative blood volume monitoring and biomarkers.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Clinical assessment for suspected HFpEF — Physical examination "may demonstrate signs of congestion, including elevated jugular venous pressure, presence of an S3 gallop, pulmonary crackles or rales, hepatomegaly, ascites, or lower extremity edema". "Electrocardiography should be performed in all patients with suspected HFpEF", and electrocardiographic evaluation "can screen for atrial fibrillation, which may be occult in HFpEF and is prevalent in 15% to 41% of patients". "Chest radiography should be performed in the evaluation of HFpEF, particularly in patients presenting with dyspnea", as it "may show signs of volume overload (Kerley B-lines, pleural effusion, pulmonary congestion) or reveal other noncardiac causes of dyspnea", though "Radiographic findings appear to have low sensitivity in detecting patients with HFpEF compared with PCWP measurements by cardiac catheterization".

### Findings on the portable chest radiograph correlate with fluid balance in critically ill patients [^115xrWRm]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Fluid balance concerns occur daily in critically ill patients, complicated by difficulties assessing intravascular volume. Chest radiographs (CXRs) quantify pulmonary edema in acute lung injury (ALI) and total blood volume in normal subjects. We hypothesized that CXRs would reflect temporal changes in fluid balance in critically ill patients.

Design

Standardized scoring of 133 supine, portable, anteroposterior CXRs. Outcomes included subjective and objective measures of intravascular volume and pulmonary edema.

Setting

Academic university medical center and affiliated Veterans Affairs hospital.

Patients

Thirty-seven patients with ALI receiving mechanical ventilation blindly randomized to treatment with diuretics and colloids or dual placebo for 5 days.

Measurements and Results

Treated patients experienced a 3.3-L diuresis and 10-kg weight loss during the 5-day period. A significant correlation was observed in all patients between changes in vascular pedicle width (VPW) and net intake/output (r = 0.50, p = 0.01) or weight (r = 0.51, p = 0.01). The correlation between VPW and fluid balance was greatest for weight changes in the treatment group alone (r = 0.71, p = 0.005). Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure correlated highly with changes in VPW (r = 0.70, p < 0.001). After day 1, CXRs revealed significant between-group differences in VPW without changes in cardiothoracic ratio or subjective measures of edema. The proportion of patients with VPW < 70 mm did not differ at baseline but was significantly more in the treatment group on all subsequent days (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

We conclude that temporal fluid balance changes are reflected on commonly utilized portable CXRs. Objective radiographic measures of intravascular volume may be more appropriate indicators of fluid balance than subjective measures, with VPW appearing most sensitive. If systematically quantitated, serial CXRs provide a substantial supplement to other clinically available data for the purpose of fluid management in critically ill patients.

### A new global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^113d8vmd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Timing, Risk Factors, and Extrapulmonary Factors

The committee agreed that the current time frame for the diagnosis of ARDS should be retained: acute onset or worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure is defined as occurring within 1 week of the onset of the predisposing risk factor or within 1 week of new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Prolonging the time to onset of hypoxemic respiratory failure was considered, as protracted symptoms may precede progression to frank respiratory failure, as in the case of COVID-19; however, expanding the definition to include HFNO (detailed below) should allow earlier diagnosis, so the time frame of 1 week for acute onset of respiratory failure was maintained. The acute onset or worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure and pulmonary edema should not be exclusively or primarily attributable to cardiogenic pulmonary edema or fluid overload, atelectasis or lung collapse, pleural effusion, or pulmonary embolism. ARDS can be diagnosed in the presence of these conditions if a predisposing risk factor for ARDS is also present, and the clinician believes that these other conditions (e.g. fluid overload, atelectasis) are unlikely to be the primary causes of the hypoxemia. ARDS also can be diagnosed in the presence of chronic lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary hypertension, providing that acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is not primarily attributable to these underlying conditions. Further rationale for these recommendations is provided in Supplement E2 and Tables E1 and E2.

Chest Imaging

The committee agreed that chest imaging criteria should include bilateral radiologic (chest radiography or computed tomography) or ultrasound findings suggestive of loss of lung aeration that are not fully explained by effusions, atelectasis, or nodules/masses. Although the identification of bilateral opacities by chest radiography has poor interrater reliability, chest radiography is the most common imaging modality in critically ill patients, which contributed to the recommendation to retain it in the definition despite its limitations. In addition, the committee recommended that ultrasound be accepted as a modality for identifying signs of loss of lung aeration consistent with (noncardiogenic) pulmonary edema or lung consolidation, especially when chest radiography or computed tomography is not available. There is evidence that ultrasound can be reliable if the operator is trained to detect bilateral consolidations and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, an approach that should have value, especially in resource-limited areas. Further discussion of the rationale for these recommendations is provided in Supplement E3.

### Challenges in the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in individuals with obesity [^115kXkwF]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rales are a typical sign of pulmonary congestion or fluid overload. However, in patients with obesity, pulmonary congestion can occur without overt or audible crackles because the sound transmission may be dampened by the excess adipose tissue. Thus, HFpEF patients with obesity may have fewer audible crackles despite significant fluid overload. A similar principle applies to heart murmurs. Significant valve stenoses or insufficiencies may not be heard due to the insulating effect of fat tissue. Imaging tools, such as a chest X-ray or echocardiogram may be needed to provide objective evidence of the presence or absence of pulmonary congestion or other lung pathology, and valvular abnormalities.

The primary techniques of physical examination — inspection, palpation, auscultation, and percussion — are essential for physicians to assess normal physiology and detect pathology. However, these methods are compromised when viscera and vasculature are surrounded by a (thick) layer of adipose tissue, which may severely limit the quality of the physical exam. Despite the widespread obesity epidemic, many medical students and residents receive no formal training on adapting the physical examination for patients with obesity. It is crucial to emphasize the need for physicians to overcome these challenges to ensure optimal care for these patients.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: evaluation and management [^116kKPT5]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Fluid status assessment

Accurate volume status evaluation is essential for appropriate therapy as inadequate assessment of volume status can result in not providing necessary treatment or in the administration of unneeded therapy, both associated with increased mortality. There are several methods to evaluate fluid status; however, most of the tests currently used are fairly inaccurate. We will describe some of these methods.
History and physical examination: The usefulness of medical history, symptoms, and signs along with routine diagnostic studies (chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)) that differentiate heart failure from other causes of dyspnea in the emergency department were evaluated in a meta-analysis. Many features increased the probability of heart failure, with the best feature for each category being the presence of past history of heart failure (positive LR = 5.8; 95% CI, 4.1–8.0); paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (positive LR = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5–4.5); third heart sound gallop (positive LR = 11; 95% CI, 4.9–25.0); chest radiograph showing pulmonary venous congestion (positive LR = 12.0; 95% CI, 6.8–21.0); and electrocardiogram showing atrial fibrillation (positive LR = 3.8; 95% CI, 1.7–8.8). A low serum BNP proved to be the most useful test (serum BNP < 100 pg/mL; negative LR = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.07–0.16). Importantly, signs like pulmonary rales, lower extremity edema, and jugular venous distention have significant limits for assessing fluid overload. There are some studies that have correlated these sings during physical examination and invasive measures (e.g. pulmonary catheter wedge pressure (PCWP)). Butman et al. found that the presence of jugular venous distension, at rest or inducible, had a sensitivity (81%), and a specificity (80%) for elevation of the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (≥ 18 mmHg). Using hepato-jugular reflux and Valsalva maneuvers, Marantz et al. showed that these maneuvers were valid in the diagnosis of congestive heart failure in acutely dyspneic patients, with low a sensitivity (24%) and a high specificity (94%). On the other hand, in a prospective study, physical signs of fluid overload were compared with hemodynamic measurements in 50 patients with known chronic heart failure. Sings like rales, edema, and elevated mean jugular venous pressures were absent in 18 of 43 patients with pulmonary capillary wedge pressures ≥ 22 mmHg. The combination of these signs had a sensitivity of 58% and specificity of 100%.
Chest radiography Chest x-ray has been one of the most used tests to evaluate for hypervolemia. Radiographic sings of volume overload include dilated upper lobe vessels, cardiomegaly, interstitial edema, enlarged pulmonary artery, pleural effusion, alveolar edema, prominent superior vena cava, and Kerley lines. However, up to 20% of patients diagnosed with heart failure had negative chest radiographs at initial emergency department evaluation. Additionally, these radiographic sings can be minimal in patients with late-stage heart failure. In patients with congestive heart failure, radiographic signs had poor predictive value for identifying patients with PCWP values ≥ 30 mmHg where radiographic pulmonary congestion was absent in 39% of patients. The X-ray technique and the clinical status of patient impact radiographic performance for detecting volume overload. Portably chest X-ray, reduce the sensitivity of findings of volume overload, and pleural effusions can be missed if the film is performed supine. With intubated patients and patients with pleural effusions, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of supine chest X-ray was reported to be as low as 60%, 70%, and 67% respectively. Conversely, the frequency of volume overload findings in the chest X-ray increased with the severity of fluid overload such as severe heart failure.
Natriuretic peptides High levels of BNP can be found with volume overload; however, some conditions like myocardial infraction and pulmonary embolism can cause elevated levels of BNP. Other conditions that have to be taken into account when evaluating BNP levels are obesity, associated with lower BNP levels and renal failure, associated with high BNP levels. Patients with heart failure who have elevated base-line levels of BNP. The greatest utility of BNP levels is in the absence of elevation, since low BNP levels have a high negative predictive value for excluding heart failure diagnosis. On the other hand, high BNP levels can be non-specific for volume overload.
Bioimpedance vector analysis Bioelectrical impedance analysis is a commonly used method for estimating body composition, specifically detecting soft tissue hydration with a 2–3% measurement error. It is a noninvasive, inexpensive and highly versatile test that transforms electrical properties of tissues into clinical information. Bioimpedance vector analysis (BIVA) measures whole body fluid volume and is based on patterns of the resistance-reactance graph, relating body impedance to body hydration. Clinical information on hydration is obtained through patterns of vector distribution with respect to the healthy population of the same race, sex, class of body mass index, and age. Changes in tissue hydration status below 500 mL are detected and ranked. BIVA was examined as an indicator of fluid status compared to central venous pressure (CVP) in 121 critically ill patients. In this study patients were classified in three groups according to their CVP value: low (0 to 3 mmHg); medium (4 to 12 mmHg); and high (13 to 20 mmHg). The agreement between BIVA and central venous pressure indications was good in the high CVP group, moderate in the medium CVP group, and poor in low CVP group. The combined evaluation of peripheral tissue hydration (BIVA) and central filling pressure (CVP) could provide a useful clinical assessment instrument in the planning of fluid therapy in critically ill patients, particularly in those with low CVP.
Thoracic ultrasound Sonographic artifacts known as B-lines that suggest thickened interstitial or fluid-filled alveoli can be detected using thoracic ultrasound (Fig. 1). PCWP and fluid accumulation in lungs have been correlated with the presence of B-lines ("comet-tail images") in patients with congestive heart failure. Agricola et al. used thoracic ultrasound to detect "comet-tail images" and obtained an individual patient comet-tail image score by summing the number of B-lines in each of the scanned spaces assessed (right and left hemi thorax, from second to fourth intercostals' space, from para-sternal to mid-axillary line); authors found significant positive linear correlations between comet-tail images score and extra-vascular lung water determined by the PiCCO System, between comet score and PCWP, and between comet-tail images score and radiologic sings of fluid overload in the lungs. Fig. 1 Lung comet tail image. 'B lines' also known as comet-tail images are a marker of pulmonary edema. In the presence of extravascular lung water the reflection of the ultrasound beam on the sub-pleural interlobular septa thickened by edema creates comet-tail reverberation artifacts. The ultrasound appearance is of a vertical, discrete, hyperechogenic image that arises from the pleural line and extends to the bottom of the screen moving synchronously with the respiration (white arrows)
Vena cava diameter ultrasound The measurement of the inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter can also be use to assess volume status. Normal diameter of IVC is 1.5 to 2.5 cm (measured 3 cm from the right atrium); volume depletion is considered with an IVC diameter < 1.5 cm while an IVC diameter > 2.5 cm suggests volume overload. In an observational study on blood donors, Lyon et al. evaluated the inferior vena cava diameter (IVCd) during inspiration (IVCd i) and during expiration (IVCd e), before and after blood donation of 450 mL. Significant differences were found between the IVCd e before and after blood donation and between IVCd i before and after donation (5.5 mm and 5.16 mm, respectively). In patients treated for hypovolemia, Zengin et al. evaluated the IVC and right ventricle (RVd) diameters and diameter changes with the diameters and diameter changes of healthy volunteers. The IVCd was measured ultrasonographically by M-mode in the subxiphoid area and the RVd was measured in the third and fourth intercostals spaces before and after fluid resuscitation. As compare with healthy volunteers average diameters in hypovolemic patients of the IVC during inspiration and expiration, and right ventricule diameter were significantly lower. After fluid resuscitation, there was a significant increase in mean IVC diameters during inspiration and expiration as well as in the right ventricule diameter. Bedside inferior vena cava diameter and right ventricule diameter evaluation could be a practical noninvasive instrument for fluid status estimation and for evaluating the response to fluid therapy in critically ill patients.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^111cPT4u]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Fluid overload recognition during pediatric sepsis resuscitation — Although fluid bolus therapy should be discontinued if signs of fluid overload are present or develop, early recognition of fluid overload by clinical examination is a challenge in children, and clues of evolving fluid overload include worsening respiratory status, particularly increasing respiratory rate, radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema in an intubated patient, or new or expanding hepatomegaly. Bedside ultrasound may also be helpful, as a "full" inferior vena cava with minimal variation across the respiratory cycle demonstrated on ultrasound indicates a fluid-replete circulation.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^113Gzpri]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Table 4 — patient volume status in suspected sepsis lists bedside signs of hypoperfusion and fluid overload to guide assessment. Hypoperfusion signs include SBP < 100 mm Hg (or less than baseline SBP for patients with baseline SBP < 100 mm Hg), MAP < 65 mm Hg (or less than baseline MAP for patients with baseline MAP < 65 mm Hg), heart pulse rate ≥ 110 beats/min, shock index (pulse rate/SBP) > 1.0, peripheral capillary refill time > 3 seconds, and decreased urine output (< 0.5 mL/kg per hour). Fluid overload with fluid administration is indicated by development of pulmonary crackles, increased jugular venous distention, increased work of breathing, increased hypoxemia, chest x-ray signs of pulmonary edema, and ultrasound signs consistent with pulmonary edema (eg, B-lines).

### 2021 ACC / AHA key data elements and definitions for heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical data standards (writing committee to develop clinical data standards for heart failure) [^115nEuos]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure data elements — chest radiography defines the data element as "Documented findings from the radiological examination of the chest", with permissible values including "Pulmonary vascular redistribution, pulmonary congestion, or pulmonary edema", "Cardiomegaly, chamber enlargement", "Pleural effusion(s)", and "No abnormalities related to HF". Pulmonary edema is defined as "Accumulation of fluid in the lung tissues causing disturbance of the gas exchange that may lead to respiratory failure. It is caused by direct injury to the lung parenchyma or congestive HF". Cardiomegaly/chamber enlargement is "Abnormal enlargement of the heart", and pleural effusion(s) are described as "Increased amounts of fluid within the pleural cavity. Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. It is usually caused by lung infections, congestive HF; pleural and lung tumors, connective tissue disorders, and trauma".

### An official American Thoracic Society / American association of critical-care nurses / American College of Chest Physicians / Society of Critical Care Medicine policy statement: the choosing wisely® top 5 list in critical care medicine [^113HfdFF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Choosing Wisely critical care Recommendation #1 — Do Not Order Diagnostic Tests at Regular Intervals (Such as Every Day), But Rather in Response to Specific Clinical Questions — states that routine diagnostic evaluations carry measurable burdens and costs for patients and the health-care system, including iatrogenic anemia from routine phlebotomy leading to extra red blood cell transfusions and risks such as alloimmunization, transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, infection, and organ failure. Routine chest radiography and computed tomography scanning are described as rarely indicated and may be harmful, with unexpected findings on chest radiographs noted in less than 6% of the 2,457 daily routine radiographs ordered in 754 consecutive ICU patients in a mixed medical-surgical ICU, and in fewer than half of these cases did the finding prompt a change in management. A protocol to reduce chest radiograph ordering decreased use by up to 36%.

### Chest radiography versus lung ultrasound for identification of acute respiratory distress syndrome: a retrospective observational study [^116eLLGc]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Defining ARDS

ARDS was defined in two ways: using a combination of the Berlin definition with chest radiography (Berlin-CXR) or modified using lung ultrasound as an alternative imaging method (Berlin-LUS). For both definitions, diagnosis of respiratory failure was within 1 week of a known clinical insult or new/worsening respiratory symptoms, not fully explained by heart failure or fluid overload. For both ARDS definitions, patients on noninvasive ventilation could be classified as having mild ARDS but not moderate or severe ARDS. With regards to oxygenation, patients with ARDS required the ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to inspired fraction of oxygen to be 300 mmHg or lower. For the Berlin-CXR definition, the imaging criterion required the presence of bilateral radiographic opacities not fully explained by pleural effusions, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules. For the Berlin-LUS definition, the imaging criterion required at least one region of each hemithorax to be affected by multiple B lines (> 2 B lines per rib space) or consolidation on lung ultrasound. However, consolidation adjacent to pleural effusion could be a consequence of pulmonary atelectasis and was not counted as positive for ARDS.

### Modern tools for optimizing fluid management in dialysis patients: a comprehensive review [^116o8vfe]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Maintaining optimal fluid balance is crucial for patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis, as both fluid overload and excess removal can lead to poor outcomes. Traditional approaches such as physical exam and chest X-ray have limitations when assessing volume status. This review carefully examines the tools that provide more precise options, including lung ultrasound, echocardiography, Venous Excess Ultrasound (VEXUS), bioimpedance analysis (BIA), and passive leg raise (PLR). We discuss the principles, supporting evidence, and practical uses of these techniques differentiating between static and dynamic methods to evaluate ultrafiltration tolerance. By integrating these modern techniques with clinical judgment, nephrologists can optimize fluid management in dialysis patients. While these tools show promise, further research is needed to establish standardized protocols and evaluate their impact on patient-centered outcomes.

Methods

Patient selection and definitions

Data were collected in two hospitals in the Netherlands (Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, tertiary SCD hospital, and Flevo Hospital, Almere). Electronic records of patients with SCD [sickle cell anaemia (HbSS), sickle‐haemoglobin C disease (HbSC), HbS‐β 0 thalassaemia (HbSβ 0 ‐thal) and HbS‐β⁺ thalassaemia (HbSβ + ‐thal)] admitted for VOC between September 2016 and September 2018 were screened. The current Dutch guideline recommends 3 l/24 h of NaCl 0.65% in adult patients with SCD during VOC, regardless of their concomitant oral intake. Before 2018, adult patients were primarily treated with NaCl 0.9%. In paediatric patients a total fluid intake (oral + IV NaCl 0.45%/glucose 2.5%) of 3 l/m²/24 h is recommended. We will refer to these guidelines as IV‐FT (for VOC) throughout this manuscript. Patients are generally also encouraged to drink actively. A fluid bolus is not given, as is supported by previous data. IV‐FT is tapered or stopped after 72 h. To reliably study IV‐FT per protocol, admissions in which IV‐FT was not started and hospitalisations of < 72 h were excluded. Repetitive admissions of the same patient were allowed for inclusion. For each eligible admission, patient and disease characteristics were collected.

Electronic patient records were reviewed manually by two study physicians to capture all study variables and characteristics. Additionally, several automatic search terms were used to detect cases of fluid overload. If fluid overload was described by the treating physician at the time of hospitalisation, these cases were retrospectively reviewed by the two study physicians to adjudicate a case of fluid overload using a combination of clinical parameters and symptoms. At least one of the following criteria was mandatory: lung oedema on chest X‐ray, weight gain, or increased peripheral oedema. In all cases, these criteria were accompanied by one or more of the following items: signs of lung crackles, dyspnoea and/or oxygen requirement, reduction or stop if IV‐FT and/or treatment with diuretics. In case of doubt by the two reviewing physicians, the episode of presumed fluid overload was not defined as such in this study.

### The influence of fluid overload on the length of mechanical ventilation in pediatric congenital heart surgery [^114jGzUK]. Pediatric Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Fluid overload and prolonged mechanical ventilation lead to worse outcomes in critically ill children. However, the association between these variables in children following congenital heart surgery is unknown. The objectives of this study were to describe the association between fluid overload and duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen requirement and radiologic findings of pulmonary and chest wall edema. This study is a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent congenital heart surgery between June 2010 and December 2013. Univariate and multivariate associations between maximum cumulative fluid balance and length of mechanical ventilation and OI were tested using the Spearman correlation test and multiple linear regression models, respectively. There were 85 eligible patients. Maximum cumulative fluid balance was associated with duration of mechanical ventilation (adjusted analysis beta coefficient = 0.53, CI 0.38–0.66, P < 0.001), length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (Spearman's correlation = 0.45, P < 0.001), and presence of chest wall edema and pleural effusions on chest radiograph (Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.003). Amount of red blood cells transfused and use of nitric oxide were independently associated with increased duration of mechanical ventilation (P = 0.012 and 0.014, respectively). Fluid overload is associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and PICU length of stay after congenital heart surgery. Fluid overload was also associated with physiological markers of respiratory restriction. A randomized controlled trial of a restrictive versus liberal fluid replacement strategy is necessary in this patient population, but in the meantime, accumulating observational evidence suggests that cautious use of fluid in the postoperative care may be warranted.

### Correlation between positive fluid balances with venous excess ultrasound scores and lung ultrasound in critically ill children with fluid overload [^116pZGf7]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluid overload is a frequent and clinically significant complication in pediatric intensive care, affecting up to 83% of critically ill children depending on the definition and population studied. Fluid overload typically results from a mismatch between aggressive fluid administration for resuscitation, maintenance, or medication delivery, and impaired elimination due to renal, cardiac, or hepatic dysfunction. Even a modest degree of fluid accumulation, defined by a cumulative positive fluid balance exceeding 5% of body weight, has been independently associated with increased risk of mortality, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and adverse organ outcomes. The negative physiological consequences of fluid accumulation is called fluid overload and depends on individual factors of illness severity.

Despite its clinical relevance, early detection of fluid overload remains challenging. Clinical signs such as peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, and pulmonary crackles often emerge at more advanced stages and demonstrate limited sensitivity and specificity. These findings may also be confounded by underlying disease processes, resulting in underestimation of early systemic or pulmonary congestion. Objective parameters such as central venous pressure (CVP) and cumulative fluid balance are frequently used but lack sufficient accuracy for individualized volume assessment, particularly in dynamic critical illness settings.

### Impact of chest X-ray before discharge in asymptomatic children after cardiac surgery – prospective evaluation [^113fzaDh]. Pediatric Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

In many paediatric cardiac units chest radiographs are performed routinely before discharge after cardiac surgery. These radiographs contribute to radiation exposure. To evaluate the diagnostic impact of routine chest X-rays before discharge in children undergoing open heart surgery and to analyze certain risk factors predicting pathologic findings. This was a prospective (6 months) single-centre observational clinical study. One hundred twenty-eight consecutive children undergoing heart surgery underwent biplane chest X-ray at a mean of 13 days after surgery. Pathologic findings on chest X-rays were defined as infiltrate, atelectasis, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or signs of fluid overload. One hundred nine asymptomatic children were included in the final analysis. Risk factors, such as age, corrective versus palliative surgery, reoperation, sternotomy versus lateral thoracotomy, and relevant pulmonary events during postoperative paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) stay, were analysed. In only 5.5% (6 of 109) of these asymptomatic patients were pathologic findings on routine chest X-ray before discharge found. In only three of these cases (50%), subsequent noninvasive medical intervention (increasing diuretics) was needed. All six patients had relevant pulmonary events during their PICU stay. Risk factor analysis showed only pulmonary complications during PICU stay to be significantly associated (p = 0.005) with pathologic X-ray findings. Routine chest radiographs before discharge after cardiac surgery can be omitted in asymptomatic children with an uneventful and straightforward perioperative course. Chest radiographs before discharge are warrantable if pulmonary complications did occur during their PICU stay, as this is a risk factor for pathologic findings in chest X-rays before discharge.

Definitions

The Berlin Definition of ARDS

Timing: within one week of new or worsening of existing respiratory symptoms;
Chest imaging: bilateral opacities — not fully explained by effusions, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules.
Source of pulmonary edema: respiratory failure that cannot be explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload; an objective assessment is needed to rule out hydrostatic edema in the absence of risk factors.
Hypoxemia: Mild, 200 < PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 300 mmHg with PEEP or CPAP ≥ 5 cmH₂O; Moderate, 100 < PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 200 mmHg with PEEP or CPAP ≥ 5 cmH₂O; Severe, 100 < PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 100 mmHg with PEEP/CPAP ≥ 5 H₂O.

The 2023 New definition of ARDS
Timing: within one week of new or worsening of existing respiratory symptoms;
Risk factors: such as pneumonia, non-pulmonary infections, trauma, blood transfusions, aspiration, or shock.
Pulmonary edema is not exclusively or primarily attributable to cardiac failure or fluid overload. Impairments in gas exchange are not primarily attributable to atelectasis. If causative factors for ARDS are present, ARDS can be diagnosed in the presence of these conditions.
Chest imaging: Bilateral opacities on chest radiograph and CT, or bilateral B lines and/or consolidations by ultrasound Findings not fully explained by effusions, atelectasis, or nodules/masses
Criteria Applicable to Specific Categories of ARDS: Nonintubated ARDS: When the HFNO is ≥ 30 L/min or the noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV)/CPAP ≥ 5 cmH₂O end-expiratory pressure, PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 300 mmHg or SpO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 315; Intubated ARDS: Mild, 200 < PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 300 mmHg or 235 < SpO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 315. Moderate, 100 < PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 200 mmHg or 148 < SpO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 235. Severe, PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 100 mmHg or SpO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 148 Resource-Limited Settings: SpO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 315, and the diagnosis of ARDS does not require PEEP, oxygen flow, or specific respiratory support devices.

Sepsis is defined based on the Sepsis-3 definition. Assessment of organ dysfunction was carried out in accordance with the criteria of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA).

Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) was classified according to the modified Glucksberg grading system and grouped as 0-I or II-IV depending on the treatment requirement.

### Pleural effusions due to pulmonary embolism [^116EM7hE]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review highlights both the radiographic and the fluid characteristics of pleural effusions occurring in patients with pulmonary embolism.

Recent Findings

Recent data show that one third of patients with pulmonary embolism have pleural effusions as demonstrated by chest radiograph. By using computed tomography or ultrasonography, pleural effusions have been observed in half of these patients. The effusions occupy one third or less of the hemithorax in 90% of the patients and are unilateral in more than three quarters of them (even if computed tomography is the reference technique). On computed tomography, about 20% of pleural effusions show loculations, which is true particularly in those patients with a delayed diagnosis. Although previously thought to be transudates on occasion, two recent series found that all of the effusions are exudates.

Summary

Pleural effusions associated with pulmonary embolism are usually small, unilateral and exudative when analyzed. If the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is delayed, the effusion may become loculated.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: diagnosis and management [^111VWk4M]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that manifests as rapidly progressive dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. Diagnostic criteria include onset within one week of a known insult or new or worsening respiratory symptoms, profound hypoxemia, bilateral pulmonary opacities on radiography, and inability to explain respiratory failure by cardiac failure or fluid overload. ARDS is thought to occur when a pulmonary or extrapulmonary insult causes the release of inflammatory mediators, promoting inflammatory cell accumulation in the alveoli and microcirculation of the lung. Inflammatory cells damage the vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium, leading to pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation, decreased lung compliance, and decreased gas exchange. Most cases are associated with pneumonia or sepsis. ARDS is responsible for one in 10 admissions to intensive care units and one in four mechanical ventilations. In-hospital mortality for patients with severe ARDS ranges from 46% to 60%. ARDS often must be differentiated from pneumonia and congestive heart failure, which typically has signs of fluid overload. Treatment of ARDS is supportive and includes mechanical ventilation, prophylaxis for stress ulcers and venous thromboembolism, nutritional support, and treatment of the underlying injury. Low tidal volume and high positive end-expiratory pressure improve outcomes. Prone positioning is recommended for some moderate and all severe cases. As patients with ARDS improve and the underlying illness resolves, a spontaneous breathing trial is indicated to assess eligibility for ventilator weaning. Patients who survive ARDS are at risk of diminished functional capacity, mental illness, and decreased quality of life; ongoing care by a primary care physician is beneficial for these patients.

### A systematic review of diagnostic methods to differentiate acute lung injury / acute respiratory distress syndrome from cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^113txYXk]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Differentiating between cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) and acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is challenging in the early stages of illness. The most widely accepted definition of ALI/ARDS had been based on the American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) definition, of acute onset respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) < 18 mmHg, or absence of elevated left atrial pressure. However, pulmonary artery catheterization is rarely used in clinical practice because clinical estimation of PCWP is invasive, costly, and does not aid in the diagnosis of ALI/ARDS. There were potential inconsistencies in this definition, including a lack of explicit criteria for defining acute respiratory failure, the sensitivity of the PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio to ventilator settings, poor reliability of the chest radiograph criteria, and difficulties distinguishing ARDS from CPE including that these diagnoses can coexist. Based on these limitations, the Berlin definition for ARDS was published in 2012 and is reported to have better predictive validity for mortality, than this earlier definition. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure measurement was removed from this definition. Patients were presumed to have ARDS if they had respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload as judged by the treating physician using all available data.

In current practice and most clinical studies, ALI/ARDS is usually differentiated from CPE by the clinical circumstances and by physical findings, but this distinction is often made only by post hoc review after patient' discharge or death, and is often based on the response to therapy. The ARDS Clinical Trial Network reported that fluid management to decrease cardiogenic fluid retention and the effects of lung permeability and edema, will shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care without increasing nonpulmonary organ failure. The differentiation between ALI/ARDS and CPE is important in order to avoid delaying treatment of fluid retention and avoiding unnecessary testing. Several biomarkers to distinguish ALI/ARDS from CPE have been reported. The aim of this systematic review was to review published studies of potential biomarkers to distinguish ALI/ARDS from CPE.

### Thoracic ultrasound for pleural effusion in the intensive care unit: a narrative review from diagnosis to treatment [^115g9K21]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Several medical conditions are responsible for pleural effusion (PLEFF), with volume overload, congestive heart failure, and pleuropulmonary infection representing the most common causes in the intensive care unit (ICU). Fluid accumulation can take place due to an imbalance of hydrostatic and oncotic pressure across the lung capillaries, increased pleural membrane capillary permeability, and lymphatic obstruction. Furthermore, the factors known to promote lung edema formation in the clinical setting (fluid loading, myocardial depression, hypoalbuminemia) usually coexist, and may exceed the normally high absorptive capacity of the lungs and parietal pleural lymphatics, resulting in exacerbation of PLEFF.

PLEFF occurs frequently in ICU patients with an incidence that varies according to the diagnostic technique used (from 8% following physical examination to more than 60% after routine imaging). It is also associated with a high crude mortality rate. Indeed, PLEFF can worsen gas exchange, hemodynamic stability, and respiratory dynamics. Drainage can improve oxygenation, respiratory mechanics, and compliance by enhancing the ventilation:perfusion ratio and by re-expanding areas of collapsed parenchymal lung. Although percutaneous pleural drain insertion is frequently carried out in the ICU, inaccurate insertion of the tube can have tragic consequences. Complications with the insertion of chest drains have been reported in up to 20–30% of cases; some of these complications can be potentially fatal (i.e. perforation of the lung, heart, liver, esophagus, spleen, and inferior vena cava).

Prompt diagnosis of the presence and nature of PLEFF is vital in order to evaluate the best therapeutic choice (diuretics, invasive procedures). The use of thoracic ultrasound (TUS), a safe and non-invasive bedside procedure with good accuracy, can help clinicians to visualize the effusion and also to distinguish between different types (exudative, transudative empyema, hemothorax). Moreover, TUS is important during thoracentesis and the insertion of chest drains as it helps increase safety and decrease life-threatening complications (e.g. organ laceration and infection). It is fundamental not only during needle or drainage insertion, but also when monitoring the volume of PLEFF drained, and deciding when to remove the drainage tube. Furthermore, TUS can help diagnose co-existing lung diseases, often with higher specificity and sensitivity than chest radiography and without X-ray exposure. Consequently, TUS has become an essential skill for many specialists, especially intensivists.

### Identification of volume overload hospitalizations among hemodialysis patients using administrative claims: a validation study [^117B8KHw]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical adjudication of volume overload hospital admissions

For each sampled hospitalization, we conducted detailed clinical chart reviews to adjudicate the presence or absence of volume overload at the time of admission. We sought to identify hospitalizations of patients admitted with volume overload. Unlike other cardiovascular conditions, such as myocardial infarction, there is no established, objective definition for the clinical diagnosis of volume overload. Volume overloaded hemodialysis patients often present with a constellation of signs and symptoms indicative of fluid retention (e.g. shortness of breath, rales on lung auscultation, pulmonary edema on chest imaging, etc.) that may vary from individual to individual. Thus, an in-depth review of the medical record was necessary to capture all volume-related clinical findings associated with each sampled hospitalization. Medical chart notes (e.g. emergency department, admitting team and consult notes), chest and abdominal imaging reports, and cardiac procedure reports occurring within 24 h of admission were evaluated. Abstractors utilized a standardized data collection form (Additional file 1) to record symptoms, physical exam findings, imaging results, and clinical impressions. Each medical record was independently abstracted by two clinical reviewers who were blinded to the hospitalization's billed diagnosis and procedure codes and to the abstraction results of the other reviewer. Inter-abstractor discrepancies in individual data elements were resolved by a board-certified nephrologist (J.E.F) Initial agreement between abstractors was high across all data elements, ranging 98.1% (κ = 0.91) for subjective dyspnea to 100% (κ = 1.00) for central venous pressure. After review and error resolution, consensus was reached on all abstracted charts.

### Fluid levels in medical imaging [^116b2ae1]. Clinical Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Fluid levels are commonly observed on a range of imaging methods in both normal and abnormal circumstances. Radiologists must be familiar with the appearances and significance of fluid levels, but more fundamentally, require an understanding of the mechanisms by which fluid levels occur and the principles necessary for the demonstration of fluid levels. These are the prerequisites of a cavity and at least two types of immiscible fluid, and most importantly, the requirement of an image that is orientated in the vertical plane.

### The azygos vein pathway: an overview from anatomical variations to pathological changes [^115R4BYL]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Fluid overload and an increase in mean right atrial pressure

In physiological conditions, the microvascular hydrostatic pressure measures approximatively 7 mmHg, whereas the perimicrovascular pressure of elastic return measures about -8 mmHg. The combination of these two pressures generates hydrostatic pressure of filtration of about 15 mmHg, which is partially blanced by a colloid-osmotic pressure of 14 mmHg. A final filtration pressure of about 1 mmHg favours the continuous transvascular flow of water and solutes. The lymphatic pulmonary draining system allows this draining of water and solutes, removing the excess fluid and avoiding fluid overload in the lung. Increased hydrostatic pressure, reduced colloid-osmotic plasmatic pressure or a capillary membrane lesion may induce pulmonary oedema as a result of a change in the physiological balance of fluid. Increased hydrostatic capillary pressure is the main reason for pulmonary oedema and can be the result of left cardiac diseases or excessive fluid infusion of iso-oncotic fluids. On chest X-ray, variation in the size and contour of the azygos vein and mediastinal pedicle provides useful haemodynamic information. The azygos vein and vascular pedicle correlate significantly with the intravascular fluid circulating pool. In fact, increased capillary blood volume (CBV) following over-infusion or renal failure, with consequent fluid overload (Fig. 5), results in a concomitant increase in the width of the azygos and vascular pedicle. Each variation of 0.5 cm on the vascular pedicle corresponds to an increase of 1 l of circulating fluid. The width of the azygos vein does not correlate significantly with the CBV, but with the right mean atrial pressure (r = 0.74; p < 0.001). These reversible relationships have been observed in patients with any degree of severity of cardiac failure and CBV values ranging from normal to very high. Actually, Milne and co-workers reported that the main reason for enlargement of the azygos vein is the increased mean right atrium pressure. Usual causes of increased mean right atrial pressure include constrictive pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, pulmonary hypertension and portal hypertension.

### Factors associated with unknown aetiology in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^112TjiaS]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Despite comprehensive diagnostic work-up, the aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains undetermined in 30–60% of cases. The authors studied factors associated with undiagnosed pneumonia. Patients hospitalised with CAP and being evaluated by two blood cultures, at least one valid lower respiratory tract sample, and serology on admission were prospectively recorded. Patients who had received antimicrobial pretreatment were excluded. Patients with definite or probable aetiology were compared to those with undetermined aetiology by uni- and multivariable analysis. A total 204 patients were eligible for the study. The aetiology remained undetermined in 82 (40%) patients, whereas a definite aetiology could be established in 89 (44%) and a probable one in 33 (16%). In multivariable analysis, factors associated with undetermined aetiology included age > 70 yrs, renal and cardiac comorbidity, and nonalveolar infiltrates on the chest radiograph. There was no association of undiagnosed pneumonia with mortality. Age and host factors were associated with unknown aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia. Some of these cases may also represent fluid volume overload mimicking pneumonia.

### The clinical value of daily routine chest radiographs in a mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit is low [^113hZmPk]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Several important drawbacks of the present study must be mentioned. The study design allowed daily routine CXRs to be recategorized as on-demand radiographs if the attending physician had developed a specific question about the already routinely obtained radiograph. Although this change in classification was only possible before the physicians had seen the CXR (for instance, before the results were revealed at the daily meeting with the radiologist), this practice might have caused bias. However, classifying these CXRs as daily routine radiographs instead of on-demand radiographs did not change the results. Radiologists were not blinded to the expectations of the clinical fellows, residents, or interns; radiologists were able to read the back of each request form. We did not wish to interfere with daily practice in the study, however. Finally, the present analysis did not evaluate whether the absence of abnormalities influenced daily management in our ICU. For instance, the absence of infiltrates in a patient with fever may prompt physicians to look for other infections, and the absence of radiological signs of pulmonary congestion might have resulted in another fluid therapy regimen.

We did not score for the clinical relevance of the unexpected presence of large atelectasis or severe pulmonary congestion. We opted not to evaluate these two abnormalities because we were uncertain whether we could adequately score for this in an unbiased manner. ICU patients receive diuretics every day for many reasons, not just because of the presence of pulmonary congestion. Similarly, physiotherapy and use of (higher) levels of positive end-expiratory pressure are applied routinely in our ICU, and are not related to the presence of abnormalities on the CXR. Unfortunately, these abnormalities formed a substantial part of all new and unexpected abnormalities in our analysis (1.0% and 1.2% of all daily routine CXRs showed these two findings). However, even if we assume that all daily routine CXRs that showed one of these findings would have resulted in a change to therapy, the value of this diagnostic tool remained low (for example, 4.8% of all daily routine CXRs would have resulted in a change to therapy).

### Radiographic manifestations of transfusion-related acute lung injury [^111vZc6H]. Clinical Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical symptoms and illustrate the radiological manifestations of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) as the condition develops. We mention those findings that aid the discrimination from transfusion-associated cardiac overload. We will also point some of the characteristics that increase the risk of TRALI.

Conclusion

TRALI generally occurs within 1 to 2 h of the start of a blood transfusion. Though the radiographic features of TRALI are nonspecific, the diagnosis is established using clinical and radiological parameters. The diagnosis warrants a high index of suspicion as well as knowledge of its risk factors. There are no specific treatments; the best chance of survival in TRALI is with early diagnosis and prevention.

### Albumin rather than C-reactive protein may be valuable in predicting and monitoring the severity and course of acute respiratory distress syndrome in critically ill patients with or at risk for the syndrome after new onset fever [^1116TikJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Protocol

The day of new onset fever was marked day 0 (D0). Within 12 hours of meeting inclusion criteria we recorded: demographic variables, risk factors, and baseline characteristics. Disease severity was expressed by the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II on admission. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores were used to monitor organ failure. Mechanical ventilation was pressure guided (control or support) and protective according to standard of care in our hospital. Chest radiographs collected on study days were reviewed by two authors (SHH and ABJG) blinded to the study results in an effort to exclude severe fluid overload or signs of congestive heart failure in classifying alveolar consolidations, In addition to the chest radiographs we used the central venous pressure (CVP), which was routinely measured in 83% of patients, to rule out severe fluid overload. The routine biochemical variables, albumin, CRP, LDH, and respiratory parameters like ventilator settings and daily chest radiographs were collected on D0, 1, 2, and 7. Total respiratory dynamic compliance was calculated from tidal volume/(plateau pressure-positive end-expiratory pressure), mL/cmH₂O. The need for additional imaging and collection of specimen for cultures was decided upon by treating physicians blinded to study results. In case culture and/or imaging results were positive we considered the day of their collection the day of diagnosis. Sepsis is the simultaneous presence of either clinically suspected or proven infection and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Patients were considered suffering shock when a systolic arterial pressure < 90 mmHg or a mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 65 mmHg was observed for at least one hour despite adequate fluid resuscitation and/or need of vasopressor administration. All definitions, including infections, are in line with American Society of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine criteria. For the sake of clarity, pneumonia is either community-, hospital- or ventilator-acquired. To define ARDS severity on study days, both the Berlin definition and the LIS were used. The Berlin definition divides patients into 4 categories that reflect the severity of the syndrome: no ARDS (Berlin 0, not fulfilling preconditions or PaO₂/FiO₂ > 300 mmHg), mild ARDS (Berlin 1, 200 mmHg < PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 300 mmHg), moderate ARDS (Berlin 2, 100 mm Hg < PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 200 mm Hg), and severe ARDS (Berlin 3, PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 100 mmHg). Patients suffer from ARDS if its onset is within 1 week of a known clinical insult or worsening of respiratory symptoms, there are bilateral opacities on chest radiograph not fully explained by cardiac failure of fluid overload, and the PEEP level is ≥ 5 cmH₂O. We also calculated the LIS; an average based on classification of patients by the number of quadrants with alveolar consolidation on the anterior-posterior chest radiograph, severity of hypoxemia, pulmonary compliance (tidal volume/(peak inspiratory pressure-PEEP)), and PEEP level. We used the lowest PaO₂/FiO₂ measured on study days and recorded the corresponding PEEP levels and compliance at the time of sampling. Based on their LIS, patients were divided into three categories that reflect disease severity: no lung injury (LIS ≤ 1), mild ARDS (LIS 1–2.5), and severe ARDS (LIS > 2.5). Follow up was until day 28 and we checked the clinical state or date of death for all patients.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for heart failure, more specifically with respect to chest radiography, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain a CXR to assess heart size and pulmonary congestion and to detect alternative cardiac, pulmonary and other diseases likely to cause or contribute to the symptoms in patients with suspected or new-onset HF or presenting with acute decompensated HF.

### Pulmonary high-resolution computed tomography findings in nephropathia epidemica [^112jh5Tf]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate lung high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings in patients with Puumala hantavirus-induced nephropathia epidemica (NE), and to determine if these findings correspond to chest radiograph findings.

Materials and Methods

HRCT findings and clinical course were studied in 13 hospital-treated NE patients. Chest radiograph findings were studied in 12 of them.

Results

Twelve patients (92%) showed lung parenchymal abnormalities in HRCT, while only 8 had changes in their chest radiography. Atelectasis, pleural effusion, intralobular and interlobular septal thickening were the most common HRCT findings. Ground-glass opacification (GGO) was seen in 4 and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy in 3 patients. Atelectasis and pleural effusion were also mostly seen in chest radiographs, other findings only in HRCT.

Conclusion

Almost every NE patient showed lung parenchymal abnormalities in HRCT. The most common findings of lung involvement in NE can be defined as accumulation of pleural fluid and atelectasis and intralobular and interlobular septal thickening, most profusely in the lower parts of the lung. As a novel finding, lymphadenopathy was seen in a minority, probably related to capillary leakage and overall fluid overload. Pleural effusion is not the prominent feature in other viral pneumonias, whereas intralobular and interlobular septal thickening are characteristic of other viral pulmonary infections as well. Lung parenchymal findings in HRCT can thus be taken not to be disease-specific in NE and HRCT is useful only for scientific purposes.

### Improving diagnostic accuracy in assessing pulmonary edema on bedside chest radiographs using a standardized scoring approach [^112afsAn]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of critically ill ventilated patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) is a demanding task for all involved. One important task is to assess the hemodynamic status and the presence of an increased intra- and extravascular volume which could potentially cause a pulmonary edema, which might negatively affect a patient's ventilation and condition. Various methods are, therefore, available which enable the intra- and extravascular volume status and pulmonary edema to be assessed. There are non-invasive techniques, such as the evaluation of various indicators on chest radiographs (CXRs) or sonographic analysis of the presence of Kerley lines, which depict thickened interlobular septa. Invasive techniques such as the indicator dilution method which measures the extravascular lung water (EVLW) using a pulse contour cardiac output (PiCCO) system (Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) seem to be reliable for evaluation of pulmonary edema in patients with indirect lung injury, but they are expensive and there is a risk of complications developing. Under routine clinical conditions, the diagnosis of an altered hemodynamic status and the presence, and severity of, or changes to a pulmonary edema is commonly based on the evaluation of characteristic indicators on CXRs. An accurate discrimination of patients with and without pulmonary edema during evaluation of frequent bedside CXRs remains clinically important and valuable for the practicing physician in the ICU. In addition, the interpretation of bedside CXRs is known to be challenging, and mechanical ventilation may affect the appearance of the characteristic radiographic indicators. It has been shown that the correlation between evaluation results and the actual EVLW-value can be weak when the customary reporting approach is chosen. New strategies are, therefore, needed to provide a more reliable evaluation of bedside CXRs. It has been shown, that, in the case of radiological evaluations, a scoring-based approach which allows a standardized analysis of various radiographic indicators can be beneficial in a variety of tasks. We developed and assessed customized scoring software, implemented as a web-based application, which facilitates a standardized assessment of the presence of pulmonary edema. It is based on the systematic evaluation of characteristic radiological indications of pulmonary edema on bedside CXRs. Classification of the different indications leads to a total score that distinguishes patients with pulmonary edema from patients without pulmonary edema. In contrast to bedside CXRs a significant effort has been spent in order to improve evaluation of pulmonary edema which is detected on upright CXRs. One promising approach is the accurate assessment of the vascular pedicle. This makes it particularly easy to distinguish between pulmonary edema due to congestive heart failure, renal failure and acute lung injury. To our knowledge no standardized scoring approach to assess pulmonary edema on bedside CXRs was previously correlated with a reference standard such as the EVLW-value.

### Fluid overload due to intravenous fluid therapy for vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: incidence and risk factors [^1112CFX7]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 230 consecutive hospitalisations for VOC in 100 patients were eligible for inclusion, of which there were 46 in 20 paediatric patients. The median (IQR) age was 25.0 (18.3–33.8) years, 41% of patients were female, 65% had a severe genotype (HbSS/HbSβ 0 ‐thal) and 53% used hydroxyurea. The median (IQR) time to fluid overload occurrence was 3 (2–3) days after admission.

During the 2‐year study period, 21 patients developed fluid overload due to IV‐FT for VOC. Four patients had two episodes of fluid overload during the study period, bringing the total number of fluid overload episodes during this study to 25 (11% of the 230 hospitalisations). Of these 25 cases of fluid overload, 16 (64%) had signs of pulmonary oedema on chest X‐ray, one (4%) had peripheral oedema, two (8%) had weight gain and six (24%) had a combination of two or more of these criteria. A total of 33 patients had at least one episode of fluid overload in their past medical history. The proportion of patients with a positive history of fluid overload was significantly larger in patients developing fluid overload during the study period (12/21; 57%) than that in patients not developing fluid overload during the study period (21/79; 27%, P = 0.012). When combining all episodes of fluid overload during the 2‐year study period and in the medical history, 42% of the patients had developed at least one documented episode of fluid overload.

### ESR essentials: imaging in fibrotic lung diseases-practice recommendations by the European society of thoracic imaging [^113fCSYU]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Complications

Acute exacerbations (AEs) have a relatively common incidence in IPF patients (5–19% per year), but they can develop in any FLD, causing high mortality. AE is defined as acute respiratory deterioration lasting less than 1 month, with new ground-glass opacities and consolidation appearing on a background of FLD on CT, after cardiac failure or fluid overload have been ruled out (Fig. 7). Radiologists must be aware of the potential occurrence of AEs, especially in the emergency setting, to allow prompt recognition and management; acute pulmonary embolism and pulmonary infections should also be considered in differential diagnosis.

Fig. 7
Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Axial and sagittal computed tomography (CT) images (a – c) depicting a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern with the typical peripheral predominant distribution, in the mid-lower posterior zones and antero-superior zones of the lungs (c). Honeycombing is evident in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe (a). Axial and sagittal CT images (d – f) performed 15 months later in the emergency department for acute respiratory distress of the patient show the appearance of almost diffuse areas of ground-glass opacity in both lungs, mostly in the areas relatively spared by fibrosis, suggestive of acute exacerbation. After 40 days from the acute phase, a new chest CT scan was requested for persisting chest pain. Axial and sagittal CT images (g – i), analysed at the same anatomic levels as before, demonstrate the presence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum, explained by the alveoli rupture and interstitial emphysema due to distress; interesting to note the evident progression of pulmonary fibrosis respect to the previous exam, which is a common occurrence after an acute exacerbation

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) can complicate FLDs and reduce patients' overall survival; radiologists should look for CT signs of PH, as the increased main pulmonary artery/ascending aorta diameters ratio (> 0.9), particularly in cases at higher risk (e.g. IPF, systemic sclerosis).

FLDs, particularly IPF and CTD, are associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer, which is most likely to occur near or within fibrotic regions; close monitoring of pulmonary nodules and interdisciplinary evaluation are required for the correct management.

### Using the chest radiograph to determine intravascular volume status: the role of vascular pedicle width [^112SA6QD]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Due to concerns about the efficacy and safety of using pulmonary artery catheterization to evaluate hemodynamic status, noninvasive diagnostic testing has gained increased importance. This article focuses on both the supportive evidence and the limitations of applying the vascular pedicle width (VPW), which is the mediastinal silhouette of the great vessels, as an aid in the assessment of patients' intravascular volume status. The objective measurement of the VPW obtained from either upright or supine chest radiographs (CXRs which are often already available though not fully utilized) can increase the accuracy of the clinical and radiographic assessment of intravascular volume status by 15 to 30%, and this value may be even higher when VPW is used serially within the same patient. Regardless of the presence or absence of pulmonary edema, the best VPW cutoff for differentiating a high vs normal to low intravascular volume status is 70 mm. Patients with a VPW of > 70 mm coupled with a cardiothoracic ratio of > 0.55 are more than three times more likely to have a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure > 18 mm Hg than are patients without these radiographic findings. We suggest a management algorithm for utilizing the VPW, and whether or not such an approach will offer superior patient outcomes requires prospective investigation. Reappraisal of the VPW and other roentgenographic signs should be incorporated into newly implemented studies of the Swan-Ganz catheter, ICU echocardiography, portable CT scans, and other costlier technologies. While such investigations may refine the optimum application of the portable CXR, conventional and digital supine radiographs should retain an important role in the diagnosis and management of critically ill patients. Lastly, the measurement of the VPW should be incorporated into the training of chest clinicians and radiologists.

### Albumin rather than C-reactive protein may be valuable in predicting and monitoring the severity and course of acute respiratory distress syndrome in critically ill patients with or at risk for the syndrome after new onset fever [^113rBX9e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A limitation of this study is its relatively small sample size and heterogeneous population. Considering generalizabilty of the results the latter might be an advantage as well. We included patients with the symptom fever rather than with specific conditions to focus on an inflammatory response as a major risk factor for developing or worsening ARDS. Few patients received corticosteroids or albumin as part of their treatment, but their distribution was equal between ARDS categories and therefore do not invalidate our conclusions. With exceptions, the AUROC's were generally not > 0.75. Low predictive capacity could also be related to the inclusion of high risk patients only. This must be weighed against the accessibility of these variables which are collected almost daily and routinely in many ICU's. Nevertheless, even though the associations between albumin levels and ARDS were modest, they were present on all individual study days and over the course of a week. Furthermore, albumin was inversely related to disease severity regardless of the clinical definition and its course predicted disease course (AUROC 0.68–0.77 respectively), while neither albumin nor CRP had any predictive value for 28-day mortality, possibly due to the limited power of this study. Our study suggests that albumin levels may have practical value in monitoring the severity of ARDS at the bedside of critically ill patients without the need for LIS calculations which are hardly done routinely. Assessing the PaO₂/FIO₂ ratio and chest radiograph may be insufficient to monitor ARDS, since both are treatment-dependent, for instance with higher PaO₂/FIO₂ ratios and more aerated chest radiographs with higher PEEP. Even though two authors reviewed clinical history, chest radiographs, and CVP to exclude severe fluid overload or congestive heart failure in classifying alveolar consolidations we cannot fully exclude a a component of hydrostatic edema in some of our ARDS patients. Nevertheless, even when there is dilution due to fluid administration hypoalbuminemia leads to lowered oncotic pressure and in the presence of increased vascular permeability this leads to pulmonary edema and ARDS. As shown by others low total protein and albumin levels, regardless of fluid state, are associated with the presence and development of ARDS. Our study adds to the latter studies by focusing on the value of albumin in late ARDS (85–90% after 48 hours, depending on definition) in the ICU, a commonly underdiagnosed condition.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^116mGrfY]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging modalities

Radiographic findings in pneumonia generally fall into three categories: 1) focal non-segmental or lobar pneumonia, 2) multifocal bronchopneumonia, and 3) focal or diffuse interstitial pneumonia. In patients who clinically improve, ATS/IDSA guidelines do not recommend routine follow-up chest imaging. However, in cases where clinical presentation is atypical despite radiographic evidence of pneumonia, repeat CXR is advised to rule out alternative diagnoses. Besides, repeat CXR can show progression of disease, but more importantly may reveal fluid collections (rarely abscess, more commonly pleural effusions) which could represent lack of source control (Fig. 2), like empyema requiring drainage. Radiographic resolution can lag days to weeks beyond clinical improvement. In patients under 50 and those with mild-to-moderate pneumonia, radiographic infiltrates typically resolve within four weeks. Conversely, resolution may take up to 10 weeks in older patients, those with multiple comorbidities and COPD, or severe pneumonia. Slow radiographic resolution alone is not an indicator of treatment failure.

Point-of-care LUS can also be beneficial as it is more sensitive than CXR for identifying pleural effusions and can identify fluid characteristics that suggest the presence of an empyema. While LUS avoids the cost and radiation of CT, it requires technical expertise and is less effective for assessing pathology deep to the lung pleura.

For non-resolving pneumonia or clinical deterioration, repeat imaging — especially chest CT scan — is strongly recommended. CT can help confirm or refute the diagnosis of pneumonia and identify alternative or concurrent conditions that may explain patients' delayed response rates, like pulmonary edema, embolism, pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, or malignancy. High resolution chest CT reviewed by chest radiologists can be particularly helpful in differentiating infectious from non-infectious pathology. CT also offers better delineation of radiographic patterns (e.g. lobar, interstitial, nodular) and can identify complications such as cavitation, abscess, empyema, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, guiding further diagnostic or therapeutic interventions (Fig. 2).

### High dose interleukin-2 (aldesleukin)-expert consensus on best management practices-2014 [^112xNoTs]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Dyspnea/Hypoxia

Management of dyspnea requires astute assessment and medical judgment as to causality. HD IL-2-related respiratory symptoms may develop in relation to local capillary leak or lymphocyte adherence to pulmonary vasculature or generalized fluid overload. However, patients with a smoking history, chronic obstructive lung disease or a history of asthma may have pulmonary symptoms related to bronchospasm, even without significant fluid overload. All of the preceding problems will be associated with decreased oxygen saturation. The treatment will vary according to the specifics. In addition, these patients may be febrile, uncomfortable and anxious and may be tachypneic on that basis without associated hypoxia. Finally, an important metabolic cause of non-hypoxic tachypnea is acidosis.

The frequency of these problems varies, and is related to the center's plan for management of hypotension - aggressive fluid resuscitation versus less fluid and early use of vasopressors. Diuretics are used by some sites, but not recommended by most. The adverse effects on blood pressure and kidney refractoriness within 4 hours of a recent IL-2 dose, make this a relatively futile and counterproductive measure. Hypoxia should be quickly treated with nasal cannula oxygen, with increased support as necessary to maintain oxygen saturation at 95%. In the context of hypotension with an increased demand on the myocardium, adequate oxygenation is critical and patients should not be maintained with suboptimal saturation waiting for recovery. Patients with obstructive pulmonary disease may benefit from regular nebulizer treatments with bronchodilators, and often they are able to continue IL-2. Elevation of the patient's bed is helpful. Performance of a chest radiograph should be reserved for patients with clinical indications for investigation.

### Prevalence of fluid overload in a cohort of patients with acute pancreatitis: results from a retrospective tertiary single-center study [^117T5p5M]. Pancreas (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Aggressive fluid expansion has been an undisputed aspect about navigating the early stages of acute pancreatitis. Evidence produced by the WATERFALL trial supports a more conservative approach to fluid resuscitation as patients face higher odds of fluid overload while experiencing no benefit of their underlying condition. This retrospective monocentric observational study seeks to identify fluid-related complications in patients with acute pancreatitis of any grade of severity.

Methods

One-hundred-twenty-nine patients with acute pancreatitis including moderately severe and severe courses were divided into groups based on their cumulative fluid administration within the first 24 hours (restrictive: < 3 L; moderate: 3–6 L; aggressive: > 6 L). Vital signs and laboratory values were reported at defined time points.

Results

Most patients were allocated to the group of moderate fluid resuscitation. At baseline, patients did not differ in systemic disease severity indicated by critical illness scores. A higher proportion of patients with moderately severe or severe pancreatitis associated with an acute peripancreatic fluid collection had previously been administered > 6 L fluids. C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in patients with > 6 L while albumin levels were decreased. Patients receiving > 6 L fluids were more likely to show radiological features of pulmonary fluid overload and be transferred to intensive care unit. In addition, oxygenation markedly deteriorated in aggressively hydrated patients versus restrictive and moderate fluid regimes.

Conclusion

The extent of fluid resuscitation was found to be strongly associated with the prevalence of clinical and radiological signs of pulmonary fluid overload. Furthermore, moderately severe and severe courses of pancreatitis were more frequently observed in excessively hydrated patients.

### Mimickers of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on chest CT: spectrum of CT and clinical features [^112U549N]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary edema

Pulmonary edema has various types and etiologies with different radiological patterns: cardiogenic pulmonary edema (e.g. congestive heart failure), non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and fluid overload (e.g. renal failure). Both pulmonary edema and COVID 19 infection may have bilateral GGO but with different distribution and other associated signs. The diffuse ground-glass pattern of cardiogenic pulmonary edema tends to be perihilar, bilateral and symmetrical (Fig. 9). Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is presented by acute dyspnea, associated with cardiomegaly and pleural effusion is common, while ARDS has dense-dependent consolidations, with or without interlobular septal thickening, and pleural effusion may occur. Pulmonary edema can also be presented by crazy paving pattern.

Fig. 9
Non-infectious mimickers of indeterminate COVID-19. a, b A 73-year-old man with pulmonary edema, axial and coronal reformatted CT images show bilateral perihilar consolidation and to less extent GGO associated with bilateral pleural effusion and pericardial effusion in mediastinal window (not shown). c, d A 58-year-old woman with acute respiratory distress syndrome, axial and sagittal reformatted CT images shows dependent consolidation and multifocal non-rounded GOO superimposed with interlobular septal thickening (crazy paving)

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

ARDS in adults is a non-specific catastrophic response of the lung to injury. Pneumonia, aspiration of gastric contents, toxic fumes inhalation and near drowning are the common pulmonary causes. The extra-pulmonic causes are systemic sepsis, non-cardiogenic shock, severe trauma, pancreatitis, drug overdose and multiple blood transfusions. Signs and symptoms are dyspnea, cyanosis, tachypnea and hypoxemia mimicking those of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Similar to COVID-19, CT features in extra-pulmonary ARDS are bilateral GGO and consolidations distributed peripherally and mainly in the dependent parts of the lung (Fig. 9). In pulmonary ARDS, the distribution of lung changes is more likely to be asymmetrical, with mixed GGO and non-dependent consolidation. Pleural effusion and bronchial dilatation within GGO are equally common to both types of ARDS.

### Vascular pedicle width in acute lung injury: correlation with intravascular pressures and ability to discriminate fluid status [^115KYj1x]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Multiple studies in patients with a spectrum of intravascular volume ranging from ALI to CHF indicate that the VPW measured from a CXR correlates highly with intravascular pressure and distinguishes cardiogenic from non-cardiogenic edema, but this is the first study to our knowledge assessing the role of this easily measured anatomic landmark among patients exclusively with ALI (a markedly narrower intravascular volume range). VPW correlated moderately well with PAOP and less well with CVP. In multivariate regression, the correlation between VPW and PAOP was stronger than that between net cumulative fluid balance or PEEP and PAOP, while serum albumin did not independently correlate with PAOP. Furthermore, VPW decreased over time in the conservative fluid management strategy arm, but increased in the liberal fluid management arm. VPW, however, was only moderately able to discriminate achievement of the conservative fluid management target of PAOP < 8 mmHg and unable to discriminate achievement of CVP < 4 mm Hg. VPW was also only moderately able to discriminate whether a hydrostatic component of the edema may also be present in these patients with ALI. These new observations provide additional data on the reliability and clinical relevance of this non-invasive radiologic measurement.

Although underutilized, determining intravascular volume status by radiographic appearance has classically revolved around measurement of the VPW and analysis of patterns of lung parenchymal infiltration. A review of acute pulmonary edema recommended the VPW as a potentially useful factor in differentiating cardiogenic from non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Initially characterized in upright posteroanterior CXRs from non-critically ill patients, the VPW measurement has subsequently been shown to have similar predictive ability in ICU patients with anteroposterior supine films. Several investigations have addressed relationships between VPW and intravascular volume status. Other studies have demonstrated the ability of the VPW to differentiate pulmonary edema due to volume overload from that due to acute lung injury. Our optimal cutoff of a VPW ≥ 72 mm for distinguishing a hydrostatic component to the pulmonary edema was similar to the values of 68 and 70 mm found in previous studies. In addition to confirming the findings of these studies, our data also suggest that VPW might be able to be used to identify when hydrostatic edema may be contributing to ALI and whether conservative fluid management targets have been reached in cases where intravascular pressure measurements are not available.

### Correlation between positive fluid balances with venous excess ultrasound scores and lung ultrasound in critically ill children with fluid overload [^116WXh2V]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a real-time, bedside alternative to conventional assessment tools. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is particularly valuable for detecting pulmonary congestion by identifying B-lines, pleural effusions, and subpleural consolidations. Multiple studies have demonstrated that LUS is more sensitive than auscultation or chest radiography in identifying extravascular lung water, even in asymptomatic patients. Its advantages, such as portability, lack of radiation exposure, and applicability in various clinical positions, make LUS highly suitable for pediatric critical care. Moreover, semi-quantitative scoring systems using multi-zone protocols provide structured assessment of pulmonary involvement.

Venous excess ultrasound (VExUS) is a structured ultrasonographic approach to assess systemic venous congestion, integrating inferior vein cava (IVC) diameter with Doppler examination of hepatic, portal, and intrarenal veins. The current prototypes of VExUS grading system consist of VExUS A, B, C, D, and E. The system combines multiple ultrasound markers to categorize congestion into four grades, with higher grade indicating a severe congestion. In adult studies, VExUS has shown stronger correlations with fluid overload, organ dysfunction, and outcomes compared to CVP. In pediatric settings, feasibility studies have demonstrated potential utility, though diagnostic reliability is influenced by age-related differences in venous compliance, respiratory dynamics, and ultrasound window accessibility.

The integration of VExUS and LUS provides a comprehensive and non-invasive framework for evaluating both systemic and pulmonary congestion. LUS identifies interstitial and alveolar fluid accumulation, while VExUS characterizes venous pressure dynamics and organ-level congestion. This combined approach aligns with a physiological model encompassing vascular capacity, fluid redistribution, and early tissue congestion. The complementary strengths of both modalities may enhance the precision of bedside fluid assessment and support more timely and individualized management in pediatric critical care.

This study aimed to examine the correlation between VExUS and LUS scores with early positive fluid balance in critically ill children. Additionally, the study sought to explore their association with clinical signs of congestion.

### What can we learn from chest radiographs in hypoxemic asthmatics? [^116CHtS7]. Pediatric Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Chest radiographs (X-rays) are frequently obtained on children with asthma exacerbations who remain hypoxemic after therapy even though their utility has not been evaluated.

Objective

To compare X-rays in hypoxemic and non-hypoxemic asthmatic children.

Methods

Over 21 months, X-rays were obtained on all persistently hypoxemic asthmatics (1–17 years, oxygen saturation < 93% in room air), and some non-hypoxemic asthmatics. A pediatric radiologist blinded to the patients' symptoms evaluated each X-ray for lung size, extravascular lung fluid, and atelectasis. Clinical outcomes including duration of hypoxemia, length of hospital stay, and admission to the PICU were assessed through chart audit after hospital discharge.

Results

A total of 445 patients were enrolled and stratified into four groups based on initial and post-treatment pulse oximetry measurements. Hypoxemic groups I and II were more likely to have large or small lungs (P < 0.05), severe interstitial fluid (P < 0.01), and atelectasis (P < 0.01) compared to non-hypoxemic group IV. Group I was more likely to have fluid in the alveolar space compared to all other groups (P < 0.01). Within hypoxemic group I, there was no association between any radiographic findings and our clinical outcomes.

Conclusion

Large or small lung sizes, extravascular fluid, and atelectasis were more common in the X-rays of hypoxemic asthmatics.

### Severity scoring of lung oedema on the chest radiograph is associated with clinical outcomes in ARDS [^112w37or]. Thorax (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There is no accurate, non-invasive measurement to estimate the degree of pulmonary oedema in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We developed the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Oedema (RALE) score to evaluate the extent and density of alveolar opacities on chest radiographs. After first comparing the RALE score to gravimetric assessment of pulmonary oedema in organ donors, we then evaluated the RALE score in patients with ARDS for its relationship to oxygenation and clinical outcomes.

Methods

We compared radiographs with excised lung weights from 72 organ donors (derivation cohort) and radiographs with clinical data from 174 patients with ARDS in the ARDSNet Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial (validation cohort). To calculate RALE, each radiographic quadrant was scored for extent of consolidation (0–4) and density of opacification (1–3). The product of the consolidation and density scores for each of the four quadrants was summed (maximum score = 48).

Results

Agreement between two independent reviewers for RALE score was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.93, 95%CI 0.91 to 0.95). In donors, pre-procurement RALE score correlated with height-adjusted total lung weight (ρ = 0.59, p < 0.001). In patients with ARDS, higher RALE scores were independently associated with lower PaO 2 /fractional inspired oxygen and worse survival. Conservative fluid management significantly decreased RALE score over 3 days compared with liberal fluid management.

Conclusions

The RALE score can be used to assess both the extent of pulmonary oedema and the severity of ARDS, by utilising information that is already obtained routinely, safely and inexpensively in every patient with ARDS. This novel non-invasive measure should be useful for assessing ARDS severity and monitoring response to therapy.

### Impact of protocolized diuresis for de-resuscitation in the intensive care unit [^117WTWeY]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

A logistic regression model was defined a priori to be built for all-cause mortality. Forward selection was utilized with variables included in the model if p < 0.05 in the univariate analysis or if deemed biologically plausible and clinically relevant. These initial variables incorporated into the model included SOFA score, DRG weight, age, intervention versus standard therapy assignment, mechanical ventilation time to initiation of first dose of furosemide, net cumulative fluid balance prior to furosemide, and vasoactive therapy. If the intervention group was not to be identified as a significant covariate, it was predetermined that such would be manually entered into the final model to ascertain the point estimate. Collinearity was assessed with the use of variance inflation factors while goodness of fit was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.

Given the potential for pertinent changes in clinical practice that are unrelated to the protocol, an interrupted time series was performed. Further, given the subjective nature of the inclusion criterion clinical signs of fluid overload determined via chest X-ray or physical exam, a subgroup analysis was performed including only those included based on objective volume status (net positive cumulative fluid balance at furosemide start). A subgroup was also collected for pre- and post-protocol amendments to assure no significant impact on clinical outcome.

### Relationship between noninvasive assessment of lung fluid volume and invasively measured cardiac hemodynamics [^114GKvpG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We evaluated the correlation between ReDS assessment of lung fluid volume and invasive measurement of PAWP in patients undergoing RHC for any indications. Our main findings are as follows: (1) A good correlation exists between ReDS and PAWP. (2) ReDS has high sensitivity and specificity to detect abnormally high PAWP that would trigger changes in medical therapy. (3) ReDS reading in the normal range has a high negative predictive value of (95%) in ensuring the PAWP is < 18 mm Hg.

The current available noninvasive tools for the HF practitioner to assess fluid congestion include physical examination, chest x‐ray, and B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Both physical examination and chest x‐ray are prone to operator experience, subjective interpretation, and basic limitations, which renders them relatively unreliable. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 BNP and NT‐proBNP (N‐terminal pro‐BNP) are useful to support the diagnoses or exclusion of HF in patients with dyspnea and have shown value in risk stratification. 19, 20, 21 However, their performance as a quantitative parameter in relation to the extent of fluid overload is limited. Moreover, clinical studies have yielded conflicting results in establishing them as HF management tools. 22, 23

A reliable, safe, easy‐to evaluate, and noninvasive tool for the assessment of pulmonary fluid status could replace the need for an invasive test or permanent implantable device and would be of great value in both clinical and economic terms in the long‐term management of ambulatory patients with HF by providing an actionable measure that can trigger HF‐specific therapies.

HF practitioners could benefit from an HF‐related vital sign, such as ReDS, much like blood pressure or glucose for systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus, respectively. ReDS technology is an actionable day‐to‐day parameter that is directly related to fluid volume, according to which the HF treatment can be titered. 8, 24, 25 The results of this study demonstrated high negative predictive value of ReDS (95%) and suggested that ReDS can fill this unmet clinical need.

### Simplified lung ultrasound protocol shows excellent prediction of extravascular lung water in ventilated intensive care patients [^112VX4Tr]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Because blinding of the ultrasound examiner to the appearance and clinical volume status of the patient was hardly possible, we recorded screenshots of the ultrasound examination and asked two independent examiners to reassess the US score in a blinded manner. Correlation with EVLWI remained significant as a surrogate for good reproducibility. We believe that the correlation coefficient was slightly lower in the blinded analysis because static screenshots were analyzed, whereas the dynamic real-time examination would be more sensitive in detecting B lines that move with pleural sliding images. Nevertheless, only an examination by two independent operators within a narrow time window would prove good reproducibility. This is clearly a limitation of our study.

Correlation of US score and EVLWI with the PaO₂/FiO₂ was significant but rather weak. This is in agreement with earlier findings and is not unexpected, given the fact that fluid overload is only one of many factors influencing the pulmonary gas exchange. Assessment of the chest radiographs using a numeric scale revealed a significant but weak correlation with the EVLWI. Given the fact that the correlation of the chest radiographs to the EVLWI was worse than that of the US score, and keeping in mind the risks to the patient associated with radiation exposure due to repeated radiologic examinations and the fact that chest radiographs are not always readily available at the bedside, we conclude that the ultrasound examination might be a better way to conduct an EVLW assessment in the ICU. Researchers in previous studies also reported conflicting results regarding the performance of chest radiographs in predicting pulmonary hyperhydration, interstitial syndrome or high cardiac filling pressures. Our data suggest that lung ultrasound is a valuable method to use for assessing EVLW at the bedside of the ventilated ICU patient.

One of the major limitations of our study is the fact that it was done at a single center. We did not compare different protocols using, for example, an 8- or even a 28-zone approach, so no final conclusions can be drawn regarding the superiority of either protocol. We defined transpulmonary thermodilution as our standard method. No consensus has been reached so far regarding the threshold for a pathologic EVLW level. The cutoff values of 7 and 15 ml/kg used in our study were chosen on the basis of different reported mortality rates in critically ill patients associated with these values, but they remain arbitrary. Nevertheless, the results of using lung ultrasound as a bedside tool in the ICU are promising and should prompt further studies to evaluate its utility for making diagnoses and guiding therapy.

### TACO and TRALI: visualising transfusion lung injury on plain film [^111VK4mA]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Description

A 63-year-old woman with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus was admitted to the intensive care unit for increased respiratory support following large-volume fluid administration to treat diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient was intubated and diagnosed with mild acute respiratory distress syndrome; the clinical status was improving when a unit of blood was administered for chronic anaemia. Ten minutes into blood administration, the patient became acutely hypoxic (SpO₂ 70%) and hypertensive (200/100 mm Hg). Administration was halted, and a stat chest X-ray (CXR) obtained. Clinical examination was notable for prominent jugular venous distension, unremarkable on earlier examination. A morning CXR obtained 90 min prior (figure 1) was compared with the one obtained post-reaction (figure 2), demonstrating sudden, dramatic worsening of bilateral lung opacities. Supportive care was initiated with oxygen and diuresis, and the symptoms resolved 30 min following cessation of blood product administration. Investigation of blood products for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies and human neutrophil antigen (HNA) antibodies was initiated and ultimately was negative. It was determined that the clinical presentation and symptoms were most consistent with transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO).

### Ultrasonography for clinical decision-making and intervention in airway management: from the mouth to the lungs and pleurae [^115ppKWu]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Non-cardiogenic IS

IS has been described in various interstitial lung diseases, ARDS, pneumonia and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Often, the location of the B-lines does not follow gravitational rules in many of these conditions. The pleural line may appear thickened and fragmented, some spared areas may be devoid of B-lines, and subpleural consolidations may be seen. In other cases of pulmonary oedema from fluid overload and renal failure, the LUS findings will be similar to those of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Hence, when IS is detected, supplementary focused echocardiography can be employed in order to establish whether the IS is of cardiogenic origin or not. Even though LUS has a high sensitivity for the detection of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, CT still has a higher sensitivity for the detection of many of the conditions causing non-cardiogenic IS, especially interstitial lung disease. Hence a LUS with normal findings cannot be used to rule out conditions such as interstitial lung disease, and supplementary CT should still be considered since it has a pivotal role in diagnosing, staging and monitoring of these diseases.

Focal B-lines

Occurrence of multiple, isolated, B-lines can both be a normal and pathological sign. Of patients with normal chest imaging, 21–28% have multiple B-lines in the lower lateral intercostal space. Focal areas with multiple B-lines can also be seen in any disease with localised increased density of the lung tissue, e.g. lower lobe pneumonia. If the density increases and the lung tissue becomes filled with fluid, the pattern will change to that of lung consolidation (see section below). Other causes of focal B-lines are pneumonitis, atelectasis, pulmonary contusion, pulmonary embolism, pleural disease and malignancy.

### Diffuse smoking-related lung diseases: insights from a radiologic-pathologic correlation [^114CQ3Kn]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute eosinophilic pneumonia

AEP is an uncommon condition that occurs most frequently in males between the second and forth decades of life. Approximately two-thirds of patients have smoking habits. Changes in smoking habits are known inducers of the development of AEP: initiation of smoking habit, resumption after interruption, and increased frequency of smoking. The clinical presentation is generally unspecific, letting the disease be frequently misdiagnosed as other most common entities such as community-acquired pneumonia. The clinical symptoms are acute, with duration of the respiratory illness of less than a month, and characterized by moderate fever, cough, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, malaise, myalgia, and night sweats. Acute respiratory failure is frequent and mechanical ventilation is often required. Therefore, the disease is severe, and most patients fulfill diagnostic criteria for acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The key to diagnosis is evidence of eosinophilia in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), with more than 25% of eosinophils on the cell count. Nevertheless, blood eosinophils are frequently at normal levels at the beginning of the clinical presentation and may rise after a few days. BAL is sterile with no bacterial growth during the disease course.

Lung biopsy is usually not needed to meet the diagnosis. It shows alveolar and interstitial eosinophilia and alveolar damage. Additional features include nonnecrotizing perivascular inflammation, eosinophilic abscesses, interstitial lymphocytes, organizing fibrinous exudate in the alveoli, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and also involvement of the airway.

Imaging findings are predominant in the lower lungs, showing diffuse consolidations, ground-glass opacities (GGO), ill-defined centrilobular nodules, smooth septal thickening, and unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion (Fig. 9). The radiologic differential includes infection, fluid overload, ALI/ARDS, hypersensitivity to drugs, and pulmonary hemorrhage.

### Lung ultrasound diagnosis of pulmonary edema resulting from excessive fluid absorption during hysteroscopic myomectomy: a case report [^1121eCoh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Lung ultrasonography is highly accurate and radiation-free, making it a preferable option over chest X-rays or CT scans for daily patient management. It aids in the diagnosis and monitoring of pulmonary diseases in diverse clinical scenarios. In our case, we were unable to promptly transfer a patient for a chest X-ray examination in the surgery, however, lung ultrasound has played a crucial role in our ability to detect pulmonary lesions early on. The arterial gas analysis and SpO₂ levels revealed a problem with oxygen exchange, which correlated with the elevated B-lines identified through lung ultrasonography. This result further supports the diagnostic value of pulmonary ultrasound in detecting pulmonary edema in hysteroscopic surgery, even in the absence of pulmonary rales and other clinical symptoms.

Early diagnosis is crucial for effective clinical treatment, while early intervention plays a key role in determining clinical prognosis. Treatment typically involves fluid restriction, diuretics, and close monitoring. The treatment approach depends on the symptoms and severity of the condition. If the patient presents volume overload, the focus of treatment will be on optimising respiratory status through measures such as supplemental oxygen, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or intubation, as necessary. Additionally, correction of hypervolemia will be achieved by using a loop diuretic. On the other hand, in this case, despite adequate airway and respiratory support being achieved, IV fluids prompted congestion, which improved after negative fluid balance.

In the particular case, we encountered challenges in accurately measuring fluid deficit within an open system. For women with known cardiovascular disease, adapting to sudden significant increases in intravascular fluid can be difficult, increasing the likelihood of complications even at lower levels of fluid deficiency. During surgery, the patient may experience fluid overload, increased cardiac afterload, and the potential for heart failure as a result of untreated hypertension. To address these concerns, we implemented strategies to manage fluid levels during the perioperative period. By restricting intravenous fluids and administering diuretics, we were able to reduce the risk of fluid overload and buy time for subsequent treatments. In our clinical practice, we have observed the benefits of administering furosemide preventively within 30 min of surgery while this method falls under empirical administration and has not been compared to other approaches, there are similar recommendations in the existing literature. By administering preventive medication, we have seen a reduction in clinical symptoms and an improvement in the overall surgical process. In the meantime, it is better to stop the procedure before a potential life-threatening for the patient.

### Impact of protocolized diuresis for de-resuscitation in the intensive care unit [^115DSSb6]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Patient selection

This was a pilot study to evaluate a service line level change in diuresis practice. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation with a net-positive or -even cumulative fluid or clinical signs of fluid overload determined via chest X-ray or physical exam between April 1, 2018, and April 1, 2019, received the diuresis protocol (see Additional file 1). Inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarized in Additional file 1. Patients were assessed for inclusion and exclusion daily while in the ICU. In order to approximate an experimental design using observational electronic health record (EHR) data, each patient visit within the intervention group was matched to three patient visits meeting the above inclusion and exclusion criteria from the historical time period of all Medical ICU admits between January 2016 and December 2017 who received furosemide. Diuresis practices in the historical group were non-protocolized and left to physician discretion. Patients who met the inclusion criteria from the historical cohort who were not matched with a patient from the intervention group were excluded from the analysis to prevent significant heterogeneity between groups.

Chest radiography — abnormal findings are present in most patients with pulmonary hypertension, yet a normal chest X-ray does not exclude the diagnosis; characteristic signs include a configuration of the cardiac silhouette due to right heart (right atrium [RA]/RV) and pulmonary artery enlargement with pruning of peripheral vessels, and additional signs may indicate the underlying cause such as left heart disease or lung disease.

### Assessment and prevalence of pulmonary oedema in contemporary acute heart failure trials: a systematic review [^1156RzjU]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

Pulmonary oedema is a common and important finding in acute heart failure (AHF). We conducted a systematic review to describe the methods used to assess pulmonary oedema in recent randomized AHF trials and report its prevalence in these trials.

Methods and Results

Of 23 AHF trials published between 2002 and 2013, six were excluded because they were very small or not randomized, or missing full-length publications. Of the remaining 17 (n = 200–7141) trials, six enrolled patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF) and 11, patients with both HF-REF and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF). Pulmonary oedema was an essential inclusion criterion, in most trials, based upon findings on physical examination ('rales'), radiographic criteria ('signs of congestion'), or both. The prevalence of pulmonary oedema in HF-REF trials ranged from 75% to 83% and in combined HF-REF and HF-PEF trials from 51% to 100%. Five trials did not report the prevalence or extent of pulmonary oedema assessed by either clinical examination or chest x-ray. Improvement of pulmonary congestion with treatment was inconsistently reported and commonly grouped with other signs of congestion into a score. One trial suggested that patients with rales over > 2/3 of the lung fields on admission were at higher risk of adverse outcomes than those without.

Conclusion

Although pulmonary oedema is a common finding in AHF, represents a therapeutic target, and may be of prognostic importance, recent trials used inconsistent criteria to define it, and did not consistently report its severity at baseline or its response to treatment. Consistent and ideally quantitative, methods for the assessment of pulmonary oedema in AHF trials are needed.

### Improving diagnostic accuracy in assessing pulmonary edema on bedside chest radiographs using a standardized scoring approach [^114i1nfW]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Due to the fact that we only assessed 10 bedside CXRs showing pulmonary edema we are not able to establish which imaging criteria best correlate with the EVLW categories. However, Table 1 shows weighting of the different criteria based on findings of previously published research. A higher maximum score means that the corresponding criterion shows extravascular water more distinctively. For example, the criterion "enlarged hilar vessels" got a maximum score of 3 points because it may have multiple causes and it does not show extravascular water indeed. In contrast, the criteria "extensive perihilar haze" and "diffuse increase in density" are caused by and actually represent extravascular water and therefore got a maximum score of 15 points.

Further, we did not distinguish between the different causes of pulmonary edema. Several authors determined criteria to differentiate between cardiogenic, renal, and injury patterns of pulmonary edema with the CRXs being performed predominantly with the patient in an upright position and with a posterior-anterior radiation beam. However, we included bedside CXRs with an anterior-posterior radiation beam and the objective of the present study was to assess pulmonary edema independently of its cause.

### A deep learning model enables accurate prediction and quantification of pulmonary edema from chest X-rays [^113qoeBk]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary edema is one of the most common findings in chest radiographs and has important clinical consequences. By impeding the gas exchange and reducing lung compliance, severe pulmonary edema is potentially life threatening. Measuring and monitoring pulmonary edema is useful in many, but especially important in critically ill patients.

Technically, the attenuation of X-rays should be proportional to the amount of lung water, and thus, a chest radiograph should be a valuable tool in monitoring the amount of pulmonary edema. Commonly, radiologists rate the severity on a categorical scale. A quantitative measure for pulmonary edema widely used for critically ill patients is the extravascular lung water (EVLW) which is defined as the amount of water accumulating in the lungs outside of the pulmonary vasculature. Measurement of EVLW by transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD), although invasive, shows good correlation with the gold standard ex vivo method of gravimetry. However, mixed results have been reported in the literature with the grade of correlation of clinicians' chest X-ray reports or clinicians' scores to extravascular lung water (EVLW), ranging from good over modest to poor.

Recently Horng et al. used a radiologist-based categorical four grade severity score to train a deep learning classification system on chest radiographs and report a high performance. To our knowledge, our present study is the first to explore the usefulness of deep learning in predicting the quantitative pulmonary edema measure EVLW from chest radiographs.

### Non-traumatic thoracic emergencies: imaging and treatment of thoracic fluid collections (including pneumothorax) [^114EWN4H]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Cross-sectional imaging has revolutionised the radiological diagnosis of pleural collections. Not only can the precise location and volume of a pleural effusion be established, but also features specific for the aetiology of the effusion can be demonstrated. Increasingly, radiologists are called upon to perform image-guided biopsies, aspirations and small bore chest drain placement, all of which have been shown to be safe and efficacious. Pneumothoraces occurring due to acute trauma and in an intensive care setting can also benefit from radiological input, both in terms of diagnosis and image-guided treatment.

### Bedside ultrasound versus chest radiography for detection of pulmonary edema: a prospective cohort study [^116YdQfN]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Chest radiography has been the preferred imaging study to assess pulmonary congestion. However, chest radiography interpretation is influenced by the level of expertise and high interobserver variability. Lung ultrasound (US) may produce more objective findings through evaluation of vertical comet tail artifacts known as B-lines, which are created by a decrease in the ratio of alveolar air to fluid pulmonary content. Few studies have directly compared chest radiography to bedside US against a reference standard for the diagnosis of pulmonary edema. This study compared the sensitivity and specificity of bedside US and chest radiography in diagnosing pulmonary edema.

Methods

This prospective observational cohort study involved adult patients presenting to the emergency department of an urban tertiary hospital with dyspnea. The primary outcome was the presence or absence of pulmonary edema, as indicated by B-lines on a bedside lung US examination or radiologist-interpreted chest radiography. Patients underwent a US examination within about 1 hour of chest radiography. The final diagnosis from the discharge summary served as the reference standard.

Results

Ninety-nine patients were enrolled; 32.3% had congestive heart failure, and 40.4% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Bedside US showed significantly higher sensitivity (96%) compared to chest radiography (65%; P < .001). Of 18 patients with negative radiographic findings and a discharge diagnosis of pulmonary edema, 16 (89%) had positive US findings (P < .001).

Conclusions

Bedside US has the potential to identify pulmonary edema more accurately than chest radiography. As current practice within the United States uses chest radiography, reflecting American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guidelines for management of heart failure, the results of this study warrant further evaluation.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: imaging of the injured lung [^117QQRGB]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

In patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), there is non-specific but widespread exudation of oedema and inflammatory fluid into the lungs. The clinical corollary (dyspnoea, refractory hypoxia, reduced pulmonary compliance and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates) is catastrophic and generally associated with a poor outcome. Imaging is integral to the care of these critically ill patients on the intensive care unit. In the present review, the radiological changes on plain radiography and computed tomography (CT) in patients with ARDS are discussed. Particular attention is directed at the appearances on CT: the relationships between CT features, histopathological changes and the inevitable alterations in pulmonary physiology are explored.

Despite the therapeutic advances and improvements in ventilation complications of therapy arise, particularly in the very premature infants.

A patent ductus arteriosus is common in premature infants and is thought to contribute to the lung disease.

Positive pressure ventilation in these premature infants is the most common cause of complications such as pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pnuemopericardium, and pulmonary interstitial emphysema. These air leaks are less common since the more routine use of artificial surfactant and high frequency ventilation.

Focal atelectasis, due to tube malposition of the endotracheal tube, poor clearance of secretions or mucous plugging is also a common complication of surfactant deficiency.

Pulmonary haemorrhage may also develop in infants with hyaline membrane disease secondary to severe hypoxia and capillary damage.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or chronic lung disease, described by Northway in 1967, is a long-term consequence of neonatal lung disease. It occurs most commonly after treatment for hyaline membrane disease with mechanical ventilation but may occur following any lung condition which leads to prolonged oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation. The incidence of BPD has not changed significantly despite the many advances in ventilatory support and the introduction of artificial surfactant. This is largely due to the survival nowadays of very low birth weight premature infants. However, its severity has decreased, particularly in infants greater than 28 weeks gestation.

During fetal life the lungs are expanded with fluid, an ultrafiltrate of fetal serum which contributes to amniotic fluid volume. During and after birth the fluid is removed by the pulmonary lymphatics and capillaries. When there is slow or incomplete removal of the lung fluid the infant may suffer from transient tachypnoea of the newborn and the condition most commonly occurs in term infants. The incidence is increased in infants delivered by caesarian section. It is postulated that the absence of squeezing of the thorax during passage through the vaginal canal results in retention of lung fluid. The condition is also reported in infants with hypoproteinaemia, hyponatraemia, maternal fluid overload, small hypotonic or sedated infants and infants who have experienced a precipitous delivery. The most common radiographic appearance is mild overaeration of the lungs, perihilar interstitial shadowing, prominent blood vessels and the presence of fluid in the horizontal fissure. Occasionally there is a small pleural effusion and mild cardiomegaly.

### Extravascular lung water in patients with severe sepsis: a prospective cohort study [^113Ffwfo]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. The size of the study prevents absolute conclusions from being drawn regarding EVLW in patients with severe sepsis, although these results stand as the largest prospective evaluation of EVLW in patients with severe sepsis. The transpulmonary thermodilution technique employed for measuring EVLW has been well validated in critically ill patients despite prior concerns that severe ventilation–perfusion mismatch may preclude access to the complete pulmonary vascular bed. All chest radiographs were interpreted by a single experienced critical care physician to reduce variability in interpretation of chest radiographs. The apparent insensitivity of the consensus ARDS definition may be improved with consideration of less severe forms of lung injury, although this is operationally differentiated by the severity of hypoxemia rather than the discrepant factor in our study, namely evidence of pulmonary edema on chest radiograph. The finding that ARDS patients with higher EVLW have increased mortality, as well as the finding of no difference in mortality among severe sepsis patients stratified by EVLW, may be due to statistical power or inherent heterogeneity in the sepsis and ARDS patient populations (beyond such identified disparities as baseline fluid balance).

### Right-sided hydrothorax: a peritoneal dialysis dilemma [^116CavDs]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

We present a 23-year-old female patient with a chief complaint of progressively worsening dyspnoea of 2 days duration. Her medical history was significant for end stage renal disease secondary to membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. A peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter was placed 8 weeks prior to admission. She did not miss any of the PD sessions prior to this admission. Vital signs were significant for hypoxemia. Physical examination was remarkable for right-sided basilar crackles with no other signs of fluid overload. A chest X-ray demonstrated the presence of a large right-sided pleural effusion. Right-sided thoracentesis was performed, with subsequent pleural fluid analysis concerning for a pleuroperitoneal leak. CT peritoneography performed confirming the diagnosis as contrast material leaked through the inferior vena cava (IVC) diaphragmatic foramen into the right pleural space. Surgical intervention was deferred in light of the close proximity of the defect to the IVC. The patient was transitioned to haemodialysis for temporary cessation of PD.

### Radiologic determination of intravascular volume status using portable, digital chest radiography: a prospective investigation in 100 patients [^1112Yfj6]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To answer the following questions: Can the digital chest roentgenogram (CXR) be used to differentiate patients' volume status? Do clinical data alter radiologists' accuracy in interpreting the digital CXR?

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Nine adult intensive care units of a tertiary care medical center.

Patients

One hundred thirty-five consecutive patients with pulmonary artery catheters, of whom 35 were excluded because of unacceptable pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) tracings.

Methods

Each patient had a portable, anteroposterior, supine digital CXR. Clinicians evaluated volume status and then measured hemodynamic data within 1 hr of the CXR. Digital CXRs were independently interpreted on two separate occasions (with and without clinical information) by three experienced chest radiologists, and these interpretations were compared with hemodynamic data.

Results

Of the 100 patients, 39 had PAOP > 18 mm Hg, whereas 61 had PAOP < 18 mm Hg. Radiologists' accuracy in differentiating volume status increased with incorporation of clinical data (56% without vs. 65% with clinical data, p = .009). Using objective receiver operating characteristic-derived cutoffs of 70 mm for vascular pedicle width and 0.55 for cardiothoracic ratio, radiologists' accuracy in differentiating PAOP > 18 mm Hg from PAOP < 18 mm Hg was 70%. The intrareader and the inter-reader correlation coefficients were very high. The likelihood ratio of the CXR in determining volume status using the objective vascular pedicle width and cardiothoracic ratio measures was 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.9–6.0), significantly higher than subjective CXR interpretations with and without clinical data (p < .001).

Conclusions

Differentiating intravascular volume status with portable, supine, digital CXRs may be improved by using objective cutoffs of vascular pedicle width > 70 mm and cardiothoracic ratio > 0.55 or by incorporating clinical data.

### A new global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1157Sskd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In keeping with the conceptual model of ARDS as a diffuse process, the committee retained the requirement for bilateral opacities on chest imaging, though they recognized that both chest radiography and lung ultrasound, though widely available, are highly interpreter-dependent. Furthermore, though promising, radiographic scoring systems such as the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema Score, were ultimately not included, because they require further prospective validation. Future research should consider whether formal radiographic scoring systems should be integrated into the definition of ARDS. The committee did not select a preferred imaging modality for the diagnosis of ARDS, as there is insufficient evidence to support a single modality as the gold standard.

The committee also endorsed the use of ultrasound for detection of bilateral (noncardiogenic) pulmonary edema or consolidation, especially when chest radiography or computed tomography is not available, with the caveat that the operator must be trained in thoracic ultrasound for this purpose. Ultrasound is particularly useful in resource-limited settings in which radiography is not routinely available. When performed by adequately trained operators, ultrasound can reliably detect signs that are associated with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Although the presence of multiple B lines and/or consolidations (i.e. ultrasound findings associated with loss of aeration) bilaterally can be useful in diagnosing ARDS, it has been suggested that relying exclusively on them might lead to oversensitivity and only moderate specificity. Recent studies suggest that integrating these findings with other sonographic signs, such as pleural line abnormalities, may improve diagnostic accuracy, especially specificity. Further studies should involve multiple operators across a range of clinical settings (Table 3). One recent study and an accompanying commentary considered several of these issues. The committee recommended that appropriate training in the use of lung ultrasound should be emphasized.

### Radiographic evaluation of the pleural fluid accumulation rate after pneumonectomy [^117EyD7L]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Understanding the radiographic appearance and normal rate of fluid accumulation after pneumonectomy is important in order to detect postoperative complications.

Methods

Upright posterior-anterior chest radiographs of 94 postpneumonectomy patients were assessed for the rate of pleural fluid accumulation as a percentage of hemithorax volume.

Results

Overall median time to 70% hemithoracic opacification was 3 days and mean time was 27 days. The median time to 100% opacification was 66 days and mean time was 96 days.

Conclusion

The median time to 70% hemithoracic opacification postpneumonectomy is 3 days, while median time to 100% opacification was 66 days.

### Pulmonary edema and blood volume after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a prospective observational study [^111J1s76]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Furthermore, any formation of PED implies a fluid shift from the vascular system to the lung tissue. Therefore, the occurrence of PED could contribute to a further reduction in blood volume.

A limitation of our study is that the diagnosis of PED was based on clinical criteria in combination with chest radiograph findings. The physicians responsible for patient care were not blinded for treatment allocation. This may have contributed to an increase of PED diagnosed in the intervention group, because some clinicians believed that patients in the intervention group were at increased risk for hypervolemia and pulmonary edema. We did not categorize the severity of edema. Less-severe instances of pulmonary edema may have escaped detection, as extravascular lung water must increase by > 30% for edema to be visible on a chest radiograph. We did not routinely monitor central venous pressure or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in these patients, because of the poor relation between these pressures and actual volume status. Another limitation concerns the definition of normal blood volume. Previous studies found "normal" blood volume values in adults of ~70 ml/kg. However, the changes in blood volume that occur as a result of illness or therapy are incompletely understood. For this reason, we used wide margins in our definition of normovolemia (60–80 ml/kg). Even with these large margins, patients developing PED fell outside this range and were considered hypovolemic.

Notably, volume status is only one of the factors determining the adequacy of tissue perfusion. To evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status, many hemodynamic parameters must be taken into consideration together and seen in the context of the overall clinical condition.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111mNB2M]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Chest radiograph — imaging signs of right-sided disease include a globular cardiac silhouette in cases of significant right ventricular (RV) enlargement, loss of the retrosternal airspace on a lateral projection indicating RV enlargement, and rightward displacement of the cardiac silhouette, well beyond the spine, which almost always represents right atrial (RA) enlargement. With coexisting pulmonary hypertension (PH), the main pulmonary artery (PA) will be enlarged and the distal PA branches may have a "pruned" appearance, and elevated central venous pressure (CVP) may be recognized by an enlarged azygous vein. Pulmonary vascular redistribution, increased interstitial markings, and Kerley lines are signs of pulmonary venous hypertension, and pleural effusions are frequent in severe right heart failure (RHF), particularly when pulmonary and systemic venous pressures are both elevated.

### Fluid challenge revisited [^112mYD2U]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the rationale, technique, and clinical application of the fluid challenge.

Data Source

Relevant literature from MEDLINE and authors' personal databases.

Study Selection

Studies on fluid challenge in the acutely ill.

Data Extraction

Based largely on clinical experience and assessment of the relevant published literature, we propose that the protocol should include four variables, namely 1) the type of fluid administered, 2) the rate of fluid administration, 3) the critical end points, and 4) the safety limits.

Conclusions

A protocol for routine fluid challenge is proposed with defined rules and based on the patient's response to the volumes infused. The technique allows for prompt correction of fluid deficits yet minimizes the risks of fluid overload.

Learning Objectives

On completion of this article, the reader should be able to: 1. Explain the signs of hypovolemia. 2. Describe how to administer a fluid challenge. 3. Use this information in a clinical setting.

### Assessment of pulmonary edema: principles and practice [^117QdsNE]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Pulmonary edema increasingly is recognized as a perioperative complication affecting outcome. Several risk factors have been identified, including those of cardiogenic origin, such as heart failure or excessive fluid administration, and those related to increased pulmonary capillary permeability secondary to inflammatory mediators. Effective treatment requires prompt diagnosis and early intervention. Consequently, over the past 2 centuries a concentrated effort to develop clinical tools to rapidly diagnose pulmonary edema and track response to treatment has occurred. The ideal properties of such a tool would include high sensitivity and specificity, easy availability, and the ability to diagnose early accumulation of lung water before the development of the full clinical presentation. In addition, clinicians highly value the ability to precisely quantify extravascular lung water accumulation and differentiate hydrostatic from high permeability etiologies of pulmonary edema. In this review, advances in understanding the physiology of extravascular lung water accumulation in health and in disease and the various mechanisms that protect against the development of pulmonary edema under physiologic conditions are discussed. In addition, the various bedside modalities available to diagnose early accumulation of extravascular lung water and pulmonary edema, including chest auscultation, chest roentgenography, lung ultrasonography, and transpulmonary thermodilution, are examined. Furthermore, advantages and limitations of these methods for the operating room and intensive care unit that are critical for proper modality selection in each individual case are explored.

### Better with ultrasound: thoracic ultrasound [^115ukbtJ]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound examination of the thorax is superior to chest radiograph or physical examination for diagnosing common conditions such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax. The basic skill set is straightforward to learn, quick to perform, repeatable, and does not involve patient transport, harmful ionizing radiation, or waiting time. This paper outlines the basic building blocks that makeup a thoracic ultrasound examination, regardless of which specific scanning protocol is performed. Narrative videos and illustrative figures demonstrating these techniques are included.

### Diagnostic studies in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1158FUTR]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical-radiological diagnosis. Clinical diagnosis comprises severe hypoxemia assessed by arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of less than 200 and bilateral infiltrate on a chest radiograph in the absence of left atrial hypertension. The sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis vary based on the underlying etiology for ARDS. Except for presence of bilateral infiltrate on chest radiograph and severe hypoxemia on arterial blood gas, most diagnostic studies are used to exclude mimics of ARDS and potentially modify treatment. Computerized tomography of the chest is helpful in understanding the extent of the disease and is more sensitive in identifying pneumomediastinum and pneumothoraces seen frequently in patients with ARDS, which can be missed on a chest radiograph, especially if they are small in size. Measurements of alveolar dead space ventilation fraction can be helpful in determining the prognosis in individuals with ARDS. Bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial lung biopsy, and open lung biopsies can be safely performed in patients with ARDS. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with ARDS shows neutrophil predominance with increased edema fluid to serum protein ratio. Diffuse alveolar damage, a pathognomic of ARDS, is seen on histopathology on transbronchial lung biopsy or open lung biopsy. Most common complications of these procedures include transient hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis, and pneumothorax with occasional persistent air leak. The potential risk of diagnostic studies should be balanced against the possible foreseeable benefits of the diagnostic studies.

Interstitial fluid and pulmonary oedema

Quantification of B-lines (vertical artefacts that result from an increase in interstitial density; FIG. 1b) has been shown to be useful for the diagnosis, monitoring, and risk assessment of patients with known or suspected AHF –. Either curvilinear or phased array transducers can be used, typically at an imaging depth of 18 cm. Although the assessment of eight or more anterior and lateral thoracic zones (four on each hemithorax) has been recommended in a consensus statement, a subsequent study demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy with examination of only six thoracic regions. The visualization of three or more B-lines in two or more intercostal spaces bilaterally should be considered diagnostic for pulmonary oedema, with sensitivity of 94% (95% CI 81–98%) and specificity of 92% (95% CI 84–96%). By contrast, physical examination and chest radiography have a sensitivity of only 62% (95% CI 61–64%) and 57% (95% CI 55–59%), and a specificity of 68% (95% CI 67–69%) and 89% (95% CI 88–90%) for a diagnosis of pulmonary oedema, respectively. The presence of multiple bilateral B-lines in AHF has been well-correlated with natriuretic peptide levels, and only variably correlated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and measures of extravascular lung water. Given that studies to assess the incremental diagnostic value of LUS compared with natriuretic peptides for the identification of AHF in patients with dyspnoea reported variable results in different cohorts, this topic warrants further investigation. The number of B-lines is thought to decrease with treatment for AHF and, therefore, this technique is potentially useful in the monitoring of pulmonary oedema in response to therapy. For serial assessments, patient positioning (sitting versus supine) should be kept consistent. Importantly, a higher number of B-lines on LUS at the time of discharge from hospital might help to identify patients with heart failure who have a worse prognosis.

Pleural effusion

Similarly to B-lines, the presence of pleural effusions can be assessed using curvilinear or phased array transducers in the posterior–axillary line(FIG. 1d). Current data regarding the diagnostic utility of pleural effusions identified on ultrasonography in patients with AHF are less robust, but have been reported with sensitivities of 79–84% and specificities of 83–98% in small studies of patients with dyspnoea.

### Ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of pleural effusions [^114RYkW7]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

We review the literature on the use of point-of-care ultrasound to evaluate and manage pleural effusions. Point-of-care ultrasound is more sensitive than physical exam and chest radiography to detect pleural effusions, and avoids many negative aspects of computerized tomography. Additionally, point-of-care ultrasound can assess pleural fluid volume and character, revealing possible underlying pathologies and guiding management. Thoracentesis performed with ultrasound guidance has lower risk of pneumothorax and bleeding complications. Future research should focus on the clinical effectiveness of point-of-care ultrasound in the routine management of pleural effusions and how new technologies may expand its clinical utility.

### Dasatinib [^117MGaWL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Fluid Retention

Dasatinib may cause fluid retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. After 5 years of follow-up in the adult randomized newly diagnosed chronic phase CML study (n = 258), Grade 3 or 4 fluid retention was reported in 5% of patients, including 3% of patients with Grade 3 or 4 pleural effusion. In adult patients with newly diagnosed or imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic phase CML, Grade 3 or 4 fluid retention occurred in 6% of patients treated with dasatinib at the recommended dose (n = 548). In adult patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL treated with dasatinib at the recommended dose (n = 304), Grade 3 or 4 fluid retention was reported in 8% of patients, including Grade 3 or 4 pleural effusion reported in 7% of patients. In pediatric patients with chronic phase CML, cases of Grade 1 or 2 fluid retention were reported in 10.3% of patients.

Evaluate patients who develop symptoms of pleural effusion or other fluid retention, such as new or worsened dyspnea on exertion or at rest, pleuritic chest pain, or dry cough, promptly with a chest x-ray or additional diagnostic imaging as appropriate. Fluid retention events were typically managed by supportive care measures that may include diuretics or short courses of steroids. Severe pleural effusion may require thoracentesis and oxygen therapy. Consider dose reduction or treatment interruption [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

5.4 Cardiovascular Toxicity

Dasatinib can cause cardiac dysfunction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. After 5 years of follow-up in the randomized newly diagnosed chronic phase CML trial in adults (n = 258), the following cardiac adverse reactions occurred: cardiac ischemic events (3.9% dasatinib vs 1.6% imatinib), cardiac-related fluid retention (8.5% dasatinib vs 3.9% imatinib), and conduction system abnormalities, most commonly arrhythmia and palpitations (7.0% dasatinib vs 5.0% imatinib). Two cases (0.8%) of peripheral arterial occlusive disease occurred with imatinib and 2 (0.8%) transient ischemic attacks occurred with dasatinib. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac dysfunction and treat appropriately.

### Postoperative acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia in pulmonary and non-pulmonary surgery: a retrospective study [^117Wyjub]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population and covariates

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Nagasaki University Hospital (approval number 17112011) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was not required in view of the retrospective study design and the anonymity of the patient records reviewed, pursuant to the ethical guidelines of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. The study population comprised a cohort of consecutive patients with IP detected by high-resolution CT (HRCT) who underwent surgery under general anesthesia at Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan, from April 2008 to October 2017. Preoperative chest HRCT images were used to identify IP. Preoperative patient characteristics, laboratory findings, and anesthetic management obtained from the clinical records were compared between patients who experienced AE-IP postoperatively and those who did not.

Diagnostic criteria for acute exacerbation

Previously published criteria were used to define postoperative AE-IP, i.e. onset within 30 days after surgery, extra-parenchymal cause excluded, and new bilateral ground glass opacity/consolidation on CT not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. Patients with cardiac failure and fluid overload were excluded by echocardiography and responded to diuretics. Pulmonary infections were evaluated by sputum and blood culture, and other serological and urinary studies for the following pathogens and pathogen components including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus antigen, β-D glucan, Legionella spp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Evaluation of HRCT findings

The HRCT scans of the chest were interpreted independently and in random order by two pulmonary radiologists (ST, KA) without knowledge of the clinical status of the patients. Divergent observations were resolved by consensus after consultation between the two observers. All the HRCT scans were acquired in the 6 months before surgery. Chest CT images were classified according to the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines. Based on the guidelines, UIP or probable UIP pattern was categorized into a UIP group and indeterminate UIP pattern or alternative diagnostic findings were categorized into a non-UIP pattern. Patients with UIP or probable UIP pattern of unknown cause were diagnosed to have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

Material and methods

Study population

Beginning in May 2012, a randomized trial of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in ARDS patients was carried out in our center (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01585922). From May 2012 to April 2014, all adult patients with ARDS caused by pneumonia who were admitted to the respiratory ICU of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital were prospectively enrolled. Severe ARDS was diagnosed according to the Berlin definition: (1) developing within 1 week of a known clinical insult or new or worsening respiratory symptoms; (2) bilateral opacities not fully explained by effusions, lobar and/or lung collapse, or nodules; (3) respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload; (4) partial oxygen pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO₂/FiO₂) ≤ 100 mmHg with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ≥ 5 cmH₂O; and (5) a chest radiograph with three or four quadrants with opacities. Patients with HAdV-55 infection and severe ARDS who failed conventional NPPV and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) were included in the analysis. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital (LLKYPJ2012031). Data were analyzed anonymously. Each patient gave written informed consent for their data to be used for research and publication.

Clinical data collection

Clinical information collected by investigators with a standardized data form included the following: demographic characteristics (age and sex), comorbidities, clinical symptoms (fever, cough, sputum, dyspnea, chest pain, rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and headache), signs (body temperature, heart rate, respiratory frequency, blood pressure and crackles in the lungs), laboratory tests (whole-blood cell count and blood chemistry) and microbiological findings and images of the lung (chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography). Concomitant medications, respiratory support, complications and outcomes were also recorded.

Practical use of beta-blockers — risks of treatment: fluid retention and worsening HF indicates initiation of treatment has produced 4 types of adverse reactions, and initiation of therapy with a beta-blocker can cause fluid retention that is usually asymptomatic and is detected primarily by an increase in body weight but may become sufficiently marked to cause worsening symptoms of HF; physicians should ensure that patients are not volume overloaded before a beta-blocker is initiated, should monitor patients closely for increases in weight and for worsening signs and symptoms of HF, and should augment the dose of diuretic if weight increases whether or not other signs or symptoms of worsening HF are present; the occurrence of fluid retention or worsening HF is not generally a reason for the permanent withdrawal of treatment, as such patients generally respond favorably to intensification of conventional therapy and once treated remain excellent candidates for long-term treatment with a beta-blocker.

### Vascular pedicle width in acute lung injury: correlation with intravascular pressures and ability to discriminate fluid status [^115Zxkw4]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Our study also has other limitations. The patients enrolled in FACTT are a highly-selected group of patients with acute lung injury. This substudy evaluates data from a subset of the overall FACTT population. However, almost 30% of the enrolled patients were included, with five geographically diverse centers with heterogeneous patient populations participating. Although all the data were collected prospectively during the conduct of the original study, this substudy represents a post-hoc, retrospective analysis. As such, many of the CXR and vascular pressure measurements did not occur simultaneously. To minimize any potential bias this might introduce, we limited our analysis to "matched" measurements and CXRs obtained within three hours of each other. Furthermore, although a VPW of 67 mm, was found to best predict a PAOP < 8 mmHg the relatively few instances that conservative fluid management resulted in target PAOP or CVP measurements being reached resulted in wide confidence intervals for the sensitivity and specificity. Similar to the cutoffs previously defined for differentiating patients with cardiogenic versus noncardiogenic edema, a VPW value of 72 or higher in our study, also discriminated a PAOP of at least 18 mmHg, which could represent cases where volume overload and hydrostatic edema may be contributing to the hypoxia and patients who may benefit from diuresis. Despite only having moderate sensitivity and specificity for predicting either volume overload or conservative fluid status, given its non-invasive nature, relative availability, and moderate sensitivity and sensitivity, we think these data support the use of VPW in a fluid management strategy when other measures, such as intravascular pressure measurements, are unavailable. A suggested algorithm is presented in Figure 5.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of chest radiograph (CXR) findings in COVID-19 [^112twE4E]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Chest radiography (CXR) is most likely to be the utilized modality for diagnosing COVID-19 and following up on any lung-associated abnormalities. This review provides a meta-analysis of the current literature on CXR imaging findings to determine the most common appearances of lung abnormalities in COVID-19 patients in order to equip medical researchers and healthcare professionals in their efforts to combat this pandemic. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The inclusion criteria consisted of: (1) published in English literature; (2) original research study; (3) sample size of at least 5 patients; (4) reporting clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients as well as CXR imaging features; and (5) noting the number of patients with each corresponding imaging feature. A total of 1948 patients were included in this study. To perform the meta-analysis, a random-effects model calculated the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence intervals of abnormal CXR imaging findings. Seventy-four percent (74%) (95% CI: 51–92%) of patients with COVID-19 had an abnormal CXR at the initial time of diagnosis or sometime during the disease course. While there was no single feature on CXR that was diagnostic of COVID-19 viral pneumonia, a characteristic set of findings were obvious. The most common abnormalities were consolidation (28%, 95% CI: 8–54%) and ground-glass opacities (29%, 95% CI: 10–53%). The distribution was most frequently bilateral (43%, 95% CI: 27–60%), peripheral (51%, 95% CI: 36–66%), and basal zone (56%, 95% CI: 37–74%) predominant. Contrary to parenchymal abnormalities, pneumothorax (1%, 95% CI: 0–3%) and pleural effusions (6%, 95% CI: 1–16%) were rare.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^116n5ALu]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Chest imaging — key points in trauma care emphasize that the AP chest radiograph is the single most valuable diagnostic study in the management of chest trauma performed in the trauma receiving area. A chest CT is warranted in all adult patients with high-energy torso trauma, a positive chest radiograph, or positive findings on physical examination, and chest CT has low sensitivity for detection of blunt cardiac injury. In pediatrics, for the pediatric patient with minor abnormalities on chest radiograph, chest CT is reported to have no impact on subsequent management, whereas a chest CT is recommended for children with an abnormal contour of the mediastinum to an age-appropriate shaped chest.

### Bedside chest radiography [^113hs9qh]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

The bedside chest x-ray (CXR) is an indispensible diagnostic tool for monitoring seriously ill patients in the intensive care unit. The CXR often reveals abnormalities that may not be detected clinically. In addition, bedside CXRs are an irreplaceable tool with which to detect the malposition of tubes and lines and to identify associated complications. Although the image quality is often limited, bedside CXRs still provide valuable diagnostic information. The interpretation of the bedside CXRs is often challenging, and requires extensive radiologic experience to avoid misinterpretation of the wide spectrum of pleural and pulmonary disease. The clinical information is of substantial value for the interpretation of the frequently nonspecific findings.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia in children after cardiac surgery in the Netherlands [^116zCCoT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Tan et al. reported an even higher incidence of 21.5% for acquired nosocomial pneumonia in children after cardiac surgery. However, this incidence probably does not reflect the incidence of true VAP, as they did not comment on the temporal relationship with mechanical ventilation. Rates reported in general PICU populations are generally lower than those found in our study: between 2.9 and 11.6 per 1,000 ventilator days. Higher VAP rates for surgical and trauma ICUs versus medical ICUs were reported in the 2004 NNIS survey in both adult and pediatric studies.

There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of VAP in pediatric patients. The diagnostic criteria of VAP remain contentious. We adhered to the criteria proposed by Horan et al. which place an emphasis on identifying a progressive infiltrate in two consecutive chest radiographs in patients with underlying disease. However, in postoperative pediatric cardiac surgical patients it is very difficult to differentiate between infectious infiltrates and pulmonary over-circulation, fluid overload, atelectases and pleural effusion on chest radiographs. This indicates that the criteria proposed by Horan et al. may not be fully applicable to pediatric patients after cardiac surgery. Other criteria include worsening gas exchange, reflected in a worsening PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio and/or an A–a gradient which are already abnormal due to fluid overload, atelectases or intracardiac shunts in many patients after cardiac surgery. In our patients with VAP without shunting (8 of 11) the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio decreased by an average of 16% (from 225 to 188 mmHg) and the A–a gradient doubled on average from 120 to 249 mmHg. Further research is needed to address the issue of diagnosing VAP, especially in this specific patient group. We are currently performing a prospective review of the incidence of VAP.

### Vascular pedicle width in acute lung injury: correlation with intravascular pressures and ability to discriminate fluid status [^1162CfDB]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Correlation between VPW measurements from the portable chest radiograph with the PAOP represented the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included correlation of VPW and CTR with both PAOP and CVP. The effect of cumulative fluid balance, PEEP, and serum albumin on the relationship between VPW and PAOP represented additional secondary endpoints. A formal sample size calculation was not undertaken as this study utilized all available patients with matching CXR and vascular pressure measurements from the five sites. The mean VPW and CTR were determined for each individual radiograph by averaging the measurements from all the readers who gave a satisfactory grade to position and technique for that radiograph. Inter-rater variability was assessed by calculating the difference between readings for each pair of readers for each measurement. These differences were then averaged and divided by the mean value of the reading to obtain the relative percent variation. VPW and CTR were compared separately to both CVP and PAOP measurements using scatterplots with regression equations. R values were determined using Spearman's correlations. Multivariate linear regression analysis was utilized to determine the effect that cumulative fluid balance, PEEP, and baseline serum albumin had on the relationship between VPW and PAOP. All variables were included in the model regardless of the significance of their association. Both the net fluid balance for the day of the intravascular pressure measurement and the cumulative net fluid balance from 24 hours prior to enrollment through the day of the VPW measurement were included in the multivariate regression analysis separately. Standardized coefficients were obtained to compare the relative effect each covariate had on PAOP. Cumulative net fluid balance from 24 hours prior to enrollment through the day of the VPW measurement had a better correlation than the daily fluid balance, so it was utilized in the final model. The PEEP value used in the regression analysis was the morning (that is, 06:00 to 10:00 AM) value from the day of the CXR. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to determine both the optimal VPW cutoff for discriminating adequateness of conservative fluid management, defined as a PAOP measurement < 8 mmHg and whether some component of hydrostatic edema may also be present (that is, PAOP ≥ 18 mm Hg). Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios of the VPW cutoff value were calculated using Confidence Interval Analysis 2.1.0. The change in VPW over time was calculated from the first CXR to the last available CXR in patients with two CXRs at least 48 hours apart between baseline and study Day 4. The median change in VPW over time was compared between conservative and liberal treatment strategy groups using Mann Whitney U testing. Data were analyzed using SPSS (Version 15.0; Chicago, IL, USA) and two-sided P -values ≤ 0.05 were utilized to determine statistical significance.

### A structured diagnostic algorithm for patients with ARDS [^113okpc8]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of ARDS

The diagnosis of ARDS is largely based on hypoxic respiratory failure and the detection of pulmonary edema, from which hydrostatic cardiogenic pulmonary edema must be excluded. It is therefore essential that false positive results are excluded as much as possible by means of non-invasive imaging. Ultrasound of the lungs is superior to chest X-ray for detecting and ruling out pleural effusion. The chest X-ray can give the illusion that the lung is consolidated when there is a large effusion and this can result in a false positive diagnosis, but the treatment differs. Transthoracic ultrasound of the heart can facilitate the diagnosis of acute heart failure. In general, acute heart failure is sufficient explanation for pulmonary edema and treatment should be focused on decongestion. However, a complicating factor is that cardiomyopathy due to a hyperinflammatory state can be associated with ARDS (and thus non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema). Usually, these are patients with sepsis, with a high a priori risk of ARDS who should also be diagnosed with ARDS.

Practical steps

Determine that the patient meets the ARDS criteria according to the 'Berlin definition' and report the diagnosis of ARDS in the status (Table 1), both when the cause is evident and when the cause is unclear, as ARDS is a descriptive — and not causal — diagnosis. The presence of ARDS should trigger both a standardized set of evidence-based interventions (e.g. lung protective ventilation, restrictive fluid therapy) and, importantly, an investigation into the cause of the pulmonary injury.
Perform ultrasound of the lungs to rule out pulmonary effusion as the cause for the bilateral consolidations. Finding pleural abnormalities with lung ultrasound strongly suggests an inflammatory cause of the pulmonary edema.
Perform transthoracic cardiac ultrasound to exclude acute heart failure as a cause of pulmonary edema. Ultrasound evidence of cardiomyopathy does not exclude ARDS in an underlying condition with a high pre-probability of ARDS (such as sepsis) and in this case ARDS should be diagnosed despite the contribution of acute heart failure to the onset of pulmonary edema.

### Minoxidil [^115y6Y9m]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

1. General Precautions

(a) Monitor fluid and electrolyte balance and body weight (see WARNINGS: Salt and Water Retention).

(b) Observe patients for signs and symptoms of pericardial effusion (see WARNINGS: Pericarditis, Pericardial Effusion, and Tamponade).

(c) Use after myocardial infarction - Minoxidil tablets have not been used in patients who have had a myocardial infarction within the preceding month. It is possible that a reduction of arterial pressure with minoxidil might further limit blood flow to the myocardium, although this might be compensated by decreased oxygen demand because of lower blood pressure.

(d) Hypersensitivity - Possible hypersensitivity to minoxidil, manifested as a skin rash, has been seen in less than 1% of patients; whether the drug should be discontinued when this occurs depends on treatment alternatives.

(e) Renal failure or dialysis- Patients may require smaller doses of minoxidil and should have close medical supervision to prevent exacerbation of renal failure or precipitation of cardiac failure.

2. Information for Patient

The patient should be fully aware of the importance of continuing all of his antihypertensive medications and of the nature of symptoms that would suggest fluid overload. A patient brochure has been prepared and is included with each minoxidil package. The text of this brochure is reprinted at the end of the insert.

3. Laboratory Tests

Those laboratory tests which are abnormal at the time of initiation of minoxidil therapy, such as urinalysis, renal function tests, EKG, chest x-ray, echocardiogram, etc., should be repeated at intervals to ascertain whether improvement or deterioration is occurring under minoxidil therapy. Initially such tests should be performed frequently, eg, 1 to 3 month intervals; later as stabilization occurs, at intervals of 6 to 12 months.

4. Drug Interactions

See "Interaction with Guanethidine" under WARNINGS.
