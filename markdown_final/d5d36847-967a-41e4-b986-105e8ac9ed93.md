## Question

How soon after pregnancy does hCG levels drop to zero

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how soon after pregnancy human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels drop to zero. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "zero" means clinically versus analytically. Then, I should verify the expected timeline for hCG decline after a normal delivery or miscarriage. Next, I will examine how the route of pregnancy resolution (spontaneous loss, medication abortion, aspiration, ectopic treatment) modifies the decline curve. After that, I need to check special scenarios like molar pregnancy and retained trophoblastic tissue that can prolong clearance. Finally, I should confirm assay detection limits and practical follow-up thresholds to give a clinically useful answer with appropriate caveats and safety margins.

> Let me first confirm the definition of "zero". Clinically, we consider hCG "undetectable" when it falls below the assay's functional detection limit, typically around 5 mIU/mL for most serum assays, though some laboratories report "nonpregnant" as ≤ 5 mIU/mL and may detect values down to 3–5 mIU/mL. Urine tests are generally less sensitive, with many qualitative kits detecting around 20–25 mIU/mL, so "zero" on a urine test may lag serum results by several days to weeks [^111NF6tn] [^112ah5EB] [^114SeFLP].

> Now, I should verify the general timeline after a normal pregnancy ends. Wait, let me double-check the postpartum and post-loss data: after delivery or miscarriage, hCG typically normalizes within about 4–6 weeks, though there is patient-to-patient variability and low-level positivity can persist longer, especially on urine tests. This is why many programs advise confirming resolution with a serum quantitative hCG rather than relying on urine alone in the early post-pregnancy period [^115AzNPo] [^112ah5EB].

> Next, I will examine medication abortion, because the decline is often faster. I need to check the early kinetics: after mifepristone with misoprostol, serum hCG commonly falls by about 50–57% by 48–72 hours and by roughly 80% or more by 7 days. By days 5–7, many patients have declines exceeding 90%, and a ≥ 80% decline by day 7 is commonly used to confirm complete abortion in very early gestations, with the caveat that trends cannot reliably distinguish ectopic from ongoing intrauterine pregnancy when the location is unknown [^114fhh73] [^114ms7Yx] [^114uDnU4] [^1153CBqf] [^113pBu5h].

> Hold on, I should verify aspiration abortion data as well. After uterine aspiration at very early gestation (≤ 42 days), median hCG declines are about 73% by day 1, 88% by day 2, and 93% by day 3, with minimum declines of roughly 56%, 77%, and 83% at 1, 2, and 3 days, respectively; this supports using a > 50% decline at 24 hours, > 70% at 48 hours, or > 80% at 72 hours as reassuring thresholds for completed aspiration in this early window [^116ZcspZ] [^112TSbxf].

> I will now examine spontaneous abortion and pregnancy of unknown location. Let me consider the expected decline rates: in spontaneous resolution, hCG typically falls by about 21–35% over 48 hours and 60–84% over 7 days, with faster declines when starting levels are higher. Importantly, declines slower than about 21% at 2 days or 60% at 7 days raise concern for retained tissue or ectopic pregnancy and warrant closer follow-up or intervention [^116vJuW5] [^111Zz3sz].

> But wait, what if the pregnancy was ectopic and treated medically? I should confirm methotrexate kinetics. After single-dose methotrexate for ectopic pregnancy, a falling hCG between days 0–4 predicts treatment success with about 85% accuracy, and serial monitoring is continued until a nonpregnant level per the lab assay is reached; this often takes several weeks, and the trajectory is slower than after intrauterine pregnancy resolution, so "zero" may take longer in this context [^116Tjt8i] [^113Gdm68] [^114FJsKw].

> Next, I should review molar pregnancy, where hCG can be markedly elevated and decline is uniquely prolonged. Let me verify guideline-based timelines: after evacuation of a complete hydatidiform mole, hCG is monitored every 1–2 weeks until normalization, then monthly for 6 months. If hCG normalizes within 56 days, the risk of post-molar GTN is very low and some centers accept a single confirmatory normal value, whereas if normalization takes ≥ 56 days, extended surveillance is advised due to a modestly higher residual risk. Partial moles generally normalize faster and may require only one confirmatory normal value one month after the first undetectable result [^115UKkbj] [^114p3byf] [^111UML12] [^114DThZ4] [^116nUHh3] [^1145CL4y] [^113E4ooK].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "zero" might be achieved within 1–2 weeks for everyone, but I should correct that. While very early medication or aspiration abortions can show > 80–90% declines within 3–7 days, reaching a serum level below 5 mIU/mL often takes 2–4 weeks and can extend to 4–6 weeks after delivery or miscarriage, with urine tests lagging behind serum due to lower sensitivity. Thus, a serum quantitative hCG is the most reliable way to document clearance [^112ah5EB] [^111NF6tn] [^114SeFLP].

> I need to ensure I address assay variability and potential confounders. False positives or persistent low-level hCG can occur from assay interference, pituitary hCG in perimenopausal patients, or quiescent trophoblastic disease; if low-level positivity persists beyond 6 weeks, I should double-check for these entities and consider specialized assays or suppression testing before concluding ongoing trophoblastic activity [^114oqJf1] [^112hwG1u] [^1113NBs8].

> Putting this together, I should confirm a practical clinical answer. For most patients, hCG reaches undetectable serum levels within about 2–6 weeks after pregnancy ends, with faster clearance after very early medication or aspiration abortion and slower clearance after ectopic treatment or molar pregnancy. Urine tests may remain weakly positive for longer, so documenting resolution with a serum quantitative hCG is prudent, and any plateau or unexpected rise warrants re-evaluation for retained tissue, ectopic tissue, or trophoblastic disease [^115AzNPo] [^114fhh73] [^116ZcspZ] [^114FJsKw] [^112DqRpr].

---

hCG typically returns to **< 5 mIU/mL within 4–6 weeks** after pregnancy ends, but the exact time varies by starting level and resolution type. After a term delivery, hCG may remain detectable for 4–6 weeks; after early miscarriage or abortion, it usually normalizes within 2–4 weeks. Molar pregnancies take longer, often 8–12 weeks, and require serial monitoring until three consecutive negative results. Persistent low-level hCG beyond 6 weeks warrants evaluation for retained tissue, ectopic pregnancy, or gestational trophoblastic disease [^115AzNPo] [^115UKkbj] [^112DqRpr] [^114oqJf1].

---

## Normal hCG decline after pregnancy

- **Normal pregnancy**: hCG rises rapidly in early pregnancy, peaks around 8–10 weeks, then declines to a plateau by the second trimester. After delivery or miscarriage, hCG falls with a half-life of ~24–36 hours, typically reaching < 5 mIU/mL within 4–6 weeks [^112ah5EB].

- **Early pregnancy loss**: After spontaneous abortion or medical abortion, hCG usually normalizes within 2–4 weeks, depending on initial level and gestational age [^notfound].

- **Ectopic pregnancy**: After methotrexate, hCG declines more slowly; serial measurements are needed until nonpregnant levels are reached [^114FJsKw].

---

## Factors influencing hCG decline

Several factors affect how quickly hCG returns to **zero**:

| **Factor** | **Effect on hcg decline** |
|-|-|
| Initial hCG level | Higher initial levels take longer to decline [^notfound] |
| Gestational age | Later gestations have slower decline |
| Type of pregnancy resolution | - Medical abortion: faster decline <br/> - Methotrexate: slower decline [^114ms7Yx] |
| Individual metabolism | Variability in clearance rates |
| Presence of retained tissue | Prolongs hCG persistence [^114jj2nQ] |

---

## Clinical guidelines for hCG monitoring

- **Postpartum**: Monitor until hCG is undetectable, typically 4–6 weeks.

- **Post-abortion**: Monitor until hCG is undetectable, usually 2–4 weeks.

- **Ectopic pregnancy**: Monitor until hCG is nonpregnant per lab assay [^114FJsKw].

- **Molar pregnancy**: Monitor weekly until undetectable, then monthly for 6–12 months [^112DqRpr] [^1145CL4y].

---

## Clinical significance of persistent hCG

Persistent low-level hCG beyond 6 weeks may indicate:

- **Retained trophoblastic tissue**: Common after incomplete abortion or delivery [^notfound].

- **Ectopic pregnancy**: Persistent or rising hCG suggests ectopic tissue [^116MEqx1].

- **Gestational trophoblastic disease**: Plateau or rise after molar pregnancy indicates GTN [^1155ppQh].

---

## Conclusion

hCG typically returns to **< 5 mIU/mL within 4–6 weeks** after pregnancy ends, but the timeline varies with initial level, gestational age, and resolution type. Persistent hCG beyond 6 weeks needs evaluation for retained tissue, ectopic pregnancy, or trophoblastic disease.

### Symptomatic patients with an early viable intrauterine pregnancy: HCG curves redefined [^113g2mHW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the change in serial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels in women symptomatic with pain or bleeding who presented with nondiagnostic ultrasonography but were ultimately confirmed to have a viable intrauterine pregnancy.

Methods

The rise in serial hCG measures were modeled over time, with the start point defined in 2 ways: by last menstrual period and by date of presentation for care. Both semiparametric (spline) curves and linear random-effects models were explored. The slope and projected increase of hCG were calculated to define 99% of viable intrauterine pregnancies.

Results

A total of 287 subjects met inclusion criteria and contributed 861 measurements of hCG. On average, these subjects contributed 3.00 observations and were followed up for 5.25 days. A linear increase in log hCG best described the pattern of rise. Curves derived from last menstrual period and day of presentation do not differ substantially. The median slope for a rise of hCG after 1 day was 1.50, (or a 50% increase); 2.24 after 2 days (or a 124% rise), and 5.00 after 4 days. The fastest rise was 1.81 at 1 day, 3.28 at 2 days, and 10.76 at 4 days. The slowest or minimal rise for a normal viable intrauterine pregnancy was 24% at 1 day and 53% at 2 days.

Conclusion

These data define the slowest rise in serial hCG values for a potentially viable gestation and will aid in distinguishing a viable early pregnancy from a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. The minimal rise in serial hCG values for women with a viable intrauterine pregnancy is "slower" than previously reported, suggesting that intervention to diagnosis and treat an abnormal gestation should be more conservative.

### Monitoring complete hydatidiform molar pregnancies after normalisation of human chorionic gonadotrophin: national retrospective population study [^1175JVd5]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Complete and partial hydatidiform moles are abnormal conceptions affecting 1800 women each year in the UK (about 220 000 women globally a year) or about 1–3 per 1000 pregnancies. A complete hydatidiform mole is an androgenetic diploid conception lacking maternal nuclear DNA but with two paternal sets of chromosomes. A partial hydatidiform mole is a triploid pregnancy with one maternal and two paternal chromosomal contributions. Molar pregnancies result in aggressive abnormal placental (trophoblast) development that typically causes bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy. Some molar pregnancies might be undetected because of early spontaneous abortions, but when an abnormal pregnancy suggestive of a molar pregnancy is detected on an early pelvic ultrasound, suction uterine evacuation is usually performed. Histological examination of the evacuated material is essential to make a diagnosis of complete hydatidiform mole, partial hydatidiform mole, or non-molar pregnancy loss. All patients with a histologically confirmed complete or partial hydatidiform mole should then undergo serial measurements of serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels to ensure no regrowth of residual trophoblastic tissue has occurred. Persistence of trophoblastic tissue occurs in about 15% of complete hydatidiform moles and 0.5–1% of partial hydatidiform moles where levels of hCG might increase or plateau over at least two or three consecutive values, respectively, indicating the onset of malignant change, also known as postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Early detection is important so that subsequent treatment can achieve a nearly complete cure rate. Almost all postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasias will occur before serum levels of hCG have normalised after uterine evacuation, but in a few cases, malignancy can occur after the first normal hormone value.

### Monitoring complete hydatidiform molar pregnancies after normalisation of human chorionic gonadotrophin: national retrospective population study [^1122LQ5J]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, we showed that the overall risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia in patients whose hCG levels had returned to normal in < 56 days was low (posterior median 0.06%), which supports the idea that surveillance protocols can safely change to one confirmatory normal hCG value in this patient group. In those whose hCG levels return to normal in ≥ 56 days, figure 2 provides information for adequate counselling on the risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia over time and will inform shared decision making with patients and providers. Future research is needed to estimate the cost effectiveness and psychological effect of new follow-up recommendations.

Policy Implications

Our findings support the idea that in patients whose hCG levels return to normal in < 56 days, current UK and international practice could be changed to reduce monitoring protocols to one confirmatory normal hCG sample, to match current practice for partial hydatidiform moles. A recent Markov model based, cost effectiveness analysis in complete hydatidiform moles also suggested that it would be reasonable to reduce or potentially stop hCG monitoring after hCG levels have returned to normal.

For women whose hCG levels return to normal in ≥ 56 days after a complete hydatidiform mole, how long should surveillance continue? Our study provides information for patients and clinicians to help determine what this interval should be. The risk data in figure 2 could be shared with patients for a personalised decision based process to decide when they feel it would be safe to stop hCG monitoring. In the UK, we have currently decided to continue offering up to six months of hCG monitoring after normalisation of hCG levels for these patients, but we might revise this approach after patient feedback. Clearly, many factors need to be considered in the decision process for affected women, including their reproductive plans and age, and whether a delayed diagnosis might result in a worse outcome. Although the absolute risk of recurrence remains low, patients need to be educated on the importance of seeking medical care even after completion of follow-up if they have abnormal bleeding or other concerning symptoms. A time interval of > 2.8 years from the antecedent presumed causative pregnancy was found to correlate with worse outcomes in high risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Fortunately, in our cohort, six of 31 patients had a diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia > 2.8 years after their initial complete hydatidiform mole, but this finding did not affect survival. We saw a trend for the need for much more aggressive combination chemotherapy, rather than chemotherapy with one drug, in patients who developed gestational trophoblastic neoplasia many months or years after their complete hydatidiform mole.

Abstract

Objective

To provide evidence for a reduced surveillance protocol to detect gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after normalisation of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels following uterine evacuation of a complete hydatidiform mole.

Design

National retrospective population study

Setting

Two UK Trophoblastic Disease Treatment Centres (Sheffield and London), 1 January 1980 to 30 November 2020.

Participants

17 424 patients with hCG normalisation after evacuation of their complete hydatidiform mole were included. Complete hydatidiform moles were verified by centralised pathological review. Patients were excluded if lost to follow-up or required treatment before normalisation of hCG levels.

Main outcome measures

Incidence and clinical presentation of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after normalisation of hCG levels following uterine evacuation of a complete hydatidiform mole.

Results

Of 17 424 patients whose hCG normalised after complete hydatidiform mole evacuation, 99.8% (n = 17 393 of 17 424) did not subsequently develop gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The overall risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after previous normalisation of hCG levels was 0.2% (n = 31 of 17 424 patients). The risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after uterine evacuation was substantially lower if hCG levels returned to normal in < 56 days rather than ≥ 56 days (posterior medians 0.06%, 95% credible interval 0.01% to 0.14% v 0.22%, 0.15% to 0.31%), with a posterior relative risk of 0.25 (0.06 to 0.72). Most patients who developed gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (71.0%, n = 22 of 31) had received a diagnosis after the current six month surveillance protocol. The cumulative risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia in patients whose hCG levels normalised early increased minimally with time. If a patient had normal hCG levels in < 56 days, a clinically relevant time point, the risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia was small (0.04%, about 1 in 2619 patients) at 39 months after normalisation. The equivalent risk for a patient who had normal hCG levels in ≥ 56 days was 0.16% (about 1 in 642 patients). All 31 women who developed gestational trophoblastic neoplasia achieved sustained remission after subsequent treatment.

Conclusions

The findings of the study indicate that surveillance protocols could safely change to one confirmatory normal hCG value for patients whose hCG levels return to normal in < 56 days of evacuation of a complete hydatidiform mole. Patients whose hCG levels return to normal in ≥ 56 days should be counselled on the remaining risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia over time to help decide the length of subsequent follow-up.

### Is chemotherapy necessary for patients with molar pregnancy and human chorionic gonadotropin serum levels raised but falling at 6months after uterine evacuation? [^116vmY24]. Gynecologic Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the outcomes of Brazilian patients with molar pregnancy who continue human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) surveillance with those treated with chemotherapy when hCG was still positive, but falling at 6months after uterine evacuation.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of 12,526 patients with hydatidiform mole treated at one of nine Brazilian reference centers from January 1990 to May 2016.

Results

At 6months from uterine evacuation, 96 (0.8%) patients had hCG levels raised but falling. In 15/96 (15.6%) patients, chemotherapy was initiated immediately per FIGO 2000 criteria, while 81/96 (84.4%) patients were managed expectantly. Among the latter, 65/81 (80.2%) achieved spontaneous remission and 16 (19.8%) developed postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). Patients who received chemotherapy following expectant management required more time for remission (11 versus 8months; p = 0.001), had a greater interval between uterine evacuation and initiating chemotherapy (8 versus 6months; p < 0.001), and presented with a median WHO/FIGO risk score higher than women treated according to FIGO 2000 criteria (4 versus 2, p = 0.04), but there were no significant differences in the need for multiagent treatment regimens (1/15 versus 3/16 patients, p = 0.60). None of the women relapsed, and no deaths occurred in either group.

Conclusion

In order to avoid unnecessary exposure of women to chemotherapy, we no longer follow the FIGO 2000 recommendation to treat all patients with molar pregnancy and hCG raised but falling at 6months after evacuation. Instead, we pursue close hormonal and radiological surveillance as the best strategy for these patients.

### Early serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) trends after medication abortion [^114uDnU4]. Contraception (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Despite increased reliance on human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for early pregnancy monitoring, there is limited information about hCG trends soon after medication abortion. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a predictable decline in serum hCG values shortly after medication abortion.

Study Design

This is a retrospective study of women with early intrauterine pregnancies who underwent medication abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol and had a serum hCG level on Day 1 (day of mifepristone) and a repeat value on Day 2 to 6. The percent hCG decline was calculated from baseline to repeat measure, with repeat values from the same patient accounted for through repeated measure analysis of variance.

Results

Eighty-eight women with a mean gestational age of 5.5 weeks and median baseline hCG of 5220 IU met study criteria over a 3-year period. The mean decline (± SD) in hCG from the Day 1 baseline value was 56.9% ± 29.5% on Day 3, 73.5% ± 38.6% on Day 4, 86.1% ± 8.8% on Day 5, and 92.9% ± 3.4% on Day 6. Eighty-two women (93% of the cohort) had a complete abortion without further intervention. The least square means hCG decline among these women was 57.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 50.3–64.9%] on Day 3, 78.9% (95% CI: 75.0–82.8%) on Day 4 and 86.2% (95% CI: 81.3–91.1%) on Day 5.

Conclusion

There is a rapid decline in serum hCG within the first few days after early medication abortion. Further research is needed to delineate how soon after medication abortion this decline may be specific enough to confirm abortion completion.

Implications

This study provides the largest cohort of patients followed with serial hCG values in the first few days after medication abortion. Our findings demonstrate the trend in hCG decline in this population, which may be predictable by Day 5.

### Low risk of relapse after achieving undetectable HCG levels in women with complete molar pregnancy [^115pee5W]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Complete hydatidiform molar pregnancies occur in approximately 1 of 1,000 conceptions. After uterine evacuation of the trophoblastic tissue, women are followed up with serial serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) measurements. Patients are considered to have attained remission when their hCG level spontaneously declines to an undetectable level and remains there during a 6-month follow-up period. This standard effectively detects all disease recurrence; however, it is resource intensive, delays child bearing, and is subject to significant noncompliance. Our objective was to determine the risk of disease recurrence after hCG spontaneously declines to undetectable levels.

Methods

We used a database from the New England Trophoblastic Disease Center to analyze hCG levels in patients with complete molar pregnancies.

Results

Among 1,029 women with complete molar pregnancy and complete data, 15% developed persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The rate of persistent neoplasm among those whose hCG level fell spontaneously to undetectable levels was 0.2% (2/876, 95% confidence interval 0–0.8%). No women developed persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after their hCG level fell to undetectable levels using an assay with a sensitivity of 5 mIU/mL (n = 82, 95% confidence interval 0–4.5%).

Conclusion

Based on our experience with women with complete hydatidiform molar pregnancies whose hCG values spontaneously fell to undetectable levels after molar evacuation, we conclude that the risk of recurrent neoplasm after hCG levels fall to less than 5 mIU/mL approaches zero.

### Decline of serum human chorionic gonadotropin and spontaneous complete abortion: defining the normal curve [^116vJuW5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to estimate a standard curve of serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) decline that characterizes spontaneous abortion.

Methods

Data were extracted from a clinical database of women with symptomatic early pregnancies and nondiagnostic ultrasonography who required follow-up with serial hCG levels. The evaluation was restricted to women who had a pregnancy of unknown location, a decrease in serum levels, and who were ultimately diagnosed with miscarriage (a decrease in serum hCG to < 5 mIU/mL in the absence of surgical intervention or confirmation of products of conception after dilation and curettage). The starting point of the curve was the hCG concentration at presentation, with serial levels plotted until the time of definitive diagnosis. Semiparametric statistical techniques were used to characterize the shape of the curve. We present slopes for the decrease in log hCG levels and the projected rate of fall.

Results

Of the 1,543 patients, 710 were diagnosed with miscarriage. A quadratic curve for log hCG with a steeper rate of decline for large initial hCG values best described the pattern of change. One curve could not fully estimate the decline because the rate was dependent on the initial hCG level. In other words, more rapid decline was associated with a higher starting concentration. The rate of decline ranged from 21% to 35% at 2 days and 60% to 84% at 7 days, depending on initial hCG value.

Conclusion

The rate of hCG decrease in spontaneous abortions is described by a quadratic profile, with a faster decline in hCG value with higher presentation levels. A rate of decline less than 21% at 2 days or 60% at 7 days suggests retained trophoblasts or an ectopic pregnancy.

### Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115przLo]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Hydatidiform mole monitoring and follow-up — After initial treatment, perform H&P 1 month after initial treatment, obtain hCG assay every 1–2 weeks until normalized, and use systemic hormonal contraception (oral contraceptives for at least 6 months preferred). With normal hCG levels for 3 consecutive assays, consider hCG assay every 3 months for 6 months. With persistent hCG elevation (plateau or rise), proceed to persistent post-molar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) (HM-2). Oral contraceptives are preferred over intrauterine devices (IUDs) because they suppress endogenous LH/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which may interfere with hCG measurement at low levels, and a formal follow-up program allows for early detection of GTN and limits exposure to combination chemotherapy. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Discussion

Principal findings

The overall risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after normalisation of hCG levels was low (0.2%), with most patients receiving a diagnosis after the current six month hCG surveillance protocol. Moreover, we confirmed that the risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia was 3.6-fold lower in those whose hCG levels returned to normal in < 56 days than in those with normalisation of hCG levels in ≥ 56 days (posterior medians 0.06%, 95% credible interval 0.01% to 0.14% v 0.22%, 0.15% to 0.31%), with a posterior relative risk of 0.25 (0.06 to 0.72). We have provided an overview of how the risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia evolves over time (figure 2), which could be used to estimate the risk in individual patients.

Clinical overview

Women with a molar pregnancy usually present with irregular vaginal bleeding in the first trimester. An ultrasound scan can identify most CHMs (88%) but only detects some PHMs (56%), presenting a diagnostic challenge. Although sonography might be suggestive of a molar pregnancy, histopathological examination of the products of conception is the gold standard for the diagnosis of molar pregnancy. In CHM, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) might be inappropriately high and reach concentrations of more than 100 000 IU/L (table 1). A review of 180 cases presenting to the New England Trophoblastic Disease Centre over a 20 year period showed a reduction in the gestational age at diagnosis of CHM from 12 weeks to 9 weeks gestation. Earlier diagnosis of GTD has led to changes in clinical presentation with women now rarely presenting with anaemia, hyperemesis, pre-eclampsia, or hyperthyroidism.

The diagnosis of GTN is largely based on a combination of obstetric history and elevated concentrations of hCG. After molar pregnancy, plateaued or rising hCG concentrations are indicative of GTN. All forms of GTN (excluding PSTT and ETT) are highly vascular and a biopsy is not recommended because of the risk of a life threatening haemorrhage. Identification of the origin of choriocarcinoma can be challenging and genetic profiling can help to differentiate gestational from non-gestational choriocarcinoma, with non-gestational choriocarcinoma having a worse prognosis.

Obstetric management of molar pregnancy involves uterine evacuation and histopathological examination of the products of conception. Follow-up serum or urine hCG monitoring is done until hCG values return to within the normal range. hCG is an ideal biomarker for GTD surveillance as its concentration accurately reflects disease burden. Most women with molar pregnancy do not require further treatment following uterine evacuation of the products of conception. However, some women develop disease persistence and progress to malignant disease requiring chemotherapy or further surgical intervention.

5 TREATMENT

5.1 Molar pregnancy

Assessment of the patient's clinical condition is essential, and any medical complications should be promptly identified and treated to avoid obstetric near‐miss events. Conventional suction evacuation — or manual aspiration in settings without electronic equipment — remains the preferred method for uterine evacuation, ideally performed under ultrasound guidance. A 7–12 suction cannula is recommended for evacuation, and an intravenous oxytocin infusion may be initiated at the start of the procedure and continued for several hours postoperatively to promote uterine contractility and reduce blood loss. When available, hysteroscopic resection of residual tissue can serve as a complementary approach. Rh‐negative women should receive Rh immune globulin at the time of molar evacuation. Improved outcomes are achieved through the careful use of appropriate equipment and techniques, access to blood products, close intraoperative monitoring, and early recognition and mangement of complications. A second curettage yields controversial results, and should not be routinely performed. However, it may be used in selected cases with uterine bleeding and ultrasound findings suggestive of molar remains in the endometrial cavity. For patients who have completed childbearing, hysterectomy with ovarian preservation is a viable alternative to suction curettage. Medical induction of labor and hysterotomy are not recommended for molar evacuation, as these approaches are associated with increased maternal morbidity and the development of post‐molar GTNs.

Prophylactic chemotherapy at the time of or immediately after molar evacuation is associated with a reduction of 3%–8% in the incidence of post‐molar GTNs. However, it should be limited to special situations in which the risk of post‐molar GTN is much greater than normal or where adequate hCG follow‐up is not possible.

Follow‐up hCG monitoring every 1–2 weeks is essential for the timely diagnosis and management of post‐molar GTNs. If testing is carried out at 2‐week intervals and a rise or plateau in hCG levels is detected, next sample should be obtained after 1 week. On the other hand, post‐molar GTN rarely occurs after hCG levels have spontaneously returned to normal, which allows for a shortened follow‐up period in most women. Hence, for a PHM, a single confirmatory hCG test 1 month after initial normalization is recommended. For a CHM, monthly hCG monitoring should continue for 6 months after hCG normalization. Hormonal contraception is considered safe during post‐molar follow‐up period.

### First trimester bleeding: evaluation and management [^1119Cf46]. American Family Physician (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for early pregnancy loss, more specifically with respect to hCG, AAFP 2019 guidelines recommend to consider using the initial β-hCG level when monitoring the rate of β-hCG increase in early pregnancy. In viable intrauterine pregnancies with initial β-hCG levels of < 1,500 mIU/mL, 1,500–3,000 mIU/mL, or > 3,000 mIU/mL, recognize that there is a 99% chance that the β-hCG level will increase by at least 49%, 40%, and 33%, respectively, over 48 hours.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: management of undesired pregnancy of unknown location and abortion at less than 42 days of gestation [^115xm56p]. Contraception (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy of unknown location is a condition in which a pregnancy test is positive, but no intrauterine or extrauterine pregnancy is visualized using transvaginal ultrasonography. We recommend using standardized nomenclature and definitions to describe intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), probable IUP, pregnancy of unknown location (PUL), probable ectopic pregnancy (probable EP), and ectopic pregnancy (EP) (Best Practice). Among abortion-seeking patients found to have a PUL, the incidence of EP is 4% to 8%. We recommend clinical judgment in assessing the risk for EP in the setting of PUL; the absence of an intrauterine gestational sac (GS) or yolk sac should not delay care (GRADE 1B). In asymptomatic individuals with an undesired PUL who prefer to proceed with immediate treatment (medication or procedural management without delay) and have a low risk of EP, as determined by the clinician based on history, symptoms, and all other available data, we recommend medication management with mifepristone and misoprostol or procedural management via uterine aspiration and clear plans for ensuring pregnancy resolution in a timely fashion (GRADE 1B). While both medication and procedural management of undesired PUL are associated with earlier pregnancy resolution and identification of EP, the two main risks of inadequate follow-up include ongoing pregnancy and missing or delaying a subsequent diagnosis of EP. For individuals with PUL choosing immediate treatment with medication management, we recommend clinicians obtain a baseline serum quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at the time of medication provision to aid in diagnosis and follow-up (GRADE 1A). Following medication management of PUL with mifepristone and misoprostol, we suggest a repeat serum quantitative hCG level, with pregnancy resolution defined as either a 50% decline or greater at 48 to 72 hours after misoprostol or an 80% decline or greater at 7 days after mifepristone or 5 to 10 days after misoprostol (GRADE 2B). We recommend against direct extrapolation of follow-up recommendations from no-test abortion clinical protocols to individuals with a documented PUL treated with mifepristone and misoprostol, given the higher risk of EP among individuals with a known PUL (GRADE 1C). When uterine aspiration is performed at less than 42 days of gestation, including for individuals with PUL or probable IUP, and both chorionic villi and GS are not visualized, we recommend repeat ultrasonography (if an IUP or probable IUP was seen initially), serum quantitative hCG follow-up, or both (GRADE 1B). When both chorionic villi and GS are not visualized after uterine aspiration and serial serum hCG follow-up is warranted, we recommend testing on the day of the procedure and 24 to 72 hours later, with pregnancy resolution defined as greater than 50% decline 24 hours after aspiration, greater than 70% by 48 hours, or greater than 80% by approximately 72 hours (GRADE 1B).

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^1161vUCh]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) reference ranges in pregnancy — physiologic shifts and guidance: A downward shift of the TSH reference range occurs during pregnancy, with the lower limit decreased by about 0.1–0.2 mU/L and the upper limit decreased by about 0.5–1.0 mU/L, with the largest decrease in the first trimester attributable to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation. In women with very high hCG, suppression is frequent; in one study with hCG concentrations > 200,000 IU/L, TSH was suppressed (≤ 0.2 mU/L) in 67% of women and in 100% when hCG concentrations were > 400,000 IU/L. When local trimester-specific ranges are unavailable, the first-trimester lower reference range can be reduced by approximately 0.4 mU/L and the upper reference range reduced by approximately 0.5 mU/L; for a typical early pregnancy this corresponds to a TSH upper reference limit of 4.0 mU/L, generally applied beginning with the late first trimester (weeks 7–12) with a gradual return toward nonpregnant values thereafter. A small percentage of normal pregnancies may have undetectable TSH (< 0.01 mU/L).

### Monitoring complete hydatidiform molar pregnancies after normalisation of human chorionic gonadotrophin: national retrospective population study [^117Raeb8]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence for a reduced surveillance protocol to detect gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after normalisation of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels following uterine evacuation of a complete hydatidiform mole.

Design

National retrospective population study.

Setting

Two UK Trophoblastic Disease Treatment Centres (Sheffield and London), 1 January 1980 to 30 November 2020.

Participants

17 424 patients with hCG normalisation after evacuation of their complete hydatidiform mole were included. Complete hydatidiform moles were verified by centralised pathological review. Patients were excluded if lost to follow-up or required treatment before normalisation of hCG levels.

Main Outcome Measures

Incidence and clinical presentation of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after normalisation of hCG levels following uterine evacuation of a complete hydatidiform mole.

Results

Of 17 424 patients whose hCG normalised after complete hydatidiform mole evacuation, 99.8% (n = 17393 of 17 424) did not subsequently develop gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The overall risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after previous normalisation of hCG levels was 0.2% (n = 31 of 17 424 patients). The risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after uterine evacuation was substantially lower if hCG levels returned to normal in < 56 days rather than ≥ 56 days (posterior medians 0.06%, 95% credible interval 0.01% to 0.14% v 0.22%, 0.15% to 0.31%), with a posterior relative risk of 0.25 (0.06 to 0.72). Most patients who developed gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (71.0%, n = 22 of 31) had received a diagnosis after the current six month surveillance protocol. The cumulative risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia in patients whose hCG levels normalised early increased minimally with time. If a patient had normal hCG levels in < 56 days, a clinically relevant time point, the risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia was small (0.04%, about 1 in 2619 patients) at 39 months after normalisation. The equivalent risk for a patient who had normal hCG levels in ≥ 56 days was 0.16% (about 1 in 642 patients). All 31women who developed gestational trophoblastic neoplasia achieved sustained remission after subsequent treatment.

Conclusions

The findings of the study indicate that surveillance protocols could safely change to one confirmatory normal hCG value for patients whose hCG levels return to normal in < 56 days of evacuation of a complete hydatidiform mole. Patients whose hCG levels return to normal in ≥ 56 days should be counselled on the remaining risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia over time to help decide the length of subsequent follow-up.

### Suspected ectopic pregnancy [^116MEqx1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Women who present with pain and bleeding in the first trimester are at risk for ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening condition. Conditions that predispose a woman to ectopic pregnancy are damaged fallopian tubes from prior tubal surgery or previous pelvic infection, smoking, and conception using assisted reproduction. Many women without risk factors can develop an ectopic pregnancy. A diagnostic algorithm that includes the use of transvaginal ultrasonography, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentrations, and, sometimes, uterine curettage can definitively diagnose women at risk in a timely manner. The absence of an intrauterine pregnancy above an established cut point of hCG is consistent with an abnormal pregnancy but does not distinguish a miscarriage from an ectopic pregnancy. When the initial hCG value is low, serial hCG values can be used to determine whether a gestation is potentially viable or spontaneously resolving. The minimal rise in hCG for a viable pregnancy is 53% in 2 days. The minimal decline of a spontaneous abortion is 21–35% in 2 days, depending on the initial level. A rise or fall in serial hCG values that is slower than this is suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy. Women diagnosed with an unruptured ectopic pregnancy are potential candidates for medical management with methotrexate. Intramuscular injection with methotrexate can be used to safely treat an ectopic pregnancy with success rates, tubal patency rates, and future fertility that are similar to those obtained with conservative surgery. Success rates using methotrexate are inversely rated to baseline hCG values and are higher using "multidose" compared with "single-dose" regimens. Surgical treatment may be conservative or definitive and should be attempted in most cases via laparoscopy.

### Change in hCG levels after very early medication abortion for pregnancy of unknown location or probable intrauterine pregnancy [^113pBu5h]. Contraception (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective(S)

To evaluate changes in serum/plasma human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) from baseline levels in very early medication abortion (VEMA) in pregnancies of unknown location (PUL) and probable intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) to confirm treatment success.

Study Design

A prospective cohort was selected from the VEMA randomized controlled trial conducted at 26 sites across nine countries. Patients with a gestational age ≤ 42 days without confirmed IUP on ultrasound (n = 741) received medication abortion according to WHO guidelines, hCG was measured at mifepristone intake and repeated on day 7 (± 2). Changes in hCG were analyzed to distinguish the trends associated with complete abortion versus ectopic pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, and incomplete abortion.

Results

Among 533 cases with complete abortion, a decline in hCG level of ≥ 80% was observed in 96.8 of cases 7 (± 2) days post-abortion. The mean hCG decline for complete abortions was 94% (CI: 93.2–94.9). None of the ectopic pregnancies 8 (1.7%) or ongoing pregnancies 21 (2.9%), showed a decline of ≥ 80%. Rising or insufficient decline (< 80%) indicated ectopic and ongoing pregnancy. The hCG trend following complete abortion was significantly different from all other outcomes (p < 0.001), but trends did not distinguish between ectopic, ongoing pregnancy, or incomplete abortion.

Conclusion(S)

A hCG decline of ≥ 80% within 7 (± 2) days can effectively confirm complete abortion and rule out ectopic and ongoing pregnancies in early medication abortion. These results highlight the effectiveness of hCG monitoring as a reliable follow-up tool for managing VEMA without confirmed IUP.

Implications

This study highlights the value of hCG monitoring in early medication abortions in pregnancy of unknown location to differentiate between complete or incomplete abortion, ectopic, or ongoing pregnancy. An hCG decline of ≥ 80% within 7 (± 2) days post-mifepristone can confirm complete abortion and help exclude ectopic and ongoing pregnancy.

### Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after human chorionic gonadotropin normalization following molar pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116nUHh3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To estimate the incidence of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia following complete and partial molar pregnancy after reaching normal human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels to guide evidence-based follow-up recommendations.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, POPLINE, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to November 2018, using the intersection of "gestational trophoblastic disease", "molar pregnancy", and "human chorionic gonadotropin" themes.

Methods Of Study Selection

Search results were screened to identify cohort studies of molar pregnancy reporting gestational trophoblastic neoplasia development, with at least 6 months of intended normal hCG follow-up.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Two reviewers independently identified articles for inclusion. Data were extracted using a standardized form. For meta-analysis, cumulative incidence of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, with CIs by the Agresti-Coull method, and pooled risk ratios (RRs) comparing complete and partial mole were calculated. Among the 19 eligible studies that reported adequate data for inclusion in the primary meta-analysis, we found low incidence of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after normal hCG level following both complete mole (64/18,357, 0.35%, 95% CI 0.27–0.45%), and partial mole (5/14,864, 0.03%, 95% CI 0.01–0.08%). There was a significantly higher risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after complete compared with partial molar pregnancy (RR 4.72, 95% CI 1.81–12.3, P = 0.002). Among gestational trophoblastic neoplasia cases after normal hCG level following complete mole, 89.6% occurred when the time from evacuation to normalization was 56 days or longer, and 60.7% were diagnosed beyond the commonly recommended 6-month surveillance interval. Sensitivity analyses, including those limiting to studies at low risk of bias, did not significantly affect results. We found an overall incidence of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia of 15.7% for complete mole (1,354/8,611, 95% CI 15.0–16.5%) and 3.95% for partial mole (221/5,593, 95% CI 3.47–4.50%).

Conclusion

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia development after normal hCG level following molar pregnancy is rare. Recommendations for frequency and duration of hCG follow-up can be minimized to lessen burden on patients and informed by the type of molar pregnancy and time interval from uterine evacuation to hCG normalization.

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia — follow-up after initial treatment of HM: Follow-up with hCG monitoring is essential to ensure that hCG levels return to normal, and monitoring should be performed with a quantitative assay capable of detecting all forms of hCG, including beta-hCG, core hCG, nicked-free beta, beta core, and hyperglycosylated forms; post-molar GTN develops in about 15% to 20% of complete moles but in only 0.1% to 5% of partial moles, and the risk of recurrence is low (< 2%) following a single molar pregnancy but increases significantly for patients who experience one or more recurrences.

### Pregnancy, malignancy or mother nature? Persistence of high hCG levels in a perimenopausal woman [^112hwG1u]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Despite the fact that a small percentage of peri en postmenopausal women have mild elevations in human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) concentrations (< 14 IU/L) besides high levels of gonadotrophins, a considerable number of clinicians are not aware of this phenomenon. We report a case of a 53-year-old woman with an unusually high hCG concentration (> 40IU/L) given her menopausal state. Although a pregnancy or a malignancy was unlikely on the basis of stable hCG levels, elevated gonadotrophins and a negative transvaginal ultrasound, her physicians were uncertain and chose an expectant approach by repeated testing. Ultimately, after consulting the laboratory, analytical interference was ruled out and pituitary origin of unusual high hCG level could be confirmed after conduction of a suppression test by oestrogen-progesterone hormone replacement therapy. Until that time, the patient had undergone a vast amount of laboratory tests and gynaecology consultations, resulting in an enormous amount of confusion, anxiety and overdiagnosis.

### Utility and limitations of human chorionic gonadotropin levels for remote follow-up after medical management of early pregnancy loss [^114LghDD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Early pregnancy loss can be treated medically with mifepristone followed by misoprostol, with ultrasonographic confirmation of pregnancy expulsion. Alternative strategies that ascertain treatment success remotely are needed. We compared percent decline in human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level with treatment success or failure between patients who received mifepristone pretreatment followed by misoprostol or misoprostol alone for early pregnancy loss between 5 and 12 weeks of gestation to determine a threshold decline that might predict success. Early pregnancy loss treatment success was associated with a greater percent hCG level decline compared with treatment failure, but no threshold was able to predict success. Additional research is needed to understand hCG trends after medical management of early pregnancy loss to develop reliable protocols for remote follow-up.

### Pregnancy… [^114EaiYY]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

What does this test do. This is a home-use test kit to measure human chorionic gonadotropin in your urine. You produce this hormone only when you are pregnant. What is hCG. hCG is a hormone produced by your placenta when you are pregnant. It appears shortly after the embryo attaches to the wall of the uterus. If you are pregnant, this hormone increases very rapidly. If you have a 28 day menstrual cycle, you can detect hCG in your urine 12–15 days after ovulation. Most pregnancy tests have about the same ability to detect hCG, but their ability to show whether or not you are pregnant depends on how much hCG you are producing. If you test too early in your cycle or too close to the time you became pregnant, your placenta may not have had enough time to produce hCG. This would mean that you are pregnant but you got a negative test result.

Because many women have irregular periods, and women may miscalculate when their period is due, 10 to 20 pregnant women out of every 100 will not detect their pregnancy on the first day of their missed period. The different tests for sale vary in their abilities to detect low levels of hCG. For the most reliable results, test 1–2 weeks after you miss your period. There are some tests for sale that are sensitive enough to show you are pregnant before you miss your period. Does a positive test mean you are pregnant. Usually, yes, but you must be sure to read and interpret the results correctly. Do negative test results mean that you are not pregnant. No, there are several reasons why you could receive false negative test results. If you tested too early in your cycle, your placenta may not have had time to produce enough hCG for the test to detect. Or, you may not have waited long enough before you took this test.

If you have a negative result, you would be wise to consider this a tentative finding. You should not use medications and should consider avoiding potentially harmful behaviors, such as smoking or drinking alcohol, until you have greater certainty that you are not pregnant. You will probably recognize incorrect results with the passage of time. You may detect false negatives by the unexpected onset of menses Repeat testing and/or other investigations such as ultrasound may provide corrected results.

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia — diagnostic criteria for post-molar GTN and baseline evaluation: Post-molar GTN is typically diagnosed by hCG surveillance, and the NCCN Guidelines use FIGO criteria as meeting one or more of the following after treatment for HM, as indicated by hCG monitoring and WHO scoring: hCG levels plateau for 4 consecutive values over 3 weeks or hCG levels rise ≥ 10% for 3 values over 2 weeks. Assessment and staging should include history and physical examination (including pelvic exam), FIGO stage and prognostic score, pelvic ultrasound, and imaging (chest x-ray or [C/A/P] CT), with pelvic ultrasound used to confirm the absence of pregnancy, measure uterine size, and delineate tumor volume and vasculature.

### How to be reasonably certain that a patient is not pregnant… [^115AzNPo]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Comments and Evidence Summary The criteria for determining whether a patient is pregnant depend on the assurance that the patient has not ovulated within a certain amount of time after their last menses, spontaneous or induced abortion, or delivery. Among menstruating patients, the timing of ovulation can vary widely. During an average 28-day cycle, ovulation generally occurs during days 9–20. In addition, the likelihood of ovulation is low from days 1–7 of the menstrual cycle. After a spontaneous or an induced abortion, ovulation can occur within 2–3 weeks and has been found to occur as early as 8–13 days after the end of the pregnancy. Therefore, the likelihood of ovulation is low ≤ 7 days after an abortion. A systematic review reported that the mean day of first ovulation among postpartum nonlactating women occurred 45–94 days after delivery. In one study, the earliest ovulation was reported at 25 days after delivery.

Among women who are within 6 months postpartum, are fully or nearly fully breastfeeding, and are amenorrheic, the risk for pregnancy is < 2%. Although pregnancy tests often are performed before initiating contraception, the accuracy of qualitative urine pregnancy tests varies depending on the timing of the test relative to missed menses, recent sexual intercourse, or recent pregnancy. The sensitivity of a pregnancy test is defined as the concentration of human chorionic gonadotropin at which 95% of tests are positive. Most qualitative pregnancy tests approved by the Food and Drug Administration report a sensitivity of 20–25 mIU/mL in urine. However, pregnancy detection rates can vary widely because of differences in test sensitivity and the timing of testing relative to missed menses. Certain studies have demonstrated that an additional 11 days past the day of expected menses are needed to detect 100% of pregnancies using qualitative tests. In addition, pregnancy tests cannot detect a pregnancy resulting from recent sexual intercourse. Qualitative tests also might have positive results for several weeks after termination of pregnancy because hCG can be present for several weeks after delivery or abortion.

### Physiological range of human chorionic gonadotropin for support of early human pregnancy [^115phfhT]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the physiological range of hCG in early pregnancy.

Design

Retrospective study of patient charts.

Setting

Magee-Women's Hospital IVF clinic, Monroeville, Pennsylvania.

Patient(S)

Sixty patients with successful, singleton birth outcomes.

Intervention(S)

Serum hCG measurements on days 12–16 post-oocyte retrieval (OR).

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Lowest values, highest values, mean values, quartile mean values, and 48-hour doubling times for days 12–16 post-OR.

Result(S)

The average production of hCG in successful pregnancies is roughly 4-fold greater than the lowest amount observed in successful pregnancies, suggesting that a considerable excess of hCG is normally produced. Additionally, the average doubling time is almost 2-fold greater than the slowest doubling rate.

Conclusion(S)

The data from this study provide a set of values for the minimum and maximum threshold of hCG for days 12–16 post-OR that may be physiologically required, although not entirely predictive, for a successful IVF pregnancy outcome.

### Use of the abbott I-STAT® 1 point of care device for hCG quantification in early pregnancy [^112cAtTq]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The Abbott i‐STAT®1 POCT device and the Abbott Architect core laboratory analyzer demonstrated excellent agreement between total β‐hCG blood results with a minimal negative proportional bias of 4%. This confirms the reliability of hCG results at the clinical decision threshold (1500 IU/L) for PUL, highlighting the i‐STAT®1 analyzer's potential to support clinical management in the EPU. Implementing this service would be particularly beneficial in EPUs without on‐site laboratory access or where delays in obtaining hCG results impact patient care. The availability of POCT blood hCG analysis could facilitate rapid triage of women with PUL into high‐ and low‐risk groups using decision support algorithms.

During the study period, 47 of the 61 participants (77%) had hCG values below 2000 IU/L, supporting the view that most hCG results in PUL triage reside within the 1000–2000 IU/L range, which aligns with the quantitative range of the i‐STAT®1. This further supports the use of the Abbott i‐STAT®1 device for blood hCG testing to guide management in this clinical context. In most cases of ectopic pregnancy following a PUL classification, initial hCG concentrations are typically < 1000 IU/L. However, once an ectopic pregnancy is confirmed by ultrasound examination, serial hCG measurements are no longer necessary. In such cases, hCG results can assist in determining the appropriate approach for conservative, medical, or surgical management. We do not recommend point‐of‐care hCG testing for the serial monitoring of medically managed ectopic pregnancies. In these situations, use of a central laboratory hCG assay is preferable to ensure continuity and accuracy, especially as patients may present outside regular hours and require assessment across different healthcare settings.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: management of undesired pregnancy of unknown location and abortion at less than 42 days of gestation [^114fhh73]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Society of Family Planning — medication management of pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) outlines hCG-based follow-up after immediate medication treatment. Multiple studies define complete abortion or successfully treated PUL as a 50% serum quantitative hCG decline at 48 to 72 hours after misoprostol, or 80% serum quantitative hCG decline at 7 days after mifepristone, and following serum quantitative hCG levels to zero is not required for asymptomatic individuals who meet these criteria. For individuals with a probable intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) choosing immediate treatment with medication management, we suggest that clinicians obtain a serum quantitative hCG for any individuals at higher risk of ectopic pregnancy (EP) (GRADE 2B); and when a repeat serum quantitative hCG level is not available in medication management of PUL or probable IUP with a baseline hCG level less than 2000 mIU/mL, we suggest confirmation of pregnancy resolution with alternative approaches, which may include home urine pregnancy tests at approximately 14 days after mifepristone (GRADE 2C). Two additional studies found that patients with a baseline hCG level less than 2000 mIU/mL and complete abortion ultimately had negative urine hCG tests 14 days after medication administration.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: medication management for early pregnancy loss [^115FoAme]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Society of Family Planning — confirmation of completed early pregnancy loss (EPL) after medication management: All patients who receive medication management of EPL should be offered follow-up to confirm completed EPL, and "we suggest clinicians offer all patients confirmation of completed EPL, and in-person evaluation should not be required (GRADE 2B)". When ultrasonography is used, in-person follow-up most commonly occurs "1 to 2 weeks" after treatment with the goal "to confirm the passage of the GS", and "there is no need to demonstrate a completely empty uterine cavity or use a cutoff for endometrial thickness". Supporting data note that among "2,208 individuals" undergoing medication abortion, no endometrial thickness threshold had a positive predictive value "greater than 25%" for needing a procedure, and "we recommend against using endometrial thickness alone as a criterion for recommending additional intervention after medication management of EPL (GRADE 1B)". Testing of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) by blood or urine is "often used" when ultrasound is not feasible; however, "there is significantly more variability" in serum quantitative hCG after EPL, and while a greater decline is associated with success, "there was no threshold for percentage decrease that could predict successful treatment", and "a substantial decrease in serum quantitative hCG level can suggest successful completion of EPL", with urine hCG time-to-negativity thresholds "not clearly defined" and monitoring guided by "clinical signs and symptoms". Telemedicine may be used for follow-up; "Telephone follow-up to assess symptoms at 1 week, with subsequent at-home high-sensitivity urine hCG testing at 4 weeks after treatment, may be an acceptable approach", and for medication abortion, when patient and clinician believe treatment was successful "they are correct 96% to 99% of the time", whereas for EPL such prediction is "likely lower" given its less predictable symptom trajectory.

### Low risk of relapse after achieving undetectable HCG levels in women with partial molar pregnancy [^113GdzzS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

We evaluated the risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) for women with partial molar pregnancy whose human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels fall spontaneously to undetectable levels using a sensitive hCG assay.

Methods

We analyzed data from the New England Trophoblastic Disease Center to estimate the risk of GTN among 284 women with partial molar pregnancy and at least 6 months of gonadotropin follow-up.

Results

None of the 238 women with complete gonadotropin follow-up and a spontaneous decline in serum hCG levels to undetectable levels subsequently developed GTN (95% confidence interval 0–1.6%).

Conclusion

If these results are replicated at other institutions with longstanding experience managing partial molar pregnancies, it may be reasonable to abbreviate clinical follow-up for women with partial molar pregnancy whose serum hCG levels spontaneously decline to an undetectable level.

5 TREATMENT

5.1 Molar pregnancy

Suction evacuation and curettage, ideally performed under ultrasound guidance, is the preferred method of evacuation of a molar pregnancy independent of uterine size if maintenance of fertility is desired. It is recommended that a 12–14 mm suction cannula be used and that an intravenous oxytocin infusion may be started at the onset of suction curettage and may be continued for several hours postoperatively to enhance uterine contractility and decrease blood loss. Because the risk of bleeding increases with uterine size, blood for transfusion should be available when the uterus is greater than 16 weeks in gestational size. Rh immune globulin should be given to Rh‐negative women at the time of molar evacuation as RhD factor is expressed on the trophoblast. Judicious use of appropriate evacuation equipment and techniques, access to blood products, careful intraoperative monitoring, and early recognition and correction of complications results in improved outcomes. If there is no persistent bleeding, a second evacuation is usually not needed.

Hysterectomy is an alternative to suction curettage if childbearing is complete. In addition to evacuating the molar pregnancy, hysterectomy provides permanent sterilization and decreases the need for subsequent chemotherapy by eliminating the risk of local myometrial invasion as a cause of persistent disease. Medical induction of labor and hysterotomy are not recommended for molar evacuation since these methods increase maternal morbidity and the development of postmolar GTN requiring chemotherapy.

Prophylactic administration of either methotrexate or actinomycin D chemotherapy at the time of or immediately following molar evacuation is associated with a reduction in the incidence of postmolar GTN to 3%–8%. However, it should be limited to special situations in which the risk of postmolar GTN is much greater than normal or where adequate hCG follow‐up is not possible.

Follow‐up hCG monitoring every 1–2 weeks is essential for early diagnosis of and management of postmolar GTN. On the other hand, postmolar GTN rarely occurs after the spontaneous return of hCG levels to normal, allowing for a shortened follow‐up period for most women. Hence, a single additional confirmatory normal hCG measurement 1 month after first hCG normalization is recommended for a PHM and monthly hCG measurements should be obtained for only 6 months after hCG normalization for a CHM. Termination of pregnancy is not indicated if accidental pregnancy occurs during surveillance after the hCG level has returned to normal. In addition, data now show that it is safe to recommend oral contraceptives.

### Serum human chorionic gonadotropin decline following aspiration abortion in early pregnancy less than 42 days gestation [^116ZcspZ]. Contraception (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To define serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) decline following complete aspiration abortion.

Study Design

We performed a secondary analysis of 86 patients who underwent uncomplicated aspiration abortion for ultrasound-confirmed pregnancy ≤ 42 days gestation and had serum hCG at the time of aspiration and within 3 days postprocedure.

Results

Median hCG declines were 72.9% by day 1 (n = 14), 87.6% by day 2 (n = 50), and 92.8% by day 3 (n = 22). Ninetieth percentile declines were 67.8%, 81.5%, and 90.8%. Minimum hCG declines were 56.2%, 77.3%, and 83.2%. Trends did not vary by gestational age or by initial hCG < 3000 mIU/mL.

Conclusion

Postprocedure hCG trend varies over the first few days in early gestation. At ≤ 42 days gestation, serial hCG decline at 1 day after completed aspiration abortion is greater than 50%, consistent with the decline observed in medication abortion.

Implications

This study confirms previously estimated human chorionic gonadotropin decline after aspiration abortion of at least 50% at 24 hours for completed procedure in very early gestations. Minimum declines on days 2 and 3 are approximately 70% and 80%.

### Navigating pregnancy testing in chronic pain management for women of reproductive age [^114SeFLP]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Serum Pregnancy Tests

Serum beta-hCG tests are more sensitive and can detect pregnancy earlier. Results below 5 mIU/mL indicate a non-pregnant state; results above 25 mIU/mL confirm pregnancy. Indeterminate values (6–24 mIU/mL) warrant repeat testing after 48 hours.

Though more accurate, serum testing takes longer and may not be feasible in urgent scenarios. It is especially important in high-risk populations or when urine tests are incongruent with clinical signs.

However, these tests may yield false negatives or false positives in specific clinical contexts.

False Negatives

While pregnancy testing is accessible and effective, clinicians must recognize its limitations and the potential for diagnostic errors. The most common cause of false-negative results is early testing, before hCG levels rise above the detection threshold. Variations in ovulation, fertilization, implantation, or delayed menses can all contribute to this.

Another cause is the hook effect, where extremely high hCG levels (eg, in gestational trophoblastic disease) oversaturate the test, leading to a falsely negative result. A related issue, the variant hook effect, occurs when specific hCG isoforms (eg, free beta-subunit) interfere with test accuracy, especially between 7–12 weeks of gestation, leading to false-negative urine results. The presence of these variants can lead to significant discrepancies in hCG measurements, which are critical for diagnosing and monitoring pregnancy-related conditions. Therefore, it may be essential to choose immunoassays that can accurately detect and differentiate between the various forms of hCG, including the free beta-subunit, to avoid diagnostic errors caused by these effects.

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia — post-evacuation hCG follow-up and contraception: The NCCN Panel recommends hCG assay monitoring every 1 to 2 weeks until levels have normalized, defined as three consecutive normal assays, and following initial normalization, consider hCG measurement every 3 months for 6 months; patients should also use contraception and oral contraceptive pills are preferred for at least 6 months. Once normalized, recurrent elevation of hCG has been reported in < 1% of patients, and a study noted that normalization beyond 56 days after uterine evacuation had a 3.8-fold higher risk of post-molar GTN; the occurrence of GTN after normalization is rare after the recommended 6 months of post-normalization hCG monitoring.

### Predicting the decline in human chorionic gonadotropin in a resolving pregnancy of unknown location [^114jj2nQ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To characterize the curve derived from serial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) values in women with spontaneous resolution of pregnancy of unknown location and to assess factors that modify the decline.

Methods

Data from three sites were extracted from a clinical database of women with a symptomatic pregnancy of unknown location that required follow-up with serial hCG levels. A nonlinear mixed-effects regression model was used to generate hCG elimination curves.

Results

Four hundred forty-three women presenting with a pregnancy of unknown location that resolved without intervention were studied between September 2007 and May 2009. Women older than 35 years had a slower hCG decline (P = 0.001) and those with pain had a steeper decline (P = 0.006), but these changes did not alter the curve in a clinically meaningful way. The decline in hCG is faster for those with a higher level at presentation. The average decline of hCG in women with spontaneous resolution is slower than previously reported. However, the minimal decline in hCG for women with spontaneous resolution of a pregnancy of unknown location ranged from 35% to 50% at 2 days of follow-up and from 66% to 87% at 7 days, which is more rapid than previously reported.

Conclusion

In a diverse population, using updated statistical methods, it was observed that the minimal decline in hCG for women with spontaneous resolution is more rapid than previously reported. A decline slower than these thresholds may indicate the presence of retained trophoblastic tissue or ectopic pregnancy.

Serum hCG trend interpretation when ultrasonography is inconclusive in undesired PUL: When transvaginal ultrasonography is not conclusive, a single serum quantitative hCG value does not predict whether an IUP with cardiac activity will develop; clinicians should incorporate trend considerations when making ongoing management decisions based on serial serum hCG measurements in undesired PUL.

### Multi-level pregnancy test use for medical abortion follow-up after 63 days' gestation: evidence from prenatal hCG data [^112Sn7SK]. Contraception (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore hCG patterns using multi-level urine pregnancy tests (MLPTs) among prenatal clients to evaluate the potential use of these tests for medical abortion follow-up after 63 days' gestation.

Study Design

Prenatal clients with gestations 9–12 weeks were asked to administer an MLPT weekly for three weeks. We evaluated change in hCG range over one- and two-week intervals.

Results

Our analysis included 121 clients. Over one-week intervals, 26.5–43.1% of participants had a drop in hCG range. The proportion with a decline after two-weeks was 42.0–48.3%.

Conclusion

This follow-up strategy would not work in gestations beyond 63 days.

### Diagnosis and management of molar pregnancies [^116KvNu1]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Complete and partial molar pregnancies arise from abnormal fertilization with marked proliferation of syncytiotrophoblasts. Earlier diagnosis has reduced the frequency of severe medical complications at presentation; however, the risk of progression to gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) has remained unchanged. Initial assessment should include serum hCG measurement after physical examination, laboratory testing for organ dysfunction, and Doppler ultrasound. Following uterine evacuation, pathologic assessment can distinguish complete from partial moles or non-molar gestations. Close surveillance is essential for the timely diagnosis of GTN. Cure rates and subsequent obstetrics outcomes are excellent, but all patients should be referred for psychologic support and expert level care.

### Navigating pregnancy testing in chronic pain management for women of reproductive age [^1113NBs8]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

False Positives

False-positive pregnancy test results can arise in a variety of clinical scenarios. One common situation involves biochemical pregnancies, such as those occurring after miscarriage, abortion, or delivery, where human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) remains detectable in the bloodstream before it has fully cleared. Another cause is the use of exogenous hCG in fertility treatments or performance-enhancing doping, with the hormone remaining traceable for up to two weeks after injection. Certain tumors can also secrete hCG, leading to elevated levels in individuals who are not pregnant. In perimenopausal or postmenopausal women, the pituitary gland may produce hCG, contributing to false-positive results in this population. Test interference is another consideration — high doses of biotin, for example, can distort serum-based assay results, although this typically does not affect urine tests, which remain negative in such cases. Lastly, familial hCG syndrome, a rare inherited condition, can lead to persistently elevated hCG levels, creating a clinical picture that mimics pregnancy despite the absence of gestation.

A false negative may expose a fetus to teratogenic interventions, while a false positive could prevent a patient from receiving potentially beneficial therapies due to fetal risk. Pregnancy testing is a critical tool for early pregnancy detection, but given the above limitations clinicians must interpret results with a nuanced understanding of timing and hormone dynamics.

Obtain a repeat serum hCG determination at least 2 days after the initial presentation because it is useful in characterizing the risk of ectopic pregnancy and the probability of a viable intrauterine pregnancy.

### Following declining human chorionic gonadotropin values in pregnancies of unknown location: when is it safe to stop? [^113pdDKq]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if the pattern of decline in hCG curves can discriminate spontaneous abortion (SAB) from ectopic pregnancy (EP).

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

University hospitals.

Patient(S)

A total of 1,551 women with symptomatic pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) and decreasing hCG values.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Percentage change in hCG; days and visits to final diagnosis.

Result(S)

Of the 1,551 women with a PUL and declining hCG, 146 were ultimately diagnosed with EP and 1,405 with SAB. An 85% hCG drop within 4 days or a 95% hCG drop within 7 days both ruled out an EP 100% of the time. Applying the 4-day cutoff to this population would have saved 16% of the SAB population (229/1,405) a total of 2,841 person-days and 277 clinical visits. Applying the 7-day cutoff would have saved 9% of the SAB population (126/1,405) a total of 1,294 person-days and 182 clinical visits. These cutoffs were separately validated on a group of 179 EPs collected from three university clinical centers. In that population, each cutoff separately ruled out EP 100% of the time.

Conclusion(S)

The decline in serum hCG is slower in EPs than in SAB and can be used to aid clinicians in the frequency and duration of follow-up. Costs and patient time may be saved by allowing women who meet one of these criteria to be followed less frequently.

### Using a decline in serum hCG between days 0–4 to predict ectopic pregnancy treatment success after single-dose methotrexate: a retrospective cohort study [^113Gdm68]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that a fall in serum hCG between days 0–4 of treatment represents an 85% likelihood of treatment success with no further intervention, medical or surgical, for single-dose methotrexate treatment of ectopic pregnancy. We analysed the early serum hCG trends of 206 women treated with single-dose methotrexate for their ectopic pregnancies in a range of treatment centres, and these are numbers far greater than previously reported (n = 30, n = 45 and n = 129).

A large number of women were excluded from our analysis due to inaccurate timing of (or missed) serum hCG level measurements, in contrast to the requirements of the single-dose methotrexate treatment protocol. Specifically, the analyses performed in this study required serum hCG levels to be available for days 0 or 1, day 4 and day 7 after methotrexate treatment. While this raises the possibility of a selection bias, it is not immediately clear how this may have affected our results. Certainly attendance at such numerous and specific time points for serum sampling requires significant patient (and physician) compliance, but non-compliance is unlikely to have any bearing on treatment outcome, which was the primary outcome assessed in this study. Indeed, the results obtained are consistent with those of previous studies in other populations. This study therefore, strengthens the validity of the prognostic value of a falling serum hCG between days 0–4 after single-dose methotrexate treatment for ectopic pregnancy.

### What serial hCG can tell you, and cannot tell you, about an early pregnancy [^1143nGXz]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

The serial measurement of serum hCG concentrations is an important clinical tool used to differentiate normal from abnormal pregnancies. At hCG values below which ultrasonography can be diagnostic, the comparison of a patient's hCG dynamics to those of established expected curves of rise or fall can aid the clinician in determining when to follow expectantly and when to intervene. Still, this method has some limitations and should never supersede clinical judgment based on symptoms or signs.

### Medication abortion up to 70 days of gestation [^114ms7Yx]. Contraception (2020). High credibility.

Medication abortion up to 70 days of gestation — clinical follow-up clarifies that when a patient obtains in-person follow-up after medication abortion, transvaginal ultrasonography is commonly used, although it is not required, and if ultrasound is performed the sole purpose is to determine whether the gestational sac is present or absent because the measurement of endometrial thickness or other findings do not predict the need for subsequent uterine aspiration. In research trials, when a transvaginal ultrasound examination shows no evidence of a gestational sac 1 week after mifepristone use, only 1.6% of patients needed subsequent uterine aspiration. For patients who cannot return to the same facility, they can obtain serum hCG testing at a convenient location; a serum hCG level decrease of at least 80% over 6–7 days after initiating treatment with mifepristone and misoprostol indicates a successful abortion. In a randomized trial of in-clinic transvaginal ultrasonography or serum hCG testing follow-up, 24.5% of patients were lost to follow-up, with no significant differences reported in unplanned visits and interventions by 2 weeks (6.6% versus 8.2%, respectively) or in uterine evacuation rates by 4 weeks (4.4% and 1.4%, respectively).

### Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) trend within the first few days after medical abortion: a prospective study [^1153CBqf]. Contraception (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To prospectively describe the decline in serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the first 5 days after complete medical abortion and evaluate the influence of initial hCG and gestational duration.

Study Design

We conducted a prospective, physiologic study of women ≤ 63 days gestation who underwent medical abortion with 200 mg mifepristone and 800 mcg buccal misoprostol. We stratified enrollment into two gestational cohorts, < 49 days and 49–63 days, to ensure gestational variability. We collected serum quantitative hCG values on Day 1 (day of mifepristone), Day 3, Day 5 and a routine follow up hCG on Days 7–14. We calculated the percent hCG decline from Day 1 to each repeat measure and evaluated trends based on initial serum hCG level and gestation.

Results

We enrolled 66 women; 59 were protocol-adherent and included in our analysis. Mean gestation on Day 1 was 49 days and mean baseline hCG was 72,332 IU. Fifty-seven subjects (97%) had a complete medical abortion without further intervention. The mean serum hCG decline among subjects with complete medical abortion was 70.0 ± 10.6% [range 36.9–98.6%] on Day 3 and 91.4 ± 4.4% [range 68.4–97.7%] on Day 5. The mean serum hCG decline from Day 1 to routine follow-up on Days 7–9 was 97.1 ± 1.7% [range 92.4–99.2%], from Day 1 to Day 10–11 was 98.5 ± 1.4% [range 94.7–99.6%] and from Day 1 to Day 12–14 was 98.7 ± 2.8% [range 86.7–99.9%]. There was no difference in percent hCG decline stratified by initial hCG or gestation.

Conclusions

There is a rapid and predictable decline in serum hCG as early as Day 5 after complete medical abortion through 63 days gestation. Rate of hCG decline is not affected by initial hCG or gestational duration.

Implications

For women who require confirmation of complete abortion sooner than 1 week after mifepristone, due to patient preference, logistical constraints or in the setting of pregnancy of unconfirmed location, a single repeat hCG on Day 5 may be clinically useful.

### Surgical abortion prior to 7 weeks of gestation [^112ezN5R]. Contraception (2013). Medium credibility.

Ectopic pregnancy in early abortion care — incidence, diagnostic clues, and hCG thresholds: CDC estimates indicate ectopic pregnancy occurred in approximately 19.7 per 1000 pregnancies in the United States in 1992, while among women seeking early induced abortion the incidence ranges from 1.4 to 6.0 per 1000 in large series. Patients may be asymptomatic; up to half are asymptomatic. Ultrasound is often nondiagnostic, and ectopic pregnancy should be suspected in any patient with a positive pregnancy test plus an empty uterus and a noncystic adnexal mass; sonographic signs occur in only 20% and 11% of ectopic pregnancies and free fluid is present in about 30% of cases. Serial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) trends help: normal early pregnancy shows a minimum expected increase of 53% over 48 h, failing intrauterine pregnancies often decrease by 21%–35% over 48 h, and most ectopic pregnancies rise or fall more slowly than these parameters. When ultrasound is nondiagnostic and products of conception are absent in the fresh tissue aspirate, ectopic pregnancy is likely if the initial hCG is above the discriminatory level or concentrations fail to drop by at least 50% within 24–48 h after surgery. Using this approach, Edwards identified 14 women with ectopic pregnancy, half diagnosed on the day of the abortion visit.

Conclusions

We have found that a fall in serum hCG between days 0–4 after single-dose methotrexate treatment of ectopic pregnancy (where the pre-treatment serum hCG is ≤ 3000 IU/L), predicts treatment success in 85% of cases, with no further intervention required (medical or surgical).

With this measure, prognostic information is obtained three days earlier than from the current, standard clinical measure, and with comparable accuracy. This raises the possibility of altering existing methotrexate protocols, with the aim of increasing medical treatment success rates, by intervening with an earlier repeat dose where early serum hCG levels are still rising; this would, however, require further investigation.

We believe that clinical staff caring for women with ectopic pregnancies, treated with single-dose methotrexate, can confidently use a falling serum hCG between days 0–4 of treatment to provide earlier prognostic information and reassurance to patients with this potentially life-threatening condition.

Pregnancy and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) — "During pregnancy, trophoblastic cells produce the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)". Biochemical pregnancy is defined as "A patient is considered pregnant when the serum hCG value is greater than 5 mIU/mL", with assay variability noted: "Given the multitude of hCG assays available, specific values and terminology may vary, and centers are encouraged to refer to local laboratory guidelines", and "For example, the modifier for beta is not used by some laboratories". It cautions that "Values of 5 mIU/mL or less may occur in healthy nonpregnant patients" and that "Rarely, elevated hCG levels may be unrelated to pregnancy, such as with pituitary dysfunction or renal disease".

Society of Family Planning — pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) management and post-aspiration follow-up: For individuals with PUL who do not meet criteria for pregnancy resolution after initial medication management, we recommend continued evaluation with serial serum quantitative hCG, ultrasonography, uterine aspiration, empiric treatment with methotrexate, or some combination of these interventions (GRADE 1C). When uterine aspiration is performed at less than 42 days of gestation, including for individuals with PUL or probable intrauterine pregnancy, and both chorionic villi and gestational sac are not visualized, we recommend repeat ultrasonography (if an intrauterine pregnancy or probable intrauterine pregnancy was seen initially), serum quantitative hCG follow-up, or both (GRADE 1B). When both chorionic villi and gestational sac are not visualized after uterine aspiration and serial serum hCG follow-up is warranted, we recommend testing on the day of the procedure and 24 to 72 hours later, with pregnancy resolution defined as greater than 50% decline 24 hours after aspiration, greater than 70% by 48 hours, or greater than 80% by approximately 72 hours (GRADE 1B).

Because lower initial hCG concentrations are associated with slower rates of decline in spontaneous abortions, the aim of this study was to provide a detailed description of the expected rates of hCG decline in patients presenting with very low initial hCG levels and who ultimately were confirmed to have spontaneous abortions. When initial levels lie between 50 and 500 mIU/mL, the slowest expected percentage decline ranges from 12% to 24% in 2 days and from 34% to 68% in 7 days.

### Postevacuation hCG levels and risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia in women with complete molar pregnancy [^114deshM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Women diagnosed with complete hydatidiform molar pregnancy are at 15% to 28% risk of developing persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) requiring further management with chemotherapy. Our objective was to develop human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) criteria that establish a patient's risk of developing persistent GTN or achieving remission from their baseline risk within a few weeks of molar evacuation.

Methods

We used a database from the New England Trophoblastic Disease Center to analyze hCG levels from 1,029 women with complete molar pregnancies. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 1973 to 2001.

Results

Women whose hCG level declined below 50 mIU/mL during their follow-up were found to be at no more than 1.1% risk for developing persistent GTN, irrespective of when this level was reached. Women whose hCG levels was below 200 mIU/mL in the fourth week after evacuation (59.8% of all women), or below 100 mIU/mL in the sixth week after evacuation (65.8% of all women), had a risk of persistence below 9%. hCG levels above 2,000 mIU/mL in the fourth week after evacuation (13.3% of women) were associated with a 63.8% risk of developing persistent disease.

Conclusion

These data may allow clinicians to evaluate the risk of persistence that their patients with complete molar pregnancy have based on early hCG results after molar evacuation. In the fourth week after molar evacuation, 59.8% of women may be counseled that their risk of developing persistent GTN is substantially reduced from their baseline, whereas 13.3% of women may be warned that their risk of developing persistent GTN is greater than 50%.

### Effect of hCG day's estradiol levels on pregnancy outcomes following GnRH antagonist protocol: a retrospective study of 3192 fresh embryo transfer cycles [^113AqMuL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Researchers have investigated the relationship between E2 levels and pregnancy outcomes from multiple perspectives. For example, some studies tried to use the progesterone-to-estradiol ratio (P/E2) to predict pregnancy outcomes. However, the results were not consistent across cycles. Also, the P/E2 ratio did not show a clear predictive value. Some scholars have focused on the reduction of E2 and found that a decrease in E2 levels during this process might adversely affect clinical pregnancy rates, increase early abortion rates, and reduce ongoing pregnancy rates following IVF-ET. In addition, some studies have focused on the rate of E2 increasing during COH, aiming to predict pregnancy rates by dynamically monitoring changes in E2 levels. However, more studies have focused their research on E2 levels on the day of hCG administration. Joo et al. found that serum E2 levels affect pregnancy outcomes in a concentration-dependent way. The best range for serum E2 depends on age. For women under 38 years, the optimal range is 3000–4000 pg/mL. For women aged 38 or older, the optimal range is 2000–3000 pg/mL. Serum E2 levels on the hCG trigger day were segmentally associated with clinical pregnancy and LBRs according to Xu et al. We found that the rates of biochemical pregnancy and clinical pregnancy are highest when the E2-hCG level is between 1500 and 4000 pg/mL. In contrast, some researchers found no significant differences in implantation rates and pregnancy rates based on E2 levels. In our study, we observed a curved inverted U-shaped relationship between E2-hCG levels and pregnancy outcomes. An ideal pregnancy rate is achieved when E2-hCG levels range from 1500 to 4000 pg/mL, whereas pregnancy rates are lower when E2-hCG is below 1500 pg/mL or above 4000 pg/mL. However, pregnancy outcomes show no significant difference between the E2-hCG < 1500 pg/mL and E2-hCG > 4000 pg/mL groups. The different results we see in studies can be due to several reasons. First, some studies have smaller sample sizes. Second, the characteristics of the population in the studies can also affect the results. For example, some previous studies mainly included people of European descent. Our study, however, focused on an Asian population. Genetic, environmental, and lifestyle differences between these groups can lead to different responses to E2 levels and affect pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, the methods used to measure E2 levels vary between studies. Different labs might use different protocols, which can lead to different E2 results.

Regarding medical management for gestational trophoblastic disease - NCCN, more specifically with respect to management of high-risk GTN, NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend to monitor hCG assay every 2 weeks during treatment. Recognize that post-treatment imaging is not routinely recommended for follow-up after hCG normalization in patients with post-molar GTN or choriocarcinoma, where hCG is a reliable tumor marker. Consider following patients with brain metastases with MRI of the brain with contrast for 2–3 years.

### Navigating pregnancy testing in chronic pain management for women of reproductive age [^112ah5EB]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Radiation Exposure and Pregnancy Risk

When non-pharmacological and pharmacological measures have failed, interventional pain procedures may be warranted. For women undergoing these procedures, radiation exposure introduces another layer of complexity. Fluoroscopy-guided injections can expose a developing fetus to ionizing radiation. Radiation risks are typically categorized as deterministic (eg, malformations, growth restriction) and stochastic (eg, childhood cancer, genetic mutations). The likelihood and severity of these outcomes depend on both the dose and the timing of exposure.

Below 50 mGy, fetal risk is considered negligible.
Between 50–100 mGy, risk is unclear and varies based on gestational age.
Above 100–150 mGy, the risk of adverse outcomes — including neurological impairments and congenital anomalies — increases significantly.

Organogenesis, occurring between weeks 2 and 7 of gestation, represents the most vulnerable period for deterministic effects. For this reason, early pregnancy screening is essential when planning fluoroscopic procedures.

Fluoroscopically guided interventions can deliver higher than 50 mGy doses, particularly if multiple views or prolonged imaging are needed. For reference, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) notes that most diagnostic imaging procedures fall below the 50 mGy threshold which is not associated with significant risks such as miscarriage, genetic damage, or teratogenicity.

Pregnancy screening is a simple, low-cost safeguard. However, despite the pre-procedure pregnancy testing recommendations from professional societies like the ACR and ACC, there remains a lack of formalized, consistent pregnancy testing protocols specifically tailored to chronic pain management settings.

Pregnancy Testing

Biological Basis of hCG Testing

Pregnancy tests typically rely on detecting intact human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone produced shortly after implantation, around 8–10 days post-ovulation.hCG levels rise through the first trimester, peak, and gradually decline by mid-pregnancy. After a pregnancy ends — whether through delivery or miscarriage — levels typically normalize within 4–6 weeks.

hCG exists in multiple forms due to glycosylation apart from intact hCG, including free subunits, and nicked variants. This variability can affect test performance, especially early in gestation.

While clinical history can sometimes exclude pregnancy — such as in patients with hysterectomy or active cancer treatment — most cases require testing to confirm pregnancy status.

Urine Pregnancy Tests

Urine-based hCG tests are widely used due to their convenience and affordability. They offer results within minutes and are reliable once hCG levels exceed 20 mIU/mL.

### Monitoring complete hydatidiform molar pregnancies after normalisation of human chorionic gonadotrophin: national retrospective population study [^116yeE4h]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Comparison with other studies

As previously reported, and similar to the findings in this study, the overall risk of developing GTN following hCG normalization is low. Monitoring of hCG levels after evacuation of a complete hydatidiform mole previously lasted for two years. Most current guidelines (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics), however, indicate that surveillance should continue for up to six months after normalisation of this hormone. In some countries, including the UK, if normalisation of hCG levels occurs in < 56 days, follow-up is reduced to six months from the date of evacuation.

### Chemotherapy and human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations 6 months after uterine evacuation of molar pregnancy: a retrospective cohort study [^1115BxWX]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Indications for chemotherapy in gestational trophoblastic disease include raised human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentrations 6 months after uterine evacuation of hydatidiform mole, even when values are falling. We aimed to establish whether chemotherapy is always necessary in these patients.

Methods

We retrospectively identified women registered between January, 1993, and May, 2008, at Charing Cross Hospital, London, UK, who had persistently high hCG concentrations 6 months after evacuation of hydatidiform mole. Rates of hCG normalisation, relapse, and death were assessed in patients continued under surveillance and those who received chemotherapy after 6 months. We postulated that a surveillance policy would be clinically acceptable if hCG values returned to normal in 75% of patients or more.

Findings

76 (< 1%) of 13,960 patients with hydatidiform moles had persistently high hCG concentrations of more than 5 IU/L 6 months after evacuation. 66 (87%) patients continued under surveillance and hCG values spontaneously returned to normal without chemotherapy in 65 (98%) of these patients. Values in one patient did not become normal because of chronic renal failure, but she remains healthy. Ten patients received chemotherapy, and hCG concentrations returned to normal in eight (80%) of these individuals (surveillance vs chemotherapy groups p = 0.044) and remained slightly high (6–11 IU/L) in two without any associated clinical problems off treatment. We noted no significant differences between individuals in the surveillance and chemotherapy groups, apart from lower median hCG concentrations 6 months after evacuation in those under surveillance than in those given chemotherapy (13 IU/L, range 5–887, vs 157 IU/L, range 6–6438; p = 0.004). Overall, there were no deaths in this series.

Interpretation

A surveillance policy seems to be clinically acceptable in patients with low and declining concentrations of hCG 6 months after evacuation of hydatidiform mole.

Serum hCG level thresholds with transvaginal ultrasound — when sonographic abnormalities are present, a serum hCG level greater than 1,500 mIU/mL indicated ectopic pregnancy with virtual certainty; without these sonographic abnormalities, a serum hCG level greater than 2,000 mIU/mL increased the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy and excluded viable intrauterine pregnancy; smaller prospective studies identified all viable intrauterine pregnancies above 1,025 mIU/mL and above 1,000 mIU/mL, and in a study of 52 pregnant women all viable intrauterine pregnancies were identified with hCG levels above 750 mIU/mL; Level B recommendations: Arrange follow-up for patients with a nondiagnostic transvaginal ultrasound and a serum hCG level above 2,000 mIU/mL because they have an increased likelihood of ectopic pregnancy.

### Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112M3bK1]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) — presentation and initial workup includes that post-molar GTN can present with irregular bleeding after molar treatment, enlarged/irregular uterus, and bilateral ovarian enlargement, though these signs may be absent in choriocarcinoma after normal pregnancies; metastatic lesions are often hemorrhagic and may have neurologic or pulmonary symptoms; ETT and PSTT typically present with irregular uterine bleeding after a prior pregnancy. Workup includes history/physical with metastatic imaging, brain MRI (preferred), and pelvic ultrasound or MRI; visible lower genital tract lesions should not be biopsied due to hemorrhage risk. The NCCN Panel recommends repeat CBC differential with platelets; liver, renal, and thyroid function testing; and hCG assay; if hCG is elevated without imaging evidence of disease, consider LH crossover or phantom hCG; if hCG is persistently low-level and stable, quiescent GTN is possible and close follow-up rather than immediate treatment may be considered. GTN should be staged and scored using FIGO; staging is based on location/extent: stage I uterine-confined, stage II genital extension/metastasis, stage III lung metastasis, and stage IV non-pulmonary distant metastases.

Normal luteal physiology — A typical luteal phase length is relatively fixed at 12–14 days but may range from 11–17 days, and progesterone levels peak in nonpregnancy cycles 6–8 days after ovulation. Progesterone is secreted in pulses under the control of luteinizing hormone (LH), and progesterone levels may fluctuate up to eightfold within 90 minutes. Once implantation occurs, progesterone secretion by the corpus luteum depends on rising human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels, and failure of hCG levels to increase results directly in corpus luteum failure and a decline in progesterone levels.

### Monitoring complete hydatidiform molar pregnancies after normalisation of human chorionic gonadotrophin: national retrospective population study [^111UML12]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

We have previously shown that the risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after hCG levels return to normal in patients with a partial hydatidiform mole is low (0.03%, n = 3 of 9586 patients) and therefore, we recommended one confirmatory normal value before stopping hCG monitoring. In contrast, for a complete hydatidiform mole, we noted a slightly higher risk of postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after hCG levels had returned to normal (0.24%, n = 20 of 8400 patients) which decreased from one in 839 (0.12%) patients at four months to one in 1677 (0.06%) patients at 12 months after the first normal hCG value. In keeping with previous data, patients with a complete hydatidiform mole who achieved normalisation of hCG levels in < 56 days had a significantly lower risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia than those with normal levels in ≥ 56 days (one in 1159 (0.09%) v one in 308 (0.32%) patients, odds ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.88, P = 0.03). Consequently, patients with a complete hydatidiform mole seemed to need longer monitoring if hCG levels returned to normal in ≥ 56 days from the date of uterine evacuation. In the UK, hCG monitoring is continued for six more months after the first normal hCG value in these patients, whereas those with normal hCG levels in < 56 days are monitored for only six months from the date of molar evacuation. Globally, many other centres monitor patients with a complete hydatidiform mole for several months after a normal hCG level.

Prolonged monitoring after normalisation of hCG levels after uterine evacuation of a complete hydatidiform mole can cause considerable distress for patients and delay their ability to attempt another pregnancy. Patients report disruption of their wellbeing by feelings of anxiousness (47%), depression (27%), and distress (70%) because of receiving a diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic disease. Hence, we thought it might be possible to shorten the duration of hCG monitoring when hCG levels had returned to normal after a complete hydatidiform mole, particularly in those who achieved their first normal value in < 56 days. Here, in a larger cohort of patients from two trophoblastic disease centres, we reviewed the relative risk of malignant transformation over time in patients with a complete hydatidiform mole who had normal hCG levels in < 56 and ≥ 56 days.
