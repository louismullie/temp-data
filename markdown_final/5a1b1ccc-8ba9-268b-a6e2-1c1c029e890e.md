## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a thorough overview of the types, pathophysiology, and management of different shock states, including hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive shock. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational definition and classification of shock. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and hemodynamic signatures for each shock type. Next, I will examine diagnostic approaches, especially bedside echocardiography and invasive hemodynamics. After that, I need to detail management principles by shock type, including fluids, vasopressors, inotropes, source control, and mechanical circulatory support. Finally, I should consider special populations, mixed shock phenotypes, and evidence gaps to ensure the synthesis is clinically actionable and reference-aligned.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition and classification so I don't build on a shaky premise. Shock is best defined as a life-threatening, generalized acute circulatory failure with inadequate oxygen delivery to meet tissue metabolic demand, producing cellular dysoxia and organ dysfunction; clinically, it is categorized into four mechanistic types: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive, with frequent overlap in real-world patients [^111xvBfU].

> I will now examine hypovolemic shock, and I need to ensure I capture both absolute and relative volume losses. Absolute hypovolemia arises from hemorrhage or external fluid losses, while relative hypovolemia reflects vasodilation with maldistributed intravascular volume; the hemodynamic signature is low preload with low stroke volume and compensatory vasoconstriction, producing cool, mottled extremities and delayed capillary refill, with hypotension typically appearing after about 30% blood volume loss due to robust compensation [^116QRcgL] [^115uTsqH].

> Next, I should review cardiogenic shock and verify its heterogeneity. Cardiogenic shock results from primary cardiac pump failure with low cardiac output despite adequate preload, often with elevated filling pressures; it includes acute myocardial infarction–related CS, heart failure–related CS, and other etiologies such as myocarditis or arrhythmias, and it frequently coexists with vasodilatory components, yielding mixed phenotypes with variable systemic vascular resistance and high mortality despite therapy [^1156XxAz] [^112t7Kdp] [^112JA3oB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about obstructive shock; I should confirm the classic causes and hemodynamics. Obstructive shock arises from mechanical impediments to venous return or outflow, such as tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, massive pulmonary embolism, or severe aortic stenosis; the hallmark is low cardiac output with elevated right-sided pressures and dilated right chambers on echocardiography, and urgent relief of the obstruction is lifesaving [^116QRcgL] [^117MvkaZ].

> I need to check the pathophysiology of distributive shock carefully, especially sepsis. Distributive shock is characterized by inappropriate vasodilation, maldistributed blood flow, and capillary leak with relative hypovolemia; septic shock is defined by vasopressor requirement to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg with lactate > 2 mmol/L in the absence of hypovolemia, and it carries high mortality, with early recognition and treatment improving outcomes [^115tUKZq] [^1116cwTA].

> Let me consider the diagnostic approach, and I should double-check the role of echocardiography. Bedside echocardiography is the preferred initial modality to rapidly identify shock type and guide therapy, with excellent interobserver agreement and the ability to assess preload, contractility, afterload, and obstruction; in complex or refractory cases, invasive hemodynamics with pulmonary artery catheter or transpulmonary thermodilution can refine phenotyping and management decisions [^114g35c6] [^117MvkaZ] [^116QRcgL].

> Now, I should confirm the hemodynamic signatures that distinguish types at the bedside. Hypovolemic shock typically shows low cardiac output with low filling pressures and high systemic vascular resistance; cardiogenic shock shows low cardiac output with high filling pressures and variable SVR; obstructive shock shows low cardiac output with elevated right-sided pressures and small, compressed ventricles in tamponade; distributive shock shows high cardiac output with low SVR and low MAP, though myocardial depression can blunt the hyperdynamic profile in late sepsis [^116QRcgL] [^117MvkaZ].

> For hypovolemic shock, I need to ensure I balance timely volume resuscitation with hemorrhage control. Rapid isotonic crystalloid boluses are first-line, with blood products prioritized in hemorrhagic shock; permissive hypotension may be appropriate in select trauma contexts while definitive hemorrhage control is pursued, and vasopressors are generally avoided unless as a bridge when fluids are delayed or contraindicated [^116iodym] [^111TxQxg].

> For cardiogenic shock, let me verify the hierarchy of therapy and the role of revascularization. Early identification and treatment of the cause are essential, with emergent revascularization for AMI-CS improving survival; vasoactive support favors norepinephrine to restore perfusion pressure, with dobutamine considered for low-output states, and temporary mechanical circulatory support is reserved for selected patients as a bridge to recovery, decision, or transplant, ideally within shock teams and staged algorithms such as R-O-S-E [^1156XxAz] [^114KwXEg] [^113WHxCJ] [^116cJcms].

> For obstructive shock, I should confirm that temporizing measures are paired with definitive therapy. Vasopressors can transiently maintain perfusion while arranging urgent decompression for pneumothorax, pericardiocentesis for tamponade, thrombolysis or embolectomy for massive PE, or aortic valve intervention for critical stenosis; delays in relieving the obstruction drive mortality [^111TxQxg].

> For distributive septic shock, I need to ensure I align with guideline-based bundles while individualizing. Immediate recognition, 30 mL/kg crystalloid within 3 hours with dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness, early broad-spectrum antibiotics after cultures, rapid source control, and norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor are core elements; fluid restriction after initial resuscitation is increasingly emphasized to avoid overload, and de-escalation of antimicrobials should be reassessed daily [^1116cwTA] [^1145gRY3] [^114WmUw9] [^111mfgHu].

> But wait, what if the patient has mixed shock or a nonclassical phenotype; I should double-check how to detect and manage this. Mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock is common and carries high mortality; invasive hemodynamics and echocardiography help identify low output with inappropriately low SVR, prompting combined inotrope and vasopressor strategies and careful fluid titration, with shock teams facilitating device selection and escalation decisions [^112JA3oB] [^112GEA2j] [^114TUj1G].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts so I don't overgeneralize. In pediatrics, early recognition and rapid isotonic fluid resuscitation with timely vasoactive support are critical, with sepsis bundles adapted to local resources; in older adults with cardiogenic shock, age alone should not dictate withholding disease-directed therapies, and comprehensive geriatric assessment informs goals of care; in pregnancy, peripartum cardiomyopathy and hemorrhage require obstetric-critical care coordination [^1162kEfQ] [^115QVWd3] [^1137459b].

> Next, I should review evidence gaps and future directions to keep the synthesis honest. High-quality randomized data are limited in cardiogenic shock beyond early revascularization, and in mixed shock there are no consensus definitions or trial-proven therapies; ongoing work focuses on phenotyping, biomarker-guided strategies, and standardized shock team protocols to improve outcomes and enable comparative effectiveness research [^1156XxAz] [^114Ujpxe] [^116Jq1Tj].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical takeaway is precise: classify shock by mechanism using bedside assessment and echocardiography, treat the underlying cause urgently, apply type-specific algorithms with fluids, vasoactive agents, source control, and mechanical support as indicated, anticipate mixed phenotypes with invasive monitoring, and engage multidisciplinary shock teams to individualize care and navigate evidence gaps [^114g35c6] [^1156XxAz] [^1116cwTA] [^116Jq1Tj].

Shock is a life-threatening state of **inadequate tissue perfusion** [^111xvBfU] with four main types: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive [^1137459b]. Each type has distinct pathophysiology and requires **targeted management** [^1158HAXA]. Hypovolemic shock is treated with rapid hemorrhage control and isotonic crystalloids or blood products [^116iodym]; cardiogenic shock with inotropes/vasopressors and urgent revascularization or mechanical support [^1156XxAz]; obstructive shock with immediate relief of the obstruction (e.g. pericardiocentesis, thrombolysis, decompression) [^111TxQxg]; and distributive shock with early antibiotics, source control, and vasopressors (especially norepinephrine) [^1116cwTA] [^114WmUw9]. Early recognition, rapid diagnosis with echocardiography [^117MvkaZ], and hemodynamic monitoring are essential to guide therapy and improve outcomes [^116QRcgL].

---

## Clinical presentation

Common features include **hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, altered mentation, oliguria, and cool, mottled skin** [^notfound]. Distributive shock may show warm, flushed skin early due to vasodilation [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Bedside assessment**: Vital signs, perfusion, and organ function [^1114LUzD].
- **Echocardiography**: Rapidly identifies shock type and guides therapy [^117MvkaZ].
- **Laboratory tests**: Lactate, ABG, CBC, electrolytes, coagulation profile [^notfound].
- **Invasive hemodynamics**: Consider PAC or TPTD in complex cases [^114g35c6].

---

## Management principles

### General supportive care

- **Airway and breathing**: Ensure oxygenation and ventilate as needed [^notfound].
- **Circulation**: Establish IV access, monitor MAP/CO, and treat the cause [^116QRcgL].
- **End-organ support**: Protect renal, hepatic, and neurologic function [^111aSBRZ].

---

### Type-specific management

#### Hypovolemic shock

- **Hemorrhage control**: Direct pressure, tourniquets, surgery, embolization [^115uTsqH].
- **Fluid resuscitation**: Isotonic crystalloids; blood products for significant blood loss [^1142X2co].
- **Vasopressors**: Only if fluids are delayed or contraindicated [^111TxQtG].

---

#### Cardiogenic shock

- **Inotropes/vasopressors**: Dobutamine, norepinephrine to restore perfusion [^1178iWNH].
- **Revascularization**: Urgent PCI for AMI-related shock [^1156XxAz].
- **Mechanical support**: IABP, Impella, ECMO for refractory cases [^111rLsJC].

---

#### Obstructive shock

Obstructive shock requires **immediate relief of the obstruction** — pericardiocentesis for tamponade, thrombolysis or embolectomy for PE, and needle decompression for tension pneumothorax — with vasopressors as a bridge while definitive therapy is arranged [^111TxQtG].

---

#### Distributive shock

- **Antibiotics**: Early broad-spectrum therapy and source control [^1116cwTA] [^114WmUw9].
- **Vasopressors**: Norepinephrine first-line to restore MAP [^114KwXEg].
- **Fluids**: 30 mL/kg crystalloids initially, then individualized [^1145gRY3] [^117DEfba].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Continuous monitoring of **blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, urine output, and lactate** is essential [^notfound]. Repeat echocardiography and hemodynamic assessments guide ongoing therapy and detect complications [^117MvkaZ].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Mortality varies by type and severity: **cardiogenic shock ~40–60%**, septic shock ~30–50%, and hypovolemic shock ~10–20% with timely care [^1156XxAz] [^115tUKZq] [^114UHnXz]. Complications include multi-organ failure, ARDS, AKI, and coagulopathy [^111aSBRZ].

---

Effective shock care hinges on **rapid recognition, accurate typing, and targeted therapy** [^1158HAXA], with multidisciplinary teams and hemodynamic monitoring improving outcomes [^116Jq1Tj] [^116QRcgL].

### Contemporary management of major haemorrhage in critical care [^116iodym]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Haemorrhagic shock is frequent in critical care settings and responsible for a high mortality rate due to multiple organ dysfunction and coagulopathy. The management of critically ill patients with bleeding and shock is complex, and treatment of these patients must be rapid and definitive. The administration of large volumes of blood components leads to major physiological alterations which must be mitigated during and after bleeding. Early recognition of bleeding and coagulopathy, understanding the underlying pathophysiology related to specific disease states, and the development of individualised management protocols are important for optimal outcomes. This review describes the contemporary understanding of the pathophysiology of various types of coagulopathic bleeding; the diagnosis and management of critically ill bleeding patients, including major haemorrhage protocols and post-transfusion management; and finally highlights recent areas of opportunity to better understand optimal management strategies for managing bleeding in the intensive care unit (ICU).

### Mixed cardiogenic shock: a proposal for standardized classification, a hemodynamic definition, and framework for management [^112JA3oB]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

The classification of cardiogenic shock (CS) has evolved from a singular cold-and wet-hemodynamic profile. Data from registries and clinical trials have contributed to a broader recognition that although all patients with CS have insufficient cardiac output leading to end organ hypoperfusion, there is considerable variability in CS acuity, underlying etiologies, volume status, and systemic vascular resistance. Mixed CS can be broadly categorized as CS with at least 1 additional shock state. Mixed CS states are now the second leading cause of shock in contemporary coronary intensive care units, but there is little high-quality evidence to guide routine care, and there are no standardized classification frameworks or well-established hemodynamic definitions. This primer summarizes the current epidemiology and proposes a classification framework and invasive hemodynamic parameters to guide categorization that could be applied to help better phenotype patients captured in registries and trials, as well as guide management of mixed CS states.

### Management of cardiogenic shock: state-of-the-art [^1137idmg]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The management of cardiogenic shock is an ongoing challenge. Despite all efforts and tremendous use of resources, mortality remains high. Whilst reversing the underlying cause, restoring/maintaining organ perfusion and function are cornerstones of management. The presence of comorbidities and preexisting organ dysfunction increases management complexity, aiming to integrate the needs of vital organs in each individual patient. This review provides a comprehensive overview of contemporary literature regarding the definition and classification of cardiogenic shock, its pathophysiology, diagnosis, laboratory evaluation, and monitoring. Further, we distill the latest evidence in pharmacologic therapy and the use of mechanical circulatory support including recently published randomized-controlled trials as well as future directions of research, integrating this within an international group of authors to provide a global perspective. Finally, we explore the need for individualization, especially in the face of neutral randomized trials which may be related to a dilution of a potential benefit of an intervention (i.e. average effect) in this heterogeneous clinical syndrome, including the use of novel biomarkers, artificial intelligence, and machine learning approaches to identify specific endotypes of cardiogenic shock (i.e. subclasses with distinct underlying biological/molecular mechanisms) to support a more personalized medicine beyond the syndromic approach of cardiogenic shock.

### Contemporary management of cardiogenic shock: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1114xk2s]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiogenic shock is a high-acuity, potentially complex, and hemodynamically diverse state of end-organ hypoperfusion that is frequently associated with multisystem organ failure. Despite improving survival in recent years, patient morbidity and mortality remain high, and there are few evidence-based therapeutic interventions known to clearly improve patient outcomes. This scientific statement on cardiogenic shock summarizes the epidemiology, pathophysiology, causes, and outcomes of cardiogenic shock; reviews contemporary best medical, surgical, mechanical circulatory support, and palliative care practices; advocates for the development of regionalized systems of care; and outlines future research priorities.

### How I personalize fluid therapy in septic shock? [^117DEfba]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The first therapeutic measure in septic shock, volume expansion, is seemingly simple: a few hundred millilitres of fluid injected intravenously over a few minutes. However, nothing is simple in the strategy of using fluids in septic patients. Several different types of fluids are available today. The effects of a fluid bolus are inconsistent and transient. Fluids are risky treatments, particularly during septic shock. Then, many questions raise in practice. Which fluid to choose? Should it be infused? How to evaluate its risk and refrain from infusing it? How to predict its effects? How to evaluate them?

To these questions, one can provide a standard and unequivocal answer. This is what the current guidelines do, without distinguishing according to the clinical context and the patient characteristics. The aim is likely to make them general enough to be applied widely, which is undoubtedly laudable. Another reason is that these guidelines are based on existing randomized controlled trials, which have often paid little attention to the particularities of patients they included. So, while these recommendations are of great value, there is probably room for a more personalized fluid management. Contrary to a "universal" strategy, the idea that "one size does not fit all" has been defended for many years about several strategies in critical care medicine. The need for personalization of treatment has emerged as a virtuous goal to pursue, especially in septic shock. This is the case for fluids as for any other treatment.

In this review, we will describe what a personalized fluid strategy in septic shock can be, based not only on the existing publications, but also on the pathophysiological concepts underlying the effects of fluids. From the choice of fluid type to the decision to remove the fluid administered in excess, we will try to show that, at each stage, the choices can reasonably be individualized.

How to customize the choice of fluid type?

### Detailing the cardiovascular profile in shock patients [^114g35c6]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

What is the type of shock?

The next important point would be to evaluate the type of shock that the patient presents, as it would orient not only supportive therapies but also causal management. There are four types of shock: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive. Several hemodynamic tools can be used to determine the type of shock. However, echocardiography is the most convenient tool as it can rapidly lead to the diagnosis of the type of shock. In a study including 108 patients in shock, echocardiography diagnosed the type of shock within 4.9 ± 1.3 min. There was also an excellent agreement between the various observers. Accordingly, echocardiography is now recognized as the preferred initial modality to evaluate the type of shock. Accordingly, many patients can be monitored just with an arterial line and a central line, in addition to initial echocardiography (Fig. 1). When the patient does not respond to initial therapy, or in complex cases, additional hemodynamic monitoring is recommended. In these cases, the pulmonary artery catheter or transpulmonary thermodilution are the preferred methods.

Fig. 1
Suggested evaluation and monitoring strategy for hemodynamic assessment of a patient with circulatory failure. PAC pulmonary artery catheter, TPTD transpulmonary thermodilution, PAP pulmonary artery pressure, PAOP pulmonary artery occluded pressure, EVLW extravascular lung water index, GEDV global end diastolic volume, CVP central venous pressure, ScvO₂ central venous oxygen saturation, PvaCO₂ venoarterial difference in PCO₂, AP arterial pressure, PPV pulse pressure variations

The advantage of the pulmonary artery catheter and transpulmonary thermodilution over other less invasive techniques is that these provide not only reliable cardiac output measurements even in extreme conditions, but also additional variables that help to understand the cardiovascular profile. The pulmonary artery catheter allows the measurement of intravascular pressures while transpulmonary thermodilution estimates intravascular volumes. With the measurements of intravascular pressures and volumes it is feasible to identify the type of shock (Fig. 2).

### Hemorrhagic shock | NEJM resident 360… [^115uTsqH]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published January 24, 2018 Signs and symptoms of hemorrhagic shock, especially from occult sources of bleeding, are often subtle. In most patients, robust compensatory mechanisms render hypotension an insensitive indicator of shock until more than 30% of the patient's blood volume has been lost. More subtle clinical cues indicative of shock include anxiety, tachypnea, a weak peripheral pulse, and cool extremities with pale or mottled skin. Read the latest NEJM Review Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: Is there evidence to support the training of bystanders in tourniquet application. A: Hemorrhage induces profound changes in the vascular endothelium throughout the body. At the site of hemorrhage, the endothelium and blood act synergistically to promote thrombus formation.

However, the mounting oxygen debt and the catecholamine surge eventually induce a so-called endotheliopathy through systemic shedding of the protective glycocalyx barrier. With hemorrhage and shock, both adaptive and maladaptive changes occur in the blood. At the site of hemorrhage, the clotting cascade and platelets are activated, forming a hemostatic plug. Remote from the site of hemorrhage, fibrinolytic activity increases, presumably to prevent microvascular thrombosis. However, excess plasmin activity and autoheparinization from glycocalyx shedding can result in pathologic hyperfibrinolysis and diffuse coagulopathy. Conversely, nearly half of patients with trauma have a hypercoagulable phenotype of fibrinolysis shutdown. Depleted platelet numbers, decreased platelet margination due to anemia, and reduced platelet activity also contribute to coagulopathy and increased mortality. Iatrogenic factors can further exacerbate coagulopathy in patients with active bleeding.

A: Patients with purely abdominal or pelvic bleeding from any source may benefit from endovascular occlusion of the aorta as a temporizing measure to slow hemorrhage. This approach, termed resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta, lowers the perfusion pressure to distal sites of severe hemorrhage, increases afterload, and redistributes the remaining blood volume preferentially to the heart and brain. REBOA reduces intraoperative mortality among patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and is being evaluated in two prospective studies for patients with trauma. REBOA has also been used for severe gastrointestinal bleeding and peripartum hemorrhage.

### Critical heart failure and shock [^111Q6ZHt]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this review are to discuss the clinical assessment, pathophysiology, and management of shock, with an emphasis on circulatory physiology, cardiopulmonary interactions, and pharmacologic strategies to optimize systemic oxygen delivery. These principles will then be applied to the clinical syndromes of heart failure and cardiogenic shock that are seen in children.

Data Source

MEDLINE, PubMed.

Conclusion

An understanding of essential circulatory physiology and the pathophysiology of shock are necessary for managing patients at risk for or in a state of shock. A timely and accurate assessment of cardiac function, cardiac output, and tissue oxygenation and the means by which to enhance the relationship between oxygen delivery and consumption are essential in order to optimize outcomes.

### A standardized and comprehensive approach to the management of cardiogenic shock [^114ucGQb]. JACC: Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock is a hemodynamically complex syndrome characterized by a low cardiac output that often culminates in multiorgan system failure and death. Despite recent advances, clinical outcomes remain poor, with mortality rates exceeding 40%. In the absence of adequately powered randomized controlled trials to guide therapy, best practices for shock management remain nonuniform. Emerging data from North American registries, however, support the use of standardized protocols focused on rapid diagnosis, early intervention, ongoing hemodynamic assessment, and multidisciplinary longitudinal care. In this review, the authors examine the pathophysiology and phenotypes of cardiogenic shock, benefits and limitations of current therapies, and they propose a standardized and team-based treatment algorithm. Lastly, they discuss future research opportunities to address current gaps in clinical knowledge.

### Advances in the staging and phenotyping of cardiogenic shock: part 1 of 2 [^111EhXRw]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a heterogeneous syndrome reflecting a broad spectrum of shock severity, diverse etiologies, variable cardiac function, different hemodynamic trajectories, and concomitant organ dysfunction. These factors influence the clinical presentation, management, response to therapy, and outcomes of CS patients, necessitating a tailored approach to care. To better understand the variability inherent to CS populations, recent algorithms for staging the severity of CS have been described and validated. This paper is part 1 of a 2-part state-of-the-art review. In this first article, we consider the context for clinical staging and stratification in CS with a focus on established severity staging systems for CS and their use for risk stratification and clinical care. We describe the use of staging for predicting outcomes in populations with or at risk for CS, including risk modifiers that provide more nuanced risk stratification, and highlight how these approaches may allow individualized care.

### Cardiogenic shock syndrome unraveled: understanding the different layers of heterogeneity [^114qXLvi]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneity related to shock severity

The updated Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) shock classification is the most widely used classification, categorizing shock by its severity using clinical, biochemical and hemodynamic variables. It also incorporates risk modifiers to refine the classification which correlates well with mortality risk. It may also inform CS management, for example, in determining the optimal timing for initiating temporary mechanical circulatory support. Nonetheless, the dynamic nature of CS raises challenges in determining the timing of severity assessment.

### Fever and signs of shock: the essential dangerous fever [^112oPCQC]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

A common cause of fever with signs of shock is sepsis. Sepsis describes the spectrum of illness caused by severe infection. The incidence of sepsis is increasing and mortality can be high. Diagnosing the disease and implementing treatment early can decrease mortality. Early treatment includes empirical antibiotics and resuscitation. The diverse physiology present in sepsis can make the resuscitation complex; many different types of hemodynamic monitoring may be necessary. Even with this complexity, an organized approach can improve patient outcomes.

### The management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^117V5QDr]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of severe sepsis and septic shock is a complex and dynamic process. Newer evidence-based interventions are constantly being developed and implemented with the purpose of improving morbidity and mortality. Current investigations are being performed in hospital environments to determine the change in behaviors and clinical impact with the most recent recommendations. The use of standardized treatment protocols in addition to newer diagnostic and treatment modalities in patients who have severe sepsis and septic shock can continue to improve patient-related outcomes and the damaging effect of these diseases on society.

### Mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock: current insights and future directions [^112GEA2j]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

This state-of-the-art review describes the potential etiologies, pathophysiology, and management of mixed shock in the context of a proposed novel classification system. Cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock occurs when cardiogenic shock is complicated by inappropriate vasodilation, impairing compensatory mechanisms, and contributing to worsening shock. Vasodilatory-cardiogenic shock occurs when vasodilatory shock is complicated by myocardial dysfunction, resulting in low cardiac output. Primary mixed shock occurs when a systemic insult triggers both myocardial dysfunction and vasoplegia. Regardless of the etiology of mixed shock, the hemodynamic profile can be similar, and outcomes tend to be poor. Identification and treatment of both the initial and complicating disease processes is essential along with invasive hemodynamic monitoring given the evolving nature of mixed shock states. Hemodynamic support typically involves a combination of inotropes and vasopressors, with few data available to guide the use of mechanical circulatory support. Consensus definitions and novel treatment strategies are needed for this dangerous condition.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign research priorities 2023 [^111j6k7T]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome, and pathophysiology of sepsis and septic shock.

Design

Shortly after publication of the most recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, the Surviving Sepsis Research Committee, a multiprofessional group of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, convened virtually and iteratively developed the article and recommendations, which represents an update from the 2018 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Research Priorities.

Methods

Each task force member submitted five research questions on any sepsis-related subject. Committee members then independently ranked their top three priorities from the list generated. The highest rated clinical and basic science questions were developed into the current article.

Results

A total of 81 questions were submitted. After merging similar questions, there were 34 clinical and ten basic science research questions submitted for voting. The five top clinical priorities were as follows: 1) what is the best strategy for screening and identification of patients with sepsis, and can predictive modeling assist in real-time recognition of sepsis? 2) what causes organ injury and dysfunction in sepsis, how should it be defined, and how can it be detected? 3) how should fluid resuscitation be individualized initially and beyond? 4) what is the best vasopressor approach for treating the different phases of septic shock? and 5) can a personalized/precision medicine approach identify optimal therapies to improve patient outcomes? The five top basic science priorities were as follows: 1) How can we improve animal models so that they more closely resemble sepsis in humans? 2) What outcome variables maximize correlations between human sepsis and animal models and are therefore most appropriate to use in both? 3) How does sepsis affect the brain, and how do sepsis-induced brain alterations contribute to organ dysfunction? How does sepsis affect interactions between neural, endocrine, and immune systems? 4) How does the microbiome affect sepsis pathobiology? 5) How do genetics and epigenetics influence the development of sepsis, the course of sepsis and the response to treatments for sepsis?

Conclusions

Knowledge advances in multiple clinical domains have been incorporated in progressive iterations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, allowing for evidence-based recommendations for short- and long-term management of sepsis. However, the strength of existing evidence is modest with significant knowledge gaps and mortality from sepsis remains high. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

### 2025 concise clinical guidance: an ACC expert consensus statement on the evaluation and management of cardiogenic shock: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^1153pTxc]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

American College of Cardiology cardiogenic shock concise clinical guidance — general clinical assumptions state that the guidance is intended for adult patients and that pediatric presentations of cardiogenic shock (CS) differ and may require a modified Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention (SCAI) system. The principal focus applies to patients hospitalized due to CS secondary to acute myocardial infarction (AMI-CS) or heart failure (HF-CS), and the guidance is intended for clinicians across a broad array of disciplines in diverse clinical settings. The writing committee endorses the evidence-based approach recommended in the 2021 ACC/American Heart Association/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization and in the 2022 American Heart Association/ACC/Heart Failure Society of America Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure. Optimal care decisions should reflect evidence-based guidelines and the committee endorses a shared decision-making model, especially where clinical equipoise exists due to treatment uncertainty. This Concise Clinical Guidance is based predominantly on expert consensus, is not intended to supersede good clinical judgment, and interdisciplinary consultation, communication, and collaboration is strongly encouraged. As new data emerge, clinicians should thoughtfully incorporate novel discoveries and scientific evidence into their clinical practice.

### Advances in the management of cardiogenic shock [^1178iWNH]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To review a contemporary approach to the management of patients with cardiogenic shock (CS).

Data Sources

We reviewed salient medical literature regarding CS.

Study Selection

We included professional society scientific statements and clinical studies examining outcomes in patients with CS, with a focus on randomized clinical trials.

Data Extraction

We extracted salient study results and scientific statement recommendations regarding the management of CS.

Data Synthesis

Professional society recommendations were integrated with evaluated studies.

Conclusions

CS results in short-term mortality exceeding 30% despite standard therapy. While acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been the focus of most CS research, heart failure-related CS now predominates at many centers. CS can present with a wide spectrum of shock severity, including patients who are normotensive despite ongoing hypoperfusion. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention Shock Classification categorizes patients with or at risk of CS according to shock severity, which predicts mortality. The CS population includes a heterogeneous mix of phenotypes defined by ventricular function, hemodynamic profile, biomarkers, and other clinical variables. Integrating the shock severity and CS phenotype with nonmodifiable risk factors for mortality can guide clinical decision-making and prognostication. Identifying and treating the cause of CS is crucial for success, including early culprit vessel revascularization for AMI. Vasopressors and inotropes titrated to restore arterial pressure and perfusion are the cornerstone of initial medical therapy for CS. Temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is indicated for appropriately selected patients as a bridge to recovery, decision, durable MCS, or heart transplant. Randomized controlled trials have not demonstrated better survival with the routine use of temporary MCS in patients with CS. Accordingly, a multidisciplinary team-based approach should be used to tailor the type of hemodynamic support to each individual CS patient's needs based on shock severity, phenotype, and exit strategy.

### The management of cardiogenic shock from diagnosis to devices: a narrative review [^114fBmX4]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a state of inadequate cardiac output (CO) that results in tissue hypoperfusion, pulmonary and venous congestion, and often multisystem organ dysfunction.CS is a heterogenous syndrome, with variable causes, hemodynamic profiles, and clinical presentations. Despite notable advances in treatment, mortality remains unacceptably high, with figures ranging from 30% to 60%. – It is increasingly important for all critical care providers to be familiar with the management of CS and options for mechanical circulatory support. In this review, we summarize the basic pathophysiologic principles of CS and its diagnosis, as well as provide a more extensive discussion of contemporary CS management, with a particular emphasis on reviewing options for temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS).

### Cardiogenic shock [^1156XxAz]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Cardiogenic shock is a complex syndrome defined by systemic hypoperfusion and inadequate cardiac output arising from a wide array of underlying causes. Although the understanding of cardiogenic shock epidemiology, specific subphenotypes, haemodynamics, and cardiogenic shock severity staging has evolved, few therapeutic interventions have shown survival benefit. Results from seminal randomised controlled trials support early revascularisation of the culprit vessel in infarct-related cardiogenic shock and provide evidence of improved survival with the use of temporary circulatory support in selected patients. However, numerous questions remain unanswered, including optimal pharmacotherapy regimens, the role of mechanical circulatory support devices, management of secondary organ dysfunction, and best supportive care. This Review summarises current definitions, pathophysiological principles, and management approaches in cardiogenic shock, and highlights key knowledge gaps to advance individualised shock therapy and the evidence-based ethical use of modern technology and resources in cardiogenic shock.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology and contemporary management of cardiogenic shock-a position statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^115GPYNp]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a complex multifactorial clinical syndrome with extremely high mortality, developing as a continuum, and progressing from the initial insult (underlying cause) to the subsequent occurrence of organ failure and death. There is a large spectrum of CS presentations resulting from the interaction between an acute cardiac insult and a patient's underlying cardiac and overall medical condition. Phenotyping patients with CS may have clinical impact on management because classification would support initiation of appropriate therapies. CS management should consider appropriate organization of the health care services, and therapies must be given to the appropriately selected patients, in a timely manner, whilst avoiding iatrogenic harm. Although several consensus-driven algorithms have been proposed, CS management remains challenging and substantial investments in research and development have not yielded proof of efficacy and safety for most of the therapies tested, and outcome in this condition remains poor. Future studies should consider the identification of the new pathophysiological targets, and high-quality translational research should facilitate incorporation of more targeted interventions in clinical research protocols, aimed to improve individual patient outcomes. Designing outcome clinical trials in CS remains particularly challenging in this critical and very costly scenario in cardiology, but information from these trials is imperiously needed to better inform the guidelines and clinical practice. The goal of this review is to summarize the current knowledge concerning the definition, epidemiology, underlying causes, pathophysiology and management of CS based on important lessons from clinical trials and registries, with a focus on improving in-hospital management.

### The intensivist's perspective of shock, volume management, and hemodynamic monitoring [^1158HAXA]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

One of the primary reasons for intensive care admission is shock. Identifying the underlying cause of shock (hypovolemic, distributive, cardiogenic, and obstructive) may lead to entirely different clinical pathways for management. Among patients with hypovolemic and distributive shock, fluid therapy is one of the leading management strategies. Although an appropriate amount of fluid administration might save a patient's life, inadequate (or excessive) fluid use could lead to more complications, including organ failure and mortality due to either hypovolemia or volume overload. Currently, intensivists have access to a wide variety of information sources and tools to monitor the underlying hemodynamic status, including medical history, physical examination, and specific hemodynamic monitoring devices. Although appropriate and timely assessment and interpretation of this information can promote adequate fluid resuscitation, misinterpretation of these data can also lead to additional mortality and morbidity. This article provides a narrative review of the most commonly used hemodynamic monitoring approaches to assessing fluid responsiveness and fluid tolerance. In addition, we describe the benefits and disadvantages of these tools.

### Health systems governance, shocks and resilience: a scoping review of key concepts and theories [^113axuvo]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

In the literature, building HSR requires several core capacities. In addition to reactive capacity, a key resilience-building strategy is a proactive vision, focused on anticipating and preparing for potential shocks. The occurrence of a shock is not necessary for a health system to be considered resilient: a resilient health system is governed to understand the range of potential shocks and seeks to reduce the risks if they happen. Resilience approaches based on 'what if' adverse scenarios were examples of the operationalisation of this forward-looking approach. This highlights the essential characteristics of foresight and anticipation in the conceptualisation of governance of health systems.

It is argued that features of the shock, such as its nature, stage, scale and impact, influence the type of resilience strategy to be employed. These theories hypothesise that the severity of the shock influences how much resilience is required to effectively respond, while the scale and duration of the shock mostly impact health system performance. The intensity of the shock is believed to affect the amount of change that the health system needs to introduce. While absorptive strategies are often implemented to face small shocks like the recurrence of influenza each year, adaptive strategies are used in response to more intensive shocks not manageable with absorptive strategies. Finally, transformative capacities are for major shocks where the system would not survive without a change of the core functions and goals. The type of adaptation is influenced by the different causal factors or drivers of the shock.

Although HSR is a key element to reduce system vulnerability to shocks, maintaining health system performance may not always be possible in case of severe shocks. Understanding the type of shock which affects the health system is important to evaluate the scope of potential shock effects: the recovery trajectory of health system performance is influenced by the nature, severity and duration of a shock, the prior resilience status of the system and its underlying structures and processes including elements amplifying or dampening shock effects. From a complex systems perspective, the effects of a shock depend also on the phase of the adapting cycle theory (ie, growth conservation, collapse, renewal or reorganisation) in the system, and it is greater if the system is unstable. Resilience is not only shaped by the nature of the shock but also by the state of the system. Some routinely collected measures can help evaluate the trajectory of resilience after a shock, in terms of the extent and speed to return or exceed the baseline.

### What is the preferred resuscitation fluid for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock? [^1142X2co]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock recommend crystalloids as the initial fluid solution of choice in the resuscitation of these patients. In recent years, there have been numerous studies published on the type of fluid used in the resuscitation of patients with sepsis. The primary goal of this article is to determine the preferred intravenous fluid for the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature review was completed to identify studies that investigated the type of resuscitation fluid in the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Articles included were those published in English between 2011 and 2016, enrolled human subjects, and limited to the following types: randomized controlled trial, prospective observational trial, retrospective cohort trial, and meta-analyses. All selected articles then underwent a structured review by the authors.

Results

Nine thousand sixty-two articles were identified in the search. After use of predetermined criteria, 17 articles were selected for review. Eleven of these were original investigations and six were meta-analyses and systemic reviews.

Conclusion

Crystalloids are the preferred solution for the resuscitation of emergency department patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Balanced crystalloids may improve patient-centered outcomes and should be considered as an alternative to normal saline, if available. There is strong evidence that suggests semi-synthetic colloids decrease survival and should be avoided. The role of albumin in the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and sepsis is uncertain.

### Cardiogenic shock: evolving definitions and future directions in management [^113vKmv8]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a complex and highly morbid entity conceptualised as a vicious cycle of injury, cardiac and systemic decompensation, and further injury and decompensation. The pathophysiology of CS is incompletely understood but limited clinical trial experience suggests that early and robust support of the failing heart to allow for restoration of systemic homoeostasis appears critical for survival. We review the pathophysiology, clinical features and trial data to construct a contemporary model of CS as a systemic process characterised with maladaptive compensatory mechanisms requiring prompt and appropriately tailored medical and mechanical support for optimal outcomes. We conclude with an algorithmic approach to acute CS incorporating clinical and haemodynamic data to match the patient's cardiac and systemic needs as a template for contemporary management.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^114sswqQ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical recommendations for managing sepsis have also recently been updated. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) published their initial clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008,2012and most recently in 2016. The 2016 CPG is largely similar to the 2012 version, but there are differences in recommendations in a number of categories, including initial resuscitation parameters, vasopressor selection, antibiotic selection and ventilation. After the release of the Sepsis-3 definition revisions, the SCCM SSC released a practice guideline update to provide clinical context to the guidelines and help providers expeditiously screen, identify and treat patients with sepsis. In this update, they reiterate adherence to the campaign recommendations from 2012. Providers should 'continue to use signs and symptoms of infection to promote early identification' and those with suspected infection should begin immediate management to include 'obtaining blood and other cultures… administering tailored antibiotics as appropriate, and simultaneously obtain laboratory results'.

### Tailored therapy in cardiogenic shock: case-based management choices [^117A2r1s]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a complex, multisystem disorder precipitated by hypoperfusion from cardiac dysfunction. Our current approach to defining and treating CS encompasses all patients under 1 umbrella regardless of phenotype. This has created challenges for clinical trials and patient care owing to the heterogeneity of the patient population with CS. The Society of Coronary Angiography and Interventions shock classification has created a universal language for CS that has been rapidly adopted by researchers and clinicians. Its latest iteration established the 3-axis model incorporating shock severity, risk modifiers, and phenotypes. Phenotypes of CS have unique hemodynamic profiles that require nuanced adjustment approaches. In this study, we discuss representative cases including acute myocardial infarction, acute-on-chronic heart failure, fulminant myocarditis, and right ventricular failure. For each phenotype, specific hemodynamic parameters may help confirm appropriate diagnosis and direct to therapeutic targets signaling stability and recovery. The underlying pathophysiology of each phenotype can also help predict the extent of stabilization with pharmacologic interventions or the need to escalate to mechanical circulatory support. In conclusion, this tailored approach to CS, rather than a 1-size-fits-all approach, could help improve outcomes.

Introduction — cardiogenic shock (CS) is described as a complex, heterogenous, multifactorial syndrome in which a cardiac disorder results in insufficient cardiac output culminating in end-organ hypoperfusion. CS is one of the most common causes of admission to contemporary cardiac intensive care units and remains a highly morbid and lethal complication, with short-term mortality ranging from 30% to 40% and 1-year mortality approaching or exceeding 50%. CS due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI-CS) has been the most extensively studied form of CS in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Many controversies and uncertainties surround resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock caused by vascular trauma. Whereas the basic pathophysiology is better understood, much remains to be learned about the many immunologic cascades that lead to problems beyond those of initial fluid resuscitation or operative hemostasis. Fluid therapy is on the verge of significant advances with substitute oxygen carriers, yet surgeons are still beset with questions of how much and what type of initial fluid to provide. Finally, the parameters chosen to guide therapy and the methods used to monitor patients present other interesting issues.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: research priorities for sepsis and septic shock [^117MBfak]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome and underlying causes of sepsis and septic shock.

Design

A consensus committee of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine was convened at the annual meetings of both societies. Subgroups had teleconference and electronic-based discussion. The entire committee iteratively developed the entire document and recommendations.

Methods

Each committee member independently gave their top five priorities for sepsis research. A total of 88 suggestions (ESM 1 - supplemental table 1) were grouped into categories by the committee co-chairs, leading to the formation of seven subgroups: infection, fluids and vasoactive agents, adjunctive therapy, administration/epidemiology, scoring/identification, post-intensive care unit, and basic/translational science. Each subgroup had teleconferences to go over each priority followed by formal voting within each subgroup. The entire committee also voted on top priorities across all subgroups except for basic/translational science.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Research Committee provides 26 priorities for sepsis and septic shock. Of these, the top six clinical priorities were identified and include the following questions: (1) can targeted/personalized/precision medicine approaches determine which therapies will work for which patients at which times? (2) what are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated? (3) should rapid diagnostic tests be implemented in clinical practice? (4) should empiric antibiotic combination therapy be used in sepsis or septic shock? (5) what are the predictors of sepsis long-term morbidity and mortality? and (6) what information identifies organ dysfunction?

Conclusions

While the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines give multiple recommendations on the treatment of sepsis, significant knowledge gaps remain, both in bedside issues directly applicable to clinicians, as well as understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the development and progression of sepsis. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome characterized by low cardiac output leading to end-organ hypoperfusion. Organ dysoxia ranging from transient organ injury to irreversible organ failure and death occurs across all CS etiologies but differing by incidence and type. Herein, we review the recognition and management of respiratory, renal and hepatic failure complicating CS. We also discuss unmet needs in the CS care pathway and future research priorities for generating evidence-based best practices for the management of extra-cardiac sequelae. The complexity of CS admitted to the contemporary cardiac intensive care unit demands a workforce skilled to care for these extra-cardiac critical illness complications with an appreciation for how cardio-systemic interactions influence critical illness outcomes in afflicted patients.

### Cardiogenic shock: evolving definitions and future directions in management [^1173HHuw]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Though there have been significant advances in reperfusion therapy and percutaneous mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, mortality among patients presenting with acute cardiogenic shock (CS) remain obstinately high, ranging from 25% to 50%. In a recent large cohort of 21 210 patients in London with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), CS was observed in 8.9% of patients with the incidence increasing over time and high mortality of 45%–70%. Significant effort has been dedicated to the development of management guidelines and treatment algorithms to improve survival from this highly lethal condition. Despite increasing awareness, a paucity of high-quality clinical trial data and wide practice variation exists. Though the exact pathophysiology of this multifactorial, haemodynamically diverse population remains poorly understood, early recognition and intervention to interrupt the devastating 'cardiogenic shock spiral' are critical to survival.

The generally accepted definition of CS is a state in which ineffective cardiac output (CO) due to a primary cardiac dysfunction results in inadequate end-organ perfusion. Current CS-defining criteria used in clinical trials and guidelines are varied, and recommendations are largely based on data from patients with CS due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Considerably less is understood regarding the identification and outcomes in the non-ACS population, particularly acute decompensation in patients with underlying congestive heart failure–the so-called, 'acute-on-chronic' CS. Improved understanding of the pathophysiological process and identification of specific criteria for classification in this widely heterogeneous population is critical for early identification and appropriate management of patients with CS.

Epidemiology of Cardiogenic Shock

Defining CS has traditionally been challenging, owing to the various clinical, biochemical, and hemodynamic definitions used in the seminal outcome trials and societal guidelines. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions has recently sought to harmonize these definitions through a pragmatic classification system that can be applied to a range of clinical setting and helps enable the diagnosis of CS across the full clinical spectrum of disease severity, ranging from "at risk" to fulminant circulatory collapse. Importantly, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions diagnostic and staging system of CS has been validated across multiple clinical subgroups, including CS with and without AMI, patients admitted to intensive care, and those with CS complicating out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest. The use of a uniform definition for CS and its severity will play a crucial role for future epidemiologic and clinical trials, allowing direct comparison between outcomes associated with specific therapies, systems of care, and treatment protocols.

Despite the challenges with defining and diagnosing CS, it is a common problem in clinical practice with an estimated incidence of 408 per 100 000 hospitalizations based on the United States National Inpatient Sample. Acute coronary syndromes are the most common cause of CS, accounting for 70% of cases. The management of this cohort of patients is both costly and requires significant health care resource use. The average length of hospital stay ranges between 8.9 and 18.6 days with an associated cost of treating a patient with AMI‐CS in the United States of $41 774 ± $45252. Despite significant improvements over the past 2 decades in contemporary revascularization techniques and supportive care, 1‐year mortality rates continue to range between 50% and 60%.

Although the epidemiology and outcomes of in‐hospital CS have been well described, there remains a paucity of data in relation to the incidence, treatment provision, and outcomes of CS in the prehospital environment. A recent population‐based cohort study of a large provincial emergency medical services registry demonstrated that the overall incidence of emergency medical services treated CS was 14.5 per 100 000 person‐years, with an overall 30‐day all‐cause mortality of 43.9%. Despite large numbers of patients with CS receiving the initial phase of their treatment by emergency medical services, prehospital therapeutic interventions (eg, mechanical ventilation, and vasoactive medications), in addition to many in‐hospital interventions, are yet to be proven effective through high‐quality observational or randomized data.

### Management of cardiogenic shock: state-of-the-art [^115gsdQD]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Current/emerging approach: SCAI shock severity staging

The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) cardiogenic shock (SCAI-CS) staging system was designed to provide a simple and standardized approach to classifying CS according to its severity, ranging from A-E. Briefly, SCAI-CS stages are A (stable patients with acute cardiac conditions putting them at risk of CS), B (pre-shock with hypotension), C (classical shock with signs of hypoperfusion), D [deteriorating despite adequate initial supportive intervention(s)], and E (extreme shock). Numerous observational studies have confirmed the association between SCAI stage and mortality. Cardiac arrest constitutes a specific feature variable. An updated SCAI-CS staging system was subsequently published, recommending more in-depth phenotyping, including risk factors (largely unmodifiable), vasopressor/inotrope score, degree of metabolic derangement, acuity of onset, and uni-/biventricular pathology with/without pulmonary involvement. Although a significant advance in stratification, several limitations to the SCAI staging exist, including that the classified severity can by highly dynamic, the response to interventions can be variable (beneficial/neutral/detrimental), and the timing of assessed/re-assessment lacks consensus, especially when considering its use for clinical trial inclusion criteria. The SCAI classification does not encounter shock etiology nor age. It is also important to note that the conditions of CS change rapidly and that these temporal changes can hardly be reflected in a rigid classification. Another limitation of the SCAI classification is that multiple elements within the staging remain subject to variable interpretation.

### Detailing the cardiovascular profile in shock patients [^112imupZ]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the cardiovascular profile of critically ill patients is one of the most important actions performed in critically ill patients. It allows recognition that the patient is in shock and characterization of the type of circulatory failure. This step is crucial to initiate supportive interventions and to cure the cause responsible for the development of shock. Evaluation of tissue perfusion allows identification of the patient insufficiently resuscitated and also to trigger therapeutic interventions. Monitoring tissue perfusion can be achieved by lactate, venoarterial gradients in PCO₂, and central venous or mixed venous oxygen saturation. Ultimately, monitoring the microcirculation may help not only to identify alterations in tissue perfusion but also to identify the type of alterations: diffuse decrease in microvascular perfusion versus heterogeneity in the alterations, as in sepsis, with well perfused areas in close vicinity to poorly perfused areas. Regarding supportive therapy, a step-by-step approach is suggested, with fluid optimization followed by vasoactive support to preserve perfusion pressure and global and regional blood flows. The different variables should be integrated into decision and management pathways, and therapies adapted accordingly.

Definition, pathophysiology, features and epidemiology of shock

Definition

Shock is best defined as a life-threatening, generalized form of acute circulatory failure associated with inadequate oxygen utilization by the cells. It is a state in which the circulation is unable to deliver sufficient oxygen to meet the demands of the tissues, resulting in cellular dysfunction. The result is cellular dysoxia, i.e. the loss of the physiological independence between oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption, associated with increased lactate levels. Some clinical symptoms suggest an impaired microcirculation, including mottled skin, acrocyanosis, slow capillary refill time and an increased central-to-toe temperature gradient.

Pathophysiology and features of shock

Shock is a clinical state of acute circulatory failure that can result from one, or a combination, of four mechanisms. The first of these is a decrease in venous return due to a loss of circulating volume (i.e. due to internal or external loss of fluids). The second is a failure of the pump function of the heart that results from a loss of contractility (resulting from ischemia, infarction, myopathy, myocarditis) or a major arrhythmia (such as ventricular tachycardia or a high degree A-V block). The third is an obstruction due to pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax or cardiac tamponade. The fourth is loss of vascular tone that results in maldistribution of blood flow (due to sepsis, anaphylaxis or spinal injury). The features of each of these four types of shock often overlap, and patients admitted with one type of shock can develop other types of shock. For example, patients hospitalized with hemorrhagic shock due to trauma or with cardiogenic shock occasionally develop septic shock.

Search strategy and MeSH terms.

Searches were performed in PubMed using the following MeSH and free-text terms through August 15, 2020: "Shock AND definition", "Septic shock AND definition AND low resource country COVID-19 AND shock", "COVID-19 AND clinical outcomes", "COVID-19 AND bacterial infection, fungal infection, parasitic infection", and "Shock/septic AND coinfection". Last, references of selected articles were reviewed for relevant publications.

This search yielded 5,480 studies; 135 were clinical trials and/or randomized clinical trials; 1,328 were meta-analyses, reviews, and/or systematic reviews; and 154 were from LMICs.

Evidence.

In review of the literature evaluating the clinical outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection, no study offers a distinct definition of shock specifically for COVID-19 patients that differs from other patients. In the general context, shock is defined as a life-threatening circulatory failure that results in inadequate tissue perfusion and cellular dysoxia/hypoxia. This is often operationalized as MAP or systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 65 mmHg or < 90 mmHg, respectively, when associated with signs of systemic hypoperfusion, or clinically by recognition of impaired peripheral perfusion (via assessment of prolonged capillary refill, skin mottling, and skin temperature gradient), diaphoresis, oliguria, and impaired mental status. Shock can further be categorized according to the underlying mechanism, such as distributive (e.g. sepsis, anaphylaxis, and burn), cardiogenic (e.g. myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy), hypovolemic (e.g. hemorrhage), and obstructive (e.g. pulmonary embolism and pneumothorax). Although features often overlap, it is important to identify the type of shock to the extent possible as proper categorization would guide management.

### Incidence and outcomes of nontraumatic shock in adults using emergency medical services… [^113HMw9q]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Patients with hospital outcome data were stratified into shock etiologies; 3615 had cardiogenic shock: 3998, septic shock; 1457, hypovolemic shock; and 3625, other causes of shock. Shock is a clinical syndrome that is characterized by cellular and tissue hypoxia due to either inadequate oxygen delivery, increased oxygen demand, or a combination of these processes. 1–3 Patients present on a spectrum of illness severity, ranging from occult hypoperfusion to fulminant circulatory collapse. 1, 2 The altered physiology observed in shock can be broadly attributed to 4 mechanisms: hypovolemia, cardiogenic, obstructive, or distributive causes. Using the primary ICD-10 diagnosis, linked patients were stratified into 4 shock etiology groups: cardiogenic shock; septic shock; hypovolemic shock; and other cause of shock.

Further details relating to the ICD-10 diagnostic codes used to classify shock etiology are described in the eMethods in the Supplement. The overall linked cohort was hypotensive, with a median initial systolic blood pressure of 70 mm Hg. Those with cardiogenic shock were significantly more hypotensive compared with the other shock etiologies systolic blood pressure: cardiogenic: 58 mm Hg; septic, 75 mm Hg; hypovolemic, 70 mm Hg; other, 70 mm Hg; P <. 001). Furthermore, the maximum infusion rate and average infusion dose of epinephrine was significantly higher in those with cardiogenic shock. Data relating to obstructive shock, a subgroup of other shock, are included in eTable 5 and eTable 6 in the Supplement. In those with cardiogenic shock, prehospital cardiac arrest significantly increased rates of 30-day mortality compared with those that did not have a prehospital cardiac arrest. Multivariable regression models for the primary outcome of 30-day mortality are presented in Table 4.

### Emergency department management of pediatric shock [^1141hb78]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Shock, a state of inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues resulting in anaerobic metabolism, lactate accumulation, and end-organ dysfunction, is common in children in emergency department. Shock can be divided into 4 categories: hypovolemic, distributive, cardiogenic, and obstructive. Early recognition of shock can be made with close attention to historical clues, physical examination and vital sign abnormalities. Early and aggressive treatment can prevent or reverse organ dysfunction and improve morbidity and mortality.

### Hemodynamic management of cardiogenic shock in the intensive care unit [^113WHxCJ]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hemodynamic derangements are defining features of cardiogenic shock. Randomized clinical trials have examined the efficacy of various therapeutic interventions, from percutaneous coronary intervention to inotropes and mechanical circulatory support (MCS). However, hemodynamic management in cardiogenic shock has not been well-studied. This State-of-the-Art review will provide a framework for hemodynamic management in cardiogenic shock, including a description of the 4 therapeutic phases from initial 'Rescue' to 'Optimization', 'Stabilization' and 'de-Escalation or Exit therapy' (R-O-S-E), phenotyping and phenotype-guided tailoring of pharmacological and MCS support, to achieve hemodynamic and therapeutic goals. Finally, the premises that form the basis for clinical management and the hypotheses for randomized controlled trials will be discussed, with a view to the future direction of cardiogenic shock.

Part I: Principles of Cardiogenic Shock

Definition, Classification of Severity, and Clinical Phenotyping

Clinical trials and society guidelines use varying definitions of CS, but most rely on clinical criteria, namely impaired CO resulting in hypotension (systolic BP of < 90 mm Hg or need for vasopressors or mechanical support) as well as clinical or laboratory evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion. – Commonly referenced hemodynamic criteria include cardiac index of ≤ 2.2 L/min/m² and elevated intracardiac filling pressures with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of > 15 mm Hg. Nonclassical presentations increasingly have been recognized, including normotensive CS, which is associated with similarly high mortality, and right ventricular-predominant CS.

To standardize the language surrounding CS, and for prognostication, the Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) proposed a CS classification scheme in 2019. The SCAI classification uses physical examination findings, hemodynamic parameters, and biochemical markers to categorize patients into five stages of shock severity (SCAI stages A through E). SCAI stage A refers to patients with no signs or symptoms of CS but who are at risk of CS developing because of underlying cardiac pathologic features. SCAI stage B refers to patients who are beginning to show signs of CS, such as tachycardia or relative hypotension, but without end-organ hypoperfusion. SCAI stage C defines patients with classic CS who show clinical evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion requiring pharmacologic or mechanical support, or both. SCAI stage D refers to patients with CS whose condition is deteriorating despite initiation of therapy. Finally, SCAI stage E refers to patients with CS in extremis with refractory shock who are at impending risk of death (Fig 1). Importantly, the SCAI stages are dynamic and were designed purposefully to allow patient movement between classes as interventions are applied. The SCAI stages are associated with mortality across various cohorts with CS, including those with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and without AMI. Biochemical phenotypes of CS (eg, noncongested, cardiorenal, and cardiometabolic shock) also have been defined and validated to risk-stratify patients further within the SCAI staging system.

### Timing and spectrum of antibiotic treatment for suspected sepsis and septic shock: why so controversial? [^116tRBaf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis guidelines and mandates encourage increasingly aggressive time-to-antibiotic targets for broad-spectrum antimicrobials for suspected sepsis and septic shock. This has caused considerable controversy due to weaknesses in the underlying evidence and fear that overly strict antibiotic deadlines may harm patients by perpetuating or escalating overtreatment. Indeed, a third or more of patients currently treated for sepsis and septic shock have noninfectious or nonbacterial conditions. These patients risk all the potential harms of antibiotics without their possible benefits. Updated Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines now emphasize the importance of tailoring antibiotics to each patient's likelihood of infection, risk for drug-resistant pathogens, and severity-of-illness.

### The management of cardiogenic shock from diagnosis to devices: a narrative review [^111rLsJC]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a heterogenous syndrome broadly characterized by inadequate cardiac output leading to tissue hypoperfusion and multisystem organ dysfunction that carries an ongoing high mortality burden. The management of CS has advanced rapidly, especially with the incorporation of temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) devices. A thorough understanding of how to approach a patient with CS and to select appropriate monitoring and treatment paradigms is essential in modern ICUs. Timely characterization of CS severity and hemodynamics is necessary to optimize outcomes, and this may be performed best by multidisciplinary shock-focused teams. In this article, we provide a review of CS aimed to inform both the cardiology-trained and non-cardiology-trained intensivist provider. We briefly describe the causes, pathophysiologic features, diagnosis, and severity staging of CS, focusing on gathering key information that is necessary for making management decisions. We go on to provide a more detailed review of CS management principles and practical applications, with a focus on tMCS. Medical management focuses on appropriate medication therapy to optimize perfusion-by enhancing contractility and minimizing afterload-and to facilitate decongestion. For more severe CS, or for patients with decompensating hemodynamic status despite medical therapy, initiation of the appropriate tMCS increasingly is common. We discuss the most common devices currently used for patients with CS-phenotyping patients as having left ventricular failure, right ventricular failure, or biventricular failure-and highlight key available data and particular points of consideration that inform tMCS device selection. Finally, we highlight core components of sedation and respiratory failure management for patients with CS.

### Clinical trials in cardiogenic shock: challenges and solutions for the future [^111BsHkr]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Availability bias and operator/institutional experience with temporary MCS devices

The risk/benefit of centralizing vs decentralizing shock management remains unknown. The cost and complexity of employing MCS may require specialized shock centers depending on the severity of clinical presentation. This may limit access to MCS at smaller hospitals. Few centers in United States have adequate resources, support personnel, and shock teams required to manage advanced MCS. This difference in timing and utilization of MCS in hub and spoke centers may lead to variable outcomes across centers. This is particularly important for the prevention of device-related complications such as bleeding, iatrogenic limb ischemia, and related infections, which may all negatively affect outcome.

AMI-CS vs HF-CS differences in outcomes

All shock is not equal

There has been a paradigm shift in the CS realm with incidence of AMI-CS decreasing over the last 2 decades. However, most of the CS research to date has been conducted on patients with AMI-CS. Heart failure-related cardiogenic shock (HF-CS) patients are more resource-intensive and may have a greater burden of disease. Although their in-hospital survival is significantly better than that of AMI-CS, HF-CS patients remain vulnerable after discharge, and single-center reports suggest significant morbidity and mortality in the first year after discharge. Substantial heterogeneity exists with use of MCS in HF-CS, and thus more research is needed.

Selection bias/equipoise

The different phenotypes of CS make rapid screening and randomization of patients for a clinical trial complicated. Most RCTs tend to exclude certain types of shock, and these result in extrapolation of their results to patients in the excluded population. Selection bias among the clinician investigators as they enroll patients may also impact trial recruitment. Most MCS trials have limited statistical power and tend to have lot of cross-over, which may affect the outcomes of these trials. Timing of the insertion of the device is left to the discretion of the treating physician, which is another major limitation in MCS trials that requires protocolization.

### The third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock (sepsis-3) [^115tUKZq]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Definitions of sepsis and septic shock were last revised in 2001. Considerable advances have since been made into the pathobiology (changes in organ function, morphology, cell biology, biochemistry, immunology, and circulation), management, and epidemiology of sepsis, suggesting the need for reexamination.

Objective

To evaluate and, as needed, update definitions for sepsis and septic shock.

Process

A task force (n = 19) with expertise in sepsis pathobiology, clinical trials, and epidemiology was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Definitions and clinical criteria were generated through meetings, Delphi processes, analysis of electronic health record databases, and voting, followed by circulation to international professional societies, requesting peer review and endorsement (by 31 societies listed in the Acknowledgment).

Key Findings From Evidence Synthesis

Limitations of previous definitions included an excessive focus on inflammation, the misleading model that sepsis follows a continuum through severe sepsis to shock, and inadequate specificity and sensitivity of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Multiple definitions and terminologies are currently in use for sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction, leading to discrepancies in reported incidence and observed mortality. The task force concluded the term severe sepsis was redundant.

Recommendations

Sepsis should be defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. For clinical operationalization, organ dysfunction can be represented by an increase in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more, which is associated with an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%. Septic shock should be defined as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (> 18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%. In out-of-hospital, emergency department, or general hospital ward settings, adult patients with suspected infection can be rapidly identified as being more likely to have poor outcomes typical of sepsis if they have at least 2 of the following clinical criteria that together constitute a new bedside clinical score termed quickSOFA (qSOFA): respiratory rate of 22/min or greater, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less.

Conclusions and Relevance

These updated definitions and clinical criteria should replace previous definitions, offer greater consistency for epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, and facilitate earlier recognition and more timely management of patients with sepsis or at risk of developing sepsis.

### Cardiogenic shock in older adults: a focus on age-associated risks and approach to management: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115QVWd3]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock continues to portend poor outcomes, conferring short-term mortality rates of 30% to 50% despite recent scientific advances. Age is a nonmodifiable risk factor for mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock and is often considered in the decision-making process for eligibility for various therapies. Older adults have been largely excluded from analyses of therapeutic options in patients with cardiogenic shock. As a result, despite the association of advanced age with worse outcomes, focused strategies in the assessment and management of cardiogenic shock in this high-risk and growing population are lacking. Individual programs oftentimes develop upper age limits for various interventional strategies for their patients, including heart transplantation and durable left ventricular assist devices. However, age as a lone parameter should not be used to guide individual patient management decisions in cardiogenic shock. In the assessment of risk in older adults with cardiogenic shock, a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach is central to developing best practices. In this American Heart Association scientific statement, we aim to summarize our contemporary understanding of the epidemiology, risk assessment, and in-hospital approach to management of cardiogenic shock, with a unique focus on older adults.

### Is restriction of intravenous fluid beneficial for septic shock in ICU patients? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114qKpRA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. This condition is characterized by an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. Septic shock is the most critical stage of sepsis progression. The latest guidelines define sepsis as the presence of hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation and the need to rely on vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure ≥ 60 mmHg. The mortality rate of sepsis can reach 50% or higher. Under the new classification of shock types, septic shock is categorized as distributional shock owing to its unique mechanism of occurrence. The pathophysiology of septic shock includes loss of vascular tone regulation and increased vascular permeability, which cause abnormal vascular volume distribution and fluid leakage into the interstitial tissue.

The cornerstone of septic shock treatment is fluid resuscitation and the use of positive inotropic agents as well as vasopressors to increase cardiac preload and organ perfusion. For patients with septic shock, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) expert consensus guidelines recommend rapid resuscitation with a minimum of 30 ml/kg isotonic crystalloid intravenously within the first 3 h. This recommendation is based on retrospective studies and randomized controlled trials on the hemodynamic management of sepsis. However, there is limited evidence to guide fluid management after initial fluid resuscitation in septic shock. Intravenous fluids can increase cardiac output and organ perfusion but may compromise vascular integrity leading to organ edema and dysfunction. Furthermore, fluid overload is associated with higher mortality and increased incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure abdominal hypertension, and abdominal compartment syndrome. It has even been found that during early and adequate fluid resuscitation of patients with septic shock, the incidences of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome can be as high as 82.7% and 40.3%, respectively. Therefore, there is growing concern that increasing the amount of intravenous fluid replacement may be harmful.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^1162kEfQ]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric guidelines — application by local resource availability states that the intended users are health professionals caring for children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in hospital, emergency, or other acute care settings. These guidelines were largely developed without consideration of healthcare resources, with some specific exceptions such as fluid resuscitation. The panel supports that these guidelines should constitute a general scheme of "best practice", but translation to treatment algorithms or bundles and standards of care will need to account for variation in the availability of local healthcare resources, and the panel acknowledges the need for future research to test adaptation to locally available resources.

### Mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock: current insights and future directions [^1148Thwn]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with circulatory shock are divided into three primary hemodynamic phenotypes, namely hypovolemic, vasodilatory/distributive, and cardiogenic (including obstructive). Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by end-organ hypoperfusion owing to a primary cardiac insult resulting in impaired cardiac output (CO). Traditional pathophysiologic models of CS predict that acute reductions in CO should lead to neurohormonal activation and compensatory systemic vasoconstriction to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP), resulting in the classic CS hemodynamic profile with elevated systemic vascular resistance (SVR). However, CS is a hemodynamically diverse syndrome and SVR can vary widely in patients with CS. Accordingly, it has long been recognized that a subgroup of patients with CS displays inappropriately low SVR. The hemodynamic profile of depressed CO and inappropriate systemic vasodilation has been termed mixed shock to indicate the combined features of both cardiogenic and vasodilatory shock. Mixed shock is a heterogeneous syndrome with numerous etiologic drivers and variable clinical trajectories unified by a common clinical and hemodynamic profile. The Shock Academic Research Consortium describes mixed shock as a "high-risk, understudied subpopulation of patients with CS", functioning as a modifier for the 4 primary categories of CS. In this review, we will discuss the current definitions, epidemiology, pathophysiology, classification, evaluation, and management of mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock in the context of a new proposed classification system.

### Echocardiography in shock management [^117MvkaZ]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Echocardiography is pivotal in the diagnosis and management of the shocked patient. Important characteristics in the setting of shock are that it is non-invasive and can be rapidly applied.

In the acute situation a basic study often yields immediate results allowing for the initiation of therapy, while a follow-up advanced study brings the advantage of further refining the diagnosis and providing an in-depth hemodynamic assessment. Competency in basic critical care echocardiography is now regarded as a mandatory part of critical care training with clear guidelines available. The majority of pathologies found in shocked patients are readily identified using basic level 2D and M-mode echocardiography. A more comprehensive diagnosis can be achieved with advanced levels of competency, for which practice guidelines are also now available. Hemodynamic evaluation and ongoing monitoring are possible with advanced levels of competency, which includes the use of colour Doppler, spectral Doppler, and tissue Doppler imaging and occasionally the use of more recent technological advances such as 3D or speckled tracking.

The four core types of shock — cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive, and vasoplegic — can readily be identified by echocardiography. Even within each of the main headings contained in the shock classification, a variety of pathologies may be the cause and echocardiography will differentiate which of these is responsible. Increasingly, as a result of more complex and elderly patients, the shock may be multifactorial, such as a combination of cardiogenic and septic shock or hypovolemia and ventricular outflow obstruction.

The diagnostic benefit of echocardiography in the shocked patient is obvious. The increasing prevalence of critical care physicians experienced in advanced techniques means echocardiography often supplants the need for more invasive hemodynamic assessment and monitoring in shock.

### The mixed hemodynamic profile in shock: a call for a monitoring-guided individualized management [^114TUj1G]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

I commend Jentzer et al for their comprehensive review addressing mixed shock, but a few points deserve clarification.

Managing shock is multidisciplinary. From critical care prospect, shock is categorized based on its main mechanism into 4 subtypes: hypovolemic, distributive, cardiogenic, and obstructive. Pathophysiology is not exclusive with frequent overlaps secondary to disease complexity, host factors, and hemodynamic interventions.

While treating the underlying cause remains a cornerstone, the hemodynamic management shifted over years to target 3 components: fluid status, vascular tone, and cardiac function. Their contribution varies but usually coexist and moreover interact. Septic cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and thromboembolism in COVID, pre-existent heart failure, postoperative hypovolemia, and vasoplegia are few to mention. Such overlap is far from exceptional (eg, septic cardiomyopathy prevalence around 50%). Dynamicity is another factor. Sepsis-associated contractile dysfunction can be masked by vasoplegia and hypovolemia during early sepsis.

Management should not aim just to optimize abnormal indices but also to understand such circulatory system and interventions' dynamic interplay. For example, a reduced intravascular stressed volume (translated into fluid responsiveness) can also be reversed by venoconstriction. Cardiac contractility can be boosted by increasing preload (Frank-starling law). In cardiac tamponade, fluid administration can bridge for drainage by increasing the intraventricular pressure opposing the high intrapericardial pressure. On the other hand, fluid intolerability and responsiveness can coexist necessitating a risk-benefit approach. Assessing ventriculoarterial coupling is also getting more interest. To this end, Critical Care Echocardiography has been widely adopted to assess preload, cardiac function, afterload, and venous congestion during hemodynamic instability.

To conclude, a mixed hemodynamic profile is not exceptional in shock. While the terminology remains important for source control, epidemiology, and research purposes, clinicians need to follow an individualized approach guided by an effective hemodynamic monitoring.

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. task force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^116QRcgL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

How and when to monitor cardiac function and hemodynamics in shock

The three main reasons for monitoring cardiac function in circulatory shock are for:
Identifying the type of shock.
Selecting the therapeutic intervention.
Evaluating the patient's response to therapy.

Identification of the type of shock

Identifying the main mechanism responsible for shock — hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, or distributive ––is of paramount importance. Context analysis (trauma, infection, chest pain, etc.) and clinical evaluation which focuses on skin perfusion and jugular vein distension usually orient diagnosis to the type of shock, but complex situations may exist (e.g. cardiac tamponade in a patient with trauma or septic shock in a patient with chronic heart failure) in which a diagnosis is more difficult. Hence, additional hemodynamic measurements are often needed to ascertain the type of shock, especially in complex situations or in patients with comorbidities. Distributive shock is usually characterized by an elevated cardiac output, while the other types of shock are associated with low cardiac output. Hypovolemic shock is associated with low blood pressures and volumes, while these are increased in cardiogenic shock. Obstructive shock is associated with increased pulmonary artery pressure and dilated right-sided cavities. Tamponade, a form of obstructive shock, is associated with compression of all cavities, and thus with elevated intracardiac pressures but small cardiac volumes. In general, hemodynamic variables such as CVP can be useful in identifying the type of shock. However, unless in the extreme ranges of the variables (such as a CVP of 0 mmHg in the case of a history of bleeding), they should always be interpreted together with other variables.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) team activation — model, observed associations, composition, and operational elements — is outlined as follows: A standardized, interdisciplinary, team-based approach to CS management has been associated with improved clinical outcomes, with single‑center protocols showing lower inhospital mortality, and a multicenter observational analysis among 10 of 24 centers with shock teams showing more frequent invasive hemodynamics, use of advanced types of MCS beyond an intra‑aortic balloon pump, and lower risk‑adjusted cardiac intensive care unit mortality. Key stakeholders have typically included critical care cardiology or general critical care in collaboration with a cardiac intensive care unit cardiologist, advanced HF and transplant cardiology, interventional cardiology, and cardiac surgery; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation intensivists or perfusionist and/or palliative care specialists may be included. Common elements at Level 1 CS hospital centers include early interdisciplinary engagement, a coordinating physician for efficient patient triage, a rapid system for concurrent team activation, efficient virtual and/or bedside communication, and use of invasive hemodynamics to guide therapy selection. Depending on resources, all elements may not be readily available, additional expertise may be needed in scenarios such as electrical storm, critically ill pregnancy, or complex adult congenital heart disease physiology, and the writing committee affirms the importance and value of building and growing shock teams and frequently reviewing CS cases for patient safety and quality improvement.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock: 2016 [^1123c9fG]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock: 2012".

Design

A consensus committee of 55 international experts representing 25 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict-of-interest (COI) policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. A stand-alone meeting was held for all panel members in December 2015. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The panel consisted of five sections: hemodynamics, infection, adjunctive therapies, metabolic, and ventilation. Population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) questions were reviewed and updated as needed, and evidence profiles were generated. Each subgroup generated a list of questions, searched for best available evidence, and then followed the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of evidence from high to very low, and to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or best practice statement when applicable.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Guideline panel provided 93 statements on early management and resuscitation of patients with sepsis or septic shock. Overall, 32 were strong recommendations, 39 were weak recommendations, and 18 were best-practice statements. No recommendation was provided for four questions.

Conclusions

Substantial agreement exists among a large cohort of international experts regarding many strong recommendations for the best care of patients with sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for these critically ill patients with high mortality.

### Mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock: current insights and future directions [^114Ujpxe]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Research priorities in mixed shock

Patients with mixed shock continue to have high morbidity and mortality, and many important scientific questions must be addressed given their unmet clinical needs (Table 2). Novel scientific approaches and emergence of newer therapies represent important strategies to mitigate the lethal burden of mixed shock. The "host response" to myocardial injury and end-organ failure in CS and mixed shock may be maladaptive and deleterious, and potential targets for therapy to limit these harmful mechanisms need to be identified.

Table 2
Research Priorities in Mixed Shock

Clear diagnostic criteria are needed to enable generation of better epidemiological data to understand the true disease burden, for example, for SICM or mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock. Research priorities should include a standardized definition for mixed shock for both clinical trials and contemporary practice. Consensus definitions for CS and septic shock fail to precisely define mixed shock, which limits both registry-based research endeavors and the conduct and reporting of clinical trials. Perhaps an expert panel approach convening a multi-stakeholder collaboration including clinicians, investigators, industry representatives, regulators, and payers may help to generate consensus definitions for safety and outcomes in mixed shock to promote clarity and consistency in future research, analogous to the Shock Academic Research Consortium statement on CS.

### Cardiogenic shock: evolving definitions and future directions in management [^114XvfhB]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of CS is poorly understood owing to a paucity of high-quality clinical data. Even for the most common cause, ACS, significant heterogeneity (eg, STEMI vs type I and type II non-STEMI with more specific variables such as postcardiac arrest or renal failure) exists that likely informs management and influences outcomes. Ideally, management of CS would integrate general supportive measures such as pharmacological circulatory support and MCS titrated to interventions directed at treating specific mechanisms in increasingly granular detail such as interrupting the cellular, metabolic and inflammatory pathways. In the absence of robust multicentre cohort studies providing detailed patient-level phenotyping, current management of CS necessarily focuses on the quantifiable and modifiable parameters of CS as gleaned from invasive haemodynamic assessment. In general, CS is characterised by an initial insult resulting in impaired CO followed by progressive injury culminating in inadequate and ultimately maladaptive compensatory mechanisms and rapid deterioration to end-organ hypoperfusion and complete cardiovascular collapse. This is conceptualised as a vicious cycle of cardiac injury, systemic deterioration and further cardiac impairment (figure 1). Perhaps more than any single feature, this self-perpetuating feedback loop, encompassing the heart and the whole patient, is what underlies CS. Interrupting this 'shock spiral' and restoring cardiovascular homoeostasis is central to the overarching treatment paradigm of CS. Any cause of acute, severe impairment of CO can trigger this cascade and precipitate CS.

Figure 1
Conceptual algorithm for the management of cardiogenic shock (CS). The pathophysiology of CS is characterised by impaired cardiac output, SIRS, end-organ hypoperfusion and maladaptive compensatory mechanisms. Prevention of progressive cardiac and systemic compromise requires early recognition typically requiring right and left catheterisation and interruption of the vicious cycle by addressing underlying insults and initiation of mechanical circulatory support matched to the degree of clinical decompensation. Clinical indices such as CPI for LV function, PAPi for right ventricular function, and presence of malignant clinical features such as arrhythmia and hypoxaemia may help guide the decision for the most appropriate MSC modality. Bi-V, biventricular; CPI, Cardiac Power Index; LV, left ventricular; MCS, mechanical circulatory support; MI, myocardial infarction; PAPi, Pulmonary Artery Pulsatility Index; SIRS, systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

### Cardiogenic shock: searching for a better lifeboat [^112c1wnm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Beyond the issue of unloading, one must question why there has been so little progress in identifying therapies that improve mortality in CS. We believe that there are several considerations that will be important going forward.
Shock severity should be assessed in trials and registries at the onset of care. Retrospectively classifying shock severity by the treatment chosen (eg, number of drugs and devices) is convenient to analyze data sets but does not capture the fundamental distinctions between various stages of shock (eg, by the Society for Cardiac Angiography and Intervention classification). For example, deterioration (Society for Cardiac Angiography and Intervention D) is not simply the use of a mechanical circulatory support device and an inotrope, but an assessment of a downward clinical trajectory. By collecting data in this manner, differences in responses to treatment (if they exist) might be found and leveraged to build evidence for best practices when managing CS.
Granular detailed registries that capture longitudinal data about patients with CS and the responses to therapy are more likely to identify strategies that improve mortality than prospective randomized trials. Although the highest level of evidence is a prospective randomized clinical trial, the difficulties with enrollment, inherent selection bias, and complete failure of prior prospective trials (with the exception of the should we emergently revascularize occluded coronaries for cardiogenic shock [SHOCK] trial) suggest that a new strategy is warranted.
Research should focus on fundamental understanding of the transitions of stages of shock. When does the patient transition from "pump‐responsive" phenotype (where sufficient cardiac output augmentation will reverse the physiologic derangements noted) to the "pump‐unresponsive" phenotype (ie, cardiometabolic shock) where augmentation of cardiac output does little to reverse the calamitous cycle of hemodynamic collapse? This is a similar situation to that of septic shock, which has few treatments and many failed interventions. Examining biomarkers in patients in a serial manner may give insights into the deranged pathways and allow targets for intervention to be identified.
Postcardiotomy shock should be carefully investigated as a unique entity and one that has the advantage of a clear timing of insult (cardiac surgery/cardiopulmonary bypass). Other forms of CS have heterogeneous types of inciting insult (acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, and others), timing that is unclear or sometimes unknown, and a monitoring environment that is often variable. On the other hand, postcardiotomy shock occurs with clear chronology, granular data on elements, such as vital signs, transfusions, and drug infusions, and frequent laboratory measurements. It is possible that mechanisms identified in the setting of postcardiotomy shock may not be universally applicable, but some pathways may be conserved across phenotypes.

### Echocardiography in shock management [^117GragT]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Echocardiography is pivotal in the diagnosis and management of the shocked patient. Important characteristics in the setting of shock are that it is non-invasive and can be rapidly applied. In the acute situation a basic study often yields immediate results allowing for the initiation of therapy, while a follow-up advanced study brings the advantage of further refining the diagnosis and providing an in-depth hemodynamic assessment. Competency in basic critical care echocardiography is now regarded as a mandatory part of critical care training with clear guidelines available. The majority of pathologies found in shocked patients are readily identified using basic level 2D and M-mode echocardiography. A more comprehensive diagnosis can be achieved with advanced levels of competency, for which practice guidelines are also now available. Hemodynamic evaluation and ongoing monitoring are possible with advanced levels of competency, which includes the use of colour Doppler, spectral Doppler, and tissue Doppler imaging and occasionally the use of more recent technological advances such as 3D or speckled tracking. The four core types of shock-cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive, and vasoplegic-can readily be identified by echocardiography. Even within each of the main headings contained in the shock classification, a variety of pathologies may be the cause and echocardiography will differentiate which of these is responsible. Increasingly, as a result of more complex and elderly patients, the shock may be multifactorial, such as a combination of cardiogenic and septic shock or hypovolemia and ventricular outflow obstruction. The diagnostic benefit of echocardiography in the shocked patient is obvious. The increasing prevalence of critical care physicians experienced in advanced techniques means echocardiography often supplants the need for more invasive hemodynamic assessment and monitoring in shock.

### Beyond septic shock: who else requires immediate antibiotics? [^116u9zSX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Landmark studies published almost 20 years ago documented strong associations between time to antibiotic therapy and mortality in critically ill patients, most of whom had septic shock. These findings catalyzed early versions of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign that recommended administering antibiotics ≤ 1 hour after the diagnosis of sepsis with any acute organ dysfunction, not just septic shock. Some state and national quality metrics further extended this guidance, requiring rapid administration of antibiotic therapy for all patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock.

Sepsis, however, is a broad and heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses a wide range of inciting organisms, sites of infection, and patterns of organ dysfunctions. These differences are magnified by host factors, including extremes of age, comorbidities, and immune function. The manifestations of sepsis, prognoses, and the impact of therapy are very different for a young and healthy host with bacterial pneumonia compared with a geriatric patient with cancer complicated by neutropenia and disseminated fungal infection.

The latest version of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recognizes some of this variability. The 2021 guidelines suggest that patients be stratified by certainty of infection and severity of illness. Specifically, they advise antibiotic therapy ≤ 1 hour after recognition in all patients with possible septic shock and all patients with definite or probable sepsis without shock. In patients with possible sepsis without shock, however, in whom the diagnosis of infection is uncertain and the severity of illness is lesser, they suggest the diagnosis be clarified before antibiotic therapy is administered to minimize unnecessary antibiotic agent use and unintended harms to the individual and the population. Clarifying steps can include assessing the patient's response to the treatment of noninfectious conditions and comorbidities (e.g. fluids, diuresis, bronchodilators, heart rate control, pain control, opioid antagonists, anticoagulation) and/or obtaining additional diagnostic studies (e.g. cross-sectional imaging, respiratory viral panels) and administering antimicrobial agents only if the concern for infection persists for > 3 hours.

### The management of heart failure cardiogenic shock: an international RAND appropriateness panel [^115YAkUo]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiogenic shock (CS) represents the final common pathway by which cardiovascular disease causes end-organ dysfunction through sustained hypoperfusion and tissue dysoxia. As a clinical syndrome, CS exhibits heterogeneity with respect to its causative aetiologies, presentation, trajectory, and therapeutic responsiveness. As such, CS continues to pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This likely contributes to considerable variation of care and the persistently poor clinical outcomes with mortality between 30 and 50%. Randomised clinical trial (RCT) enrolment has almost exclusively focussed on the cohort with acute myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock (AMI-CS), and the only intervention proven to reduce mortality is coronary revascularisation restricted to the culprit lesion in AMI-CS.

Observational data suggest that the subset of patients with heart failure related CS (HF-CS) now predominate CS admissions to critical care. HF-CS is broadly subcategorized into de novo HF-CS wherein acute decompensated HF (ADHF) causing CS is identified in the absence of a prior HF diagnosis, and acute-on-chronic HF-CS where ADHF leads to CS development in context of a pre-existing HF diagnosis. This shift in epidemiology of CS towards a preponderance of critical care admissions with HF-CS appears to be driven by a greater relative increase in cases of new-onset or chronic cardiomyopathy with decompensated heart failure as compared with acute myocardial infarction. This has implications for clinical management and service design; recent single centre data have demonstrated that compared with AMI-CS patients HF-CS are younger, are less likely to have cardiac arrest, have divergent haemodynamic profiles, have different requirements for temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) and a different clinical course with lower in-hospital mortality. Current clinical guidelines do not reflect these emerging differences and there are no dedicated HF-CS RCTs completed to date to reliably inform clinical practice.

In an effort to consolidate opinion around the management of HF-CS, we conducted a modified Delphi consensus process using modified RAND/University of California, Los Angeles, appropriateness methodology. We specifically focused on the subset of patients with an acute decompensation of chronic HF given the heterogeneity of aetiologies and potential for disease specific management in the de novo cohort. Our intent was to identify aspects of care where both consensus and uncertainty may exist to inform clinical practice and to focus efforts for future clinical trial design.

Cardiogenic shock definitions and subtypes — acute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock (AMI-CS) and heart failure cardiogenic shock (HF-CS) are delineated as follows: AMI-CS includes cardiogenic shock due to acute myocardial infarction with or without ST-segment elevation on 12-lead electrocardiography, and shock from acute bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, advanced heart block, postcardiac arrest, or other AMI complications is also classified as AMI-CS; HF is defined by symptoms and/or signs caused by structural/functional cardiac abnormalities and ≥ 1 of elevated natriuretic peptides or objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or systemic congestion; HF-CS is shock related to primary myocardial dysfunction from ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathies, subcategorized as de novo HF-CS versus acute-on-chronic HF-CS, with varying left, right, or biventricular involvement and potential etiologies including acute myocarditis, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, peripartum cardiomyopathy, tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and infiltrative diseases such as cardiac amyloidosis or sarcoidosis.

### A clinical review of vasopressors in emergency medicine [^111TxQxg]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasopressor medications raise blood pressure through vasoconstriction and are essential in reversing the hypotension seen in many critically ill patients. Previously, vasopressor administration was largely limited to continuous infusions through central venous access.

Objectives Of The Review

This review addresses the clinical use of vasopressors in various shock states, including practical considerations and innovations in vasopressor administration. The focus is on the clinical administration of vasopressors across a range of shock states, including hypovolemic, distributive, cardiogenic, and obstructive shock.

Discussion

Criteria for starting vasopressors are not clearly defined, though early use may be beneficial. A number of physiologic factors affect the body's response to vasopressors, such as acidosis and adrenal insufficiency. Peripheral and push-dose administration of vasopressors are becoming more common. Distributive shock is characterized by inappropriate vasodilation and vasopressors play a crucial role in maintaining adequate blood pressure. The use of vasopressors is more controversial in hypovolemic shock, as the preferred treatment is correction of the volume deficit. Evidence for vasopressors is limited in cardiogenic shock. For obstructive shock, vasopressors can temporize a patient's blood pressure until definitive therapy can reverse the underlying cause.

Conclusion

Across the categories of shock states, norepinephrine has wide applicability and is a reasonable first-line agent for shock of uncertain etiology. Keeping a broad differential when hypotension is refractory to vasopressors may help to identify adjunctive treatments in physiologic states that impair vasopressor effectiveness. Peripheral administration of vasopressors is safe and facilitates early administration, which may help to improve outcomes in some shock states.

### SCAI clinical expert consensus statement on the classification of cardiogenic shock: this document was endorsed by the American college of cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) in April 2019 [^113n9QXn]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The outcome of cardiogenic shock complicating myocardial infarction has not appreciably changed in the last 30years despite the development of various percutaneous mechanical circulatory support options. It is clear that there are varying degrees of cardiogenic shock but there is no robust classification scheme to categorize this disease state.

Methods

A multidisciplinary group of experts convened by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions was assembled to derive a proposed classification schema for cardiogenic shock. Representatives from cardiology (interventional, advanced heart failure, noninvasive), emergency medicine, critical care, and cardiac nursing all collaborated to develop the proposed schema.

Results

A system describing stages of cardiogenic shock from A to E was developed. Stage A is "at risk" for cardiogenic shock, stage B is "beginning" shock, stage C is "classic" cardiogenic shock, stage D is "deteriorating", and E is "extremis". The difference between stages B and C is the presence of hypoperfusion which is present in stages C and higher. Stage D implies that the initial set of interventions chosen have not restored stability and adequate perfusion despite at least 30minutes of observation and stage E is the patient in extremis, highly unstable, often with cardiovascular collapse.

Conclusion

This proposed classification system is simple, clinically applicable across the care spectrum from pre-hospital providers to intensive care staff but will require future validation studies to assess its utility and potential prognostic implications.

### Fourth Surviving Sepsis Campaign's hemodynamic recommendations: a step forward or a return to chaos? [^112ACrgf]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Important knowledge on the pathophysiology of septic shock has been built up over decades of experimental and clinical research. Translation of these scientific foundations into clinical practice has, however, been slow and erratic. For such a condition with a mortality risk of at least 30–40%, we should expect the rationale of consensus recommendations to be firmly grounded on pathophysiology. Our opinion is that some of the recent SSC's hemodynamic recommendations move far away from this objective and might not constitute a valuable contribution to improve septic shock morbidity or mortality.

Shock — prehospital assessment and classification emphasize targeted history, focused examination, and identification of shock type. History screening includes cardiac problems, stroke, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, urinary changes, syncope, allergic reaction, immunocompromise, adrenal insufficiency, presence of a central line or port, other risks of infection, and overdose. Exam priorities include airway/breathing with pulmonary findings and pulse oximetry, circulation with heart rate, blood pressure and capillary refill, abdominal exam for hepatomegaly, mucous membrane hydration, skin, and neurologic status including GCS. Shock type determination lists cardiogenic, distributive (neurogenic, septic, anaphylactic), hypovolemic, and obstructive (e.g., pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax).

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^114rakAt]. Intensive Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built upon a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along 5 levels to create recommendation grades from A-E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.

Participants

Participants included 44 critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations.

Results

A total of 46 recommendations plus pediatric management considerations.

Conclusions

Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that will hopefully translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually, and even more rapidly when some important new knowledge becomes available.

### Cardiogenic shock syndrome unraveled: understanding the different layers of heterogeneity [^112t7Kdp]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition and clinical classification of CS

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a complex syndrome defined as a cardiac disorder resulting in sustained tissue hypoperfusion. This clinical term covers a broad spectrum of entities, which can differ substantially in pathophysiology and hence clinical presentation and management. The classic clinical triad of CS is the presence of hypotension, low cardiac output (CO) despite adequate preload, and signs of hypoperfusion. A small subgroup of CS patients is normotensive, due to preserved compensatory mechanisms.

The scientific expert panel from the Shock Academic Research Consortium (SHARC) classifies CS by etiology into four categories: CS due to an acute myocardial infarction (AMI-CS), CS related to heart failure (HF-CS), CS due to a primary non-myocardial cardiac cause, e.g. arrhythmias or valvular disease (secondary CS), and post-cardiotomy CS. In addition, CS could also be categorized according to the hemodynamic profile (dysfunction and congestion of right, left or both ventricles), the extent of multiple organ dysfunction and the presence of coexisting anoxic brain injury which may impact therapeutic strategies. Another profile, 'mixed shock', which includes vasodilatory shock and systemic inflammation, and is associated with a higher mortality risk.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^112y5ZKH]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric — implications of recommendation strength are outlined as follows: For a strong recommendation, most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not, and most individuals should receive the recommended course of action; formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences, and such recommendations can be adapted as policy in most situations, including for use as performance indicators. For a weak recommendation, the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not; different choices are likely to be appropriate for different patients, and therapy should be tailored to the individual patient's circumstances, such as patients' or family's values and preferences, and policies will likely be variable. A best practice statement indicates implications to patients, clinicians, and policymakers are the same as strong recommendation.

### Early management of severe sepsis: concepts and controversies [^115HL1AY]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Sepsis is among the most common reasons for admission to ICUs throughout the world, and it is believed to be the third most common cause of death in the United States. The pathogenetic mechanism and physiologic changes associated with sepsis are exceedingly complex, but our understanding is evolving rapidly. The major pathophysiologic changes in patients with septic shock include vasoplegic shock (distributive shock), myocardial depression, altered microvascular flow, and a diffuse endothelial injury. These pathophysiologic changes play a central role in the management of sepsis. The early management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock centers on the administration of antibiotics, IV fluids, and vasoactive agents, followed by source control. However, the specific approach to the resuscitation of patients with septic shock remains highly controversial. This review provides a practical and physiologic-based approach to the early management of sepsis and explores the controversies surrounding the management of this complex condition.

### Hypovolemic shock… [^114UHnXz]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A 65-YEAR-OLD man is admitted to the emergency department with a two-day history of melena associated with dizziness and light-headedness. The skin is pale, cold, and clammy. The radial pulse is thready and small at 130 beats per minute. The patient is dyspneic with a respiratory rate of 24/min, and the blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. As the examination progresses, the patient becomes agitated, and circumoral cyanosis appears. The mucous membranes become dry, the BP decreases to 80/40 mm Hg, and the pulse rate increases to 150 beats per minute. A nasogastric tube is inserted, and it elicits bright red blood. This is a description of hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock, probably secondary to upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Shock is defined as inadequate circulating blood volume with decreasing peripheral vascular perfusion ultimately causing cellular metabolic derangements. The volume loss from a bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcer stimulates pressure receptors in Schumer W.

### Management of cardiogenic shock: state-of-the-art [^111JKvRb]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Definition of cardiogenic shock

The clinical definition of AMI-CS often used in clinical trials is a combination of low systolic blood pressure (SBP) of < 90 mmHg and evidence of low CO (cardiac index [CI] of < 2.2 L/min/m²) in patients with elevated filling pressures (pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure [PCWP] > 15 mmHg). The definition is scientifically pragmatic, as it relies on an SBP of less than 90 mmHg for a clinical diagnosis, and invasive hemodynamic assessment is not readily available on initial presentation. The Shock Academic Research Consortium (SHARC) consensus and the American Heart Association defined CS as cardiac disorder that results in both clinical and biochemical evidence of sustained tissue hypoperfusion. Septic and hypovolemic shock also manifests with hypotension and end-organ hypoperfusion, and mixed forms of shock frequently exist simultaneously. Certain patients have clear evidence of reduced CI and elevated PCWP but with an SBP greater than 90 mmHg. In addition to including absolute blood-pressure parameters in the definition of CS, the degree of hypotension relative to the patients preexisting blood pressure should be considered in the diagnosis of CS. In the SHOCK trial registry, 5.2% of patients were in CS but had an SBP > 90 mmHg, and 7.1% had no evidence of organ hypoperfusion with an SBP < 90 mmHg. Yet, both groups of patients had increased mortality. While traditional criteria for CS are based on the presence of hypotension, recent consensus statements defined CS more broadly with the presence of hypoperfusion in patients without hypotension. Normotensive CS phenotype, especially in young patients, are at high risk for significant hemodynamic deterioration and need a specific awareness.

The definition of CS including invasive hemodynamics was designated a class IIb, level of evidence B recommendation by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), given the absence of prospective randomized data. A consensus statement by the American Heart Association (AHA) supports invasive hemodynamic assessment in select circumstances, although it should not delay primary revascularization. Proactive use of invasive hemodynamic monitoring should be considered early in the presentation of CS to guide management and risk prognostication. However, recent RCTs did not require PCWP or other invasive hemodynamic measurements for diagnosis of CS.

### The management of heart failure cardiogenic shock: an international RAND appropriateness panel [^117Krotc]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we have used a multi-professional consensus process that systematically and quantitatively combined expert opinion with the limited available evidence to further inform contemporary management of HF-CS. The preponderance of HF-CS cases in cardiac critical care units coupled with the persisting ambiguity around optimal monitoring, management and escalation of these cases highlighted within, mandates a requirement for both prospective large-scale registries and clinical trials in patients with HF-CS to inform future clinical guidelines. Without this, there is risk that clinicians conflate observational data and guidance generated in the AMI-CS cohort, and as a result, clinical outcomes will remain static. Collaboration between heart failure cardiology, critical care cardiology and trial methodologists is crucial to design trials specific to the HF-CS cohort.
