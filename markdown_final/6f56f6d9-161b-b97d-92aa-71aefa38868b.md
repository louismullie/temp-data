## Question

30 yr old female: cholesterol 201, LDL 136, cholesterol/HDL ratio 4.37

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a lipid panel in a 30-year-old woman with total cholesterol 201 mg/dL, LDL-C 136 mg/dL, and total/HDL ratio 4.37. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify these lipid values against current guideline thresholds. Then, I should verify the patient's baseline ASCVD risk using appropriate tools and consider lifetime risk. Next, I will examine risk-enhancing factors that could modify decisions. After that, I need to outline lifestyle therapy as first-line management. Finally, I will determine whether pharmacotherapy is indicated now or later, and specify follow-up intervals and additional tests that could refine risk, such as Lp(a) or coronary artery calcium in select scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the lipid classifications. Total cholesterol 201 mg/dL is borderline high by adult criteria, LDL-C 136 mg/dL is borderline high, and the total/HDL ratio of 4.37 is above the desirable threshold of < 4.0, though it is not the primary decision metric in contemporary guidelines; non–HDL-C would be 201 minus HDL, and if HDL is around 46 mg/dL, non–HDL-C would be about 155 mg/dL, which is borderline high as well, reinforcing atherogenic risk even when 10-year risk is low due to age [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the risk assessment approach for a 30-year-old. The Pooled Cohort Equations are not designed for adults under 40, so 10-year ASCVD risk will be artificially low; instead, I should prioritize lifetime or 30-year risk estimation and emphasize lifestyle modification, reserving drug therapy for select higher-risk phenotypes or when risk enhancers are present [^115bcecc] [^11227DTh] [^111Ksvaj].

> I will now examine whether any high-priority conditions are present that would override routine risk assessment. LDL-C is not ≥ 190 mg/dL, so severe hypercholesterolemia requiring statin regardless of other factors is not applicable here; I should still screen for familial hypercholesterolemia if there is a family history of premature ASCVD or physical stigmata, but at 136 mg/dL this is not diagnostic for FH by itself [^115iDaTQ] [^114GY9Hx].

> Next, I should review risk-enhancing factors that could shift management in a 30-year-old with borderline-high LDL-C. Family history of premature ASCVD, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory disorders, premature menopause, high triglycerides, metabolic syndrome, elevated Lp(a), and certain high-risk ancestries are examples; in women, prior pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia also count, and these factors can support earlier pharmacotherapy when combined with persistent LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL or a high lifetime risk profile [^116Vtu3Q] [^111SpaeW] [^114pdYeU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about medications. For a 30-year-old with LDL-C 136 mg/dL and no diabetes or known ASCVD, first-line management is intensive lifestyle therapy: adopt a heart-healthy dietary pattern, achieve at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, maintain healthy weight, avoid tobacco, and limit alcohol; I should confirm adherence and recheck a fasting or nonfasting lipid panel in about 3–6 months to gauge response and reinforce behavior change [^115bcecc] [^117JUPp4].

> Let me consider the role of additional testing. I should double-check whether Lp(a) has ever been measured, because elevated Lp(a) is a risk enhancer and can meaningfully increase lifetime risk; measuring Lp(a) at least once in adulthood is reasonable, and if markedly elevated, it can support earlier statin consideration even when LDL-C is only borderline high, though evidence for statins directly mitigating Lp(a)-mediated risk is limited and decisions remain individualized [^115Qq6KL] [^116LSHF2].

> But wait, what if the patient has persistent LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL despite lifestyle therapy or has multiple risk enhancers? In that scenario, it is reasonable to consider moderate-intensity statin therapy after shared decision-making that discusses long-term benefit, potential adverse effects, and patient preferences; importantly, there are no completed randomized trials of statins specifically in adults aged 20–39, so decisions are extrapolated from broader evidence and lifetime risk modeling, which often shows substantial absolute risk reduction over decades in younger adults with elevated LDL-C [^115iDaTQ] [^1175ya2m] [^116CntJK].

> I should confirm follow-up cadence. For adults 20–39, reassessing traditional risk factors and lipids every 4–6 years is appropriate, with earlier checks if risk factors change, weight increases, or new family history emerges; if pharmacotherapy is initiated, lipid monitoring every 3–12 months is reasonable to ensure adherence and safety, with dose adjustments as needed [^111Ksvaj] [^117JUPp4].

> Let me reconsider the total/HDL ratio of 4.37. While it is above desirable, contemporary guidelines do not use the ratio to decide on statin therapy; it can be a useful communication tool, but I should avoid overinterpreting it and instead anchor decisions to LDL-C, non–HDL-C, lifetime risk, and risk enhancers, keeping in mind that a higher ratio often reflects lower HDL and/or higher atherogenic lipoproteins, both of which track with increased ASCVD risk over time [^115bcecc].

> In summary, I need to ensure the plan is explicit: classify the lipids as borderline high, avoid 10-year PCE use in a 30-year-old, prioritize lifestyle therapy with reassessment in 3–6 months, screen for risk enhancers including Lp(a) and family history, and consider statin therapy if LDL-C remains ≥ 160 mg/dL or if multiple risk enhancers are present, documenting shared decision-making and aligning with the patient's values and reproductive plans, including preconception counseling if relevant [^115bcecc] [^116Vtu3Q] [^116LSHF2].

This 30-year-old woman has a **borderline-high LDL-C of 136 mg/dL** and a **total/HDL ratio of 4.37**, indicating modest atherogenic risk. Given her age and likely low 10-year ASCVD risk, **lifestyle therapy is first-line** [^115bcecc]: heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, weight management, and smoking avoidance, with repeat lipids in 3–6 months. Pharmacotherapy is not indicated now unless LDL-C is ≥ 190 mg/dL, there is a family history of premature ASCVD, or multiple risk enhancers are present [^115iDaTQ] [^116Vtu3Q]. If lifestyle fails and LDL-C remains ≥ 160 mg/dL, consider a moderate-intensity statin after shared decision-making [^115iDaTQ].

## Interpretation of lipid profile

| **Lipid parameter** | **Patient value** | **Reference range** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Total cholesterol | 201 mg/dL | < 200 mg/dL (desirable) | Borderline high |
| LDL cholesterol | 136 mg/dL | < 100 mg/dL (optimal) | Borderline high |
| HDL cholesterol | 46 mg/dL | ≥ 50 mg/dL (women) | Low-normal |
| Total/HDL ratio | 4.37 | < 4.0 (desirable) | Slightly elevated |

- **LDL-C 136 mg/dL**: Borderline high; confers modestly increased ASCVD risk [^112zYqKy].
- **Total/HDL ratio 4.37**: Slightly elevated; a higher ratio associates with higher CVD risk, though LDL-C is the primary driver of therapy decisions [^113LzcKS].
- **HDL-C 46 mg/dL**: Low-normal; not low enough alone to prompt pharmacotherapy.

---

## Cardiovascular risk assessment

- **10-year ASCVD risk**: Likely low given age 30 and no reported risk factors; the Pooled Cohort Equations are not validated for adults < 40, so 10-year risk is often underestimated in this group [^111jMSpQ].
- **Lifetime risk**: May be elevated due to borderline-high LDL-C; lifetime or 30-year risk estimation is reasonable in adults 20–39 to guide prevention [^11227DTh] [^1118HMwh].
- **Risk enhancers**: Family history of premature ASCVD, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory disorders, or elevated Lp(a) could increase risk and influence treatment decisions [^116Vtu3Q].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

According to the 2018 AHA/ACC guidelines, **lifestyle modification is first-line** for adults 20–39 with LDL-C 130–159 mg/dL, with pharmacotherapy reserved for LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL or persistent LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL with risk enhancers after lifestyle therapy [^115iDaTQ] [^115bcecc]. The 2019 ACC/AHA primary prevention guideline similarly emphasizes lifestyle and lifetime risk assessment in young adults, with statins considered for LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL when risk enhancers are present [^116TMavT] [^116Vtu3Q].

---

## Recommended management strategy

### Lifestyle modifications (first-line therapy)

- **Diet**: Emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and limit saturated fats, trans fats, refined carbs, and added sugars.
- **Exercise**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity.
- **Weight management**: Aim for BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m².
- **Smoking**: Avoid tobacco smoke.
- **Alcohol**: Limit to ≤ 1 drink/day (women).

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Recheck a **fasting or nonfasting lipid panel** in 3–6 months to assess lifestyle response, then every 4–6 years if stable. Continue to reassess cardiovascular risk factors regularly and update lifetime risk as needed [^111Ksvaj].

---

### Pharmacologic therapy considerations

Pharmacotherapy is **not indicated now** unless any of the following are present:

- **LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL**: Initiate high-intensity statin regardless of other risk factors [^115iDaTQ].
- **Persistent LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL**: After lifestyle therapy, consider moderate-intensity statin if risk enhancers are present (e.g. family history of premature ASCVD, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory disorders, elevated Lp(a)) [^115iDaTQ] [^116Vtu3Q].
- **Familial hypercholesterolemia**: Suspect if LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL with family history or physical findings; consider genetic testing and cascade screening [^114GY9Hx].

---

## Potential benefits and risks of pharmacologic therapy

Benefits include **LDL-C lowering** and reduced lifetime ASCVD risk, with greater absolute benefit in those with higher baseline risk or longer exposure [^116CntJK]. Risks include myalgias, elevated liver enzymes, and rare myopathy; overall, statins are well tolerated and safe in reproductive-age women with appropriate counseling.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing management

- **Family history**: Premature ASCVD in first-degree relatives increases risk and may lower treatment thresholds [^116Vtu3Q].
- **Reproductive plans**: Pregnancy planning affects timing of statins; avoid statins during pregnancy and use effective contraception if prescribed.
- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential given low short-term risk and potential long-term benefit [^115iDaTQ].

---

## Summary and recommendations

- **Current risk**: Modest due to borderline-high LDL-C and slightly elevated total/HDL ratio.
- **Initial management**: Intensive lifestyle therapy and lipid recheck in 3–6 months.
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Not indicated now unless LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, persistent LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL with risk enhancers, or FH is suspected.
- **Long-term**: Continue lifestyle measures, monitor lipids periodically, and reassess lifetime risk to guide therapy.

This approach aligns with guidelines and balances **short-term low risk** with **long-term prevention** in a 30-year-old woman.

### Lifetime risk for developing dyslipidemia: the framingham offspring study [^114VzscD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

High serum low-density lipoprotein(LDL) cholesterol and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are major vascular risk factors. National surveys indicate that 40% of individuals in the United States have borderline-high LDL cholesterol, and 13–34% have low HDL. The lifetime risk of developing dyslipidemia is unknown, however.

Methods

We estimated the 10- to 30-year long-term risks of developing "borderline-high" LDL cholesterol (≥ 130 mg/dL [3.4 mmol/L]), "high" LDL cholesterol (≥ 160 mg/dL [4.1 mmol/L]) and "low" HDL cholesterol (< 40 mg/dL [1.0 mmol/L]) in 4701 Framingham Offspring Study participants (53% women) who attended at least 2 examinations between 1971 and 2000. We performed sex-specific analyses (for age groups 30–34, 40–44, 50–54 years), and estimated risks conditional on surviving without the lipid abnormality up to the baseline age. We also estimated risks accounting for baseline prevalence of dyslipidemia (elevated LDL, low HDL).

Results

Over a 30-year period, approximately 6 of 10 participants developed borderline-high LDL, 4 of 10 people developed high LDL, and 2 (women) to 4 (men) of 10 individuals developed low HDL levels; estimates were generally similar for different age groups. Adjustment for baseline prevalence of dyslipidemia increased these estimates: 30-year risks exceeded 80% for borderline-high LDL, 50% for high LDL, and 25% (women) to 65% (men) for low HDL; 20–50% had or developed a low HDL along with a high LDL level. The 30-year estimates approximate the lifetime risk in 50-year-olds.

Conclusions

The long term risks of developing dyslipidemia are substantial in both sexes, and considerably exceed prevalence estimates from cross-sectional surveys.

Heterozygous hypercholesterolemia and pediatric risk factors — cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is marked by very high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL–C), with LDL–C levels minimally 160 mg/dL and typically higher than 200 mg/dL beginning in infancy, and high event rates, with 50 percent of men and 25 percent of women experiencing clinical coronary events by age 50 years. In the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth (PDAY) study, every increase in non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL–C) of 30 mg/dL was associated with incremental increases in atherosclerosis severity, and in 15- to 19-year olds the presence of hyperglycemia was associated with advanced coronary atherosclerosis. In a 2.5-year follow-up, the metabolic syndrome risk factor cluster in children predicted clinical CVD in adults ages 30–48 years, and the PDAY study also reports a strong relationship between abdominal aortic atherosclerosis and tobacco use.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^117CYeQV]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

LDL-C and non–HDL-C preventive thresholds — evidence cited supports an LDL-C concentration of < 100 mg/dL and a non–HDL-C level of < 130 mg/dL for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), corresponding to an LDL-C concentration of ∼ 100 mg/dL; lipid-lowering therapy which reduced LDL-C to ≤ 100 mg/dL was associated with a significantly lower percentage of total and CHD-related deaths (40% vs 61%) compared with patients with LDL-C of ≥ 100 mg/dL, and lower-risk associations have been shown to be present to LDL-C values of < 55 mg/dL; designation of non–HDL-C treatment targets as 30 mg/dL more than the LDL-C concentration is based on the assumption that "normal" very low–density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) when triglycerides are < 150 mg/dL is typically ≤ 30 mg/dL, whereas when triglycerides are elevated, VLDL-C is typically > 30 mg/dL; in observational studies, each 1 mg/dL increment in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with an increment in ASCVD event risk at least as large as that for each 1 mg/dL increase in LDL-C.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^115samDJ]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Prevalence of dyslipidemia

Defining "hypercholesterolemia" depends on the clinical context. LDL-C is roughly normally distributed in the population, with a slight right-skew and a mean of approximately 2.6, 3.2, and 3.5 mmol/L (100, 124, and 135 mg/dL) and 2.9, 3.4, and 3.3 mmol/L (112, 132, and 138 mg/dL) for European women and men aged 20 to 39, 40 to 65, and 66 to 100 years, respectively. The 95th percentile roughly corresponds to an LDL-C value of 5.0 mmol/L (194 mg/dL).

Recommendations regarding who may benefit from lipid-lowering therapy depend on baseline risk of ASCVD. Lowering cholesterol is associated with a reduction in ASCVD risk, with a 20% relative risk reduction for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C. LDL-C > 95th percentile (ie, > 5.0 mmol/L [194 mg/dL]) is generally the point at which one may consider a primary genetic disorder, and also the point at which treatment would be recommended regardless of age or other risk factors. Therefore, it is reasonable to define hypercholesterolemia as an LDL-C level > 5.0 mmol/L (194 mg/dL).

### Comparison of LDL-cholesterol direct measurement with the estimate using the friedewald formula in a sample of 10, 664 patients [^114BNdyo]. Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "LDL Calculated" for coronary artery disease, hypertriglyceridemia and dyslipidemia.

The Friedewald formula estimates LDL cholesterol from total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, a key marker of cardiovascular risk. LDL targets vary based on risk, with stricter goals for high-risk patients.

The LDL Cholesterol Calculator is designed to estimate the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood, providing an essential insight into cardiovascular health. It achieves this by requiring input values for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. These values can be entered in either mg/dL or mmol/L, and if needed, the calculator will convert the values to mg/dL using precise conversion factors: 38.67 for total and HDL cholesterol, and 88.57 for triglycerides.

With the necessity of unit conversion addressed, the LDL cholesterol is calculated using the following formula:

LDL cholesterol = total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol - (triglycerides / 5)

This equation effectively estimates the LDL cholesterol, delivering the result in mg/dL and rounding it to two decimal places for precision.

The calculator then categorizes the LDL cholesterol level into one of several interpretation ranges, providing clarity on the result and its implications:

- LDL Cholesterol < 100 mg/dL is considered "Optimal", suggesting a lower cardiovascular risk.
- A reading between 100 and 129 mg/dL is "Near optimal/above optimal", signifying a slightly increased risk.
- Values from 130 to 159 mg/dL are labeled as "Borderline high", hinting at moderate risk levels.
- Results ranging from 160 to 189 mg/dL are classified as "High", indicating a significant risk that may necessitate intervention.
- An LDL level ≥ 190 mg/dL is "Very high", clearly pointing to a need for medical attention and lifestyle changes.

This categorization aligns with clinical guidelines, assisting individuals and healthcare providers in understanding cardiovascular risk and making informed decisions regarding health management.

### Screening for lipid disorders in children and adolescents: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115uzdMT]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Suggestions for practice regarding the I statement — potential preventable burden explains that familial hypercholesterolemia is generally asymptomatic in childhood and adolescence and is rarely associated with cardiovascular events in the first 2 decades of life, yet it can cause early cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as an adult, with atherosclerotic changes starting as early as age 8 years. Robust evidence from studies conducted primarily before statins were commonly used shows that a diagnosis of FH substantially increases adult cardiovascular risk. A meta-analysis of 68 565 adults from 6 US cohorts found that the FH phenotype, defined by an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL or greater (to convert LDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259), was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio of 4.1 (95% CI, 2.1–13.4) for cardiovascular disease events over 30 years of follow-up compared with a reference group defined by an LDL-C level of less than 130 mg/dL.

### Associations of blood pressure and Cholesterol levels during young Adulthood with later Cardiovascular events [^113gRfsW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Current U.S. guidelines for treatment of high cholesterol and high BP advise using atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk to guide treatment decisions. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline for high BP recommends pharmacological treatment for stage one hypertension (SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg or DBP 80 to 89 mm Hg) for younger adults without chronic kidney disease or diabetes only if 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 10%. The 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guideline emphasizes the importance of assessment of 30-year or lifetime ASCVD risk in young adults, but statin treatment of high cholesterol is recommended for young adults with LDL < 190 mg/dl only if with long-standing diabetes or a concomitant higher-risk condition. The majority of the young adults with nonoptimal risk factors have low 10-year ASCVD risk and are not likely to receive either pharmacological interventions or advice to pursue lifestyle measures (i.e. weight loss, heart-healthy diet), if they are screened at all. Pharmacological BP and LDL lowering may benefit selected young adults at high risk for premature ASCVD. The currently ongoing ECAD (Eliminate Coronary Artery Disease) trial is designed to address the question of whether incident ASCVD events can be more effectively prevented by early initiation of statin-based LDL lowering in young and middle-aged adults who are not yet candidates for guideline-based pharmacological LDL lowering due to low 10-year ASCVD risk.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Primary prevention adults 40 to 75 years of age with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.7 to 4.8 mmol/L) without diabetes mellitus — risk estimation and statin intensity are specified as follows: the 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk should be estimated by using the race- and sex-specific pooled cohort equations (PCE), and adults should be categorized as low risk (< 5%), borderline risk (5% to < 7.5%), intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20%), and high-risk (≥ 20%); in adults at intermediate-risk, if a decision is made for statin therapy after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in intermediate-risk patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more, and for optimal ASCVD risk reduction, especially in high-risk patients, levels should be reduced by 50% or more; and clinicians and patients should engage in a risk discussion that considers risk factors, healthy lifestyle, expected ASCVD risk-reduction benefits, potential adverse effects and drug–drug interactions, and patient preferences.

### A long-term benefit approach vs standard risk-based approaches for statin eligibility in primary prevention [^1175ya2m]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

A 10-year benefit-based approach to statin therapy in primary prevention includes younger individuals with higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and prevents more cardiovascular events than a risk-based approach. However, a 10-year treatment duration likely underestimates the expected benefits of statins.

Objective

To model the impact of a 30-year benefit approach to select individuals for statin therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) data set included samples of the US population from the 2009–2010, 2011–2012, and 2013–2014 data collection cycles. Individuals between 40 to 60 years old who did not have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or LDL-C levels greater than 190 mg/dL and who were not taking statins were included. Data analysis took place from November 2017 to August 2018.

Exposures

We calculated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 10-year and 30-year absolute risk reduction (10-year ARR and 30-year ARR) of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for each individual.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Number of individuals meeting eligibility for statins based on 10-year (atherosclerotic) cardiovascular disease risk, 10-year ARR, or 30-year ARR.

Results

A total of 1688 individuals were included, representing 56.6 million US individuals. Statin eligibility based on 7.5% CVR10 was 9.5%; based on 2.3% 10-year ARR, 13.0%, and based on 15% 30-year ARR, 17.5%. The 10-year risk, 10-year benefit, and 30-year benefit approaches all led to similar acceptable mean absolute risk reductions at 30 years, with the benefit-based approaches better able to avoid treatment of individuals with low expected benefit. Individuals who met statin eligibility based solely on the 30-year ARR threshold of 15% or greater were younger (mean age, 50 [95% CI, 48–52] years) and more likely to be women (43% [95% CI, 26%-59%]) than those recommended with a 10-year ARR threshold of 2.3% or greater (mean age, 56 [95% CI, 54–57] years; 22% [95% CI, 10%-34%] women). This group also had lower 10-year risk (mean risk, 4.7% [95% CI, 4.4%-5.1%]) and higher LDL-C levels (mean level, 149 mg/dL [95% CI, 142–155 mg/dL]) than those recommended with a 10-year ARR threshold of 2.3% or greater (mean risk, 9.3% [95% CI, 8.3%-10.2%]; mean LDL-C levels, 110 [103–118] mg/dL). Preventable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in 10 and 30 years were highest using the 30-year benefit approach (296 000 at 10 years and 2.03 million at 30 years) and lowest based on 10-year risk (204 000 at 10 years and 1.18 million at 30 years).

Conclusions and Relevance

A long-term benefit approach to statin eligibility identifies nearly 1 in 6 individuals as having a high degree of expected long-term benefit of statins, with a number needed to treat of less than 7. This approach identifies younger individuals with higher LDL-C levels who would not be currently recommended for treatment and may provide a more optimal approach for determining statin eligibility in primary prevention.

### New national cholesterol education program III guidelines for primary prevention lipid-lowering drug therapy: projected impact on the size, sex, and age distribution of the treatment-eligible population [^117PmW1r]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The guidelines in the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP III) include absolute risk and lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels to assess eligibility for lipid-lowering drug therapy. We studied the impact of these changes on the size, sex, and age distribution of the target US population using data from the Third Annual National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES III) (1988 to 1994).

Methods and Results

A subsample of NHANES III participants aged 20 to 79 years with known cardiovascular risk factors and LDL-C levels was identified (n = 13 589). We assessed their eligibility for drug therapy first using NCEP II guidelines and then using the new NCEP III criteria. We also calculated the number eligible for LDL-C lowering to < 100 mg/dL. An estimated 15 million individuals aged 20 to 79 years are eligible for drug therapy under NCEP II; 51% are males, 49% are females, 26% are < 45 years old, and 28% are ≥ 65 years old. Under NCEP III, 36 million would be eligible for treatment; 55% are males, 45% are females, 32% are < 45 years old, and 27% are ≥ 65 years old. This represents a 140% increase in eligibility overall, a 157% increase among males, a 122% increase among females, a 131% increase among those ≥ 65 years old, and a 201% increase among those < 45 years old. Of treatment-eligible individuals, 26% of males, 24% of females, 39% of elderly, and 14% of those < 45 years old are targeted for LDL-C lowering to < 100 mg/dL.

Conclusions

The NCEP III guidelines will alter the age and sex distributions of the treatment-eligible population, targeting many more younger (< 45 years old) and greater numbers of elderly (≥ 65 years) individuals, particularly for aggressive intervention.

### Earlier intervention in the management of hypercholesterolemia: what are we waiting for? [^115YnKKk]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The thesis advanced here is that we are initiating treatment of hypercholesterolemia (and other risk factors) too late in life. Initiating treatment at, for example, age 30 years instead of age 60 years might very well prevent not just 30% of events, as in the 5-year statin trials, but perhaps as many as 60%.

### Long-term risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in US adults with the familial hypercholesterolemia phenotype [^111KQsiP]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) affects up to 1 in 200 individuals in the United States, but atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes of FH in the general US population have not been described. We therefore sought to evaluate long-term coronary heart disease (CHD) and total ASCVD risks in US adults with an FH phenotype.

Methods

Using individual pooled data from 6 large US epidemiological cohorts, we stratified participants by low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level at index ages from 20 to 79 years. For the primary analysis, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥ 190 and < 130 mg/dL defined the FH phenotype and referent, respectively. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the effects of varying the FH phenotype definition. We used Cox regression models to assess covariate-adjusted associations of the FH phenotype with 30-year hazards for CHD (CHD death or nonfatal myocardial infarction) and total ASCVD (CHD or stroke).

Results

We included 68565 baseline person-examinations; 3850 (5.6%) had the FH phenotype by the primary definition. Follow-up across index ages ranged from 78985 to 308378 person-years. After covariate adjustment, the FH phenotype was associated with substantially elevated 30-year CHD risk, with hazard ratios up to 5.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.1–21.7). Across index ages, CHD risk was accelerated in those with the FH phenotype by 10 to 20 years in men and 20 to 30 years in women. Similar patterns of results were found for total ASCVD risk, with hazard ratios up to 4.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.2–13.4). Alternative FH phenotype definitions incorporating family history, more stringent age-based low-density lipoprotein cholesterol thresholds, or alternative lipid fractions decreased the FH phenotype prevalence to as low as 0.2% to 0.4% without materially affecting CHD risk estimates (hazard ratios up to 8.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.0–61.6).

Conclusions

In the general US population, the long-term ASCVD burden related to phenotypic FH, defined by low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL, is likely substantial. Our finding of CHD risk acceleration may aid efforts in risk communication.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to lipoprotein, a, EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining lipoprotein(a) at least once in each adult person's lifetime to identify patients with very high inherited lipoprotein(a) levels > 180 mg/dL (> 430 mmol/L) having a lifetime risk of ASCVD equivalent to the risk associated with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

### Prediction of cumulative exposure to Atherogenic lipids during early Adulthood [^114bpKBH]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The ability of a 1-time measurement of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to predict the cumulative exposure to these lipids during early adulthood (age 18–40 years) and the associated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk after age 40 years is not clear.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to evaluate whether a 1-time measurement of non-HDL-C or LDL-C in a young adult can predict cumulative exposure to these lipids during early adulthood, and to quantify the association between cumulative exposure to non-HDL-C or LDL-C during early adulthood and the risk of ASCVD after age 40 years.

Methods

We included CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study) participants who were free of cardiovascular disease before age 40 years, were not taking lipid-lowering medications, and had ≥ 3 measurements of LDL-C and non-HDL-C before age 40 years. First, we assessed the ability of a 1-time measurement of LDL-C or non-HDL-C obtained between age 18 and 30 years to predict the quartile of cumulative lipid exposure from ages 18 to 40 years. Second, we assessed the associations between quartiles of cumulative lipid exposure from ages 18 to 40 years with ASCVD events (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke) after age 40 years.

Results

Of 4,104 CARDIA participants who had multiple lipid measurements before and after age 30 years, 3,995 participants met our inclusion criteria and were in the final analysis set. A 1-time measure of non-HDL-C and LDL-C had excellent discrimination for predicting membership in the top or bottom quartiles of cumulative exposure (AUC: 0.93 for the 4 models). The absolute values of non-HDL-C and LDL-C that predicted membership in the top quartiles with the highest simultaneous sensitivity and specificity (highest Youden's Index) were > 135 mg/dL for non-HDL-C and > 118 mg/dL for LDL-C; the values that predicted membership in the bottom quartiles were < 107 mg/dL for non-HDL-C and < 96 mg/dL for LDL-C. Individuals in the top quartile of non-HDL-C and LDL-C exposure had demographic-adjusted HRs of 4.6 (95% CI: 2.84–7.29) and 4.0 (95% CI: 2.50–6.33) for ASCVD events after age 40 years, respectively, when compared with each bottom quartile.

Conclusions

Single measures of non-HDL-C and LDL-C obtained between ages 18 and 30 years are highly predictive of cumulative exposure before age 40 years, which in turn strongly predicts later-life ASCVD events.

### Inflammation, cholesterol, lipoprotein (a), and 30-year cardiovascular outcomes in women [^111uymCx]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a) levels contribute to 5-year and 10-year predictions of cardiovascular risk and represent distinct pathways for pharmacologic intervention. More information about the usefulness of these biomarkers for predicting cardiovascular risk over longer periods of time in women is needed because early-life intervention represents an important risk-reduction method.

Methods

We measured high-sensitivity CRP, LDL cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a) levels at baseline in 27,939 initially healthy U.S. women who were subsequently followed for 30 years. The primary end point was a first major adverse cardiovascular event, which was a composite of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. We calculated the adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals across quintiles of each biomarker, along with 30-year cumulative incidence curves adjusted for age and competing risks.

Results

The mean age of the participants at baseline was 54.7 years. During the 30-year follow-up, 3662 first major cardiovascular events occurred. Quintiles of increasing baseline levels of high-sensitivity CRP, LDL cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a) all predicted 30-year risks. Covariable-adjusted hazard ratios for the primary end point in a comparison of the top with the bottom quintile were 1.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.52 to 1.90) for high-sensitivity CRP, 1.36 (95% CI, 1.23 to 1.52) for LDL cholesterol, and 1.33 (95% CI, 1.21 to 1.47) for lipoprotein(a). Findings for coronary heart disease and stroke appeared to be consistent with those for the primary end point. Each biomarker showed independent contributions to overall risk. The greatest spread for risk was obtained in models that incorporated all three biomarkers.

Conclusions

A single combined measure of high-sensitivity CRP, LDL cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a) levels among initially healthy U.S. women was predictive of incident cardiovascular events during a 30-year period. These data support efforts to extend strategies for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic events beyond traditional 10-year estimates of risk.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1115GNwp]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening and classification of initial lipoprotein lipid levels — In all adults (≥ 20 years of age), a fasting or nonfasting lipoprotein profile should be obtained at least every 5 years and should include at minimum total cholesterol and HDL-C to allow calculation of non–HDL-C (total-C – HDL-C); if fasting (generally 9–12 hours), the LDL-C level may be calculated provided the triglyceride concentration is < 400 mg/dL. If atherogenic cholesterol levels (non–HDL-C and LDL-C) are in the desirable range, lipoprotein lipid measurement and ASCVD risk assessment should be repeated in 5 years, or sooner based on clinical judgment, with earlier rescreening prompted by changes in ASCVD risk factors (including weight gain), a premature ASCVD event in a first-degree relative, evidence of ASCVD in the patient, or a new potential secondary cause of dyslipidemia; for those with atherogenic cholesterol in the desirable range, public health recommendations regarding lifestyle should be emphasized.

### Women, lipids, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a call to action from the European Atherosclerosis Society [^116Mxkbb]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular risk factors in women: focus on lipids

There is limited information on how female sex influences major lipids, including LDL-C, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs), and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]. Cumulative exposure differs (Figure 1), with higher lipid levels from birth in girls than boys, persisting during adolescence. Lipids also vary during the menstrual cycle (highest at ovulation), a possible consideration in lipid testing. Increases during pregnancy in levels of total cholesterol and LDL-C (∼30%) and triglycerides (TGs) (∼50% at 35–42 weeks) (Figure 3)are important in women with higher pre-pregnancy levels. Breastfeeding favourably modulates hyperlipidaemia, and when continued for > 12 months over the lifetime, is associated with lower risk of ASCVD. After menopause transition, women experience a worsening in the lipid profile (Figure 1) with increases in total cholesterol, LDL-C, and TG levels potentially contributing to accelerating ASCVD risk.

Figure 3

Data are medians calculated from the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles from Klajnbard et al. To convert total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol from mmol/L to mg/dL multiply by 38.7. To convert triglycerides from mmol/L to mg/dL multiply by 88.6

Familial hypercholesterolaemia

Familial hypercholesterolaemia is characterized by elevated LDL-C levels compared with the general population. Women with FH appear to be at risk of higher cholesterol burden than men with FH for a number of reasons, including higher LDL-C levels from an early age, later diagnosis (on average, by ∼2.5 years), and underuse of maximal statin doses or combination LLT. Attainment of LDL-C goal is consequently lower (Figure 4), and ∼40% of women do not attain levels < 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) (odds ratio.63, 95% CI.48–.82; P = 0.0007). These disparities in FH care impact ASCVD risk, with registry data showing the highest excess CHD risk among younger women with FH.

### Efficacy of cholesterol levels and ratios in predicting future coronary heart disease in a Chinese population [^113LzcKS]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

In this study, we assessed the efficacy of various lipid and lipoprotein measurements at baseline for predicting the risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and determined the associated risk of CHD in subgroups stratified by different lipid and lipoprotein screening strategies to evaluate the adequacy of current total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-based approaches in lipid management. We analyzed data from the Chin-Shan Community Cardiovascular Cohort study, a Chinese population-based prospective cohort study that began in 1990. During an 8-year follow-up period, 213 of 3,159 participants (6.7%) without CHD (aged ≥ 35 years) developed CHD. The total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio was the most powerful lipoprotein predictor of future CHD (hazard ratio 1.21 for a 1.0 increment in ratio; p < 0.001). Subjects with "high-risk" LDL cholesterol levels (> 160 mg/dl) and low total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratios (≤ 5) had an incidence of CHD similar to those with low levels of both LDL cholesterol (≤ 130 mg/dl) and total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratios (4.9% vs 4.6%). In contrast, subjects with "low-risk" LDL cholesterol levels (≤ 130 mg/dl) and high total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratios (> 5) had a 2.5-fold higher incidence of CHD than those with similar LDL cholesterol levels but low total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratios (p < 0.001). Compared with using an LDL cholesterol level of 130 mg/dl as the cut-off point, using a total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio of 5 was associated with superior specificity (73% vs 59%, p < 0.001) and accuracy (72% vs 58%, p < 0.001), and similar sensitivity (50% vs 53%). Our data indicate that current guidelines for lipid management may misclassify subjects with high levels of HDL and LDL cholesterol as well as those with low levels of HDL and LDL cholesterol. Using the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol as the initial screening tool can obviate this discrepancy.

### Prevalence of elevated cardiovascular risks in young adults: a cross-sectional analysis of national health and nutrition examination surveys [^111VuMFw]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The 2013 cholesterol management guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommend lipid screening in all adults older than 20 years to identify those at increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Statins may be considered for patients with elevated 10-year risk (> 5%) or a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of 4.92 mmol/L (190 mg/dL) or greater.

Objective

To describe the prevalence of elevated ASCVD risk among nondiabetic adults younger than 50 years.

Design

Cross-sectional.

Setting

NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), 1999 to 2000 through 2011 to 2012.

Participants

Adults aged 30 to 49 years without known ASCVD or diabetes.

Measurements

10-year ASCVD risk was estimated by using the 2013 ACC/AHA ASCVD risk calculator. Participants were subdivided by age, sex, and history of smoking and hypertension. The percentages of adults in each subgroup with a 10-year ASCVD risk greater than 5% and of those with an LDL-C level of 4.92 mmol/L (190 mg/dL) or greater were estimated. Low-prevalence subgroups were defined as those in which a greater than 1% prevalence of elevated cardiovascular risk could be ruled out (that is, the upper 95% confidence bound for prevalence was ≤ 1%).

Results

Overall, 9608 NHANES participants representing 67.9 million adults were included, with approximately half (47.12%, representing 32 million adults) in low-prevalence subgroups. In the absence of smoking or hypertension, 0.09% (95% CI, 0.02% to 0.35%) of adult men younger than 40 years and 0.04% (CI, 0.0% to 0.26%) of adult women younger than 50 years had an elevated risk. Among other subgroups, 0% to 75.9% of participants had an increased risk. Overall, 2.9% (CI, 2.3% to 3.5%) had an LDL-C level of 4.92 mmol/L (190 mg/dL) or greater.

Limitation

No information was available regarding cardiovascular outcomes.

Conclusion

In the absence of risk factors, the prevalence of increased ASCVD risk is low among women younger than 50 and men younger than 40 years.

Primary Funding Source

14.1 Clinical Studies in Adults

Reductions in Risk of CHD Mortality and Cardiovascular Events

In 4S, the effect of therapy with simvastatin on total mortality was assessed in 4,444 patients with CHD and baseline total cholesterol 212–309 mg/dL (5.5 to 8.0 mmol/L). In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were treated with standard care, including diet, and either simvastatin 20 to 40 mg/day (n = 2,221) or placebo (n = 2,223) for a median duration of 5.4 years. Over the course of the study, treatment with simvastatin led to mean reductions in total-C, LDL-C and TG of 25%, 35%, and 10%, respectively, and a mean increase in HDL-C of 8%. Simvastatin significantly reduced the risk of mortality by 30% (p = 0.0003, 182 deaths in the simvastatin group vs 256 deaths in the placebo group). The risk of CHD mortality was significantly reduced by 42% (p = 0.00001, 111 vs 189 deaths). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in non-cardiovascular mortality. Simvastatin significantly decreased the risk of having major coronary events (CHD mortality plus hospital-verified and silent non-fatal myocardial infarction [MI]) by 34% (p < 0.00001, 431 vs 622 patients with one or more events). The risk of having a hospital-verified non-fatal MI was reduced by 37%. Simvastatin significantly reduced the risk for undergoing myocardial revascularization procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) by 37% (p < 0.00001, 252 vs 383 patients). Simvastatin significantly reduced the risk of fatal plus non-fatal cerebrovascular events (combined stroke and transient ischemic attacks) by 28% (p = 0.033, 75 vs 102 patients). Simvastatin reduced the risk of major coronary events to a similar extent across the range of baseline total and LDL cholesterol levels. Because there were only 53 female deaths, the effect of simvastatin on mortality in women could not be adequately assessed. However, simvastatin significantly lessened the risk of having major coronary events by 34% (60 vs 91 women with one or more event). The randomization was stratified by angina alone (21% of each treatment group) or a previous MI. Because there were only 57 deaths among the patients with angina alone at baseline, the effect of simvastatin on mortality in this subgroup could not be adequately assessed. However, trends in reduced coronary mortality, major coronary events and revascularization procedures were consistent between this group and the total study cohort. Additionally, simvastatin resulted in similar decreases in relative risk for total mortality, CHD mortality, and major coronary events in elderly patients (≥ 65 years), compared with younger patients.

European and American risk-based LDL-C targets — thresholds and actions: According to the European Society of Cardiology guidance, individuals aged 50 to 69 years with a 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk of ≥ 10% and those under 50 years with a 10-year CVD risk of ≥ 7.5% should aim to reduce their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels to < 1.4 mmol/L (54.1 mg/dL). Individuals under 50 years with a CVD risk between 2.5% and 7.5% and those aged 50–69 years with a 10-year CVD risk between 5% and < 10% should target an LDL-C level of < 1.8 mmol/L (69.6 mg/dL). In line with American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidance, individuals aged 40–75 years with LDL-C levels ≥ 1.8 mmol/L (69.6 mg/dL) are recommended to assess their 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk; if the ASCVD risk is between 7.5% and 19%, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% to 49%, while an ASCVD risk ≥ 20% warrants a reduction of 50%. In Australia, individuals aged 45–79 years with a 5-year CVD risk of ≥ 5% are recommended to initiate LMAs to reduce their LDL-C levels to 1.8 mmol/L (69.6 mg/dL).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

2018 Cholesterol clinical practice guideline — young adults with hypercholesterolemia are addressed with specific thresholds and assessment guidance: statin therapy is recommended for young adults with primary elevations of LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dl. In young adults with persistent, moderate hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C 160–189 mg/dL), especially when risk-enhancing factors are present, clinical judgment would suggest that these high risk young adults will benefit from long-term statin therapy. For risk assessment in those without phenotypically severe hypercholesterolemia, the pooled cohort equations can be used to estimate lifetime risk starting at age 21 years. Evidence gaps are noted as no long-term RCTs with cholesterol-lowering drugs have been carried out in those 20 to 39 years age, and while coronary artery calcium scores have been suggested to identify candidates, absence of RCT data precludes guideline recommendations at this time.

### Incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in young adults at low short-term but high long-term Risk [^111jMSpQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

To guide lipid-lowering treatment decisions, the 2018 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) cholesterol guideline recommends using pooled cohort equations (PCEs) to estimate 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. However, the PCEs are not directly applicable to young adults because they were developed in and recommended only for adults 40 to 75 years of age. The 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline recommends the estimation of lifetime or 30-year ASCVD risk for adults younger than 40 years of age.

A few studies have reported that some adults may have a low 10-year but a high lifetime predicted ASCVD risk. – Because age is the strongest contributor to 10-year predicted risk, young adults generally have a low 10-year ASCVD predicted risk even if their risk factor profile indicates high lifetime risk. Individuals with a low 10-year but a high lifetime predicted ASCVD risk have a higher incidence of subclinical ASCVD compared with those with both low 10-year and lifetime predicted risk, suggesting this subgroup as one that would benefit from preventive measures.

Existing lifetime or 30-year ASCVD risk tools were derived from a single cohort of non-Hispanic Whites aged 20 to 59 years. It is unclear how well these long-term ASCVD risk prediction tools, along with the PCE 10-year risk equation, discriminate high vs low ASCVD risk among young adults, especially among those who are not non-Hispanic White. In the present study, we compared the performance of 10-year, 30-year, and lifetime ASCVD risk prediction tools recommended by the 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline in a large diverse sample of young adults. We evaluated characteristics of young adults with elevated short-term or long-term predicted ASCVD risk and the incidence of ASCVD associated with short-term and long-term predicted risk categories.

### High cholesterol facts… [^115unSue]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points High total cholesterol is 240 mg/dL or more. High cholesterol has no symptoms, so many people don't know that their cholesterol is too high. A simple blood test can check cholesterol levels. High total cholesterol in the United States
- Between 2017 and 2020, 10% of adults age 20 or older had total cholesterol levels above 240 mg/dL. About 17% had high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels below 40 mg/dL.
- Slightly more than half of US adults who could benefit from cholesterol medicine are currently taking it.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — risk-enhancing factors for intermediate risk indicates that knowledge of risk-enhancing factors is useful for all individuals but particularly for those at intermediate risk (ASCVD risk of 7.5% to ≤ 20%). An example cited is that a family history of premature ASCVD identified women ≥ 60 years of age with elevated hs-CRP and without ASCVD who benefited from high-intensity statin therapy, and those with primary LDL-C elevations of ≥ 160 mg/dL (≥ 4.1 mmol/L) have elevated lifetime ASCVD risk.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein (a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^112GQmEq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several clinical implications to the current findings. First, these observations apply to almost all patients in whom a lipid panel is measured because absence of circulating lipoprotein(a) is extremely rare. 28 The methodological limitations of current measures/calculations of LDL‐C particularly affect patients with elevated lipoprotein(a), because the contribution of their lipoprotein(a) mass to LDL‐C will be proportionally higher as lipoprotein(a) mass increases. Lipoprotein(a) concentration > 30 mg/dL is present in ≈35% of patients in the United States 21 and similar numbers in Europe 29, and there are ≈1.4 billion people globally with lipoprotein(a) levels > 50 mg/dL. 30

Second, our data suggest that CVD risk is imprecisely depicted by "LDL‐C". For example, an "LDL‐C" of "70 mg/dL" may represent 2 different patients: one with a lipoprotein(a) mass of 15 mg/dL, Lp(a)‐C of 5 mg/dL, and true LDL‐C of 65 mg/dL, or another with a lipoprotein(a) mass of 210 mg/dL, Lp(a)‐C of 70 mg/dL, and true LDL‐C of 0 mg/dL. Despite having identical "LDL‐C" values, these 2 individuals would be expected to have unique risk profiles (Figure 4). In a recent analysis of the Copenhagen cohorts, the HR for cardiovascular mortality was 1.18 for every 15‐mg/dL increase in Lp(a)‐C. 31 In contrast, the HR for the same outcome was only 1.07 for every 15‐mg/dL increase in LDL‐C. This finding supports a more granular understanding of the components comprising "LDL‐C" for improved risk prediction. At a population level, differential lifelong exposure to LDL‐C levels as low as 10 mg/dL results in substantial differences in CVD. This suggests that the contribution of Lp(a)‐C to CVD events, which is directly related to lipoprotein(a) mass that is genetically determined and contributes risk from birth, can be substantial, even with modest elevations of Lp(a)‐C levels. For example, lipoprotein(a) levels at upper limit of normal at 30 mg/dL may contribute as much as 9 to 13.5 mg/dL of cholesterol to the LDL‐C measurement. This value is similar to loss‐of‐function PCSK9 mutations associated with lifelong lower risk of CVD. 32

### Incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in young adults at low short-term but high long-term Risk [^11492GUM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study compared the performance of the short-term and long-term ASCVD prediction tools recommended by the 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline in a large cohort of contemporary young adults. A very low percentage of young adults were estimated to have elevated 10-year predicted ASCVD risk, and a higher percentage were estimated to have elevated 30-year predicted ASCVD risk. With the use of the 30-year risk prediction tool, 1.6% of young adults were identified as having low 10-year but elevated 30-year predicted risk. The 30-year risk prediction tool had better classification compared with the 10-year risk prediction tool in young adults. Young adults with low 10-year but elevated 30-year predicted risk had a higher incidence of ASCVD events compared with those with both low 10-year and low 30-year predicted risks. These findings suggest the potential benefit of using long-term prediction tools in addition to short-term risk estimation to identify at-risk young adults.

The 10-year risk prediction models are commonly recommended in patients aged over 40 years. This is mainly because the original PCEs were developed among adults aged 40 to 75 years who are most abundantly represented in U.S. cardiovascular disease epidemiology cohort studies, and the PCEs are recommended for only this age group. The incidence of MI and ischemic stroke hospitalization has increased among young adults in recent years. The major contributors of ASCVD risk in young adults include tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and/or diabetes. In particular, the prevalence of elevated lipid levels is high during young adulthood, and evidence suggests that elevated LDL-C during young adulthood contributes to the onset of ASCVD independently from LDL-C levels in later life. Together, these data support earlier ASCVD risk assessment, detection, and intervention of these high-risk young adults and potentially early initiation of lipid-lowering therapy in higher-risk young adults.

### Reproductive carrier screening: identifying families at risk for familial hypercholesterolemia in the United States [^113qLCrs]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Although the American Heart Association recommends all adults aged 20 years and older have cholesterol (and other risk factors) evaluated every 4 to 6 years, testing is underutilized. Moreover, there is a range of LDL-C levels associated with FH and not all adults with FH have an LDL-C level above the diagnostic cutoff of 190 mg/dL. Identification of FH, through LDL-C levels may be more difficult in older adults because there is an age-related increase and therefore greater overlap in levels for people with and without FH. Accordingly, the diagnosis of FH is typically made based on a combination of family history, clinical examination findings, and LDL-C levels with, or without, genetic testing. However, the presence of a pathogenic FH gene variant alone has also been considered sufficient to make the diagnosis of FH, irrespective of the patient's clinical features. These current testing strategies only identify ≈15% of individuals with FH and often times the diagnosis is only made once there is overt CVD, highlighting the need for a more proactive approach. It has been pointed out that while there is a need for an effective approach to screening for FH, the optimal approach has remained elusive.

### Long-term risk of cardiovascular events across a spectrum of adverse major plasma lipid combinations in the framingham heart study [^115smPiT]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Blood levels of high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high triglycerides (TG), and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) have been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The long-term comparative CVD risk associated with these 3 major lipid classes in various combinations is, however, unknown.

Methods

A total of 3,501 participants of the Framingham Offspring Study (mean age 51 ± 10 years, 56% women) without CVD at baseline were followed up for incident CVD between 1987 and 2011. Participants were grouped according to baseline lipid values into 8 distinct categories to compare the prognostic significance of values within an optimal range to Third Report of the National Cholesterol Educational Program-defined high LDL-C (> 130 mg/dL), high TG (> 150 mg/dL), and/or low HDL-C (< 40 mg/dL) in various combinations using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models.

Results

On follow-up (median 20.2 years), 724 (21%) had new-onset CVD. Adjusted for confounders and compared with the group with optimal lipid values, hazards ratios and population-attributable risks (PARs) were as follows: isolated low HDL-C, 1.93 (95% CI 1.37–2.71), PAR = 3.1%; isolated high LDL-C, 1.28 (1.03–1.59), PAR 6.4%; isolated high TG, 1.35 (0.91–1.98), PAR = 1.1% (not significant); low HDL-C and high LDL-C, 1.82 (1.33–2.49), PAR = 3.9%; low HDL-C and high TG, 1.74 (1.28–2.37), PAR = 3.9%; high LDL-C and high TG, 1.52 (1.12–2.07), PAR = 6.4%; and high LDL-C, high TG and low HDL-C 2.28 (1.73–3.02), PAR = 7.5%.

Conclusions

Aside from isolated hypertriglyceridemia, low levels of HDL-C, high levels of LDL-C, and high levels of TG in any combination were associated with increased risk of CVD.

Cholesterol

Cholesterol‐containing lipoproteins are central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Elevated total cholesterol and LDL‐C are associated with increased ASCVD risk, – and lipid‐lowering medications can reduce this risk. – Intensive lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, should be recommended as first‐line therapy for all patients.

The newest iteration of the guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol (to reduce atherosclerotic CV risk in adults) have markedly changed the approach to lipid management, identifying statins as the preferred drug class to lower LDL‐C. Randomized controlled trial data support the use of statins to reduce CV risk in 4 groups: (1) those with known ASCVD, (2) those with an LDL‐C level ≥ 190 mg/dL, (3) those aged 40 to 75 years with DM and LDL‐C 70 to 189 md/dL, and (4) those aged 40 to 75 years with LDL‐C 70 to 189 mg/dL and an estimated ASCVD 10‐year risk of ≥ 7.5% (Table 4). The new pooled cohort risk estimator weighs age quite heavily; therefore, many more adults may be considered eligible for statin therapy despite having well‐controlled risk factors. Consequently, a central component of the new guideline recommendations is to have an informed discussion with the patient about the relative benefits and risks of drug therapy before starting a statin.

Table 4.
Groups in Who Randomized Controlled Trial Evidence Demonstrated a Reduction in ASCVD With Statin Therapy

Intensity of statin therapy is chosen to match the risk of those who are most likely to benefit (Table 4). A high‐intensity statin lowers LDL‐C by ≥ 50%, and a moderate‐intensity statin lowers LDL‐C by 30% to < 50%. Recommendations for statin intensity based on indication are summarized in Table 4. In addition, appropriate periodic monitoring (every 3 to 12 months) of lipid values should be obtained to monitor adherence, adequacy of response, and safety measures, as stated in the 2013 cholesterol guidelines.

Patients with increased concentrations of LDL‐C particles, decreased HDL‐C particles, and increased triglycerides carry an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and type 2 DM. This form of atherogenic dyslipidemia can be assessed by non–HDL‐C or by measuring an apolipoprotein B level. In addition, lipoprotein(a), which is a modified form of LDL that confers atherogenic risk independent of LDL‐C, can be elevated in the absence of other lipid abnormalities.

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia is underdiagnosed and undertreated in the general population: guidance for clinicians to prevent coronary heart disease: consensus statement of the European Atherosclerosis Society [^115Z941o]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common genetic cause of premature coronary heart disease (CHD) (i.e. ischaemic heart disease), namely myocardial infarction and angina pectoris, due to lifelong elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. If left untreated, men and women with heterozygous FH (later referred to simply as FH, unless specified as heterozygous or homozygous FH) with total cholesterol levels of 8–15 mmol/L (310–580 mg/dL) typically develop CHD before age 55 and 60, respectively, while homozygotes with total cholesterol levels of 12–30 mmol/L (460–1160 mg/dL) typically develop CHD very early in life and if untreated die before age 20. However, once diagnosed, heterozygotes can readily be treated with cholesterol-lowering medication to attenuate development of atherosclerosis and to prevent CHD.

The extent of underdiagnosis and undertreatment of individuals in the general population with FH is largely unknown. It is generally believed that among whites, 1/500 are heterozygous for FH and 1/1 000 000 are homozygous; however, even these individuals are not diagnosed in most countries. Furthermore, these prevalences likely represent underestimates and as cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Indeed, many individuals and families with FH may simply be overlooked among the huge number of individuals with any CHD caused by more common risk factors, and as a consequence be underdiagnosed and undertreated for genetically elevated cholesterol levels.

The aim of the present consensus paper is to critically evaluate the extent to which FH is underdiagnosed and undertreated worldwide. Based on a consensus of the opinions of the experts in this panel and/or on small studies, retrospective studies, and registries (level of evidence C), the EAS Consensus Panel proposes recommendations on (i) how better to diagnose individuals and families with FH and (ii) therapeutic strategies for best practice aimed to prevent CHD in these extremely high-risk individuals and families. Importantly, the effect of LDL cholesterol lowering on reduction in CHD and all-cause mortality in individuals without FH is based on multiple randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses(level of evidence A). Details of the levels of evidence specifically derived from FH studies can be found elsewhere. This Consensus Statement is aimed at cardiologists, endocrinologists, internists, paediatricians, general practitioners, clinical biochemists, public health practitioners, health service planners, other health professionals, and healthcare providers worldwide.

### Effect of change in total cholesterol levels on cardiovascular disease among young adults [^11437Pne]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this nationwide cohort study, we have revealed that increased cholesterol levels and decreased cholesterol levels in young adults were associated with elevated and reduced risk of CVD, respectively. These findings were more robust in men aged > 30 years irrespective of statin medication.

While many previous studies have evaluated the association between cholesterol levels and CVD risk in young adults, 8, 9, 10, 11 there was no randomized controlled trial targeted to young adults. Although guidelines recommend high‐intensity statin treatment in adults aged > 21 years with LDL‐C ≥ 190 mg/dL, the benefits were extrapolated from results in middle and elderly participants because of the lack of studies in young adults. 23 The results from our study could add evidence that reducing cholesterol levels may be beneficial and necessary for those with high cholesterol levels to reduce CVD risk in young adults. However, our significant result was limited to men aged > 30 years, possibly because of low incidence rates in female participants in their 20s.

Participants with increased cholesterol levels were associated with higher risk of CVD compared with those in sustained low or sustained middle cholesterol groups. Furthermore, decreased cholesterol levels were associated with lower CVD risk. Although the reasons for change in cholesterol levels cannot be determined, we can assume that such decrease would be achieved mostly by statin medication or lifestyle intervention. Well‐established lifestyle management includes diet, increased physical activity, and weight control. 24, 25 However, only 10% to 42% of young adults meet the optimal physical activity levels recommended 26, 27 and the prevalence of obesity among young adults is persistently increasing not only in Korea 28 but also globally. 29 Therefore, lifestyle modification should be emphasized in those with high cholesterol levels. However, cholesterol lowering effects by lifestyle modification can decrease only 7% to 18% of cholesterol. 30 Decreased cholesterol levels to the low‐cholesterol group were associated with lower risk of CVD compared with decreased cholesterol levels to the middle‐cholesterol group from the high‐cholesterol group. Therefore, lifestyle modification alone may not be sufficient to completely benefit from reduced risk of CVD upon cholesterol level reduction.

14.3 Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease

In the Fluvastatin Capsules Intervention Prevention Study, the effect of fluvastatin capsules 40 mg administered twice daily on the risk of recurrent cardiac events (time to first occurrence of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or revascularization) was assessed in 1677 patients with CHD who had undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure (mean time from PCI to randomization = 3 days). In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were treated with dietary/lifestyle counseling and either fluvastatin capsules 40 mg (n = 844) or placebo (n = 833) given twice daily for a median of 3.9 years. The study population was 84% male, 98% Caucasian, with 37% > 65 years of age. Mean baseline lipid concentrations were: total cholesterol 201 mg/dL, LDL-C 132 mg/dL, triglycerides 70 mg/dL and HDL-C 39 mg/dL.

Fluvastatin capsules significantly reduced the risk of recurrent cardiac events (Figure 1) by 22% (p = 0.013, 181 patients in the fluvastatin capsules group vs. 222 patients in the placebo group). Revascularization procedures comprised the majority of the initial recurrent cardiac events (143 revascularization procedures in the fluvastatin capsules group and 171 in the placebo group). Consistent trends in risk reduction were observed in patients > 65 years of age.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^116VZyqu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

### Intensive LDL cholesterol-lowering treatment beyond current recommendations for the prevention of major vascular events: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials including 327 037 participants [^116CntJK]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Background

The benefits of LDL cholesterol-lowering treatment for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are well established. However, the extent to which these effects differ by baseline LDL cholesterol, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, and the presence of comorbidities remains uncertain.

Methods

We did a systematic literature search (MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from inception up to June 15, 2019) for randomised controlled trials of statins, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors with at least 1000 patient-years of follow-up. Random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regressions were done to assess for risk of major vascular events (a composite of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal ischaemic stroke, or coronary revascularisation) per 1 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol concentrations.

Findings

327037 patients from 52 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Each 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol was associated with a 19% relative risk (RR) reduction for major vascular events (RR 0.81 [95% CI 0.78–0.84]; p < 0.0001). Similar reductions (per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol) were found in trials with participants with LDL cholesterol 2.60 mmol/L or lower, 2.61–3.40 mmol/L, 3.41–4.10 mmol/L, and more than 4.1 mmol/L (p = 0.232 for interaction); and in a subgroup of patients who all had a baseline LDL cholesterol less than 2.07 mmol/L (80 mg/dL; RR 0.83 [95% CI 0.75–0.92]; p = 0.001). We found greater RR reductions in patients at lower 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk (change in RR per 10% lower 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 0.97 [95% CI 0.95–0.98]; p < 0.0001) and in patients at younger age across a mean age of 50–75 years (change in RR per 10 years younger age 0.92 [0.83–0.97]; p = 0.015). We found no difference in RR reduction for participants with or without diabetes (p = 0.878 for interaction) and chronic kidney disease (p = 0.934 for interaction).

Interpretation

For each 1 mmol/L LDL cholesterol lowering, the risk reduction of major vascular events is independent of the starting LDL cholesterol or the presence of diabetes or chronic kidney disease. Patients at lower cardiovascular risk and younger age might have a similar relative reduction in risk with LDL-cholesterol lowering therapies and future studies should investigate the potential benefits of earlier intervention.

Managing risk related to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is vital in therapy for patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events given its important etiologic role in atherogenesis. Despite decades of research showing reduction of ASCVD risk with multiple approaches to lowering of LDL cholesterol, there continue to be significant gaps in care with inadequate numbers of patients receiving standard of care lipid-lowering therapy. Confusion regarding implementation of the multiple published clinical practice guidelines has been identified as one contributor to suboptimal management of LDL-related risk. This review summarizes the current guidelines for reduction of LDL-related cardiovascular risk provided by a number of major professional societies, which have broad applicability to diverse populations worldwide. Statements have varied in the process and methodology of development of recommendations, the grading system for level and strength of evidence, the inclusion or exclusion of expert opinion, the suggested ASCVD risk assessment tool, the lipoproteins recommended for risk assessment, and the lipoprotein targets of therapy. The similarities and differences among important guidelines in the United States and internationally are discussed, with recommendations for future strategies to improve consistency in approaches to LDL-related ASCVD risk and to reduce gaps in implementation of evidence-based therapies.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines [^1125gyqo]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Appendix 5 — Evidence statements for CQ2: For long-term and lifetime atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment, we found no evidence assessing variations in long-term or lifetime risk of CVD outcomes among persons at low or intermediate short-term risk in racial/ethnic groups other than non-Hispanic whites in the United States and Europe. ASCVD risk factors measured in young and middle-aged adults, considered singly or jointly, generally are associated with short-term, long-term, and lifetime risk of ASCVD, with Strength of Evidence: Low (for diabetes and metabolic syndrome) to Moderate (for BMI, cholesterol, systolic BP, and smoking). Multivariable short-term (10-year) CHD risk prediction models underestimate absolute lifetime risk of CHD but may stratify relative lifetime risk of CHD in women and older men (Strength of Evidence: Low), and CHD is defined as all manifestations of CHD, or as CHD death/nonfatal MI. Long-term (30-year) risk equations based on traditional ASCVD risk factors provide more accurate prediction of long-term ASCVD risk than do extrapolations of short-term (10-year) risk equations among individuals 20–59 years of age who are free from ASCVD (Strength of Evidence: Low), with risk factors including age, sex, total cholesterol, HDL-C, systolic BP; use of antihypertensive therapy, diabetes, and current smoking. Long-term (≥ 15 years) risk prediction models based on selected traditional ASCVD risk factors predict CHD death with good discrimination and calibration, and better in women than men, in US non-Hispanic white populations (Strength of Evidence: Low), using age, sex, total cholesterol, systolic BP, diabetes, and smoking. Measuring and updating ASCVD risk factors every 4–6 years improves short- and long-term risk prediction (Strength of Evidence: Moderate).

Drug therapy is needed only in selected patients with moderately high LDL-C (≥ 160 mg/dL [≥ 4.1 mmol/L]) or very high LDL-C (190 mg/dL [4.9 mmol/L]).

### Incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in young adults at low short-term but high long-term Risk [^11189EYk]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Young adults enrolled in a large integrated U.S. health care system with either high short-term or low short-term but elevated long-term predicted risk had higher incidence of ASCVD events compared with those with both low short-term and long-term predicted risk, suggesting that current risk assessment practices miss the opportunity to identify young adults eligible for preventive measures. Further practical clinical research is needed to test the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of implementing risk assessment tools in young adult patients. For the time being, using the 30-year risk prediction tool to identify additional at-risk young adults for lipid-lowering therapy and ASCVD prevention may be important.

### Twenty-five year secular trends in lipids and modifiable risk factors in a population-based biracial cohort: the coronary artery risk development in young adults (CARDIA) study, 1985–2011 [^112oPP5m]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Elevated levels of total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐c), and triglycerides and low levels of high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐c) have been linked with cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in numerous population‐based and clinical studies. 1, 2, 3, 4 Individuals with elevated lipid values have high relative risk of future cardiovascular events and often benefit from antihyperlipidemic medication therapy. Individuals with only mildly elevated lipid levels have lower relative risks, but comprise the majority of abnormal values; these individuals may respond to lifestyle modification and therefore offer opportunities for primary prevention.

Secular trend data based on serial cross‐sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) have suggested that total and LDL‐c levels have declined in most race/ethnic and sex groups over the past 20 years. 5 These favorable trends in total and LDL‐c have been replicated in many Western countries during the same time period, whereas trends in HDL‐c and triglycerides have exhibited less‐consistent patterns. A recent report by Carroll et al. 6 extending NHANES data through 2010, suggests that favorable trends continue among most subgroups, regardless of lipid‐lowering medication status. Other serial cross‐sectional data suggest that the favorable secular trends have either flattened out or are reversing. 7, 8, 9

However, longitudinal data, as opposed to serial cross‐sectional data, allow for a better understanding of the effects of both time and aging while accounting for changes in potential correlates, such as obesity on lipid profiles. Given the strong association of adverse lipid levels with cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, we used data from the community‐based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study to examine secular and aging trends in total cholesterol, LDL‐c, HDL‐c, and triglycerides over 25 years of follow‐up in a fixed biracial cohort of men and women who were 18 to 30 years old at baseline. We also assessed whether the observed lipid trends were confounded by modifiable risk factors — body mass index (BMI), physical activity, ethanol consumption, and smoking — after controlling for age, education, and study center. Our goal was to identify risk factors that may have attenuated observed favorable lipid trends or contributed to adverse lipid trends in a cohort that has moved from young adulthood to middle age during the obesity epidemic.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines [^112S3Bgq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA cardiovascular risk assessment — Table 8 describes estimating an individual's 10-year risk of incident hard atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) using race-sex group–specific coefficients and a worked example. The example profile assumes an individual 55 years of age (for which the Ln[Age] = 4.01), with a total cholesterol of 213 mg/dL, HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) of 50 mg/dL, and an untreated systolic BP (blood pressure) of 120 mm Hg who is not a current smoker and does not have diabetes. The calculation is performed in steps: the natural log (Ln) of age, total cholesterol, HDL-C, and systolic BP is calculated; appropriate interaction terms are derived (for example, Ln[Age]×Ln[Total Cholesterol]); the resulting values are multiplied by coefficients from the equation for the specific race-sex group to yield "Coefficient × Value" terms that are summed as an "Individual Sum". The estimated risk is formally calculated as "1 minus the survival rate at 10 years ("Baseline Survival" in Table A), raised to the power of the exponent of the "Coefficient × Value" sum minus the race- and sex-specific overall mean "Coefficient × Value" sum", and the white men example equates to a 5.3% probability of a first hard ASCVD event within 10 years.

### Risks of incident cardiovascular disease associated with concomitant elevations in lipoprotein (a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-the framingham heart study [^112s1Lqd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background Elevated lipoprotein(a) is a well-established risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease but is not measured in routine clinical care. Screening of high lipoprotein(a) in individuals with moderate elevations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) may identify individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Methods and Results We examined 2606 Framingham Offspring participants (median age, 54 years; 45% men) prospectively with a median follow-up of 15 years (n = 392 incident cardiovascular events). Individuals with higher (≥ 100 nmol/L) versus lower lipoprotein(a) were divided into groups based on LDL-C < 135 mg/dL versus ≥ 135 mg/dL. In Cox models, after adjustment for known risk factors, high lipoprotein(a) (≥ 100 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL were each significant predictors of cardiovascular disease (LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL: hazard ratio [HR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09–1.64; P = 0.006; high lipoprotein (a): HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03–1.66; P = 0.026). Across the groups of high/low lipoprotein (a) and LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL or < 135 mg/dL, the absolute cardiovascular disease risks at 15 years were 22.6% (high lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, n = 248), 17.3% (low lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, n = 758), 12.7% (high lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C < 135 mg/dL, n = 275) and 11.5% (low lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C < 135 mg/dL, n = 1328, reference group). Among individuals with LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, those with high lipoprotein(a) had a 43% higher risk (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05–1.97; P = 0.02). Presence of high lipoprotein(a) with moderate LDL-C levels (135–159 mg/dL) yielded absolute risks equivalent to those with LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL (23.5%, 95% CI, 17.4%-31.3%; and 20.7%, 95% CI, 16.8%-25.3%, respectively). Conclusions Concomitant elevation of LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL and lipoprotein(a) ≥ 100 nmol/L is associated with a high absolute risk of incident cardiovascular disease. lipoprotein(a) measurement in individuals with moderate elevations in LDL-C, who do not otherwise meet criteria for statins, may identify individuals at high cardiovascular risk.

### Nonoptimal lipids commonly present in young adults and coronary calcium later in life: the CARDIA (coronary artery risk development in young adults) study [^111seh9d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Dyslipidemia causes coronary heart disease in middle-aged and elderly adults, but the consequences of lipid exposure during young adulthood are unclear.

Objective

To assess whether nonoptimal lipid levels during young adulthood cause atherosclerotic changes that persist into middle age.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

4 cities in the United States.

Participants

3258 participants from the 5115 black and white men and women recruited at age 18 to 30 years in 1985 to 1986 for the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study.

Measurements

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and coronary calcium. Time-averaged cumulative exposures to lipids between age 20 and 35 years were estimated by using repeated serum lipid measurements over 20 years in the CARDIA study; these measurements were then related to coronary calcium scores assessed later in life (45 years [SD, 4]).

Results

2824 participants (87%) had nonoptimal levels of LDL cholesterol (≥ 2.59 mmol/L [≥ 100 mg/dL]), HDL cholesterol (< 1.55 mmol/L [< 60 mg/dL]), or triglycerides (≥ 1.70 mmol/L [≥ 150 mg/dL]) during young adulthood. Coronary calcium prevalence 2 decades later was 8% in participants who maintained optimal LDL levels (< 1.81 mmol/L [< 70 mg/dL]), and 44% in participants with LDL cholesterol levels of 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) or greater (P < 0.001). The association was similar across race and sex and strongly graded, with odds ratios for coronary calcium of 1.5 (95% CI, 0.7 to 3.3) for LDL cholesterol levels of 1.81 to 2.56 mmol/L (70 to 99 mg/dL), 2.4 (CI, 1.1 to 5.3) for levels of 2.59 to 3.34 mmol/L (100 to 129 mg/dL), 3.3 (CI, 1.3 to 7.8) for levels of 3.37 to 4.12 mmol/L (130 to 159 mg/dL), and 5.6 (CI, 2.0 to 16) for levels of 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) or greater, compared with levels less than 1.81 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL), after adjustment for lipid exposure after age 35 years and other coronary risk factors. Both LDL and HDL cholesterol levels were independently associated with coronary calcium after participants who were receiving lipid-lowering medications or had clinically abnormal lipid levels were excluded.

Limitation

Coronary calcium, although a strong predictor of future coronary heart disease, is not a clinical outcome.

Conclusion

Nonoptimal levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol during young adulthood are independently associated with coronary atherosclerosis 2 decades later.

Primary Funding Source

### Comparison of recommended eligibility for primary prevention statin therapy based on the US preventive services task force recommendations vs the ACC / AHA guidelines [^115pJVLU]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

There are important differences among guideline recommendations for using statin therapy in primary prevention. New recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) emphasize therapy based on the presence of 1 or more cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and a 10-year global CVD risk of 10% or greater.

Objective

To determine the difference in eligibility for primary prevention statin treatment among US adults, assuming full application of USPSTF recommendations compared with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines.

Design, Setting, and Participants

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (2009–2014) were used to assess statin eligibility under the 2016 USPSTF recommendations vs the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines among a nationally representative sample of 3416 US adults aged 40 to 75 years with fasting lipid data and triglyceride levels of 400 mg/dL or less, without prior CVD.

Exposures

The 2016 USPSTF recommendations vs 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Eligibility for primary prevention statin therapy.

Results

Among the US primary prevention population represented by 3416 individuals in NHANES, the median weighted age was 53 years (interquartile range, 46–61), and 53% (95% CI, 52%-55%) were women. Along with the 21.5% (95% CI, 19.3%-23.7%) of patients who reported currently taking lipid-lowering medication, full implementation of the USPSTF recommendations would be associated with initiation of statin therapy in an additional 15.8% (95% CI, 14.0%-17.5%) of patients, compared with an additional 24.3% (95% CI, 22.3%-26.3%) of patients who would be recommended for statin initiation under full implementation of the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines. Among the 8.9% of individuals in the primary prevention population who would be recommended for statins by ACC/AHA guidelines but not by USPSTF recommendations, 55% would be adults aged 40 to 59 years with a mean 30-year cardiovascular risk greater than 30%, and 28% would have diabetes.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this sample of US adults from 2009–2014, adherence to the 2016 USPSTF recommendations for statin therapy, compared with the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines, could lead to a lower number of individuals recommended for primary prevention statin therapy, including many younger adults with high mean long-term CVD risk.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

AHA/ACC 2018 cholesterol guideline — primary prevention pharmacotherapy for adults 40 to 75 years with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL states that in intermediate-risk adults who would benefit from more aggressive LDL-C lowering and in whom high-intensity statins are advisable but not acceptable or tolerated, it may be reasonable to add a nonstatin drug (ezetimibe or bile acid sequestrant) to a moderate-intensity statin, and that in patients at borderline risk, in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Assessment of cardiovascular risk — recommendations for adults. For adults 40 to 75 years of age, clinicians should routinely assess traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calculate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by using the pooled cohort equations (PCE). For adults 20 to 39 years of age, it is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors at least every 4 to 6 years. In adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) or intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), it is reasonable to use additional risk-enhancing factors to guide decisions about preventive interventions (e.g., statin therapy). In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) or selected adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), if risk-based decisions for preventive interventions remain uncertain, it is reasonable to measure a coronary artery calcium score to guide clinician–patient risk discussion. For adults 20 to 39 years of age and for those 40 to 59 years of age who have < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk, estimating lifetime or 30-year ASCVD risk may be considered.

### Dyslipidemia [^111mwmAv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dyslipidemia:

- **Definition**: Dyslipidemia is a disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol, decreased HDL cholesterol and/or increased triglycerides, which contributes to the development of atherosclerosis.
- **Pathophysiology**: Primary dyslipidemia is due to genetic abnormalities, whereas secondary dyslipidemia is multifactorial, and is associated with obesity, physical inactivity, high-carbohydrate and high-fat diets, smoking, alcohol use, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, renal failure, cholestatic liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, and various drugs (corticosteroids, progestogens, androgenic steroids, thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, oral estrogens, retinoic acid derivatives).
- Epidemiology: In the US, an estimated 53% of adults have at least one lipid abnormality: 27% have elevated LDL cholesterol, 23% have decreased HDL cholesterol, and 30% have increased triglycerides.
- **Disease course**: Lipid abnormalities contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque, leading to an increased risk of CVD, stroke, and PAD.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Treatment with statins is associated with a relative reduction in the risk of major adverse vascular events of 22% in men and 16% in women for every 1.0 mmol/L (38.6 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol.

### Effect of change in total cholesterol levels on cardiovascular disease among young adults [^111pBayv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality has gradually decreased in developed countries because of therapeutic advances, CVD mortality nonetheless accounts for one‐thirds of all deaths in adults aged ≥ 35 years. 1 One of the major risk factors for CVD is dyslipidemia, which precipitates atherosclerotic change in vessels. 2 In this context, strategies for lowering cholesterol, such as statins have shown to reduce cardiovascular events in meta‐analysis. 3, 4 However, most studies have focused on middle‐aged or elderly participants. In 2016, the United States Preventive Services Task Force stated that direct evidence on the benefits and harms of screening or treatment of dyslipidemia in young adults aged 21 to 39 years old remains insufficient. 5

The prevalence of dyslipidemia in young adults is relatively high, with estimations ranging from 12.0% to 13.0%. 6, 7 Furthermore, several studies have reported that high serum cholesterol in young adults is associated with cardiovascular events in the future. 8, 9, 10, 11 In CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study for young people aged 18 to 30 years, the risk for coronary calcium, a strong predictor of future coronary heart disease, was elevated for those with low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) levels of more than 160 mg/dL compared with those with LDL levels of < 70 mg/mL. 8 In a prospective study of 1071 young male medical students with a mean age of 22 years, higher total cholesterol at baseline was associated with increased risk of CVD. 11 Young men in 3 large cohorts demonstrated that those with total cholesterol levels < 200 mg/dL had longer estimated life expectancy. 10 Although many previous studies have evaluated the effect of baseline cholesterol to CVD risk or mortality, the population size was small and limited to men. 10, 11 In addition, most studies did not evaluate the association between change in cholesterol levels and CVD outcomes.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between change in cholesterol among young adults and cardiovascular events using a nationwide claims database.

### The 2018 AHA / ACC / multi-society cholesterol guidelines: looking at past, present and future [^111tz2gY]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The authors review more than three decades of progress in providing clinicians and patients with guidance on risk assessment, patient evaluation and cholesterol management. Beginning with the National Cholesterol Education Program's Initial Adult Treatment Panel report, the cholesterol guidelines increasingly reflect the progress made in understanding the benefits of improved lifestyle and nutrition to improve lipid profiles, major risk factors and reduce ASCVD risk. Moreover, they now provide qualitative and quantitative assessment tools to guide appropriate risk reduction LDL-C lowering therapy. Use of the Pooled Cohort Equations to determine Low, Borderline, Intermediate and High 10-year ASCVD risk is now joined by recognition of conditions and biomarkers that enhance ASCVD risk. This personalizes the risk discussion for the patient. An important addition is the selective use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring to reclassify risk in patients at borderline or intermediate risk, but for whom a risk decision regarding statin therapy is uncertain. In secondary prevention, current guidelines provide criteria for determining a "very high" risk group in whom risk is especially high and in whom aggressive LDL-C lowering can be shown to provide increased absolute benefit. Current guidelines provide a comprehensive look at children and adolescents, young adults, elderly, women and issues specific to women through the life course. They provide guidance for those adults at risk due to severe hypercholesterolemia, persistent hypertriglyceridemia after secondary causes have been addressed, those with inflammatory disorders and HIV, those adults with chronic kidney disease, and those affected by issues of race/ethnicity. They conclude with a brief summary of recommendations emphasizing important concepts for providing safety with LDL-C lowering therapy. This combination of best external evidence and clinical expertise from the expert panel should provide a solid foundation for lipid management of patients at risk for or with clinical ASCVD.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Young adults (20 to 39 years of age) — familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), thresholds, and risk assessment are outlined. FH often goes undiagnosed, and young adults with primary elevations of LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dl have a long-term ASCVD burden, and statin therapy is recommended; cascade screening often identifies other family members with elevated LDL-C. A smaller group at higher risk are young adults with persistent, moderate hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C 160–189 mg/dL), especially when risk-enhancing factors such as a family history of premature ASCVD are present, and young adults who experience prolonged exposure to hyperlipidemia prior to age 55 are shown to have significantly increased risk of coronary heart disease. In young adults without phenotypically severe hypercholesterolemia, risk assessment should begin by estimation of lifetime risk, and the pooled cohort equations (PCE) can be used to estimate lifetime risk starting at age 21 years; when young adults with hypercholesterolemia or multiple risk factors are identified, lifestyle intervention is indicated. One approach to identifying young adults who could benefit from statins or drug combination is to detect significant coronary atherosclerosis with coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores, but absence of RCT data precludes guideline recommendations at this time.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: paradigm shifts in managing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk [^1178PAur]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults represents a major shift from prior cholesterol management guidelines. The new guidelines include data from individual randomized trials as well as the most comprehensive meta-analyses, and introduce several major paradigm shifts, which include: aiming for ASCVD risk reduction as opposed to targeting LDL-C levels, advocating for the use of evidence-based doses of statins as first line therapy, and utilizing a new risk calculator and risk cut point to guide initiation of statin therapy. These major changes have created controversy and confusion among the medical community, with some clinicians hesitant to embrace the shift. We review the evidence that forms the basis for these major changes, compare them to other major lipid guidelines, and recommend an integrated approach to managing dyslipidemia to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

Implementation of risk assessment work group recommendations — algorithm for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD): Begin by asking, "Does the patient have existing clinical ASCVD?" If yes, "See 2011 AHA/ACC Secondary Prevention Guideline (55) and 2013 Adult Prevention Guidelines: Blood Cholesterol (44), Obesity (54), Lifestyle Management (56)". If no, determine age: "Is the patient < 20 or > 79 y of age?" If yes, "See 2012 NHLBI Pediatric CV Risk Reduction Guidelines (53) and 2013 Adult Prevention Guidelines: Blood Cholesterol (44), Obesity (54), Lifestyle Management (56)". If age is 20–79 y, "Assess traditional risk factors every 4–6 y in patients 20–79 y of age; estimate 10-y risk in those 40–79 y of age using Pooled Cohort Equations". Then classify risk: "Elevated 10-y risk (≥ 7.5%)" leads to "Communicate risk data and refer to 2013 Adult Prevention Guidelines: Blood Cholesterol (44), Obesity (54), Lifestyle Management (56)", whereas "Low 10-y risk (< 7.5%)" leads to "Assess 30-y or lifetime risk in those 20–59 y of age; communicate risk data regardless of age and refer to AHA/ACC Lifestyle Guideline (56)".

### Incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in young adults at low short-term but high long-term Risk [^116cs8qD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The present study found that both 30-year and lifetime ASCVD risk prediction tools discriminate a group of young adults with elevated observed ASCVD events. However, the lifetime risk prediction tool identified that more than 40% of additional young adults had low 10-year but elevated lifetime risk while only 1.6% of additional young adults had low 10-year but elevated 30-year risk. This large discrepancy may be because the 30-year risk model predicts risk on a continuous scale whereas each individual is assigned into 1 of the 5 possible risk categories in the lifetime risk model. In the present analysis, all young adults with ≥ 1 elevated risk factor were categorized as having elevated predicted lifetime risk, representing about 41% of the study population. These percentages are similar to earlier findings. For example, Marma et alreported that 59.2% to 65.6% of men aged 20 to 39 years, and 43.0% to 55.2% of women aged 20 to 39 years had low 10-year but elevated lifetime ASCVD risk according to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. From this analysis, the prevalence of young adults with elevated 10-year predicted risk was estimated to be between 0.4% to 2.4% depending on age group (20–29 years or 30–39 years) and sex. The present study findings suggest that incorporating the 30-year ASCVD risk prediction tool into clinical practice would be translated into a lower number needed to treat to avoid 1 ASCVD event compared with the lifetime risk prediction model. Given that the eventual goal of applying these tools is to identify at-risk young adults for intervention, the 30-year risk prediction tool may be better than the lifetime risk prediction tool. A comprehensive approach to ASCVD prevention, including lipid-lowering therapy, tobacco cessation, and treatment for hypertension and diabetes, may be needed.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines [^113v5WT4]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk (ASCVD) risk score" for dyslipidemia, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2 and tobacco use.

The ASCVD calculator estimates the 10-year risk of heart attack or stroke in adults aged 40–79 based on factors like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking. It follows ACC/AHA guidelines to aid decisions on preventive measures, including statin use.

The Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk (ASCVD) risk score estimator is a tool designed to assess the 10-year risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for individuals between the ages of 40 and 79. It considers a variety of personal health inputs including age, gender, race, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking status, diabetes status, and whether the individual is undergoing blood pressure treatment.

Inputs for the ASCVD calculator include:

- Age in years
- **Gender**: categorized as Male or Female
- **Race**: either African American or Other
- Total Cholesterol, measured in mg/dL or mmol/L
- HDL Cholesterol, measured in mg/dL or mmol/L
- Systolic Blood Pressure, measured in mmHg or kPa
- **Smoking status**: Yes or No
- **Diabetes status**: Yes or No
- **Blood Pressure Treatment status**: Yes or No

Here's how the ASCVD calculation unfolds:

1. **Unit Conversion**:
- If the cholesterol levels are given in mmol/L, they're multiplied by 38.67 to convert to mg/dL.
- If the systolic blood pressure is in kPa, it is converted to mmHg by multiplying by 7.50062.

2. **Selection of Coefficients**:
- Coefficients specific to the individual's race and gender form the basis of the calculations. These include distinctive values related to age, cholesterol levels, HDL levels, and systolic blood pressure, as well as the statuses of smoking and diabetes.

3. **Logarithmic Transformation**:
- Intermediate values are calculated using logarithmic functions for age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure.

4. **Risk Score Calculation**:
- The calculator amalgamates various terms, including age-related factors, cholesterol and HDL contributions, systolic blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and medication treatment, to derive a holistic score. This score is derived by combining the selected coefficients with the intermediate logarithmic values.

5. **Conversion to Risk Percentage**:
- Using race- and gender-specific constants, the intermediate risk score is translated into a percentage risk value. This is achieved by adjusting the score and converting it to a percentage of 100 using exponential functions.

6. **Risk Interpretation**:
- The calculated risk percentage is categorized into one of four distinct risk levels:

- **Low risk**: Less than 5%
- **Borderline risk**: Between 5% and 7.5%
- **Intermediate risk**: Between 7.5% and 20%
- **High risk**: 20% or more

The result of this calculation is a comprehensive output detailing the risk percentage and its corresponding risk category. This information is crucial for individuals and healthcare providers aiming to tailor preventive practices and interventions based on the assessed cardiovascular risk.

### Managing atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in young adults: JACC state-of-the-art review [^114pdYeU]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

There is a need to identify high-risk features that predict early-onset atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The authors provide insights to help clinicians identify and address high-risk conditions in the 20- to 39-year age range (young adults). These include tobacco use, elevated blood pressure/hypertension, family history of premature ASCVD, primary severe hypercholesterolemia such as familial hypercholesterolemia, diabetes with diabetes-specific risk-enhancing factors, or the presence of multiple other risk-enhancing factors, including in females, a history of pre-eclampsia or menopause under age 40. The authors update current thinking on lipid risk factors such as triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, or lipoprotein (a) that are useful in understanding an individual's long-term ASCVD risk. The authors review emerging strategies, such as coronary artery calcium and polygenic risk scores in this age group, that have potential clinical utility, but whose best use remains uncertain. Finally, the authors discuss both the obstacles and opportunities for addressing prevention in early adulthood.

ACC/AHA 2013 long-term atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment — It is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors every 4 to 6 years in adults 20 to 79 years of age who are free from ASCVD and to estimate 10-year ASCVD risk every 4 to 6 years in adults 40 to 79 years of age who are free from ASCVD (NHLBI Grade: B [Moderate]; ACC/AHA COR: IIa, LOE: B). Assessment of 30-year or lifetime ASCVD risk on the basis of traditional risk factors may be considered in adults 20 to 59 years of age who are free from ASCVD and are not at high short-term risk (NHLBI Grade: C [Weak]; ACC/AHA COR: IIb, LOE: C). Evidence notes that lifetime risk assessment did not guide pharmacological therapy decisions and was judged more appropriate to motivate lifestyle change in younger individuals, with age 20 years as the starting point for long-term risk assessment and age 40 years as the threshold for short-term 10-year ASCVD risk assessment; long-term or lifetime estimation may be less valuable in those at high short-term (10-year) risk. A Web-based application enabling estimation of 10-year and lifetime risk of ASCVD is available at the cited URLs.

### Prevention of cardiovascular disease: highlights for the clinician of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines [^113e2uhq]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Prevention of cardiovascular disease, undoubtedly an emphasis of clinical care in 2014, will provide both opportunities and challenges to patients and their healthcare providers. The recently-released ACC/AHA guidelines on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of overweight and obesity, and treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, have introduced new concepts and revised prior conventional strategies. New to risk assessment are the Pooled Cohort Equations, targeting the expanded concept of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and focusing not solely on mortality but as well on major nonfatal events. The lifestyle management focuses on diet and physical activity for lipid and blood pressure control. The cholesterol guideline identifies four high-risk groups with the greatest benefits from statin therapy: preexisting ASCVD, primary LDL-C elevations ≥ 190 mm/dl, those 45–75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70–189 mm/dl without clinical ASCVD, and those 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD with an LDL-C 70–189 mg/dl with a 7.5% or greater 10-year ASCVD risk. Eliminated are arbitrary LDL-C treatment targets, with individual patient risk status guiding who should take statins and the appropriate intensity of statin drugs. Patient-physician discussions of individual benefits and risks are paramount. Management of high blood pressure remains controversial, with two different expert panels offering varying treatment targets; there is general agreement on a < 140/90 mmHg goal, but substantial disagreement on blood pressure targets for older adults. Clinicians and their patients deserve a well-researched concensus document.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

### Fluvastatin sodium (Lescol XL) [^115iB3tT]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

LDL-C = Total-C - HDL-C - 1/5 TG

For TG levels > 400 mg/dL (> 4.5 mmol/L), this equation is less
accurate and LDL-C concentrations should be determined by ultracentrifugation.
In many hypertriglyceridemic patients LDL-C may be low or normal despite
elevated Total-C. In such cases, Lescol is not indicated.

Lipid determinations should be performed at intervals of no less than 4
weeks and dosage adjusted according to the patient's response to therapy.

The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Treatment Guidelines
are summarized below:

†CHD, coronary heart disease

††Some authorities recommend use of
LDL-lowering drugs in this category if an LDL-C level of < 100mg/dL cannot be
achieved by therapeutic lifestyle changes. Others prefer use of drugs that
primarily modify triglycerides and HDL-C, e.g., nicotinic acid or fibrate. Clinical judgement
also may call for deferring drug therapy in this subcategory.

†††Almost all people with 0–1 risk
factor have 10-year risk < 10%; thus, 10-year risk assessment in people with
0–1 risk factor is not necessary.

After the LDL-C goal has been achieved, if the TG is still > 200 mg/dL,
non-HDL-C (Total-C minus HDL-C) becomes a secondary target of therapy. Non-HDL-C
goals are set 30 mg/dL higher than LDL-C goals for each risk category.

Carotid atherosclerosis — lipid management and statins: In patients with known coronary or other atherosclerosis, the risk of stroke decreased by > 15% for every 10% reduction in serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and other analyses showed that statin therapy reduces the risk of stroke by 15% to 30%, with atorvastatin reducing stroke rate by 16% over 5 years after a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). In an analysis of a large (> 9200) series, elevation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was associated with a reduction of stroke risk by a factor of 0.86, whereas an elevated total cholesterol/HDL ratio increased stroke risk by a factor of 1.22. Statin agents are recommended, targeting LDL of 100 mg/ dL for those with coronary heart disease or symptomatic atherosclerotic disease and LDL of 70 mg/dL for very high-risk persons with multiple risk factors.

RESULTS

Baseline Characteristics

Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of study participants. Median age was 54 years (SD, 10 years), and 55% were women. The mean LDL‐C in our sample was 126.6 mg/dL and the mean lipoprotein(a) was 51.9 nmol/L (SD, 70.4 nmol/L). During a median follow‐up period of 15 years, 394 individuals experienced a first CVD event.

Baseline Characteristics Based on the Groups (N = 2606)

Relative Risks of CVD Attributable to High Lipoprotein(a) or High LDL‐C

Table 2 summarizes the hazard ratios (HR) associated with each of the known risk factors for CVD. Compared with participants with lower lipoprotein(a) levels, those with higher plasma levels had significantly increased cardiovascular risk after adjustments for other known risk factors including high LDL‐C (lipoprotein[a] ≥ 100 nmol/L, HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03–1.66; P = 0.026; LDL‐C ≥ 135 mg/dL, HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09–1.64; P = 0.006). Multiplicative interactions between lipoprotein(a) and LDL‐C were nonsignificant but had limited statistical power. Results were similar and remained significant after we corrected for the cholesterol content carried by lipoprotein(a) (see Table S1).

Dietary cholesterol — magnitude of lipid changes per 100 mg/day — shows small average increases in circulating cholesterol. An increase of 100 mg/day in dietary cholesterol was reported to increase total-C approximately 2 to 3 mg/dL. Weggemans et al. predicted that an addition of 100 mg/day increases total-C by 2.17 mg/dL, LDL-C by 1.93 mg/dL, and HDL-C by 0.31 mg/dL, producing a total-C:HDL-C ratio increase of 0.02, based on 17 studies involving 556 subjects with diets differing only in cholesterol or egg yolks over at least 14 days.
