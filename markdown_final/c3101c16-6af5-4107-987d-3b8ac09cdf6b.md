## Question

Cold agglutinin disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cold agglutinin disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease definition and pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and clinical manifestations. Next, I will review diagnostic criteria and pitfalls, followed by a careful, stepwise management algorithm. After that, I need to examine special populations and emergency scenarios. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-based approach and highlight controversies and future directions, making sure I double-check each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and pathophysiology. Cold agglutinin disease is a primary, clonal B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by monoclonal IgM autoantibodies that bind red blood cell surface antigens at temperatures below 37°C, most commonly the I antigen, and drive classical complement pathway activation with predominantly extravascular hemolysis in the liver, although terminal complement activation with intravascular hemolysis can occur in severe disease or exacerbations [^112mMX9d] [^112Wzecv] [^111JYM7U]. Wait, let me verify the clonal nature claim; yes, contemporary series and reviews consistently show a clonal marrow process in primary CAD, distinguishing it from secondary cold agglutinin syndrome, which is transient and linked to infection or malignancy [^112mMX9d] [^112Wzecv].

> I should confirm the epidemiology next. Prevalence estimates from population-based data in Northern Europe are around 16 per million with an incidence of about 1 per million per year, and there is a notable latitude gradient with higher prevalence in colder climates, which aligns with the thermal biology of cold agglutinins [^115DaNxH] [^115ERk2N]. Hold on, I should verify the age distribution; median age at onset is typically in the seventh decade, with a female predominance in many cohorts, consistent with the broader autoimmune hemolytic anemia landscape [^115DaNxH] [^112mMX9d].

> Next, I will examine the clinical phenotype. Patients often have chronic hemolytic anemia with fatigue, dyspnea, and jaundice, and cold-induced circulatory symptoms such as acrocyanosis and Raynaud phenomenon are common, reflecting non–complement-mediated agglutination in cooler peripheral tissues [^112mMX9d] [^112nvZ4Z]. I need to check for exacerbating factors; febrile illnesses frequently trigger hemolytic flares, and there is an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, which may relate to complement activation and endothelial injury, so I should keep thromboprophylaxis in mind in high-risk settings [^115DaNxH] [^112mMX9d].

> Now, I will review the diagnostic criteria and laboratory approach. The direct antiglobulin test is typically positive for C3d and negative or weakly positive for IgG, reflecting complement coating without significant warm IgG autoantibodies, and a cold agglutinin titer of at least 64 at 4°C is generally required, with thermal amplitude testing helping define pathogenicity when activity extends to 28–30°C or higher [^112mMX9d] [^112Wzecv]. Wait, let me verify specimen handling; yes, samples must be kept at 37°C during processing to avoid spurious agglutination, and bone marrow evaluation with flow cytometry often reveals a clonal B-cell process even when overt lymphoma is not diagnosed clinically [^114gxBYE] [^112mMX9d]. I should also confirm that a comprehensive workup excludes secondary causes like Mycoplasma pneumoniae or overt lymphoma, which would reclassify the case as cold agglutinin syndrome rather than primary CAD [^112mMX9d] [^113vQaZu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about therapy before establishing indications. Treatment is indicated for symptomatic anemia, significant fatigue, or disabling circulatory symptoms; mild disease may be managed conservatively with cold avoidance alone, and I need to ensure I do not over-treat asymptomatic patients [^112mMX9d] [^1138XbQ9]. I should double-check the universal contraindication: corticosteroids are ineffective in CAD and should not be used, which is a critical distinction from warm AIHA management [^112mMX9d] [^1138XbQ9].

> For first-line therapy, let me consider B-cell–directed approaches. Rituximab monotherapy produces responses in roughly 45–60% with a median time to response around 1.5 months and median duration near 11 months; retreatment is often effective at relapse, but durability is limited by long-lived plasma cells [^112ARoD6] [^1138XbQ9]. Wait, I should verify combination strategies; rituximab plus bendamustine achieves higher and more durable responses, with approximately 78% overall response and about 53% complete responses in observational cohorts, and median response duration exceeding five years in some series, albeit with chemotherapy-related toxicity that must be balanced against benefit in older adults [^115ERk2N] [^1138XbQ9]. Rituximab plus fludarabine is also highly effective but carries greater long-term toxicity and is generally reserved for selected fit patients or as second-line after rituximab failure [^114e7tgX] [^1138XbQ9].

> Next, I should review complement inhibition. Sutimlimab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits C1s, rapidly halts classical pathway activity, increases hemoglobin by a mean of about 2.6 g/dL within weeks, normalizes bilirubin, and reduces transfusion needs in phase 3 trials; responses are sustained with continued therapy but reverse after discontinuation, underscoring the need for ongoing treatment unless a clone-directed remission is achieved [^111jy6Q5] [^1139ZsFz] [^112i7RWk]. I need to ensure I note limitations; sutimlimab does not treat the underlying clonal disease and does not improve cold-induced circulatory symptoms, and cost-effectiveness analyses suggest very high incremental costs that may limit access in some settings [^114UPYKg] [^113c8cxQ]. But wait, what if rapid control is needed in an acute crisis; eculizumab can reduce intravascular hemolysis and transfusion requirements but yields only modest hemoglobin gains and does not address extravascular hemolysis, so it is best reserved for acute settings or as a bridge rather than chronic CAD therapy [^111SSWEJ] [^1138XbQ9].

> I will now examine emerging and investigational options. Daratumumab has retrospective signals of benefit in refractory CAD, potentially via depletion of long-lived plasma cells and modulation of autoantibody production, but prospective data are needed before routine use [^113Jy32V] [^114Gzqrn]. Riliprubart, a second-generation C1s inhibitor, has shown rapid and sustained improvements in hemolysis and anemia in early-phase studies, suggesting a class effect and offering a potential alternative to sutimlimab pending regulatory review [^1137HhLP] [^114cbTKh]. Let me reconsider the broader complement pipeline; agents targeting proximal complement such as C3 and factor B are under study and may address extravascular hemolysis more comprehensively than terminal C5 blockade, which aligns with the pathophysiology of CAD [^1147ZuMU].

> For supportive care, I need to ensure meticulous cold avoidance, use blood warmers for all infusions, and maintain normothermia perioperatively. In severe hemolytic crises, therapeutic plasma exchange can acutely reduce autoantibody and complement burden and is guideline-supported in refractory or life-threatening presentations, provided all circuits and replacement fluids are pre-warmed to avoid exacerbating agglutination [^115QeBGm] [^114LBXWJ]. Hold on, I should verify transfusion thresholds; symptomatic patients with hemoglobin below about 9 g/dL warrant transfusion, and in asymptomatic patients, a threshold near 7 g/dL is reasonable, always with warmed blood products to mitigate cold agglutination in the circuit [^116k9Dfi].

> Special populations require tailored plans. In pregnancy, conservative management with strict temperature control and warmed transfusions is preferred, reserving rituximab for refractory cases after careful risk–benefit discussion. In older adults, I should favor sutimlimab or rituximab monotherapy over cytotoxic combinations when feasible due to infection and myelosuppression risks. In surgical patients, proactive warming and consideration of prophylactic complement blockade such as eculizumab for high-risk procedures can mitigate perioperative hemolysis flares [^117MdGZR] [^1138XbQ9] [^114WHFBJ]. I should double-check that these strategies align with guideline-based perioperative recommendations for cold AIHA, which emphasize normothermia and anticipatory planning [^116wh6Zc].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. For mild, asymptomatic disease, prioritize cold avoidance and observation. For symptomatic patients, choose rituximab monotherapy if a gradual response is acceptable and cytotoxic therapy is undesirable, rituximab plus bendamustine for durable disease control in fit patients, or sutimlimab for rapid hemolysis control, transfusion dependence, or when chemotherapy is contraindicated. Reassess at 3–6 months and escalate or switch based on response and tolerability, recognizing that sutimlimab requires continuous therapy while clone-directed regimens may induce remission off treatment in a subset [^1138XbQ9] [^115ERk2N] [^112i7RWk]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach mirrors contemporary expert guidance; yes, multiple reviews converge on B-cell targeting as foundational and complement inhibition as a key targeted option, with individualized selection based on urgency, comorbidity, and access [^1138XbQ9] [^112mMX9d].

> Finally, I need to address controversies and future directions. The optimal sequencing of B-cell therapy versus complement inhibition remains debated, with some advocating upfront clone-directed therapy to achieve remission and others prioritizing rapid hemolysis control with sutimlimab, particularly in transfusion-dependent or high-risk patients; cost and access constraints further complicate decision-making, especially in low- and middle-income countries where sutimlimab may be prohibitively expensive and rituximab-based regimens dominate [^1138XbQ9] [^11118pma]. I should confirm that ongoing studies of proximal complement inhibitors and plasma cell–targeted agents may reshape the landscape; indeed, trials of C3 and factor B inhibitors and expanded daratumumab data could broaden options and potentially enable steroid-sparing, chemotherapy-sparing pathways in refractory disease [^1147ZuMU] [^113Jy32V].

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare, **autoimmune hemolytic anemia** caused by IgM autoantibodies that bind red blood cells at temperatures below 37°C, activating the classical complement pathway and causing predominantly extravascular hemolysis [^111JYM7U]. Diagnosis relies on a **positive DAT for C3d**, a **cold agglutinin titer ≥ 1:64 at 4°C**, and exclusion of secondary causes; bone marrow studies may reveal a clonal B-cell disorder [^116z3tbs] [^112Wzecv]. Management centers on **cold avoidance**, with rituximab-based regimens (± bendamustine) as first-line therapy [^1138XbQ9]; sutimlimab, a C1s inhibitor, is approved for patients with hemolysis and is particularly useful when rapid control is needed or rituximab is contraindicated [^116jjug6] [^1139ZsFz]. Corticosteroids and splenectomy are ineffective, and transfusion requires warmed blood [^1138XbQ9] [^115QeBGm]. Prognosis is generally favorable, but thrombosis risk is increased and relapses are common, necessitating individualized, long-term follow-up [^115ERk2N] [^115DaNxH] [^114KHS5V].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Autoantibodies**: IgM autoantibodies (cold agglutinins) bind RBC surface antigens (commonly I/i) at temperatures below 37°C, with pathogenic antibodies often active up to 28–30°C [^112Wzecv].

- **Complement activation**: IgM-RBC complexes activate the classical complement pathway, leading to C3b opsonization and extravascular hemolysis in the liver; intravascular hemolysis can occur with terminal pathway activation [^111JYM7U].

- **Clonal B-cell disorder**: CAD is associated with a low-grade clonal B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder in the bone marrow, distinct from overt lymphoma [^116z3tbs].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Anemia symptoms**: Fatigue, dyspnea, pallor, and jaundice due to chronic hemolysis [^1138DFyR].

- **Cold-induced symptoms**: Acrocyanosis, Raynaud phenomenon, and livedo reticularis from RBC agglutination in cooler peripheral circulation [^111n3X6g].

- **Exacerbations**: Hemolysis worsens with cold exposure, infections, or surgery [^114WHFBJ].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings

- **Direct antiglobulin test (DAT)**: Positive for C3d, reflecting complement-coated RBCs; IgG is typically negative or weakly positive [^11734LNQ].

- **Cold agglutinin titer**: ≥ 1:64 at 4°C; thermal amplitude (highest temperature of activity) helps assess pathogenicity [^116z3tbs].

- **Peripheral smear**: RBC agglutination and spherocytes may be seen [^113aXnV4].

- **Bone marrow**: Clonal B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder in many patients [^112Wzecv].

- **Exclusion of secondary causes**: Infections (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Epstein-Barr virus), lymphoproliferative disorders, or autoimmune diseases [^115Pkovj].

## Treatment strategies

### Non-pharmacological management

Non-pharmacological management emphasizes **cold avoidance** — maintaining a warm environment and avoiding cold exposure — and supportive care with transfusions using **warmed blood products** [^115QeBGm].

---

### Pharmacological management

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism** | **Efficacy** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Rituximab | Anti-CD20 B-cell depletion | 45–60% response; median duration ~11 months | First-line; retreatment effective [^112ARoD6] |
| Rituximab + bendamustine | B-cell depletion + chemotherapy | 78% response; 53% CR; durable remissions | Preferred first-line for fit patients [^1161cHM9] |
| Rituximab + fludarabine | B-cell depletion + chemotherapy | High response; durable remissions | Effective but higher toxicity [^114e7tgX] |
| Sutimlimab | C1s inhibitor (classical pathway) | Rapid hemolysis control; sustained Hb rise | Approved; biweekly IV; well tolerated [^111jy6Q5] [^1139ZsFz] |
| Eculizumab | C5 inhibitor (terminal pathway) | Modest Hb rise; reduces intravascular hemolysis | Option if sutimlimab unavailable [^notfound] |
| Daratumumab | Anti-CD38 (plasma cell targeting) | Promising in refractory cases | Investigational [^113Jy32V] |

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **generally favorable**, with median survival around 12 years; however, the disease is chronic and relapsing [^115DaNxH]. Complications include an **increased thromboembolic risk** — particularly venous thrombosis — and frequent relapses that require ongoing management [^115ERk2N].

---

## Recent advances and emerging therapies

- **Sutimlimab**: First approved therapy targeting classical complement; rapid, sustained control of hemolysis and anemia [^1145q4vr].

- **Riliprubart**: Second-generation C1s inhibitor with sustained activity in phase 1b [^114cbTKh].

- **Daratumumab**: Potential role in refractory CAD; further studies needed [^114Gzqrn].

---

Cold agglutinin disease is a complement-mediated autoimmune hemolytic anemia driven by cold-reactive IgM; **management combines cold avoidance with rituximab-based therapy**, and sutimlimab offers targeted control of hemolysis. Prognosis is favorable but relapses are common, requiring individualized, long-term care.

Summary

Background

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare subtype of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia characterised by classical complement pathway-mediated haemolysis, fatigue, and poor quality of life (QoL). Sutimlimab, a C1s inhibitor, rapidly halted haemolysis, and improved patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with CAD in two phase 3 trials (CARDINAL and CADENZA). Here we report PROs from the CADENZA open-label extension (Part B).

Methods

The first patient was enrolled in CADENZA (NCT03347422) in March 2018 (Part A) and the last patient completed the study in December 2021 (Part B). All patients who completed the 26-week Part A were eligible to receive biweekly doses of sutimlimab in Part B for up to 1 year after the last patient completed Part A. PROs were assessed throughout Part B, until the last on-treatment visit with available assessment (LV), and after a 9-week washout.

Findings

In total, 32/39 patients completed Part B; median Part B treatment duration: 99 weeks. Patients switching from placebo to sutimlimab in Part B experienced rapid improvement in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue score and other PROs. Sustained, clinically important improvements in FACIT-Fatigue were observed throughout Part B in patients who switched to sutimlimab and those continuing sutimlimab treatment (combined-group mean [SE] change from baseline at LV: 8.8 [2.1]). Similarly, the combined-group mean [SE] change for 12-Item Short Form Health Survey physical (4.9 [1.7]) and mental (4.0 [1.8]) component scores exceeded clinically important changes from baseline at LV. EuroQol visual analogue scale showed consistent and sustained increases from baseline with sutimlimab treatment. Following a 9-week washout, all PROs approached baseline values.

Interpretation

Continued inhibition of the classical complement pathway with sutimlimab results in meaningful long-term improvements in PROs (fatigue and QoL) in patients with CAD.

### Cold-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia: its association with neoplastic disease and impact on therapy [^113B3p7X]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cold-antibody mediated autoimmune hemolytic anemia (cAIHA) is subclassified as cold agglutinin disease (CAD), secondary cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS), and paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH). This review aims to address the occurrence of neoplastic disorders with these three entities and analyze the impact of such neoplasias on treatment for cAIHA.

Recent Findings

"Primary" CAD is a distinct clonal B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder in probably all cases, although not classified as a malignant lymphoma. CAS is secondary to malignant lymphoma in a minority of cases. Recent findings allow a further clarification of these differential diagnoses and the therapeutic consequences of specific neoplastic entities. Appropriate diagnostic workup is critical for therapy in cAIHA. Patients with CAD should be treated if they have symptomatic anemia, significant fatigue, or bothersome circulatory symptoms. The distinction between CAD and CAS and the presence of any underlying malignancy in CAS have essential therapeutic implications.

Figure 1.
Effect of sutimlimab on a composite primary endpoint comprising Hb levels, transfusions, and need for CAD medications in patients with CAD. For the composite primary endpoint, sutimlimab was compared with placebo using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method, stratified by baseline Hb (< median vs ≥ median) and geographic region (Asia/Other, North America, and Europe). Hb increase from baseline of ≥ 1.5 g/dL was analyzed at the treatment assessment timepoint, defined as the mean average of weeks 23, 25, and 26. Requirements for transfusion included Hb < 9 g/dL and patient symptomatic or Hb < 7 g/dL and patient asymptomatic. One patient in the sutimlimab arm discontinued treatment prematurely owing to an adverse event (increased blood IgM) and started rituximab treatment during the 9-week posttreatment follow-up period; 2 patients in the sutimlimab arm discontinued prior to week 23, and their statuses were therefore "unknown" for this analysis. BL, baseline.

Three patients in the sutimlimab arm did not meet the response criteria (supplemental Table 2). The patients did not achieve the required ≥ 1.5 g/dL increase in Hb from baseline to treatment assessment timepoint, and 1 patient received a blood transfusion. Two of these patients had an increase in Hb ≥ 1.5 g/dL over baseline on at least 1 occasion that was not associated with a blood transfusion (supplemental Figure 2). Baseline characteristics between the 2 groups are shown in supplemental Table 3. An additional 3 patients in the sutimlimab arm were excluded from the primary endpoint because they discontinued early due to TEAEs, including 1 patient who received a prohibited CAD medication. Results obtained in the 3 sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary efficacy endpoint analysis (supplemental Table 4).

### Sustained inhibition of complement C1s with sutimlimab over 2 years in patients with cold agglutinin disease [^112i7RWk]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare, autoimmune, classical complement pathway (CP)-mediated hemolytic anemia. Sutimlimab selectively inhibits C1s of the C1 complex, preventing CP activation while leaving the alternative and lectin pathways intact. In Part A (26weeks) of the open-label, single-arm, Phase 3 CARDINAL study in patients with CAD and a recent history of transfusion, sutimlimab demonstrated rapid effects on hemolysis and anemia. Results of the CARDINAL study Part B (2-year extension) study, described herein, demonstrated that sutimlimab sustains improvements in hemolysis, anemia, and quality of life over a median of 144weeks of treatment. Mean last-available on-treatment values in Part B were improved from baseline for hemoglobin (12.2g/dL on-treatment versus 8.6g/dL at baseline), bilirubin (16.5μmol/L on-treatment versus 52.1μmol/L at baseline), and FACIT-Fatigue scores (40.5 on-treatment versus 32.4 at baseline). In the 9-week follow-up period after sutimlimab cessation, CP inhibition was reversed, and hemolytic markers and fatigue scores approached pre-sutimlimab values. Overall, sutimlimab was generally well tolerated in Part B. All 22 patients experienced ≥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE); 12 (54.5%) patients experienced ≥ 1 serious TEAE, including seven (31.8%) with ≥ 1 serious infection. Three patients discontinued due to a TEAE. No patients developed systemic lupus erythematosus or meningococcal infections. After cessation of sutimlimab, most patients reported adverse events consistent with recurrence of CAD. In conclusion, the CARDINAL 2-year results provide evidence of sustained sutimlimab effects for CAD management, but that disease activity reoccurs after treatment cessation. NCT03347396. Registered November 20, 2017.

### Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia [^112nb5eP]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2004). Low credibility.

Hemolytic anemia due to immune function is one of the major causes of acquired hemolytic anemia. In recent years, as more is known about the immune system, these entities have become better understood and their treatment improved. In this section, we will discuss three areas in which this progress has been apparent. In Section I, Dr. Peter Hillmen outlines the recent findings in the pathogenesis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), relating the biochemical defect (the lack of glycosylphosphatidylinositol [GPI]-linked proteins on the cell surface) to the clinical manifestations, particularly hemolysis (and its effects) and thrombosis. He discusses the pathogenesis of the disorder in the face of marrow dysfunction insofar as it is known. His major emphasis is on innovative therapies that are designed to decrease the effectiveness of complement activation, since the lack of cellular modulation of this system is the primary cause of the pathology of the disease. He recounts his considerable experience with a humanized monoclonal antibody against C5, which has a remarkable effect in controlling the manifestations of the disease. Other means of controlling the action of complement include replacing the missing modulatory proteins on the cell surface; these studies are not as developed as the former agent. In Section II, Dr. Alan Schreiber describes the biochemistry, genetics, and function of the Fc gamma receptors and their role in the pathobiology of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura due to IgG antibodies. He outlines the complex varieties of these molecules, showing how they vary in genetic origin and in function. These variations can be related to three-dimensional topography, which is known in some detail. Liganding IgG results in the transduction of a signal through the tyrosine-based activation motif and Syk signaling. The role of these receptors in the pathogenesis of hematological diseases due to IgG antibodies is outlined and the potential of therapy of these diseases by regulation of these receptors is discussed. In Section III, Dr. Wendell Rosse discusses the forms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia characterized by antibodies that react preferentially in the cold-cold agglutinin disease and paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH). The former is due to IgM antibodies with a common but particular structure that reacts primarily with carbohydrate or carbohydrate-containing antigens, an interaction that is diminished at body temperature. PCH is a less common but probably underdiagnosed illness due to an IgG antibody reacting with a carbohydrate antigen; improved techniques for the diagnosis of PCH are described. Therapy for the two disorders differs somewhat because of the differences in isotype of the antibody. Since the hemolysis in both is primarily due to complement activation, the potential role of its control, as by the monoclonal antibody described by Dr. Hillmen, is discussed.

### Catastrophic multiple organ ischemia due to an anti-Pr cold agglutinin developing in a patient with mixed cryoglobulinemia after treatment with rituximab [^113LpMvt]. American Journal of Hematology (2009). Low credibility.

Cold agglutinin disease occurring with cryoglobulinemia is a rare occurrence. Here, we report a patient with mixed cryoglobulinemia that was treated with rituximab and, after response, developed an anti-Pr cold agglutinin that manifested with hemolysis and microvascular occlusion causing mesenteric ischemia and cerebral infarction. Unlike previous reports of patients with cryoglobulinemia and cold agglutinin disease, our patient did not have a detectable cryoprecipitate when his cold agglutinin manifested.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of continued complement C1s inhibition with sutimlimab in cold agglutinin disease: CADENZA study part B [^11665Bun]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In the consensus recommendations for AIHAs, published in 2020 (before the approval of sutimlimab), it was agreed by an expert panel that complement inhibition at various levels of the complement cascade (such as with eculizumab, terminal complement [C5] inhibitor) may be a useful treatment approach for CAD in emergencies or for later lines of treatment. It is expected that complement inhibitors, like sutimlimab (C1s inhibitor), which inhibit the complement cascade further upstream, may be more effective than eculizumab as they address extravascular haemolysis (the predominant form of haemolysis in CAD).

Overall, sutimlimab was generally well tolerated by patients throughout the study. The type and frequency of TEAEs were generally consistent with the underlying disease indication, reported medical history, and an older, medically complex population; and most of the events experienced by the patients during the 9-week post-treatment follow-up period could be attributed to recurrence of CAD. Further real-world evidence for the long-term safety and efficacy of sutimlimab in CAD will be assessed via the CADENCE registry.

Patients

At screening, adult patients with confirmed CAD diagnosis, Hb ≤ 10.0 g/dL, bilirubin level above the normal reference range, and ferritin level above the lower limit of normal were eligible. A confirmed diagnosis of CAD was defined as the presence of chronic hemolysis, positive polyspecific direct antiglobulin test, monospecific-direct antiglobulin test strongly positive for C3d, IgG-direct antiglobulin test ≤ 1+, a cold agglutinin titer ≥ 64 at 4°C, and no evidence of overt malignant disease. Patients were required to have symptomatic disease within 3 months of screening, defined as one or more of the following: symptomatic anemia, acrocyanosis, Raynaud phenomenon, hemoglobinuria, disabling circulatory symptoms, and/or major adverse vascular event, including thrombosis. Patient exclusions included: cold agglutinin syndrome secondary to infection, rheumatologic disease, or active hematologic malignancy; a history of blood transfusion within 6 months of screening or a history of > 1 blood transfusion within 12 months, diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune disorders; erythropoietin deficiency; any clinically relevant infection; recent rituximab (within 3 months)/rituximab combination therapies (within 6 months); or concurrent treatment with corticosteroids other than a stable dose equivalent to 10 mg/d prednisone for the 3 months prior. A full list of study inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the supplemental appendix, available on the Blood Web site.

Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 26 weeks of either sutimlimab or placebo by a permuted block randomization (block size fixed at 4) using Pharm-Olam's Interactive Web Response System. Sutimlimab (6.5 g if body weight was < 75 kg; 7.5 g if body weight was ≥ 75 kg) or placebo was administered by IV infusion (500 mL) over 60 minutes on day 0, day 7, and every 14 days thereafter through week 25. Patients were to receive red blood cell transfusions if they were symptomatic with Hb < 9 g/dL or asymptomatic with Hb < 7 g/dL.

We present a case of a man in his 40s with pulmonary-renal syndrome due to myeloperoxidase-positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-associated vasculitis and concurrent cold agglutinin disease, a combination that has not yet been described in the literature. The fulminant course of the disease, including the need for kidney replacement therapy and mechanical ventilation posed a significant treatment challenge due to haemolytic complications.

### IgM monoclonal gammopathies of clinical significance: diagnosis and management [^112Wzecv]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary cold agglutinin disease

In primary CAD, autoimmune hemolytic anemia is caused by a cold agglutinin that is a monoclonal IgMk in more than 90% of cases and is produced by clonal lymphocytes in the bone marrow. The antibody binds erythrocyte antigens (typically type I) optimally at 4˚C resulting in agglutination and classical complement pathway activation. The thermal amplitude describes the temperature range at which the antibodies are active, and only those with a thermal amplitude reaching higher than 28˚C are considered pathogenic. In most cases, complement activation is incomplete and extravascular hemolysis of C3b-opsonized erythrocytes occurs in the liver. Less frequently there is initiation of the terminal pathway, assembly of the membrane attack complex (C5b-C9) and intravascular hemolysis, which can lead to acute life-threatening anemia. Cold agglutinins in the context of infection, autoimmune disease and overt lymphoma(including chronic lymphocytic lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and WM) are referred to as cold agglutinin syndrome.

### Cold agglutinin disease secondary to severe SARS-CoV-2 treated with eculizumab [^111bbFij]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Impaired immune response with uncontrolled inflammation and various immunological disorders have been reported during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report a case of cold agglutinin disease occurring during a severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a French intensive care unit. A patient was presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure and haemolytic anaemia. Direct antiglobulin test was positive with a cold agglutinin titre of 1/512. No other cause than COVID-19 explained the occurrence of cold agglutinin disease; however, causality could not be formally established. Persistent anaemia despite transfusion therapy and the short-term life-threatening, prompted the infusion of a monoclonal anti-C5 antibody (eculizumab). Eculizumab therapy quasi-fully resolved haemolysis within a few days, but ultimately the patient died from his severe COVID-19 infection. Data regarding the specific treatment of cold agglutinin disease during COVID-19 are rare. Although additional studies are warranted, eculizumab may be considered in critical situations.

### Prophylactic use of eculizumab during surgery in chronic cold agglutinin disease [^114WHFBJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Primary chronic cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is an autoimmune haemolytic anaemia in which a specific bone marrow lymphoproliferative disorder causes production of cold agglutinins (CA). Binding of CA to erythrocyte surface antigens results in a predominantly extravascular haemolysis that is entirely complement dependent. Because of complement activation, exacerbations are common during febrile infections, trauma or major surgery. Involvement of the terminal complement pathway with C5-mediated intravascular haemolysis is probably not prominent in stable disease but is supposed to be of importance in exacerbations following acute phase reaction. We report on a patient with CAD prone to exacerbation of haemolysis during acute phase reactions who was scheduled for cardiac surgery. To prevent her having an exacerbation of haemolysis, we chose to treat her prophylactically with eculizumab along with the usual perioperative precautions. Aortic valve replacement was undertaken with full cardiopulmonary bypass at normothermia. The procedure was successful; no exacerbation of haemolysis was observed, and transfusion requirements did not exceed what could be expected.

### How I treat autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^1138DFyR]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on autoimmune hemolytic anemia:

- Definition: AIHA is an acquired disorder where the immune system produces antibodies against RBC antigens, leading to hemolysis.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of AIHA involves warm antibody-mediated and cold agglutinin disease. In warm type, IgG antibodies bind to RBCs at normal body temperature, leading to their destruction primarily in the spleen and liver. Cold type involves IgM antibodies that bind to RBCs at colder temperatures, typically in the extremities, causing destruction mainly in the peripheral circulation.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of AIHA in the US is estimated at 17 per 100,000 population.
- Disease course: Clinically, AIHA usually presents with fatigue and other constitutional symptoms due to anemia. Other signs and symptoms may include jaundice due to the breakdown of RBCs and shortness of breath. Physical examination may reveal pallor, hepatosplenomegaly, and jaundice.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of AIHA can vary widely. It can run a chronic course with severe intermittent exacerbations. The response to treatment can also influence the prognosis.

### Autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^113YZYZW]. American Journal of Hematology (2002). Low credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) autoantibodies are a relatively uncommon cause of anemia. However, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) must be considered in the differential diagnosis of hemolytic anemias, especially if the patient has a concomitant lymphoproliferative disorder, autoimmune disease, or viral or mycoplasmal infection. Classifications of AIHA include warm AIHA, cold agglutinin syndrome, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, mixed-type AIHA, and drug-induced AIHA. Characteristics of the autoantibodies are responsible for the various clinical entities. As a result, diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation and a serologic work-up. For each classification of AIHA, this review discusses the demographics, etiology, clinical presentation, laboratory evaluation, and treatment options.

### Rituximab in chronic cold agglutinin disease: a prospective study of 20 patients [^117VHDE5]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is an acquired autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Previous therapeutic modalities, including alkylating cytostatics, interferon and prednisolone, have been disappointing. However, several case reports and small-scaled studies have demonstrated promising results after treatment with rituximab. We performed a phase II multicentre trial to investigate the effect of rituximab in CAD, including 20 patients studied from October 2002 until April 2003. Thirteen patients had idiopathic CAD and seven patients had CAD associated with a malignant B-cell lymphoproliferative disease. Rituximab was given in doses of 375 mg/m(2) at days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Sixteen patients were followed up for at least 48 weeks. Four patients were excluded after 8, 16, 23 and 28 weeks for reasons unrelated to CAD. Nine patients (45%) responded to the treatment, one with complete response (CR), and eight with partial response. Eight patients relapsed, one patient was still in remission at the end of follow-up. There were no serious rituximab-related side-effects. Our study confirms previous findings of a favourable effect of rituximab in patients with CAD. However, few patients will obtain CR and, in most patients, the effect will be transient.

### Complement in hemolytic anemia [^112oQTAu]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Complement is increasingly being recognized as an important driver of human disease, including many hemolytic anemias. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) cells are susceptible to hemolysis because of a loss of the complement regulatory proteins CD59 and CD55. Patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) develop a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) that in most cases is attributable to mutations that lead to activation of the alternative pathway of complement. For optimal therapy, it is critical, but often difficult, to distinguish aHUS from other TMAs, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; however, novel bioassays are being developed. In cold agglutinin disease (CAD), immunoglobulin M autoantibodies fix complement on the surface of red cells, resulting in extravascular hemolysis by the reticuloendothelial system. Drugs that inhibit complement activation are increasingly being used to treat these diseases. This article discusses the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapy for PNH, aHUS, and CAD.

### Mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia: a systematic review of epidemiology, clinical characteristics, therapies, and outcomes [^111DMrRp]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare, acquired disorder characterized by the premature destruction of autologous red blood cells (RBCs) due to autoantibody‐mediated hemolysis. The etiology of AIHA is multifaceted. Cases are typically considered either primary or secondary to conditions such as autoimmune diseases, infections, malignancies, or drug exposure. AIHA may be categorized based on the optimal thermal reactivity of the autoantibodies involved, resulting in distinct subtypes including warm AIHA, cold AIHA (i.e. cold agglutinin disease or cold agglutinin syndrome), mixed AIHA, and paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH). Among these, warm AIHA is the most prevalent, accounting for over two‐thirds of adult cases, whereas mixed AIHA, although less common, remains clinically significant.

Mixed AIHA is characterized by the presence of both warm (IgG)‐ and cold (IgM)‐reactive autoantibodies, resulting in a complex and often treatment‐resistant clinical presentation. Reports suggest that mixed AIHA accounts for fewer than 10% of AIHA cases, though its true incidence is difficult to ascertain due to inconsistencies in diagnostic criteria across studies. Some studies have proposed that mixed AIHA imparts a more severe clinical course, often necessitating multiple lines of therapy and leading to increased transfusion dependence. However, the rarity of the condition — coupled with the variability in laboratory definitions and diagnostic methodologies — continues to hinder a comprehensive understanding of its epidemiology and optimal management.

Previous literature reviews on mixed AIHA have been limited by inconsistent case definitions and methodological challenges. Many studies have diagnosed mixed AIHA using broad or non‐specific diagnostic criteria, such as a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) for both IgG and complement (C3), without further confirmatory testing. Critical assessments, including elution studies to verify warm autoantibodies and thermal amplitude testing to identify pathologic cold autoantibodies, are often absent. To address these limitations, we conducted a systematic review of the available literature on mixed AIHA using strict diagnostic criteria published by the British Society of Hematology and the First International Consensus Meeting, aiming to refine our understanding of its epidemiology, clinical presentation, and responses to treatment.

### Mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia: a systematic review of epidemiology, clinical characteristics, therapies, and outcomes [^112g3kZs]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Detection of a pathologic cold agglutinin required a DAT positive for C3 with a cold agglutinin that reacted between 0°C and ≤ 20°C as well as ≥ 30°C. If a cold agglutinin was suggested to be present (e.g. via a DAT positive for C3 with concomitant RBC agglutination) but the temperature requirements were not reported, the case could still be included as "possible or probable" if the titer was ≥ 64.

If no testing was available to illustrate the presence of both warm and cold autoantibodies, or if sufficient testing was performed demonstrating that the cold agglutinin did not react ≥ 30°C, the case was excluded.

For studies using the same data set, only discrete and unrelated values were extracted from each study. If we were unable to determine overlapping data, only the larger of the two studies was included.

2.7 Data Collection and Synthesis

Two authors independently extracted data on demographics, AIHA risk factors, treatments, RBC transfusion requirements, laboratory parameters, and patient outcomes. Descriptive analyses were conducted using Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Means and standard deviations were reported for normally distributed data, while medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) were used for non‐normally distributed variables. Statistical significance was determined using t ‐tests for means or Mann–Whitney tests for medians; Fisher's exact test was used to compare proportions. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Eculizumab in cold agglutinin disease (DECADE): an open-label, prospective, bicentric, nonrandomized phase 2 trial [^111SSWEJ]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a complement-dependent disorder, with extravascular and intravascular hemolysis resulting from initial or terminal complement activation, respectively. We tested the efficacy and safety of eculizumab, an inhibitor of the terminal complement pathway. Treatment-requiring patients received 600 mg eculizumab weekly for 4 weeks, followed 1 week later by 900 mg every other week through week 26. The primary end point was the difference in the lactate dehydrogenase level between the first and the last day of therapy. Twelve patients with chronic CAD and 1 patient with an acute cold agglutinin syndrome were included. The median lactate dehydrogenase level decreased from 572 U/L (interquartile range [IQR], 534–685) to 334 U/L (IQR, 243–567; p = 0.0215), paralleled by an increase in hemoglobin from 9.35 g/dL (IQR, 8.80–10.80) to 10.15 g/dL (IQR, 9.00–11.35; p = 0.0391; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Three patients maintained and 8 patients acquired transfusion independence, and 1 patient each showed a reduced or increased transfusion requirement, respectively (P = .0215; exact McNemar's test). Patients with cold agglutinins with a thermal amplitude of 37°C tended to have less pronounced lactate dehydrogenase responses than patients with cold agglutinins with narrower thermal amplitudes. In the latter, responses were observed at lower serum levels of eculizumab than they were in the former. In contrast to hemolysis, cold-induced circulatory symptoms remained unaffected. In conclusion, eculizumab significantly reduced hemolysis and transfusion requirement in patients with CAD. Suppression of hemolysis caused by cold agglutinins with a wide thermal amplitude may require higher eculizumab doses than used here. The trial is registered with EudraCT (#2009–016966–97) and www.clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT01303952).

### Management of cold agglutinin immune hemolytic anemia in pregnancy [^117MdGZR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Cold hemagglutinin disease is an acquired autoimmune hemolytic anemia caused by an immunoglobulin M autoantibody directed against the polysaccharide antigens on the red blood cell surface. This case presents the challenges surrounding the management of cold hemagglutinin disease in pregnancy.

Case

A pregnant woman in her thirties with type-2 diabetes, reporting shortness of breath and productive cough, was found to have anemia, reticulocytosis, bilirubinemia, positive direct Coombs test result, positive cold agglutinin antibody, and raised lactate dehydrogenase levels. As the infection screen and autoimmune serology results were negative, she was diagnosed as having idiopathic cold hemagglutinin disease. The management included keeping the patient warm and hydrated and treating the anemia with warm packed red blood cell transfusion.

Conclusion

Cold hemagglutinin disease is a rare condition. Investigations to rule out infections help determine the diagnosis of cold hemagglutinin disease of unknown origin.

### Long-term sutimlimab improves quality of life for patients with cold agglutinin disease: CARDINAL 2-year follow-up [^114Vsimg]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, C1s inhibition had a positive impact on patient well-being as recorded by PROs, and this effect followed the major shifts observed in hematologic parameters assessing anemia and hemolysis in this study, declining after discontinuation of treatment. This impact on patient experience is an important factor for clinical decision-making while treating a disease with a heavy burden on patient QoL. The novel findings on PRO improvements in the long-term and the effect of treatment discontinuation reported in this study will therefore be of significant interest to clinicians treating patients with CAD, favoring the recommendation that patients should remain on treatment. The contribution of individual hematologic parameters to this subjective benefit remains an interesting question, and further studies with larger patient cohorts and more granular sampling are needed to assess the correlation between these parameters and identify any existing functional relationships.

Limitations include the single-arm study design and the low patient numbers owing to the rarity of the disease. With the exception of the FACIT-Fatigue assessment, the PROs were exploratory end points in CARDINAL.

The results of CARDINAL part B show that continued upstream inhibition of the classical complement pathway with sutimlimab provides sustained and durable treatment benefits in chronic CAD, including a continued meaningful impact on patient QoL in the long term.

### Sutimlimab in patients with cold agglutinin disease: results of the randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 CADENZA trial [^113rK9ZE]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Röth and colleagues present results of a phase 3 trial of the C1s classical complement pathway inhibitor sutimlimab for the treatment of patients with cold agglutinin disease (CAD) who did not receive a transfusion within the previous 6 months. In a randomized placebocontrolled study of 41 patients, 73% of patients treated with sutimlimab required no transfusion or additional therapy, and treatment increased mean hemoglobin and fatigue scores, as compared to only 15% in the placebo arm. This supports sutimlimab as an important new agent for the treatment of CAD.

### Sutimlimab in cold agglutinin disease [^111jy6Q5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Cold agglutinin disease is a rare autoimmune hemolytic anemia characterized by hemolysis that is caused by activation of the classic complement pathway. Sutimlimab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, selectively targets the C1s protein, a C1 complex serine protease responsible for activating this pathway.

Methods

We conducted a 26-week multicenter, open-label, single-group study to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous sutimlimab in patients with cold agglutinin disease and a recent history of transfusion. The composite primary end point was a normalization of the hemoglobin level to 12 g or more per deciliter or an increase in the hemoglobin level of 2 g or more per deciliter from baseline, without red-cell transfusion or medications prohibited by the protocol.

Results

A total of 24 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of sutimlimab; 13 patients (54%) met the criteria for the composite primary end point. The least-squares mean increase in hemoglobin level was 2.6 g per deciliter at the time of treatment assessment (weeks 23, 25, and 26). A mean hemoglobin level of more than 11 g per deciliter was maintained in patients from week 3 through the end of the study period. The mean bilirubin levels normalized by week 3. A total of 17 patients (71%) did not receive a transfusion from week 5 through week 26. Clinically meaningful reductions in fatigue were observed by week 1 and were maintained throughout the study. Activity in the classic complement pathway was rapidly inhibited, as assessed by a functional assay. Increased hemoglobin levels, reduced bilirubin levels, and reduced fatigue coincided with inhibition of the classic complement pathway. At least one adverse event occurred during the treatment period in 22 patients (92%). Seven patients (29%) had at least one serious adverse event, none of which were determined by the investigators to be related to sutimlimab. No meningococcal infections occurred.

Conclusions

In patients with cold agglutinin disease who received sutimlimab, selective upstream inhibition of activity in the classic complement pathway rapidly halted hemolysis, increased hemoglobin levels, and reduced fatigue. (Funded by Sanofi; CARDINAL ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03347396.).

### How I manage autoimmune cytopenias in patients with lymphoid cancer [^1161cHM9]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Cold agglutinin disease

The pathophysiology of cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is based on monoclonal IgM antibodies that trigger complement-mediated red cell lysis, which causes predominantly extravascular hemolysis in the liver. Effective removal of the B-cell clone and complement inhibition are therefore the therapeutic goals. For these reasons, CAD usually does not respond to steroids or splenectomy. Rituximab or rituximab-containing regimens are very effective as first-line treatments (Table 1; Figure 1C). Rituximab monotherapy, 375 mg/m 2 for 4 weeks at 7-day intervals, produces response rates of ∼50%, but with few CRs. The median duration of response is less than 1 year, but repeated courses of rituximab are often effective in relapsed disease. A good option for primary CAD, particularly cases of accompanying indolent lymphomas, are combinations of rituximab with fludarabine or bendamustine. We prefer bendamustine+rituximab for its higher efficacy and rare induction of hemolytic events. Bortezomib is another effective drug for treating lymphomas. Ibrutinib is effective in Waldenström's disease and can be tried as a monotherapy. In case of AICs, a CD20 monoclonal antibody may increase efficacy.

The other option for CAD is complement inhibition. The anti-C1s antibody sutimlimab effectively increased hemoglobin levels rapidly by more than 2 g/dL in 7 of 10 patients, with a median best response of 3.9 g/dL. Inhibition of the complement cascade offers short-term relief, but does not target the underlying clonal B-cell disease. However, it would be a good option for patients who do not respond to rituximab or as a bridging therapy. Sutimlimab can also be used in sequence with ibrutinib in patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with an MYD88 mutation. Clinical studies with other B-cell–targeting agents such as PI3 kinase or SYK inhibitors are ongoing.

### Sustained improvements in patient-reported outcomes after long-term sutimlimab in patients with cold agglutinin disease: results from the CADENZA study open-label extension [^1135uQBJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare subtype of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia characterised by classical complement pathway-mediated haemolysis, fatigue, and poor quality of life (QoL). Sutimlimab, a C1s inhibitor, rapidly halted haemolysis, and improved patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with CAD in two phase 3 trials (CARDINAL and CADENZA). Here we report PROs from the CADENZA open-label extension (Part B).

Methods

The first patient was enrolled in CADENZA (NCT03347422) in March 2018 (Part A) and the last patient completed the study in December 2021 (Part B). All patients who completed the 26-week Part A were eligible to receive biweekly doses of sutimlimab in Part B for up to 1 year after the last patient completed Part A. PROs were assessed throughout Part B, until the last on-treatment visit with available assessment (LV), and after a 9-week washout.

Findings

In total, 32/39 patients completed Part B; median Part B treatment duration: 99 weeks. Patients switching from placebo to sutimlimab in Part B experienced rapid improvement in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue score and other PROs. Sustained, clinically important improvements in FACIT-Fatigue were observed throughout Part B in patients who switched to sutimlimab and those continuing sutimlimab treatment (combined-group mean [SE] change from baseline at LV: 8.8 [2.1]). Similarly, the combined-group mean [SE] change for 12-Item Short Form Health Survey physical (4.9 [1.7]) and mental (4.0 [1.8]) component scores exceeded clinically important changes from baseline at LV. EuroQol visual analogue scale showed consistent and sustained increases from baseline with sutimlimab treatment. Following a 9-week washout, all PROs approached baseline values.

Interpretation

Continued inhibition of the classical complement pathway with sutimlimab results in meaningful long-term improvements in PROs (fatigue and QoL) in patients with CAD.

### Mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia: a systematic review of epidemiology, clinical characteristics, therapies, and outcomes [^113soQaw]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

We identified 35 reports encompassing 81 patients who met strict criteria for mixed AIHA, with a significant overrepresentation of females. The severity of anemia was notable, with a median hemoglobin level below 6.0 g/dL, aligning with previous findings. Treatment approaches were heterogeneous, and more than half of patients received at least two therapeutic interventions, with corticosteroids, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide among the most frequently used therapies. Fewer than half of the patients achieved remission, underscoring the complex nature and treatment challenges of this rare condition and emphasizing the need for standardized diagnostic and management strategies.

One of our key findings was the lack of a significant difference in remission rates independent of cold antibody titer, suggesting that cold agglutinin titer alone may not reliably predict disease severity or treatment response. Previous studies have emphasized the importance of thermal amplitude rather than titer levels alone in determining the pathogenicity of cold agglutinins. However, many studies identified in the literature diagnosed mixed AIHA based solely on a positive DAT and red cell agglutination (e.g. such as at immediate spin or as observed on peripheral blood smear examination), precluding their inclusion in our analysis. The mere presence of a cold agglutinin does not establish pathogenicity. Indeed, Petz and Garratty reported that 35% of patients with WAIHA have strong cold agglutinins that, when tested appropriately, display low titers at 4°C and are non‐reactive at physiologic body temperature (i.e. narrow thermal amplitude), indicating a lack of clinical significance. Therefore, identifying a pathologic cold autoantibody that reacts at body temperature (≥ 30°C) appears to be a more relevant marker when clinical significance is in question.

### Updates on the diagnosis and management of cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^113aXnV4]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Cold agglutinin disease represents a form of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia whereby an IgM protein either monoclonal or polyclonal deposits complement on the surface of the red blood cell. Once complement is deposited, the 3rd component of complement is recognized by receptors in the mononuclear phagocyte system resulting in spherocytic extravascular hemolysis. This results in a Coombs positive hemolytic anemia with the peripheral blood film showing agglutination. In many instances, the source is a clonal population of lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow producing a monoclonal IgM protein. Traditional and emerging therapies directed against the production of the IgM may have a positive effect on hemolytic anemia. Success in the management of cold agglutinin disease with rituximab, fludarabine, bortezomib, and bendamustine has all been reported. Recent studies have demonstrated that the blockade of complement with sutimlimab can stop the hemolysis without the use of systemic chemotherapy.

Regarding medical management for autoimmune hemolytic anemia, more specifically with respect to management of secondary AIHA (infections), BSH 2017 guidelines recommend to initiate supportive therapy with appropriate antimicrobials, a warm environment and transfusion in symptomatic anemia in patients with cold agglutinin disease secondary to atypical and mycoplasma pneumonia.

### Cost-effectiveness of sutimlimab in cold agglutinin disease [^113c8cxQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare autoimmune hemolytic anemia caused by cold-reactive antibodies that bind to red blood cells and lead to complement-mediated hemolysis. Patients with primary CAD experience the burden of increased health resource utilization and reduced quality of life. The standard-of-care (SOC) in patients with primary CAD has included cold avoidance, transfusion support, and chemoimmunotherapy. The use of sutimlimab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits C1-mediated hemolysis, was shown to reduce transfusion-dependence and improve quality of life across two pivotal phase 3 studies, further supported by 2-year extension data. Using data from the transfusion-dependent patient population that led to sutimlimab's initial FDA approval, we performed the first-ever cost-effectiveness analysis in primary CAD. The projected incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in our Markov model was $2340000/QALY, significantly above an upper-end conventional US willingness-to-pay threshold of $150000/QALY. These results are consistent across scenarios of higher body weight and a pan-refractory SOC patient phenotype (i.e., treated sequentially with bendamustine-rituximab, bortezomib, ibrutinib, and eculizumab). No parameter variations in deterministic sensitivity analyses changed our conclusion. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, SOC was favored over sutimlimab in 100% of 10000 iterations. Exploratory threshold analyses showed that significant price reduction (> 80%) or time-limited treatment (< 18months) followed by lifelong clinical remission off sutimlimab would allow sutimlimab to become cost-effective. The impact of sutimlimab on health system costs with longer term follow-up data merits future study and consideration through a distributional cost-effectiveness framework.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of continued complement C1s inhibition with sutimlimab in cold agglutinin disease: CADENZA study part B [^115S4a7H]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In the 9-week follow-up period after cessation of sutimlimab, there was a decline in treatment effect, which was not unexpected. Assessment of pharmacodynamic markers showed the reversal of the near-complete inhibition of CP activity and return of CH50 and C4 towards baseline levels at the 9-week washout timepoint. The haemolytic markers also approached baseline values, indicating a return of haemolytic activity, and emphasising the need for continuous treatment with sutimlimab for continued inhibition of disease activity in CAD.

Continuous treatment with sutimlimab is needed to maintain favourable treatment effects, due to its mechanism of action, to inhibit CP activation. Treatment with therapies not approved for management of CAD, such as rituximab (a B-cell-directed therapy) monotherapy or rituximab in combination with cytostatic agents (eg, bendamustine or fludarabine) may be more time-limited and can result in remission. However, these unapproved therapies are often associated with delayed or inadequate responses (particularly with monotherapy) and toxicity issues (especially with combination treatment). It has been suggested that sutimlimab may be of particular value to patients who are severely affected by CAD and who need a short time to response (eg, during acute exacerbations that do not spontaneously resolve). Furthermore, it has been proposed that chronic inhibition of complement activity in CAD may offer clinical benefits beyond improving haemolysis and anaemia, such as decreasing risk of thromboembolic events, although more data are needed to support this hypothesis.

### Daratumumab monotherapy in refractory warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and cold agglutinin disease [^113C9YPH]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare and heterogeneous antibody-mediated disease in which red blood cell (RBC) autoantibodies lead to the accelerated destruction of RBCs. Depending on the optimal binding temperature of the autoantibodies in vitro, AIHA can be classified as warm, cold, or mixed (both) AIHA. In warm AIHA (wAIHA), polyclonal autoantibodies, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or IgA and rarely IgM isotypes, bind to the RBC antigens at an optimum temperature of 37°C. Based on the presence of an underlying disorder (such as a malignancy or other autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]), wAIHA can be subdivided in primary or secondary wAIHA. In cold AIHA (cAIHA), RBC autoantibodies lead to complement-mediated hemolysis mostly via extravascular hemolysis in the liver. cAIHA is often due to cold agglutinin disease (CAD), a lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) with an IgM kappa paraproteinemia, which is called CAD. Cold agglutinins secondary to other conditions such as overt malignancy or infections are classified as cold agglutinin syndrome. At least 50% of patients with cAIHA have symptoms of acrocyanosis after exposure to low temperatures, causing skin discoloration with or without numbness and tingling. Cold associated symptoms adversely affect quality of life. The cornerstone of treatment for wAIHA are corticosteroids followed by rituximab in case of steroid refractoriness or dependency. As with immune thrombocytopenia, there is evidence suggesting that a lack of response to rituximab could be due to the expansion of autoreactive long-lived plasma cells lacking CD20 expression. For patients with CAD requiring therapy, rituximab alone or combined with bendamustine may be used, however, long-term response to rituximab is much lower than that in wAIHA, and chemotherapy-based regimens may not be suitable for older patients with comorbidities. Additionally, the recently approved complement inhibitor sutimlimab is able to improve hemolysis and anemia in CAD but has no effect on peripheral acrocyanosis symptoms. For relapsed/refractory wAIHA/CAD there is little evidence on optimal treatment, and this population represents a pressing unmet need.

### Cold hemolytic syndrome [^1165dZUR]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

In most cases, immune-mediated hemolysis occurs extravascularly and is associated with IgG antibodies on the surface of red cells. Rare syndromes include IgG antibodies that cause direct intravascular hemolysis, such as paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. Also rare are extravascular hemolytic syndromes caused by IgM polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies that demonstrate red cell agglutination at 3 degrees C, so-called cold antibodies. Because cold agglutinin disease has a high association with several lymphoproliferative disorders and IgM monoclonal gammopathies, its management differs significantly from that associated with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. This case-based presentation is designed to guide the reader to the diagnosis and to the initiation of prompt, effective therapy.

A study limitation is the small sample size. However, this reflects the fact that CAD is a rare disease and is in keeping with studies of other rare autoimmune diseases in the literature. While most analyses were prospectively defined, a further limitation is that they were descriptive and that the analyses pertaining to LV were post hoc. In addition, since all patients were aware they were receiving sutimlimab in Part B of the study, any improvements observed in patients switching from placebo to sutimlimab should be interpreted with caution. This is because it is possible that patients may have felt better knowing they were receiving the study drug, which could partially explain any improvements in PROs observed in Part B. However, improvements were also observed in more objective measures of disease activity (published in a separate manuscript) including improvements in Hb and bilirubin levels, which are markers of anaemia and haemolysis, respectively. Another potential confounding factor may be that patients were not blinded to their Hb and bilirubin levels, which are objective measures of anaemia and haemolysis, respectively. Although, it should be noted that during study visits, questionnaires were completed before Hb or bilirubin values were communicated to the patients, thus reducing the potential influence of laboratory data on self-reported QoL.

In conclusion, CADENZA Part B has shown that, in addition to improving haematological parameters in patients with CAD and without recent history of transfusion, continued inhibition of the classical complement pathway via treatment with sutimlimab results in meaningful long-term benefits to fatigue and patient-reported QoL. These results support the effectiveness of targeting the classical complement pathway (inhibition of C1s) in the management of CAD.

Introduction

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare subtype of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia characterised by chronic haemolysis that is mediated by activation of the classical complement pathway. In patients with CAD, cold agglutinin autoantibodies preferentially bind to the "I" antigen on red blood cells (RBCs). These autoantibodies are usually of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) class and can agglutinate RBC at cooler temperatures (≤ 37 °C) leading to circulatory symptoms such as acrocyanosis or Raynaud's phenomenon. Furthermore, the IgM-antigen complex binds complement protein 1q (C1q) on the cell surface and initiates activation of the classical complement pathway. Complement activation leads to extravascular haemolysis, largely through phagocytosis of RBC in the liver. This is the main mechanism of haemolysis in CAD, but intravascular haemolysis via direct complement cascade activation can occur in severe cases, or during episodes of acute inflammation, due to an increased generation of complement and complement activation in the acute phase response.

### Inhibition of complement C1s improves severe hemolytic anemia in cold agglutinin disease: a first-in-human trial [^1135vCRw]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Cold agglutinin disease is a difficult-to-treat autoimmune hemolytic anemia in which immunoglobulin M antibodies bind to erythrocytes and fix complement, resulting in predominantly extravascular hemolysis. This trial tested the hypothesis that the anti-C1s antibody sutimlimab would ameliorate hemolytic anemia. Ten patients with cold agglutinin disease participated in the phase 1b component of a first-in-human trial. Patients received a test dose of 10-mg/kg sutimlimab followed by a full dose of 60 mg/kg 1 to 4 days later and 3 additional weekly doses of 60 mg/kg. All infusions were well tolerated without premedication. No drug-related serious adverse events were observed. Seven of 10 patients with cold agglutinin disease responded with a hemoglobin increase > 2 g/dL. Sutimlimab rapidly increased hemoglobin levels by a median of 1.6 g/dL within the first week, and by a median of 3.9 g/dL (interquartile range, 1.3–4.5 g/dL; 95% confidence interval, 2.1–4.5) within 6 weeks (P = .005). Sutimlimab rapidly abrogated extravascular hemolysis, normalizing bilirubin levels within 24 hours in most patients and normalizing haptoglobin levels in 4 patients within 1 week. Hemolytic anemia recurred when drug levels were cleared from the circulation 3 to 4 weeks after the last dose of sutimlimab. Reexposure to sutimlimab in a named patient program recapitulated the control of hemolytic anemia. All 6 previously transfused patients became transfusion-free during treatment. Sutimlimab was safe, well tolerated, and rapidly stopped C1s complement-mediated hemolysis in patients with cold agglutinin disease, significantly increasing hemoglobin levels and precluding the need for transfusions. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02502903.

### Management of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia in low-to-middle income countries: current challenges and the way forward [^11118pma]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) is anaemia due to haemolysis, mediated by autoimmune mechanisms and usually with involvement of autoantibodies against red blood cell (RBC) surface antigens. AIHA is a collective term for several diseases that differ in terms of aetiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features, and should be treated differently (Table 1). During the last decades, several new established or investigational therapies have appeared, resulting in improvements of therapy but also raising medical and financial challenges on how to treat individual patients.

Table 1
Types of autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

Given the complexity of the disease group and the need for exact diagnosis to select the appropriate treatment, an optimal diagnostic workup will require considerable clinical, laboratory, and economic resources. While the first-line treatment in most cases of warm-antibody AIHA (wAIHA), prednisolone or prednisone, is cheap, newer therapies are often not available or affordable in low-to-middle income countries (LMIC), depending on national economy, healthcare services, and social security system. Sutimlimab, an efficient and well-tolerated drug for treatment of cold agglutinin disease (CAD), costs up to $315,000 for the first year of treatment in the USA. The gap in real-world diagnostic workup and treatment of AIHA between rich and LMIC has recently been addressed based on Indian experience.

This review will outline the workup required for an exact diagnosis of AIHA subtype and the optimal therapies for these disorders. For details, we refer to more comprehensive reviews. Subsequently, we will address real-life diagnostic procedure and treatment in India and discuss the gaps, unmet needs, and directions for progress in a global perspective.

### Rituximab for primary chronic cold agglutinin disease: a prospective study of 37 courses of therapy in 27 patients [^112ARoD6]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Conventional therapies for primary chronic cold agglutinin disease (CAD) are ineffective, but remissions after treatment with the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab have been described in a small, prospective trial and in some case reports. In this study we report on 37 courses of rituximab administered prospectively to 27 patients. Fourteen of 27 patients responded to their first course of rituximab, and 6 of 10 responded to re-treatment. In both groups combined, responses were achieved after 20 of 37 courses, giving an overall response rate of 54%. We observed 1 complete and 19 partial responses. Two nonresponders and 3 patients who experienced relapse received second-line therapy with interferon-alpha combined with a new course of rituximab, and 1 nonresponder and 2 patients who experienced relapse achieved partial responses. Responders achieved a median increase in hemoglobin levels of 40 g/L (4 g/dL). Median time to response was 1.5 months, and median observed response duration was 11 months. We conclude that rituximab is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for CAD. Histologic and flow cytometric findings suggest that some of the effect may be mediated by mechanisms other than the elimination of clonal lymphocytes. We were unable to predict responses from the hematologic, immunologic, or histologic parameters before therapy.

### Autoimmune haemolytic anaemias [^112mMX9d]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Adult autoimmune haemolytic anaemias (AIHAs) include different subtypes of a rare autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies targeting autoantigens expressed on the membrane of autologous red blood cells (RBCs) are produced, leading to their accelerated destruction. In the presence of haemolytic anaemia, the direct antiglobulin test is the cornerstone of AIHA diagnosis. AIHAs are classified according to the isotype and the thermal optimum of the autoantibody into warm (wAIHAs), cold and mixed AIHAs. wAIHAs, the most frequent type of AIHAs, are associated with underlying conditions in ~50% of cases. In wAIHA, IgG autoantibody reacts with autologous RBCs at 37°C, leading to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and increased phagocytosis of RBCs in the spleen. Cold AIHAs include cold agglutinin disease (CAD) and cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS) when there is an underlying condition. CAD and cold agglutinin syndrome are IgM cold antibody-driven AIHAs characterized by classical complement pathway-mediated haemolysis. The management of wAIHAs has long been based around corticosteroids and splenectomy and on symptomatic measures and non-specific cytotoxic agents for CAD. Rituximab and the development of complement inhibitors, such as the anti-C1s antibody sutimlimab, have changed the therapeutic landscape of AIHAs, and new promising targeted therapies are under investigation.

### High response rate and durable remissions following fludarabine and rituximab combination therapy for chronic cold agglutinin disease [^114e7tgX]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Most patients diagnosed with primary chronic cold agglutinin disease (CAD) have a clonal lymphoproliferative bone marrow disorder. Treatment with rituximab is the only well-documented effective therapy, leading to 45%-60% partial responses (PR). Complete responses (CR) are rare, and median response duration is only 11 months. In a prospective multicenter trial, 29 patients received rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on days 1, 29, 57 and 85; and fludarabine orally, 40 mg/m(2) on days 1–5, 29–34, 57–61 and 85–89. Twenty-two patients (76%) responded, 6 (21%) achieving CR and 16 (55%) PR. Among 10 patients nonresponsive to rituximab monotherapy, 1 achieved CR and 6 PR. Median increase in hemoglobin level was 3.1 g/dL among the responders and 4.0 g/dL in those who achieved CR. Lower quartile of response duration was not reached after 33 months. Estimated median response duration was more than 66 months. Grade 3–4 hematologic toxicity occurred in 12 patients (41%). In conclusion, fludarabine and rituximab combination therapy is very efficient in patients with CAD. Toxicity may be a concern, and benefits should be carefully weighed against risks in very old and comorbid patients. It remains to be established whether the combination should be first-line or an efficient second-line therapy in CAD patients requiring treatment.

Key Points

- Riliprubart (SAR445088, BIVV020) was generally well tolerated in patients with cold agglutinin disease.
- A single dose led to complement pathway inhibition, control of hemolysis, and improvement in anemia, sustained over 15 weeks.

### Complement-targeting therapies in hemolytic diseases [^1147ZuMU]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Complement inhibition has revolutionized the management of hemolytic diseases by targeting the underlying drivers of red blood cell destruction in disorders such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and cold agglutinin disease. Recent advances have expanded the therapeutic landscape beyond terminal C5 inhibition to proximal strategies targeting C3, factor B, and factor D. These newer agents - such as pegcetacoplan, iptacopan, and danicopan - not only control intravascular hemolysis but also address extravascular hemolysis and offer oral or subcutaneous alternatives. In cold agglutinin disease, the efficacy of the classical pathway inhibitor sutimlimab provides compelling evidence for the therapeutic value of targeting early initiating molecules of the complement cascade. For clinicians, these innovations provide personalized treatment choices based on disease phenotype, hemolysis profile, patient preference, and risk stratification. The evolving complement inhibitor arsenal enables optimized, targeted care and pathway-specific interventions in hemolytic conditions.

Clinical trials should be considered in relapsed disease. Promising studies have examined proximal complement inhibition to inhibit extravascular hemolysis. Complement inhibition necessitates indefinite treatment and fails to reduce vascular symptoms. In a phase III study of anti-C1s, sutimlimab, versus best supportive care, it was seen that the complement inhibitor rapidly halted hemolysis, produced transfusion independence in 73% of patients, increased hemoglobin concentration by more than 15 g/L and improved fatigue; this drug has now been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The effect of complement inhibition on thrombosis has not been established; however, D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin complex levels decreased on treatment. Use of the C5 inhibitor eculizumab rapidly abrogates the terminal complement pathway with a short time to response. However, in a phase II trial there was a marginal hemoglobin rise of 8 g/L. Proximal complement inhibition presumably has greater effectiveness because it targets C3-mediated hemolysis via the liver, which is often predominant in CAD. Ongoing clinical trials of complement inhibition in CAD include those studying the C3b inhibitor, pegcetacoplan (phase III, NCT05096403), the complement factor B inhibitor, iptacopan (phase II, NCT05086744), the C1 esterase inhibitor, cinryze (phase II, 2012–003710–13/NL) and the C1s inhibitor BIVV020 (phase Ib, NCT04269551).

Acute life-threatening intravascular hemolysis may necessitate transfusion. Plasma exchange may be employed provided that all priming fluids and the circuit apparatus are pre-warmed and that the replacement products are run through a warmer. Erythropoietin support can be considered as erythropoietin can be inappropriately low in autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Complement-directed therapy may act as a bridge for rituximab combinations to target the underlying clone, which can take weeks to have an effect.

### Sutimlimab in patients with cold agglutinin disease: results of the randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 CADENZA trial [^111JYM7U]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia characterized by chronic hemolysis that is entirely mediated by activation of the classical complement pathway.CAD is a clonal, low-grade lymphoproliferative disorder that can be detected in blood or marrow in patients with no clinical or radiologic evidence of malignant conditions.CAD is distinguished from cold agglutinin syndrome, which is transient and secondary to infections, overt malignant, or autoimmune conditions. In CAD, immunoglobulin M (IgM) autoantibodies (cold agglutinins) preferentially bind to the "I" antigen on erythrocytes at temperatures ≤ 37°C and may result in erythrocyte agglutination. The antigen-IgM antibody complex, a potent trigger of the classical complement pathway, binds to the C1 complement complex, resulting in activation of C1s (a C1 complex serine protease), which activates C2 and C4, and in turn generates C3 convertase, resulting in cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b.C3b deposition on erythrocytes results in extravascular hemolysis in the liver, the predominant mechanism of erythrocyte destruction in CAD. Although hemolysis is primarily driven by classical complement and extravascular hemolysis in CAD, severe disease may see further, terminal complement activation, with increased C3b deposition contributing to C5 convertase formation, membrane attack complex production, and intravascular hemolysis. However, this occurs to a much lesser extent than in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, because of intact CD55- and CD59-mediated regulation in CAD. Recognition of the mechanism of hemolytic anemia identified components of the classical complement pathway as a promising therapeutic target in CAD.

### Safety, tolerability, and activity of the active C1s antibody riliprubart in cold agglutinin disease: a phase 1b study [^1145q4vr]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Until recently, there were no approved therapies to treat chronic hemolysis in patients with CAD. Sutimlimab (BIVV009, TNT009) is a humanized, monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits the CP at C1s and is the first approved treatment for CAD. The efficacy and safety of sutimlimab were investigated in 2 phase 3 studies; CARDINAL was an open-label, single-arm study for patients with CAD with a history of recent blood transfusion (≥ 1 blood transfusion within 6 months of enrollment) and CADENZA was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study for patients with CAD without a history of recent blood transfusion (0 within 6 months prior to enrollment). In both studies, sutimlimab was investigated at a dose of 6.5 g (patients with body weight < 75 kg) or 7.5 g (patients with body weight ≥ 75 kg) via 500 mL IV infusion every 2 weeks for the duration of the studies. At this approved recommended dose, the half-life of sutimlimab, which is dependent on the plasma concentration, is 21 days. Sutimlimab response was rapid and sustained regardless of transfusion history, and included increased hemoglobin levels, improved markers of hemolysis, and clinically meaningful improvements in fatigue. Treatment was generally well tolerated, with the type and frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) consistent with an older and medically complex patient population. These data support the targeted inhibition of C1s as an effective and well tolerated therapeutic approach for CAD management. Sutimlimab is currently approved for the treatment of CAD in the United States, European Union, Japan, Switzerland, and South Korea.

### Safety, tolerability, and activity of the active C1s antibody riliprubart in cold agglutinin disease: a phase 1b study [^114cbTKh]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Cold agglutinin disease is a rare autoimmune hemolytic anemia characterized by complement pathway-mediated hemolysis. Riliprubart (SAR445088, BIVV020), a second-generation classical complement inhibitor, is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits only the activated form of C1s. This Phase 1b study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and effect on hemolysis of riliprubart in adult patients with cold agglutinin disease. On day 1, 12 patients received a single IV dose of either 30 mg/kg (n = 6) or 15 mg/kg (n = 6) of riliprubart and were subsequently followed for 15 weeks. Riliprubart was generally well tolerated; there were no treatment-emergent serious adverse events, or treatment-emergent adverse events leading to death or permanent study discontinuation. There were no reports of serious infections, encapsulated bacterial infections including meningococcal infections, hypersensitivity, or thromboembolic events. Rapid improvements in hemoglobin (day 5) and bilirubin (day 1) were observed in both treatment cohorts. Mean hemoglobin levels were maintained at > 11.0 g/dL from day 29 and mean levels of bilirubin were normalized by day 29; both responses were maintained throughout the study. Improvements in clinical markers closely correlated with a sustained reduction in the 50% hemolytic complement (CH50) throughout the study. Mean C4 levels, an in vivo marker of treatment activity, increased 1 week after treatment with either dose of riliprubart and were sustained throughout the study. In conclusion, a single IV dose of riliprubart was well tolerated, and led to rapid classical complement inhibition, control of hemolysis, and improvement in anemia, all of which were sustained over 15 weeks. This trial was registered at www. ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT04269551.

### Sutimlimab: a complement C1s inhibitor for the management of cold agglutinin disease-associated hemolysis [^116HWytz]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, dosing and administration, and place in therapy of sutimlimab for the management of cold agglutinin disease (CAD)-associated hemolysis.

Data Sources

A literature search of PubMed (1966-October 2022) was conducted using the keywords sutimlimab, BIVV009, and cold agglutinin. Data were also obtained from prescribing information, meeting abstracts, and clinicaltrials.gov.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All published prospective clinical trials, prescribing information, and meeting abstracts on sutimlimab for the treatment of CAD were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Sutimlimab is a first-in-class complement C1s inhibitor indicated for the treatment of CAD-associated hemolysis. This approval was based on the phase III CARDINAL trial, which evaluated sutimlimab in patients with CAD-associated hemolysis. The primary endpoint of achieving a hemoglobin of ≥ 12 g/dL or increase of ≥ 2 above baseline was achieved by 54% of patients with sutimlimab in the 26-week trial. The phase III CADENZA trial was a placebo-controlled trial in which sutimlimab has demonstrated a significant improvement in the composite endpoint of hemoglobin increase of ≥ 1.5 g/dL, avoidance of transfusion, and avoidance of additional CAD therapies (73% sutimlimab vs 15% placebo).

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice In Comparison With Existing Drugs

Sutimlimab rapidly halts hemolysis, improves hemoglobin, and improves quality-of-life in patients with CAD. Safety issues with sutimlimab include infusion-related reactions and risk of serious infections with encapsulated bacteria.

Conclusions

Sutimlimab provides an additional therapeutic option in the treatment of CAD-associated hemolysis that can lead to rapid improvement in hemoglobin and anemia-related symptoms.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of continued complement C1s inhibition with sutimlimab in cold agglutinin disease: CADENZA study part B [^116g3Vwf]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

CAD is a rare disease, and accordingly patient numbers in the CADENZA study are limited. The study had a reasonable sample size for a rare disease and was adequately powered to address the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints, yet no formal statistical hypotheses could be tested in Part B and analyses were descriptive rather than inferential. In addition, as per the study protocol, the safety data and transfusion data analysis included TEAEs or transfusions that occurred with a start date on or after the Part B start date and included transfusions or AEs that occurred during the 9-week post-treatment follow-up period. Transfusions or AEs that occurred in the 9-week post-treatment follow-up period have been highlighted and summarised, and overall, the 9-week washout data were found to be supportive of the efficacy of sutimlimab. In this trial, it is not possible to say how quickly Hb levels decreased following cessation of sutimlimab. This is because assessment of Hb levels was only taken at a single 9-week washout timepoint following cessation of sutimlimab with no interim sampling to assess the kinetics of Hb decrease; however, a previous study indicated that in individual patients receiving lower doses of sutimlimab, a fall in Hb occurred within 2 weeks after sutimlimab discontinuation. Insufficient data are available to discuss the detailed effect of sutimlimab cessation on the components of the CP (eg, whether the patient's set of complement was complete at termination) or pharmacodynamics of sutimlimab clearance in the 9-week washout period. Patient and external factors may influence these kinetics and more frequent sampling within the 9 weeks' washout period would have been necessary to study these effects.

In conclusion, sustained treatment with sutimlimab continues to inhibit haemolysis and improve anaemia and QoL for up to 1 year. Responses were similar in patients administered sutimlimab throughout the study and those who switched to sutimlimab in Part B. Sutimlimab was generally well tolerated throughout the study. Continued inhibition of the classical CP via treatment with sutimlimab results in meaningful long-term benefits on haemolysis, and disease markers, including fatigue, regardless of transfusion history. Upon discontinuation of sutimlimab, treatment effect declined highlighting the importance of continuous sutimlimab therapy in patients with CAD.

### Sustained improvements in patient-reported outcomes after long-term sutimlimab in patients with cold agglutinin disease: results from the CADENZA study open-label extension [^112z7fn8]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition to increased risk of thromboembolism and decreased life expectancy, CAD impacts patients' psychological and physical wellbeing and reduces their quality of life (QoL). This may contribute to additional manifestations of the disease such as depression or anxiety, which can further negatively affect overall mental health and QoL. Fatigue is the most common symptom reported by patients during an exacerbation of CAD. Indeed, most patients with CAD report moderate or severe fatigue, tiredness, lack of stamina, and weakness, which occurs daily or multiple times a week, greatly impacting their daily life.

Sutimlimab is a humanised anti-C1s monoclonal antibody designed to target C1s. By selectively inhibiting the classical complement pathway at C1s, sutimlimab retains the immune surveillance functions of the lectin and alternative complement pathways. Sutimlimab was approved in 2022 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the European Commission, and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency for use in CAD, and is the only therapy indicated for the treatment of CAD. Two pivotal phase 3 trials have been conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of sutimlimab in CAD, CARDINAL (a single-arm study in patients with CAD with a recent history of transfusion) and CADENZA (a placebo-controlled study in patients with CAD without a recent history of transfusion). Both studies had a 26-week treatment period (Part A) followed by a long-term extension (Part B), reporting data up to 2 years after the last patient finished Part A of CARDINAL and up to 1 year after the last patient finished Part A of CADENZA. In both studies, treatment with sutimlimab rapidly inhibited activity of the classical complement pathway, halted haemolysis, increased haemoglobin (Hb) levels, and reduced fatigue in patients with CAD, regardless of recent transfusion history. These beneficial effects were maintained throughout the long-term extension periods. In both studies, sutimlimab was generally well tolerated. Overall, the type and frequency of adverse events were generally consistent with the underlying disease indication, reported medical history, and an older medically complex patient population.

### Cold agglutinin disease burden: a longitudinal analysis of anemia, medications, transfusions, and health care utilization [^114KHS5V]. Blood Advances (2017). Low credibility.

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD), a rare disease and subtype of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, is characterized by autoantibodies that bind to red blood cells at low temperatures. There is no established standard of care for CAD treatment and CAD cohort studies are limited by the rarity of the condition. The objectives of this study are to present the longitudinal experience of a CAD cohort from the United States, with a focus on anemia severity, use of medications and transfusions, and health care resource utilization. The Stanford Translational Research Integrated Database Environment database was used to retrospectively identify CAD patients diagnosed and treated at Stanford Health Care from 2000 to 2016. Twenty-nine patients were included in this analysis. There were 7.1 severe anemia events per patient-year observed over the follow-up time. For CAD patients treated at Stanford, there was a mean of 3.5 therapies per patient. Transfusions were given in at least 65% of the cohort with a mean of 11 transfusions per patient-year. For CAD-related health care use in the first year after disease onset, 93% used outpatient services with a median of 26 outpatient visits per patient. The data presented here likely represent the minimum number of events for these patients during this timeframe, as this single-center experience does not capture care from other providers. This longitudinal study of CAD patients demonstrates the severity of anemia and relapsing nature of the disease, even after administration of multiple therapies and transfusions.

### Confirmation of fixed quarterly riliprubart regimen in patients with cold agglutinin disease using population PK / PD and exposure-response analyses [^113jQ4Z2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Clinical development in rare diseases continues to be stymied by limitations such as the small pool of patients and available data, understanding of the natural history combined with their inherent heterogeneity, and the uncertainty in defining clinical endpoints. Rare diseases span diverse therapeutic areas requiring public and health needs affecting patients and families in all countries. While the number of patients with a unique rare disease may be relatively small, the cumulative impact on public health is large – there are over 7,000 rare diseases impacting an estimated 30 million people or about 10 percent of the U.S. population. Rare diseases are typically serious conditions where new treatments that provide clinically meaningful benefits could significantly address unmet medical needs.

Improvements in anemia for CAD patients have been demonstrated by therapeutic complement inhibition with the approved sutimlimab and in the clinical studies of riliprubart, but the limited understanding of the natural history and inherent heterogeneity of CAD continues to pose a challenge. In this present study, a participant presented a TEAE of recurrent hemolysis. The historical hemoglobin and bilirubin levels in this participant are presented in Figure 5 c. In Study PDY16370, this participant had a clinically meaningful increase in Hb and normalization of bilirubin after a single dose of 30 mg/kg IV riliprubart and reported improved control of hemolysis and anemia. This participant continued riliprubart treatment in LTS16637 Part 1 (one 30 mg/kg dose of riliprubart by IV infusion followed by monthly 600 mg SC) and in LTS16637 Part 2 (3.5 g IV q12w riliprubart with an additional dose of Day 29). The presentation of the recurrent hemolysis appeared consistently during the winter months (December to February) and independent of riliprubart treatment, suggesting possible heterogeneity in the pathophysiology of CAD in this participant not well understood based on currently available biomarkers.

### Cold agglutinin syndrome secondary to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in adults: results from a large French observational study (MyCOLD study) [^113vQaZu]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

(MP) is a bacterium mainly responsible for respiratory infections. Its incidence is particularly high in children and young adults. MP outbreaks typically occur every 3 to 5 years with the latest epidemics occurred in 2011–2012 and 2017–2018 and more recently in 2023. The number of MP infection drastically increased in France — and worldwide — during fall and winter of 2023–2024 years. This epidemic situation led not only to an unusual number of potentially life‐threatening respiratory infections but was also responsible for a variety of serious extra‐respiratory manifestations including cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) or cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS) according to standard terminology.

Cold agglutinins are antibodies able to agglutinate red blood cells (RBCs) at an optimum temperature of 0°C–4°C. These antibodies are mostly of the IgM isotype, target autologous RBC membrane antigens, and can lead to their accelerated destruction. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) caused by antibodies with cold agglutinin properties can be classified into cold agglutinin disease (CAD), an indolent B cell clonal disorder, and CAS, where anti‐RBC antibodies are secondary to a malignancy or an acute infection such as MP. Previous studies have suggested that the avidity of MP for sialic acid residues on the surface of RBCs may lead to the formation of neoantigens inducing an autoimmune humoral response. The autoantibodies generated in this context are mainly IgM reacting with the I RBC surface antigen and with cold agglutinin properties. Confirmation of CAS relies on a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) reacting with C3d, combined with the presence of cold agglutinins (titer > 1/64) in the serum. While the detection of cold agglutinins is a common finding in MP infections, symptomatic CAS in this setting is rare and its optimal management is not consensual. This led us to raise the following questions: (i) what are the characteristics and outcomes of MP ‐associated CAS? (ii) Are there any risk factors for developing CAS during an MP respiratory tract infection? and (iii) Is there a place for a short course of glucocorticoids (GC) to shorten the duration of CAS and/or improve the prognosis? The 2023–2024 epidemic of MP gave us the opportunity to address these questions by analyzing a significant number of patients with MP ‐associated CAS, taking advantage of the large‐scale French collaborative observational study MYCADO on hospitalized patients with MP infection.

### Autoimmune hemolytic anemias | NEJM resident 360… [^114gtgLh]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Pearls Q: Do the histologic and genetic features of cold agglutinin disease differ from those of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. A: Cold agglutinin disease is an AIHA in which the autoantibody is a cold agglutinin and no underlying clinical disorder is present. Newer studies have shown that affected patients, who previously would have received a diagnosis of primary or idiopathic cold agglutinin disease, have a clonal lymphoproliferative bone marrow disease that can be difficult to recognize. The histopathological picture has often been interpreted as several types of low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, such as lymphoplasmacytic or marginal-zone lymphoma, but a relatively uniform disease, cold agglutinin–associated lymphoproliferative bone marrow disorder, is now thought to be the underlying condition.

The MYD88 L265P mutation, present in nearly all cases of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, is usually not found in cold agglutinin disease. Q: What is the difference between cold agglutinin disease and secondary cold agglutinin syndrome. A: The distinction between cold agglutinin disease and secondary cold agglutinin syndrome has been increasingly accepted. The latter is a rare, heterogeneous group of cold agglutinin–mediated AIHA disorders that are secondary to other diseases — most often, specific infections or cancers. A: In warm AIHA, antibodies have the highest affinity to the antigen at 37°C. The autoantibodies are polyclonal.

They are usually of the IgG class, but IgM warm antibodies may be involved, and in rare cases, IgA warm antibodies may be involved. The pathogenesis of warm AIHA is complex. The mononuclear phagocytic system in the spleen plays a major role in the breakdown of opsonized erythrocytes. The complement system, activated by the classical pathway, is involved in approximately half the cases.

### Severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia in ICU: a place for emergency plasma exchange? A French multicenter retrospective study [^115F7Kt5]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by autoantibody-mediated destruction of red blood cells. Its estimated prevalence is about 17 per 100,000 individuals. Severe hemolytic crises requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission represent a life-threatening acute complication, with reported mortality rates ranging from 13 to 30%. These cases present significant therapeutic challenges, as standard treatments often fail to rapidly control hemolysis and stabilize patients.

First-line corticosteroid therapy induces an initial response in approximately 80% of patients; however, it may take up to 2 weeks to be efficient. Second-line options, including Rituximab and other immunosuppressive agents, while effective, are also limited by their delayed onset of action. Besides, red blood cell transfusions, although essential in managing severe anemia and safe in most cases, are often reportedly ineffective, limiting their role in severe AIHA management.

In this context, plasma exchange (PlEx) therapy has emerged as a potential rescue treatment for severe hemolytic crises. By rapidly removing circulating autoantibodies and complement components, PlEx offers a theoretical advantage in stabilizing critically ill patients. However, clinical evidence supporting its efficacy in AIHA remains scarce and controversial. Current American guidelines classify PlEx as a category II recommendation for cold agglutinin disease (CAD) and category III for warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA), reflecting the lack of robust data.

Despite advances in understanding AIHA, a significant knowledge gap remains regarding patients with severe hemolytic crises requiring ICU admission, particularly those with profound anemia and organ failure due to active hemolysis. This study aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of severe AIHA in ICU, describing epidemiology, prognostic factors, and the potential role of PlEx in this high-risk population.

Table 1.
Patient demographics and disease characteristics at baseline

Primary endpoint

Sixteen patients (72.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 49.8, 89.3) treated with sutimlimab vs 3 patients (15.0%; 95% CI: 3.2, 37.9) who received placebo met the prespecified criteria for the composite primary endpoint and achieved the protocol-defined responder criteria (Figure 1). Patients who received 26 weeks of sutimlimab treatment had significantly greater odds of achieving the response criteria defined in the composite primary endpoint than patients receiving placebo (odds ratio [OR] 15.9; 95% CI: 2.9, 88.0; P < .001). At treatment assessment timepoint, 16 patients (72.7%) treated with sutimlimab vs 3 patients (15.0%) with placebo had an increase in Hb levels ≥ 1.5 g/dL from baseline. All 16 (72.7%) sutimlimab-treated patients had increased Hb levels ≥ 2.0 g/dL from baseline, compared with 2 (10.0%) patients on placebo (supplemental Table 1). Between weeks 5 and 26, 18 patients (81.8%) in the sutimlimab arm and 16 patients (80.0%) in the placebo arm did not receive blood transfusions. Most patients did not require use of protocol-prohibited CAD medication from week 5 to week 26 (sutimlimab n = 19, 86.4%; placebo n = 20, 100%).

### Sustained hematologic remission after discontinuation of sutimlimab treatment in patients with cold agglutinin disease [^114NfnzB]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) that leads to fatigue, a risk of thromboembolic events, and agglutination-mediated acrocyanosis. Binding of cold agglutinins to their antigen on red blood cells causes agglutination, fixes complement C1, and initiates the classical complement pathway. This leads to coating of the red blood cells with C3b and eventual extravascular hemolysis in the liver. Upstream inhibition of the classical complement pathway is a novel treatment in CAD. The monoclonal antibody sutimlimab binds to C1s, prevents downstream opsonization of red blood cells, and thereby effectively stops hemolysis, reduces fatigue, and increases hemoglobin levels.,

In vitro, C1s inhibition with sutimlimab significantly inhibited complement-mediated activation and proliferation of primary human B cells. Treatment with sutimlimab may therefore alter the pathogenic humoral immune response in patients with CAD. As of now, there is no clinical data available to support that concept in patients. We report post-trial observations of 3 patients with CAD after the end of the long-term treatment with sutimlimab.

### The diagnosis and management of primary autoimmune haemolytic anaemia [^114gxBYE]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for autoimmune hemolytic anemia, more specifically with respect to evaluation for underlying cause, BSH 2017 guidelines recommend to keep the clotted sample from patients with suspected cold agglutinin disease for protein electrophoresis and immunofixation at 37 °C until the serum has been separated.

### Sutimlimab in patients with cold agglutinin disease: results of the randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 CADENZA trial [^111TwTh5]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

The observed efficacy results in CADENZA correlated with near-complete inhibition of classical complement pathway activity from week 1 through end of treatment in the sutimlimab group. Classical complement pathway activity was below the normal range at baseline, which is consistent with the disease nature (continuous complement activation leading to consumption of complement components) and corroborated by the low levels of total C4 and CH50 observed at baseline. As C4 is the first substrate cleaved following activation of C1s, C4 levels are low in patients with CAD, owing to cold agglutinin-mediated classical complement pathway activation and continuous consumption. At week 26, mean classical complement pathway activity was almost completely inhibited in the sutimlimab arm. Blockade of C1s by sutimlimab increased circulating levels of C4 several-fold in patients, providing an in vivo marker of sutimlimab activity.

Sutimlimab treatment was generally well tolerated. The type and frequency of TEAEs were consistent with an elderly and medically complex patient population. Headache, hypertension, rhinitis, Raynaud phenomenon, and acrocyanosis were more frequent with sutimlimab vs placebo, with a difference of ≥ 3 patients between groups. No deaths were reported, and there were no reports of meningococcal infections. Serious infections were reported without leading to treatment discontinuation. No development of systemic lupus erythematosus or serious hypersensitivity reactions and/or anaphylaxis were reported in either group. A limitation of this study is that patient numbers were low but consistent with a rare disease with clinical heterogeneity that may have contributed to some baseline imbalances (higher female:male ratio). Observed baseline imbalances, including disabling circulatory symptoms, acrocyanosis, Raynaud phenomenon, and IgM levels (Table 1), may have impacted the results observed. Of note, the baseline imbalance in incidence of CAD symptoms was less distinct at week 26 (supplemental Table 6). Real-world evidence studies may help further characterize the effectiveness and safety of sutimlimab in CAD.

### Cold agglutinin disease [^116k5TwS]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

Cold agglutinin disease is a rare and poorly understood disorder affecting 15% of patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia. We reviewed the clinical and pathologic features, prognosis, and management in the literature and describe our institutional experience to improve strategies for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Retrospective analysis identified 89 patients from our institution with cold agglutinin disease from 1970 through 2012. Median age at symptom onset was 65 years (range, 41 to 83 years), whereas the median age at diagnosis was 72 years (range, 43 to 91 years). Median survival of all patients was 10.6 years, and 68 patients (76%) were alive 5 years after the diagnosis. The most common symptom was acrocyanosis (n = 39 [44%]), and many had symptoms triggered by cold (n = 35 [39%]) or other factors (n = 20 [22%]). An underlying hematologic disorder was detected in 69 patients (78%). Thirty-six patients (40%) received transfusions during their disease course, and 82% received drug therapy. Rituximab was associated with the longest response duration (median, 24 months) and the lowest proportion of patients needing further treatment (55%). Our institution's experience and review of the literature confirms that early diagnostic evaluation and treatment improves outcomes in cold agglutinin disease.

### A randomized, first-in-human, healthy volunteer trial of sutimlimab, a humanized antibody for the specific inhibition of the classical complement pathway [^115rNBWq]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Aberrant activation of the classical complement pathway is the common underlying pathophysiology of orphan diseases such as bullous pemphigoid, antibody-mediated rejection of organ transplants, cold agglutinin disease, and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Therapeutic options for these complement-mediated disorders are limited and sutimlimab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against complement factor C1s, may be potentially useful for inhibition of the classical complement pathway. A phase I, first-in-human, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial of single and multiple doses of sutimlimab or placebo was conducted in 64 volunteers to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles. Single and multiple infusions of sutimlimab were well tolerated without any safety concerns. sutimlimab exhibited a steep concentration-effect relationship with a Hill coefficient of 2.4, and an IC 90 of 15.5 μg/mL. This study establishes the foundation for using sutimlimab as a highly selective inhibitor of the classical complement pathway in different diseases.

### Hematologic immune-related adverse effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors: a review [^111ahEka]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory findings usually show decreased haptoglobin and hemoglobin (> 2 g/dL below baseline), elevated indirect bilirubin, LDH, and reticulocytes. Peripheral smear helps differentiate warm AIHA (spherocytes) from cold AIHA (RBC agglutination due to IgM autoantibodies). Diagnosis of ICI-related AIHA also requires a temporal relationship to ICI therapy and exclusion of other etiologies.

First-line therapy is glucocorticoids, typically oral prednisone 0.5–2 mg/kg, or IV methylprednisolone for acute severe cases or if the patient cannot tolerate enteral therapy. Barcellini et al. reported a 75% overall response among 308 steroid-treated patients. Alternative/adjunctive options include IVIG, transfusions, and hematopoietic growth factors. Splenectomy may be considered second-line, with infection precautions against encapsulated bacteria. Rituximab (anti-CD20) is another effective second-line therapy with ~ 70–80% response, sometimes studied with steroids. Immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) may be used for refractory cases. Warm AIHA responds best to these strategies, while cold AIHA shows limited steroid/splenectomy benefit; rituximab is first-line in cold AIHA.

Table 2 summarizes the key pathophysiologic mechanisms, clinical and laboratory features, and therapeutic strategies for autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

Cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS)

Cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS) results from cold agglutinins binding to RBCs at low temperatures, causing agglutination and complement-mediated hemolysis. CAS and cold agglutinin disease differ: CAS is secondary (e.g. infections, malignancies, ICI therapy), while CAD is primary clonal B-cell lymphoproliferation. CAS occurrence does not depend on ICI dose or treatment duration.

Diagnosis requires bone marrow biopsy, direct antiglobulin testing, smear evaluation, and flow cytometry. Most ICI-related CAS cases recover spontaneously. Persistent cases may require transfusion, plasmapheresis, steroids, or rituximab.

### FDA approves treatment for adults with rare type of anemia… [^116jjug6]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Action FDA has approved Enjaymo infusion to decrease the need for red blood cell transfusion due to hemolysis in adults with cold agglutinin disease. Disease or Condition CAD is an autoimmune disorder characterized by red blood cell destruction, which leads to anemia and cold-induced circulatory symptoms, such as pain and discoloration of fingers or toes. The disease is called "cold" agglutinin disease because the red cell destruction occurs at cold temperatures. Patients with CAD have a range in severity of anemia symptoms, which include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, fast heart rate, dizziness, and chest pain. Many patients with CAD need red blood cell transfusions to manage their disease. The disease is rare, affecting about one person per million annually, and mostly develops in individuals between ages 40 and 80 years.

Effectiveness The effectiveness of Enjaymo was assessed in a study of 24 adults with CAD who had a blood transfusion within the past six months. All participants received Enjaymo for up to six months and could choose to continue therapy in a second part of the trial. Based on body weight, participants received either a 6. 5g or
7. 5g infusion of Enjaymo into their vein on day 0, day 7, and every 14 days through week 25. In total, 54% of participants responded to Enjaymo. The response was defined in the study as:

- an increase in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or greater, and
- no red blood cell transfusions after the first five weeks of treatment; and no other therapies for CAD as defined in the study.

The most common side effects Enjaymo are respiratory tract infection, viral infection, diarrhea, dyspepsia, cough, arthralgia, arthritis, and swelling in the lower legs and hands. Please see the prescribing information for additional information on the risks associated with Enjaymo. Designations This application received orphan drug designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review.

Methods

Study design and patient population

CADENZA (NCT03347422) was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of sutimlimab in patients with CAD. Data were collected from 53 study locations, including sites in the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The results of Part A of the study, which consisted of the 26-week pivotal phase, was completed in September 2020. In brief, adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CAD, Hb ≤ 10.0 g/dL, bilirubin level above the normal reference range, ferritin level above the lower limit of normal, and no recent history of blood transfusion were randomised 1:1 to receive an intravenous infusion of sutimlimab (6.5 g for body weight < 75 kg; 7.5 g for ≥ 75 kg) or placebo (500 mL) on day 0, 7, and every 14 days thereafter through week 25.

Cold agglutinin disease

Definition, pathogenesis, and clinical features

CAD is a cAIHA mediated by cold agglutinins (CA), i.e. autoantibodies able to agglutinate RBCs at temperatures below 37 °C. Absence of any underlying clinical disease is also part of the disease definition. The CA are produced by a clonal B-cell lymphoproliferative process of the bone marrow, not considered a malignant lymphoma. The lymphoid infiltration can be sparse and easily overlooked or misdiagnosed as non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Patients may have non-complement mediated agglutination symptoms such as acrocyanosis and Raynaud-like phenomena. Classical complement activation results in coating of RBCs with C3b and phagocytosis of opsonized RBCs (extravascular haemolysis), mainly in the liver. Terminal complement activation and intravascular haemolysis can occur in severe CAD. Patients have an increased risk of thrombosis.

Diagnosis

Fig. 1 outlines the diagnostic procedure. A significant CA titre is required for diagnosis; usually > 64, often much higher (Fig. 3). Determination of the thermal amplitude (the highest temperature at which agglutination occurs) is sometimes useful. Serum protein electrophoresis, bone marrow biopsy, and flow cytometry will reveal the clonal nature of CAD in many but not all cases. Specific precautions are needed in handling blood specimens (Table 3).

Fig. 3
Cold agglutinin titration. Doubling dilutions of plasma or serum are prepared, ranging up to 1:512. Further dilutions are made if agglutination still occurs at the highest dilution. 1 drop of each dilution is added to 1 drop of a 2% suspension of washed group O donor erythrocytes and incubated at 4 °C. Chilled slides are read macroscopically at room temperature. The titre is the inverse of the highest dilution at which agglutination can be seen.

Table 3
Cold agglutinin disease: handling of samples.

Treatment

Corticosteroids are ineffective and should not be used in CAD. Not all patients need drug therapy, but symptomatic anaemia, significant fatigue, or bothersome circulatory symptoms are indications for treatment. Treatment options are listed in Table 4.,

### Primary chronic cold agglutinin disease: a population based clinical study of 86 patients [^115DaNxH]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Our knowledge of primary chronic cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is incomplete. The aim of this study was to collect comprehensive and precise data the on epidemiology, clinical and pathological features, course, and therapy of CAD.

Design and Methods

We performed a population-based retrospective follow-up study of as many as possible of all CAD patients in Norway. Eighty-six patients were studied.

Results

The prevalence of primary CAD was 16 cases per million inhabitants. The incidence rate was 1 per million per year. The median age at onset was 67 years (range, 30–92) and the male to female ratio was 0.55. The median survival was 12.5 years from onset. Autoimmune diseases other than CAD were reported in 8% of patients, cold-induced circulatory symptoms in 91%, and exacerbation of hemolytic anemia during febrile illness in 74%. At least 51% had received red blood cell transfusions. The mean initial hemoglobin level was 9.2 g/dL (range, 4.5–15.6) and the median monoclonal immunoglobulin level 4.0 g/L (range, 0.0–47.3). Most laboratory findings did not change significantly during a median follow-up of 5 years. Monoclonal IgM was detected in 90%; IgG and IgA in 3.5% each; with kappa light chains in 94%. An abnormal kappa/lambda ratio in bone marrow was found in 90%, lymphoma in 76%, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma in 50%. Transformation to aggressive lymphoma occurred in 3.5% during 10 years. Rituximab therapy was the only treatment showing acceptable response rates (60%).

Interpretation and Conclusions

Primary CAD represents a spectrum of clonal lymphoproliferative bone marrow disorders, in most cases with morphological signs of lymphoma. Despite a favorable prognosis for survival, the disease is not indolent in terms of clinical manifestations.

### Management of cold haemolytic syndrome [^113gWJ5N]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Most haemolytic disease is mediated by immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and leads to red blood cell destruction outside of the circulatory system. However, rare syndromes, such as paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria, show IgG antibodies causing intravascular destruction. Haemolysis may also occur because of immunoglobulin M antibodies. Historically, these antibodies have been termed 'cold agglutinins' because they cause agglutination of red blood cells at 3 degrees C. Cold agglutinin haemolytic anaemia has been associated with a number of autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders, and its management differs substantially from warm antibody-mediated haemolytic anaemia. This review of cold haemolytic syndromes describes new therapies and clinical strategies to determine a correct diagnosis.

Diagnosis

Fig. 1 shows a diagnostic algorithm. Autoimmune pathogenesis, indicated by the presence of immunoglobulin and/or complement on the RBC surface, is detected by the polyspecific ("simple") DAT (Fig. 2). In the monospecific ("extended") DAT, mandatory for subclassification, immunoglobulin class (es) or complement protein(s) on the RBC surface are identified by using specific antibody reagents, usually against IgG, IgM, IgA, C3c, and C3d. In wAIHA, the DAT is typically positive for IgG or IgG + C. A positive test for C3d and, sometimes, C3c indicates complement activation, which occurs in all patients with cold-antibody AIHA (cAIHA), about 50% of wAIHA cases, and all cases of mixed AIHA.

### Sustained improvements in patient-reported outcomes after long-term sutimlimab in patients with cold agglutinin disease: results from the CADENZA study open-label extension [^113RoPKs]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Part A of the CADENZA study showed that 26 weeks of treatment with sutimlimab inhibited activity in the classical complement pathway, halted haemolysis, increased Hb levels, and reduced fatigue in patients with CAD, relative to placebo. In Part B of CADENZA, treatment with sutimlimab continued to inhibit haemolysis and improve anaemia and QoL for up to 1 year after the last patient finished Part A. Responses were similar in patients administered sutimlimab throughout the study and those who switched to sutimlimab in Part B. Sutimlimab was generally well tolerated throughout the study. Overall, the type and frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events were generally consistent with those expected for this patient population.

The results described in the current paper demonstrated that improvements seen with sutimlimab during Part A in fatigue and overall QoL, were maintained with continued sutimlimab treatment in Part B, for up to 1 year after the last patient finished Part A. Patients previously treated with placebo in Part A demonstrated rapid improvements in PRO measures when switched to sutimlimab in Part B. Throughout Part B, most of the combined group reported improved QoL compared with baseline.

### Monoclonal antibodies for treatment of cold agglutinin disease [^114UPYKg]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a difficult-to-treat autoimmune hemolytic anemia and B cell lymphoproliferative disorder associated with fatigue, acrocyanosis, and a risk of thromboembolic events. Cold-induced binding of autoantibody agglutinates red blood cells and triggers the classical complement pathway, leading to predominantly extravascular hemolysis.

Areas Covered

This review summarizes clinical and experimental antibody-based treatments for CAD and analyzes the risks and benefits of B cell and complement directed therapies, and discusses potential future treatments for CAD.

Expert Opinion

Conventional treatment of CAD includes a B cell targeted treatment approach with rituximab, yielding only limited treatment success. The addition of a cytotoxic agent (e.g. bendamustine) increases efficacy, but this is accompanied by an increased risk of neutropenia and infection. Novel complement directed therapies have emerged and were shown to have good efficacy against hemolysis and safety profiles but are expensive and unable to address circulatory symptoms. Complement inhibition with sutimlimab may be used as a bridging strategy until B cell directed therapy with rituximab takes effect or continued indefinitely if needed. Future antibody-based treatment approaches for CAD involve the further development of complement directed antibodies, a combination of rituximab and bortezomib, and daratumumab. Non-antibody based prospective treatments may include the use of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

### Complement C1s inhibition with sutimlimab results in durable response in cold agglutinin disease: CARDINAL study 1-year interim follow-up results [^112FAvfM]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Sutimlimab (BIVV009; TNT009) is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to target C1s, the C1 complex serine protease responsible for activating the classical complement pathway which triggers hemolysis in cold agglutinin disease (CAD). Results from the pivotal CARDINAL study showed sutimlimab to be an efficacious and well-tolerated therapy during 26 weeks of treatment among CAD patients. We present 1-year interim results of the ongoing 2-year CARDINAL extension which show that sutimlimab has a sustained treatment effect in CAD via long-term complement inhibition. Sutimlimab maintained mean hemoglobin levels ≥ 11 g/dL with sustained improvement in quality of life; no new safety concerns were identified.

CAD is a rare autoimmune hemolytic anemia characterized by chronic hemolysis mediated entirely by activation of the classical complement pathway.CAD is a low-grade clonal lymphoproliferative disorder with no underlying overt malignancy or infection. Clinical manifestations of CAD include classical complement pathway-mediated chronic hemolytic anemia, profound fatigue, acute hemolytic crises, as well as transient, cold-induced, red blood cell agglutination-mediated circulatory symptoms including acrocyanosis. There are currently no approved therapies for CAD. Unapproved pharmacological modalities offer varying efficacy and safety, as well as different response rates and response durations. Rituximab depletes B cells and induces a partial response in approximately 50% of patients, with a median delay of 1.5 months and relapse within 1 year. The addition of cytotoxic agents (bendamustine or fludarabine) to rituximab, although associated with increased response rates, is accompanied by more serious toxicity, including severe neutropenia. Blood transfusions are reserved for acute hemolytic anemia and are only a transient temporizing measure; other treatment is required to restrain CAD-associated hemolysis, to which transfused red blood cells are also subjected. Thus, an alternative treatment that is non-cytotoxic, rapid, and durable in controlling classical complement-mediated hemolysis and its clinical manifestations in CAD patients is needed.

### How I manage patients with cold agglutinin disease [^111pq6bW]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is an uncommon autoimmune haemolytic anaemia in which a well-defined, clonal low-grade lymphoproliferative disorder of the bone marrow results in erythrocyte destruction mediated by the classical complement pathway. The pathogenesis, clinical features and diagnostic criteria are reviewed. Although anaemia is mild in some patients, approximately one-third of untreated patients have a haemoglobin level of ≤ 80 g/l, and about 50% have been considered transfusion dependent for shorter or longer periods. Therapy has improved greatly during the last 15 years. Mild disease can be managed by avoidance of cold and adequate precautions in specific situations, without drug therapy. Corticosteroids should not be used to treat CAD. Patients requiring pharmacological therapy should be considered for prospective trials. Outside clinical studies, the rituximab-bendamustine combination or rituximab monotherapy is recommended in the first line, depending on individual patient characteristics. Second-line options are rituximab-fludarabine in fit patients or, although less strongly documented, a bortezomib-based regimen. Therapies targeting the classical complement pathway are promising, and the complement C1s inhibitor, BIVV009, has shown favourable results in preliminary studies.

### Long-term sutimlimab improves quality of life for patients with cold agglutinin disease: CARDINAL 2-year follow-up [^112mQbfq]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare but serious type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, characterized by chronic hemolysis mediated by cold agglutinins, primarily monoclonal immunoglobulin M antibodies, which bind to erythrocytes and initiate activation of the classical complement pathway. This disease accounts for 15% to 25% of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, with a reported prevalence of 16 per million people in Northern Europe, and an incidence rate of 1 per million per year, primarily in the older adult population. Patients with CAD can experience deleterious, complement-mediated symptoms, including chronic hemolysis, anemia, fatigue, and hemoglobinuria, as well as transient, cold-induced agglutination–mediated circulatory symptoms, such as acrocyanosis and Raynaud's phenomenon. These symptoms impose a severe burden on quality of life (QoL), in addition to an increased risk of thromboembolism and early mortality. In particular, fatigue has been found to affect 90% of patients with CAD, and patients report a negative effect on their daily activities, physical well-being, emotional well-being, social life, and household finances.

Sutimlimab is a first-in-class, humanized, monoclonal antibody designed to selectively target C1s, a serine protease of the C1-complex responsible for activating the classical complement pathway of the immune system. By selectively inhibiting the classical complement pathway at C1s, sutimlimab leaves the immune functions of the lectin and alternative complement pathways intact. CARDINAL (NCT03347396) was a prospective, open-label, single-arm, 2-part, multicenter phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy, durability of effect, safety, and tolerability of sutimlimab in patients with primary CAD and a recent history of transfusion. After completion of the 26-week pivotal phase of the study (part A) in 2019, the 1-year interim in 2020 and the 2-year, long-term extension phase (part B) in 2021, sutimlimab was found to be an effective and well-tolerated therapy.

### WaldenströM macroglobulinemia treatment algorithm 2018 [^113cT4cu]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

IgM-associated neuropathy is a common problem in practice. In most instances, the pathophysiology involves an IgM monoclonal protein that binds to the myelin sheath and causes demyelination and widened myelin lamellae. The IgM has antiganglioside antibody activity in 35% of patients; 40–50% have an IgM that binds to myelin-associated glycoprotein. Pathogenesis is a direct effect of M proteins on the peripheral nerve, leading to demyelination.

These syndromes are unique insofar as significant reduction in the IgM protein may have little or no impact on the clinical manifestations of the disease. In Waldenström macroglobulinemia, a 50% reduction in the IgM protein can result in dramatic reversal of anemia, lymphadenopathy, and hyperviscosity. In cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin disease, and IgM neuropathy, a 50% reduction in the M protein may not result in clear-cut benefit. Moreover, the optimal reduction of the IgM protein is unknown. The endpoint of peripheral neuropathy is very difficult to evaluate. Even when the IgM is suppressed, the best that can be expected may be stabilization of the neuropathy. Long-term damage to the myelin sheath can result in irreversible axonal damage. Nerve regrowth and recovery may not be a realistic endpoint and it is, thereby, difficult to distinguish therapeutic failure from what may be stabilization of disease. In most instances, a trial of rituximab is justified and has been reported to provide benefit in patients with IgM-associated neuropathy, cold agglutinin hemolysis, and cryoglobulinemia.

### Complement inhibitors to treat IgM-mediated autoimmune hemolysis [^1116m3Bm]. Haematologica (2015). Low credibility.

Complement activation in autoimmune hemolytic anemia may exacerbate extravascular hemolysis and may occasionally result in intravascular hemolysis. IgM autoantibodies as characteristically found in cold autoantibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia, in cold agglutinin disease but also in a considerable percentage of patients with warm autoantibodies are very likely to activate complement in vivo. Therapy of IgM-mediated autoimmune hemolytic anemia mainly aims to decrease autoantibody production. However, most of these treatments require time to become effective and will not stop immediate ongoing complement-mediated hemolysis nor prevent hemolysis of transfused red blood cells. Therefore pharmacological inhibition of the complement system might be a suitable approach to halt or at least attenuate ongoing hemolysis and improve the recovery of red blood cell transfusion in autoimmune hemolytic anemia. In recent years, several complement inhibitors have become available in the clinic, some of them with proven efficacy in autoimmune hemolytic anemia. In the present review, we give a short introduction on the pathogenesis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, followed by an overview on the complement system with a special focus on its regulation. Finally, we will discuss complement inhibitors with regard to their potential efficacy to halt or attenuate hemolysis in complement-mediated autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

6 Future Research Directions

Future research efforts should focus on the development and implementation of standardized diagnostic criteria for mixed AIHA and the establishment of prospective, multicenter registries to better characterize this rare condition. Immunohematology evaluation should include characterization of both the warm and cold components, including serum and elution studies, cold agglutinin titers, and thermal amplitude testing. While antibody titer testing may be more widely available, titers are subject to wide inter‐ and intra‐laboratory variation, and future research should investigate the effect of changes in thermal amplitude over the course of therapy on clinical outcomes.

Importantly, there is a pressing need for clinical recommendations that guide a standardized diagnostic approach, not only to improve case definitions for research but also to inform treatment selection and monitor therapeutic response. Diagnostic inconsistencies across studies have contributed to challenges in interpreting treatment efficacy, as the lack of detailed immunohematologic characterization obscures whether observed outcomes reflect true therapeutic effects or underlying diagnostic heterogeneity. Future recommendations should emphasize incorporating comprehensive immunohematology testing into both initial and longitudinal patient evaluations, ideally with defined testing protocols that can be adopted across institutions. Without such diagnostic rigor, clinicians and researchers cannot reliably determine whether treatments are effective or ineffective, hindering both evidence synthesis and patient care. Establishing clear diagnostic benchmarks will enhance the interpretability of future studies and may facilitate biomarker development to predict treatment response.

### Sutimlimab in patients with cold agglutinin disease: results of the randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 CADENZA trial [^112nvZ4Z]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with CAD may experience complement-mediated symptoms, including chronic hemolysis resulting in anemia, profound fatigue, and jaundice; non-complement-mediated symptoms include transient, cold-induced agglutination-mediated circulatory symptoms, such as acrocyanosis and Raynaud phenomenon. Patients with CAD also have an increased risk of thromboembolism and early mortality. As with other causes of anemia, patients with CAD are more likely to have reduced quality of life, depression, and anxiety.

Prior to the recent approval of sutimlimab in the United States (Sanofi 2022), there were no approved therapies for CAD. Supportive care with cold avoidance alone is often inadequate and does not address complement-mediated symptoms, as chronic hemolytic anemia persists year-round. Rituximab broadly depletes B cells and induces partial responses in ∼50% of patients after a median delay of 1.5 months, and relapses usually occur within 1 year. Addition of cytotoxic agents, such as fludarabine or bendamustine, to rituximab is associated with higher response rates but is accompanied by more serious toxic effects, including severe neutropenia. Eculizumab, a C5 inhibitor, reduces the need for transfusion and reduces lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels but elicits only a modest increase in hemoglobin (Hb) levels in patients with CAD because it does not inhibit extravascular hemolysis. Despite not being recommended because of poor response rates and often requiring unacceptably high doses, corticosteroids are often used in CAD management. Other approaches such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and splenectomy are not effective in CAD and are also not recommended.

### Inhibition of complement C1s in patients with cold agglutinin disease: lessons learned from a named patient program [^114F4Fm1]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) causes predominantly extravascular hemolysis and anemia via complement activation. Sutimlimab is a novel humanized monoclonal antibody directed against classical pathway complement factor C1s. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term maintenance treatment with sutimlimab in patients with CAD. Seven CAD patients treated with sutimlimab as part of a phase 1B study were transitioned to a named patient program. After a loading dose, patients received biweekly (once every 2 weeks) infusions of sutimlimab at various doses. When a patient's laboratory data showed signs of breakthrough hemolysis, the dose of sutimlimab was increased. Three patients started with a dose of 45 mg/kg, another 3 with 60 mg/kg, and 1 with a fixed dose of 5.5 g every other week. All CAD patients responded to re-treatment, and sutimlimab increased hemoglobin from a median initial level of 7.7 g/dL to a median peak of 12.5 g/dL (P = .016). Patients maintained near normal hemoglobin levels except for a few breakthrough events that were related to underdosing and which resolved after the appropriate dose increase. Four of the patients included were eventually treated with a biweekly 5.5 g fixed-dose regimen of sutimlimab. None of them had any breakthrough hemolysis. All patients remained transfusion free while receiving sutimlimab. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Overlapping treatment with erythropoietin, rituximab, or ibrutinib in individual patients was safe and did not cause untoward drug interactions. Long-term maintenance treatment with sutimlimab was safe, effectively inhibited hemolysis, and significantly increased hemoglobin levels in re-exposed, previously transfusion-dependent CAD patients.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of continued complement C1s inhibition with sutimlimab in cold agglutinin disease: CADENZA study part B [^115vyK9E]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare autoimmune haemolytic anaemia mediated by the classical complement pathway (CP). Sutimlimab selectively targets complement C1s inhibiting classical CP activation. In CADENZA Part A (26-weeks), a placebo-controlled study in patients without recent transfusion history, sutimlimab reduced haemolysis, anaemia, and fatigue, and was generally well tolerated.

Methods

The CADENZA study (NCT03347422) started in March 2018 (Part A) and completed in December 2021 (Part B). All patients in Part B were eligible to receive sutimlimab for up to 1 year after the last patient completed Part A. Efficacy and safety was assessed throughout Part B, until the last on-treatment visit with available assessment (LV), and after a 9-week washout.

Findings

In total, 32/39 patients completed Part B; median treatment duration: 99 weeks. Similar sustained improvements in haemolysis, anaemia, and quality of life were observed in patients switching to sutimlimab and those continuing sutimlimab. Mean LV values for the combined group (ie, placebo-to-sutimlimab group and sutimlimab-to-sutimlimab group) improved from baseline for haemoglobin (≥ 11.0 g/dL on-treatment vs 9.3 g/dL at baseline), bilirubin (≤ 20.0 μmol/L on-treatment vs 35.0 μmol/L at baseline), and FACIT-Fatigue scores. Following a 9-week washout, inhibition of CP activity was reversed, and haemolytic markers approached baseline levels. Overall, sutimlimab was generally well tolerated throughout the study. No patients developed systemic lupus erythematosus or meningococcal infections. During the 9-week washout, most adverse events could be attributed to recurrence of underlying CAD.

Interpretation

The CADENZA Part B results support the sustained efficacy and safety of sutimlimab for treatment of CAD; however, upon discontinuation disease activity reoccurs.

Funding

### Cold agglutinin disease revisited: a multinational, observational study of 232 patients [^115ERk2N]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

We retrospectively studied 232 patients with cold agglutinin disease (CAD) at 24 centers in 5 countries. In Norway and a northern region of Italy, the study was close to being population-based. For the first time, we demonstrate fourfold differences between cold and warmer climates regarding prevalence (20 vs 5 cases/million) and incidence (1.9 vs 0.48 cases/million per year). Mean baseline hemoglobin level was 9.3 g/dL, but 27% had hemoglobin < 8 g/dL. Identification of typical features of CAD-associated lymphoproliferative disorder in the bone marrow was greatly increased by centralized biopsy assessment. CAD seems to be associated with a slightly increased risk of venous thrombosis. This work includes a follow-up study of therapies, focusing on the long-term outcomes of the rituximab plus bendamustine and rituximab plus fludarabine regimens. Rituximab plus bendamustine therapy resulted in responses in 35 (78%) of 45 patients; 24 (53%) achieved complete response. Interestingly, these rates were still higher than observed in the original (2017) prospective trial, and we also found a shift toward deeper responses with time. This is explained by the prolonged time to response seen in many patients, probably related to long-lived plasma cells. In patients responding to rituximab-bendamustine, median response duration was not reached after 88 months, and estimated 5-year sustained remission was 77%. The regimen appeared safe regarding late-occurring malignancies. Rituximab plus fludarabine therapy seems to carry a higher risk of long-term adverse effects.

Introduction

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare, autoimmune hemolytic anemia mediated by the classical complement pathway (CP). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) autoantibodies, known as cold agglutinins, preferentially bind to the I antigen on erythrocytes at temperatures of 37°C or lower, resulting in erythrocyte agglutination. IgM is a potent trigger of the classical CP, whereby antigen-IgM complexes on erythrocytes bind to complement protein complex C1, composed of C1q, C1r, and C1s, and result in CP activation, thereafter, C1s activates C4 and C2, generating C3 convertase C4b2a, which cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. In CAD, this cascade predominantly results in extravascular hemolysis mediated by macrophages of the mononuclear phagocytic system, which removes C3b–coated red blood cells. Intravascular hemolysis occurs to a lesser extent via the terminal complement cascade, whereby increased levels of C3b contribute to C5 convertase formation and membrane attack complex (C5b-9) production.

All patients with CAD have complement-mediated hemolysis. Only a few patients are not anemic because the hemolysis is fully compensated, depending on the balance between hemolytic activity and bone marrow compensation. Clinical features of CAD mediated by the CP include anemia, profound fatigue, dyspnea, and jaundice. These patients may also experience cold-induced circulatory symptoms (non-complement-mediated) including acrocyanosis and Raynaud phenomenon. Medically-attended anxiety or depression is more likely to occur in patients with CAD, compared with the general population, which may impact their quality of life. In addition, these patients have a higher risk of thromboembolic events and early mortality by any cause compared with the general population. Symptoms of CAD contribute to a high burden on health care resource utilization including inpatient, outpatient, and emergency services.

### Sutimlimab in patients with cold agglutinin disease: results of the randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 CADENZA trial [^1139ZsFz]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, CADENZA phase 3 data support the targeted inhibition of C1s as an effective and well-tolerated treatment for patients with CAD. Statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences were demonstrated between sutimlimab and placebo, further supporting the efficacy of sutimlimab. Sutimlimab has a novel and targeted mechanism of action that specifically addresses the underlying cause of chronic hemolytic anemia in CAD. These data show that targeting the classical complement pathway at C1s represents a new, effective therapeutic approach for CAD management, independent of transfusion status, with treatment responses as early as week 1 and a favorable tolerability profile.

### Daratumumab monotherapy in refractory warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and cold agglutinin disease [^114Gzqrn]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations of this study are related to its retrospective design and the low incidence of refractory AIHA that both leads to the potential for selection bias as well as incompleteness of data; that is regarding adverse events, the small number of cases, the variable dosing schedules, and the lack of a control group. Furthermore, we cannot exclude late responses to the comedication given before initiation of daratumumab treatment.

In conclusion, daratumumab monotherapy may be an effective and well-tolerated treatment option associated with rapid responses for a proportion of refractory patients with AIHA, with an effect on both the hemolytic anemia as well as the cold-induced circulatory symptoms. Prospective studies should confirm these findings including the role of daratumumab maintenance therapy in patients showing an initial response. Furthermore, it would be relevant to understand better which subpopulations of patients with AIHA might be more likely to respond. The immunomodulatory effects that we observed may provide additional mechanisms via which daratumumab leads to response in patients with refractory wAIHA.

### TNT003, an inhibitor of the serine protease C1s, prevents complement activation induced by cold agglutinins [^113z1vT9]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Activation of the classical pathway (CP) of complement is often associated with autoimmune disorders in which disease pathology is linked to the presence of an autoantibody. One such disorder is cold agglutinin disease (CAD), an autoimmune hemolytic anemia in which autoantibodies (cold agglutinins) bind to red blood cells (RBCs) at low temperatures. Anemia occurs as a result of autoantibody-mediated CP activation on the surface of the erythrocyte, leading to the deposition of complement opsonins that drive extravascular hemolysis in the liver. Here we test the effects of TNT003, a mouse monoclonal antibody targeting the CP-specific serine protease C1s, on CP activity induced by cold agglutinins on human RBCs. We collected 40 individual CAD patient samples and showed that TNT003 prevented cold agglutinin-mediated deposition of complement opsonins that promote phagocytosis of RBCs. Furthermore, we show that by preventing CP activation, TNT003 also prevents cold agglutinin-driven generation of anaphylatoxins. Finally, we provide evidence that CP activity in CAD patients terminates prior to activation of the terminal cascade, supporting the hypothesis that the primary route of RBC destruction in these patients occurs via extravascular hemolysis. Our results support the development of a CP inhibitor for the treatment of CAD.

Regarding medical management for autoimmune hemolytic anemia, more specifically with respect to management of primary cold AIHA (avoidance of cold), BSH 2017 guidelines recommend to implement a policy for cold agglutinin screening before cold cardioplegia and for the management of unexpected agglutination detected during cold cardioplegia in all cardiothoracic units.

### Cold agglutinin-mediated autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^114Bii1u]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Cold antibody types account for about 25% of autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Primary chronic cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is characterized by a clonal lymphoproliferative disorder. Secondary cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS) complicates specific infections and malignancies. Hemolysis in CAD and CAS is mediated by the classical complement pathway and is predominantly extravascular. Not all patients require treatment. Successful CAD therapy targets the pathogenic B-cell clone. Complement modulation seems promising in both CAD and CAS. Further development and documentation are necessary before clinical use. We review options for possible complement-directed therapy.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of continued complement C1s inhibition with sutimlimab in cold agglutinin disease: CADENZA study part B [^1174Kx9p]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare subtype of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) mediated by classical complement pathway (CP) activation. CAD accounts for 15–30% of all AIHAs. In CAD, a low-grade lymphoproliferative disorder, cold agglutinin autoantibodies, usually of the immunoglobulin M (IgM)-κ class, are produced by clonal B cells. In the majority of cases these IgM-κ autoantibodies recognise the "I" antigen, which is present on the surface of red blood cells (RBC), and the recognition of RBC antigens can cause RBC agglutination at or below 37°C. The cold agglutinin–antigen complexes on RBCs trigger the classical CP, which leads to RBC destruction predominantly by extravascular haemolysis and phagocytosis, occurring mainly in the liver, and to a lesser extent, intravascular haemolysis via the terminal complement cascade.

### Sutimlimab in patients with cold agglutinin disease: results of the randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 CADENZA trial [^114ReD8h]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Sutimlimab, a first-in-class humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits the classical complement pathway at C1s, rapidly halted hemolysis in the single-arm CARDINAL study in recently transfused patients with cold agglutinin disease (CAD). CADENZA was a 26-week randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 study to assess safety and efficacy of sutimlimab in patients with CAD without recent (within 6 months prior to enrollment) transfusion history. Forty-two patients with screening hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL, elevated bilirubin, and ≥ 1 CAD symptom received sutimlimab (n = 22) or placebo (n = 20) on days 0 and 7 and then biweekly. Composite primary endpoint criteria (hemoglobin increase ≥ 1.5 g/dL at treatment assessment timepoint [mean of weeks 23, 25, 26], avoidance of transfusion, and study-prohibited CAD therapy [weeks 5–26]) were met by 16 patients (73%) on sutimlimab, and 3 patients (15%) on placebo (odds ratio, 15.9 [95% confidence interval, 2.9, 88.0; P < .001]). Sutimlimab, but not placebo, significantly increased mean hemoglobin and FACIT-Fatigue scores at treatment assessment timepoint. Sutimlimab normalized mean bilirubin by week 1. Improvements correlated with near-complete inhibition of the classical complement pathway (2.3% mean activity at week 1) and C4 normalization. Twenty-one (96%) sutimlimab patients and 20 (100%) placebo patients experienced ≥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse event. Headache, hypertension, rhinitis, Raynaud phenomenon, and acrocyanosis were more frequent with sutimlimab vs placebo, with a difference of ≥ 3 patients between groups. Three sutimlimab patients discontinued owing to adverse events; no placebo patients discontinued. These data demonstrate that sutimlimab has potential to be an important advancement in the treatment of CAD. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03347422.

### How I manage cold agglutinin disease [^111uZXwD]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary chronic cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a clonal lymphoproliferative disorder accounting for 13–15% of autoimmune haemolytic anaemias. Significant advances have been made in treatment, which was largely unsuccessful until recently. The essential clinical, immunological and pathological features are reviewed, focusing on their relevance for therapy. Non-pharmacological management still seems sufficient in some patients. With the recent improvements, however, drug therapy seems indicated more often than previously thought. Corticosteroids should not be used to treat CAD. Half of the patients respond to rituximab monotherapy; median response duration is 11 months. Fludarabine-rituximab combination therapy is very effective, resulting in 75% response rate, complete remissions in about 20%, and more than 66 months estimated response duration. Toxicity is a concern, and benefits should be carefully weighed against risks. An individualized approach is discussed regarding the choice of fludarabine-rituximab combination versus rituximab monotherapy. Patients requiring treatment should be considered for prospective trials.

### Cold agglutinin disease and the nephrotic syndrome… [^114ASRBB]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A 66-year-old woman entered the hospital with both chronic, idiopathic cold agglutinin disease, manifested primarily by severe hemolytic anemia, and the nephrotic syndrome. The cold agglutinin was unusual in that it was cryoprecipitable, had a very wide thermal amplitude, and possessed intense hemolytic activity. The usual causes of the nephrotic syndrome were absent and postmortem examination revealed normal-appearing glomeruli. We suggest that the IgM cold agglutinin, alone or in combination with serum complement, was etiologically related to the induction of the nephrotic syndrome via attack on the glomerular basement membrane. Treatment with chlorambucil did not significantly alter the patient's hematologic or renal disorders. Poth JL, Sharp GS, Schrier SL. Cold Agglutinin Disease and the Nephrotic Syndrome.

### Cold agglutinin disease [^115Pkovj]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Primary chronic cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a well-defined clinicopathologic entity in which a specific, clonal lymphoproliferative B-cell bone marrow disorder results in autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The immune hemolysis is entirely complement-dependent, predominantly mediated by activation of the classical pathway and phagocytosis of erythrocytes opsonized with complement protein C3b. Typical clinical features in CAD have diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Pharmacologic treatment should be offered to patients with symptom-producing anemia or disabling circulatory symptoms. CAD should not be treated with corticosteroids. Based on an individualized approach, rituximab monotherapy or rituximab-fludarabine in combination is recommended as first-line therapy. Rituximab-bendamustine is still an investigational therapy. Although complement-modulating agents are still to be considered experimental in CAD, therapy with the anti-C1s monoclonal antibody TNT009 seems promising.

### How I treat cold agglutinin disease [^1138XbQ9]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

The last decades have seen great progress in the treatment of cold agglutinin disease (CAD). Comparative trials are lacking, and recommendations must be based mainly on nonrandomized trials and will be influenced by personal experience. Herein, current treatment options are reviewed and linked to 3 cases, each addressing specific aspects of therapy. Two major steps in CAD pathogenesis are identified, clonal B-cell lymphoproliferation and complement-mediated hemolysis, each of which constitutes a target of therapy. Although drug treatment is not always indicated, patients with symptomatic anemia or other bothersome symptoms should be treated. The importance of avoiding ineffective therapies is underscored. Corticosteroids should not be used to treat CAD. Studies on safety and efficacy of relevant drugs and combinations are briefly described. The author recommends that B cell-directed approaches remain the first choice in most patients requiring treatment. The 4-cycle bendamustine plus rituximab combination is highly efficacious and sufficiently safe and induces durable responses in most patients, but the time to response can be many months. Rituximab monotherapy should be preferred in frail patients. The complement C1s inhibitor sutimlimab is an emerging option in the second line and may also find its place in the first line in specific situations.
