## Question

NMDMA ain't the use of PTSD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is an effective treatment for PTSD and how to interpret the current evidence and regulatory status. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical trial evidence base, especially the phase 3 randomized controlled trials. Then, I should verify effect sizes and clinical significance. Next, I will examine safety, tolerability, and blinding issues. After that, I need to check guideline positions and the FDA's regulatory decision. Finally, I will consider implementation challenges and synthesize a balanced, clinically useful conclusion with appropriate caveats and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the highest-quality evidence. Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials (MAPP1 and MAPP2) evaluated MDMA-assisted therapy versus placebo with identical manualized psychotherapy in adults with moderate-to-severe PTSD. Both used centralized, blinded independent raters and showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in PTSD symptom severity on CAPS-5 at 18 weeks, with moderate-to-large between-group effect sizes, which supports efficacy under controlled conditions [^113UyqaM] [^111XUSWt] [^113id9aa].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and clinical relevance. In MAPP1, the mean CAPS-5 reduction favored MDMA by about 10.5 points versus placebo with therapy, with a Cohen's d around 0.91. In MAPP2, the advantage was about 8.9 points with d ≈ 0.7, and responder analyses showed substantially higher rates of loss of diagnosis and remission with MDMA, which aligns with clinically meaningful change thresholds agreed with FDA for CAPS-5 [^113UyqaM] [^111XUSWt] [^113Veiu6].

> I should confirm durability and functional outcomes. Long-term follow-up from phase 2 cohorts and pooled analyses suggest sustained benefits 12 months after the last MDMA session, with a high proportion maintaining remission. Functional impairment on the Sheehan Disability Scale also improved in phase 3 trials, indicating gains beyond symptom scales, though replication and larger pragmatic studies are still needed to confirm generalizability [^114B8pQW] [^111XUSWt] [^11381AVa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety. Across phase 3 trials, MDMA was generally well tolerated without excess serious adverse events versus placebo. Common transient effects include muscle tightness, nausea, decreased appetite, and modest cardiovascular increases, and suicidality did not increase overall, though isolated treatment-emergent serious ideation occurred and warrants monitoring and REMS-style safeguards if implemented clinically [^113UyqaM] [^111XUSWt] [^115Kipxy].

> Hmm, wait a minute, blinding and expectancy are important. Blinding surveys show high correct identification of assignment, especially in the MDMA arm, which could inflate perceived effects; however, the trials mitigated this with centralized, blinded raters, structured manuals, and conservative statistical estimands, and the placebo-with-therapy arm also improved substantially, indicating that psychotherapy and context contribute meaningfully while MDMA adds incremental benefit [^113DonLK] [^114a66RS] [^113fjzYU].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure I'm not overstating consensus. The VA/DoD 2023 guideline judged the evidence insufficient to recommend for or against MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, citing small samples, few Veterans, and potential harms; the APA 2019 guideline similarly rated evidence as insufficient for routine use, emphasizing the need for more high-quality comparative trials and standardized delivery [^116LEgWC] [^116Porac] [^112hcg4y].

> I need to check the regulatory status carefully. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation in 2017, but in August 2024 the FDA declined to approve the initial New Drug Application for midomafetamine (MDMA) for PTSD and requested an additional phase 3 trial, reflecting concerns about study conduct, blinding, and the need for replication; this means MDMA-assisted therapy is not currently FDA-approved in the U.S [^116gRwQ7] [^113Sm2pF].

> Let me consider implementation and external validity. Trials used highly trained two-therapist teams, extensive preparatory and integration sessions, and strict medical screening. Real-world feasibility in VA/DoD systems and community settings remains uncertain, and expanded access programs have been limited and burdensome, underscoring the need for workforce development, standardized protocols, and equitable access planning if approval is eventually granted [^116Porac] [^116Njh3f] [^114w5j77].

> But wait, what if comorbidities change the risk–benefit calculus. The phase 3 trials included participants with dissociation, depression, and substance use histories and still showed benefit, yet these comorbidities also raise safety considerations; careful screening, medication washout, and close monitoring are essential, and ongoing research should clarify which subgroups benefit most and how to personalize dosing and therapy [^113UyqaM] [^111XUSWt] [^116XAQVc].

> Synthesis: I should double-check that my conclusion matches the totality of evidence. High-quality phase 3 trials demonstrate that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy produces statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms and functional impairment versus placebo with therapy, with moderate-to-large effects and acceptable short-term safety under controlled conditions. However, the FDA declined approval pending further confirmatory data, and major guidelines deem the evidence insufficient for routine clinical recommendation, so MDMA-assisted therapy remains investigational and not a first-line option pending replication and regulatory resolution [^113UyqaM] [^111XUSWt] [^116gRwQ7] [^116LEgWC].

> Clinical implications and next steps: For patients with treatment-resistant PTSD who have exhausted evidence-based trauma-focused psychotherapies and SSRIs, participation in clinical trials or carefully regulated programs may be reasonable where available. Clinicians should counsel that benefits appear real but not guaranteed, blinding and expectancy effects complicate interpretation, and implementation requires specialized training and infrastructure. We need larger, pragmatic, head-to-head trials versus established trauma therapies and clearer guidance on safety monitoring, REMS, and equitable access before widespread adoption [^116LEgWC] [^113fjzYU] [^115ZWTx7].

MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is **not currently approved** for PTSD in the United States [^116gRwQ7]. The FDA declined approval in August 2024 due to concerns about trial conduct, blinding, and safety, and requested an additional phase 3 trial [^116gRwQ7] [^112rGrQM] [^117QpgCG]. While phase 3 trials showed large symptom reductions (Cohen's d ≈ 0.7–0.9) [^113UyqaM] [^111XUSWt], **guidelines remain cautious** [^116LEgWC] and cite insufficient evidence and potential harms [^112hcg4y]. MDMA is available only in clinical trials or via limited expanded access programs; it is not a standard treatment option outside research settings [^116Njh3f].

---

## Clinical trial evidence

### Phase 2 trials

Phase 2 trials demonstrated **promising results**, with large symptom reductions (Cohen's d ≈ 1.2) and sustained benefits at 12 months [^114B8pQW] [^115it3Vh]. However, they were limited by small samples and methodological constraints [^112hcg4y].

---

### Phase 3 trials

Two phase 3 trials (MAPP1 and MAPP2) showed **significant symptom reduction** versus placebo with therapy (Cohen's d ≈ 0.7–0.9) [^113UyqaM] [^111XUSWt]. MAPP1 found a mean CAPS-5 reduction of 24.4 vs 13.9 with placebo (P < 0.0001) [^113UyqaM], and MAPP2 replicated these results in a larger, diverse sample [^111XUSWt]. However, the FDA identified methodological issues — including functional unblinding and potential bias — and requested an additional phase 3 trial before approval [^117QpgCG] [^112rGrQM].

---

## Regulatory status

- **FDA designation**: MDMA received Breakthrough Therapy designation in 2017, expediting review [^113Sm2pF].
- **FDA decision**: In August 2024, the FDA declined approval, citing concerns about trial conduct, blinding, and safety, and requested an additional phase 3 trial [^116gRwQ7] [^117QpgCG].
- **Current status**: MDMA remains investigational; no FDA-approved indication exists for PTSD [^116gRwQ7].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common adverse effects**: Anxiety, insomnia, nausea, headache, and transient increases in blood pressure and heart rate [^116Njh3f] [^113Q5rAp].
- **Serious adverse events**: Rare serious events (e.g. suicidality, arrhythmias) occurred but were not significantly more frequent than placebo [^113UyqaM] [^115Kipxy].
- **Long-term safety**: No significant long-term neurocognitive or abuse-related harms have been observed in trials, but continued monitoring is needed [^114dJWYW].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

APA guidelines state that **evidence is insufficient** to recommend MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD, citing limited high-quality data and potential harms [^112hcg4y]. VA/DoD guidelines likewise conclude that evidence is insufficient and highlight concerns about trial quality, generalizability, and safety [^116LEgWC].

## Comparison with existing treatments

| **Treatment** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Regulatory status** |
|-|-|-|-|
| MDMA-assisted psychotherapy | High efficacy in trials (Cohen's d ≈ 0.7–0.9) | Generally well-tolerated; transient adverse effects | Investigational; not FDA-approved |
| SSRIs (sertraline, paroxetine) | Moderate efficacy (Cohen's d ≈ 0.3–0.5) | Well-established safety profile | FDA-approved |
| Trauma-focused psychotherapies (PE, CPT, EMDR) | High efficacy | Well-established safety profile | First-line recommended treatments |

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Ongoing studies include additional phase 3 trials to address FDA concerns and confirm efficacy and safety, as well as investigations into optimal dosing, long-term outcomes, and integration with standard psychotherapies. Implementation research is also examining real-world feasibility, therapist training, and regulatory frameworks [^112rGrQM] [^116gRwQ7] [^115X37mW] [^117Thj9d] [^116Porac] [^113fjzYU] [^116Njh3f].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Inclusion criteria include adults with moderate-to-severe PTSD, refractory to existing treatments, without significant psychiatric comorbidities or cardiovascular risk factors; **exclusion criteria** include psychotic disorders, bipolar I, active substance use disorders, uncontrolled hypertension, and significant medical comorbidities [^113bFzVH] [^114Q8eej].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

MDMA-assisted psychotherapy shows **significant promise** for PTSD, with large, clinically meaningful effects in phase 3 trials [^113UyqaM] [^111XUSWt]. However, it is not currently FDA-approved due to methodological concerns and safety considerations [^116gRwQ7]. Clinicians should continue to use evidence-based treatments (SSRIs, trauma-focused psychotherapies) and consider MDMA-assisted psychotherapy only within approved clinical trials or expanded access programs. Continued research is essential to address regulatory concerns and establish long-term safety and efficacy.

More than 80% (87/104) of participants had a lifetime history of suicidal ideation; 13 of 53 (24.5%) in the MDMA-AT group and 12 of 51 (23.5%) in the placebo with therapy group reported suicidal ideation during the final preparation session (V4). The number of participants reporting positive suicidal ideation varied throughout the study but collectively never exceeded baseline values in either group (Supplementary Fig. 2). Three participants (two MDMA-AT and one placebo with therapy) had treatment-emergent active suicidal ideation with at least some intent to act (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) score of 4 or 5), which was observed on five occasions (MDMA-AT, three events; placebo with therapy, two events) (Supplementary Fig. 2). Of these, one participant in the MDMA-AT group with no suicidal ideation at baseline had the emergence of active suicidal ideation with at least some intent to act.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^111wsoD2]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults — research and trial conduct: The Panel recommends masking/blinding of assessors throughout randomized controlled trials (RCTs), from initial intake to long-term follow-up, and recommends that trials collect data in a manner that allows for bridging the current DSM-5 PTSD and ICD-11 C-PTSD symptom chasm in outcomes reporting. The Panel recommends unifying descriptors and data so that systematic review authors will be able to parse and summarize data in clinically meaningful ways. There is a need for more well-powered comparative effectiveness research that can compare psychotherapy vs. another psychotherapy intervention, pharmacotherapy vs. pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapy vs. pharmacotherapy. Similarly, psychotherapy-assisted interventions such as cannabis, psilocybin, and MDMA will benefit from high-quality clinical trials, and neither cannabis nor psilocybin, either alone or in combination with psychotherapy, had sufficient high-quality RCTs to be evaluated in the existing systematic reviews included in this guideline and cannot be recommended, at present, as a treatment for PTSD.

Primary outcomes

MDMA-AT significantly attenuated PTSD symptomology versus placebo with therapy, as measured by a reduction in CAPS-5 total severity score from baseline to 18 weeks. Mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of the de jure estimand showed a least squares (LS) mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) change of −23.7 (−26.94, −20.44) for MDMA-AT versus −14.8 (−18.28, −11.28) for placebo with therapy (treatment difference: −8.9 (−13.70, −4.12), P < 0.001; Fig. 2a). The Cohen's d effect size of MDMA-AT versus placebo with therapy was d = 0.7; the within-group effect sizes were d = 1.95 for MDMA-AT and d = 1.25 for placebo with therapy. MMRM analysis of the de facto estimand revealed an LS mean change (95% CI) in CAPS-5 scores of −23.7 (−26.97, −20.47) for the MDMA-AT group versus −14.8 (−18.24, −11.33) for the placebo with therapy group (P < 0.001).

Objective

Review the current literature assessing the role of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Data Sources

OVID MEDLINE search (1960-February 2014) using the terms MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Molly, and Ecstasy crossed with posttraumatic stress disorder with backwards citation tracking using references from procured articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English language studies assessing MDMA in patients with PTSD.

Data Synthesis

Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted along with follow-up open-label and extension evaluations. In the 3 RCTs, therapy with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is promising, with reductions in PTSD rating scale scores (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, Severity of Symptoms Scale for PTSD Scale), although 2 of 3 trials did not show significant results, and all three had methodological limitations. The direction of effect for all trials was toward benefit in patients who were refractory to other PTSD therapies; the percentage reductions on rating scores ranged from 23% to 68%; and in 1 trial, the effect was sustained over a long period of time. MDMA ingestion without sustained psychotherapy over a 6- to 8-hour period is unlikely to be beneficial; trying to prolong the duration of effect with supplemental dosing is unlikely to provide additional benefits; and there are adverse effects on blood pressure and heart rate that should be appreciated. These studies used unadulterated MDMA with known and reproducible potency, which may not happen with street purchase of the product.

Conclusions

MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be an effective therapy in refractory PTSD but needs further evaluation to determine its place in contemporary therapy.

Methods

Participants and study overview

Candidates were recruited via Internet advertisements and referrals from mental health professionals and were screened using a scripted telephone interview (see Figure 1). Potential participants, men and women 18 years or older, underwent in-person psychological assessment, electrocardiogram, and physical examinations. Inclusion criteria required PTSD for at least six months, and a score of ⩾50 on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV). Candidates had failed to respond to at least one course of pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy. Participants were otherwise physically healthy and free of psychiatric or medical contraindications for receiving MDMA. Women could not be pregnant or lactating. The study was conducted at an outpatient clinic in Boulder, Colorado between October 2012–February 2017. This trial was reviewed by the Copernicus Group Independent Review Board (Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA), and was designed and conducted in accordance with good clinical practices and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT #NCT01793610).

Figure 1.
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram.

Procedures

After written informed consent and enrollment, participants completed outcome measures and were interviewed by an independent rater to assess baseline PTSD severity, functioning, and psychological history (see Figure 2). To establish a safe setting and therapeutic alliance before MDMA sessions, participants underwent three 90-minute preparatory sessions with a male/female therapy team. Psychiatric medications were tapered by the study physician and discontinued at least five half-lives before MDMA administration. Each participant was assigned to one of nine therapy teams (eight therapists in total).

### Beyond ecstasy: alternative entactogens to 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine with potential applications in psychotherapy [^111L2Zwe]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

MDMA is relatively unique in that it is currently the only substance in its class of action that is being actively studied for its efficacy as an aid in psychotherapy. MDMA is perhaps the most famous example among a class of psychoactive drugs called entactogens (latin: touching within) or sometimes empathogens. Since no other drug in this class of action is currently being studied as a treatment for PTSD and psychotherapy in general, this means that, within the foreseeable future, psychiatry is limited to using MDMA when entactogenic effects are required in the course of a patient's treatment. This lack of alternative medicines in treatments involving MDMA could prove to be detrimental to patients who do not respond well to the specific mechanisms of action of MDMA, or whose psychiatric condition calls for a slightly modulated, albeit similar, range of effects. For instance, elderly patients or patients with existing heart conditions may not be able to tolerate the cardiovascular effects of MDMA, which has led to their exclusion from past clinical trials with this substance. Patients who have a long history of MDMA use may not respond adequately to the typical clinical dose employed in such a setting and may require larger, and potentially dangerously high, doses of this compound to benefit from the psychological effects. These patients could instead receive compounds that do not produce cross tolerance with MDMA. On the other hand, very sensitive patients may be overwhelmed by the psychotropic effects of a full dose of MDMA, and may benefit from receiving a milder, or shorter-acting entactogen first, to allow them to gently get acquainted with an MDMA-like experience before receiving a therapeutic dose of MDMA. Finally, it is clearly desirable to give medical practitioners as large a pallet of pharmacological tools as possible, to enable them to customise therapeutic sessions to each patient's individual needs, in order to maximise therapeutic progress. It is therefore necessary to find alternative compounds that share the entactogenic qualitative effects of MDMA, which make it so useful in psychotherapy, while also possessing a safety profile that is equal or superior to that of MDMA.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized phase 2 controlled trial [^115CJRjm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Posttraumatic stress disorder often does not resolve after conventional psychotherapies or pharmacotherapies. Pilot studies have reported that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) combined with psychotherapy reduces posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.

Aims

This pilot dose response trial assessed efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy across multiple therapy teams.

Methods

Twenty-eight people with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder were randomized in a double-blind dose response comparison of two active doses (100 and 125 mg) with a low dose (40 mg) of MDMA administered during eight-hour psychotherapy sessions. Change in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale total scores one month after two sessions of MDMA served as the primary outcome. Active dose groups had one additional open-label session; the low dose group crossed over for three open-label active dose sessions. A 12-month follow-up assessment occurred after the final MDMA session.

Results

In the intent-to-treat set, the active groups had the largest reduction in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale total scores at the primary endpoint, with mean (standard deviation) changes of -26.3 (29.5) for 125 mg, -24.4 (24.2) for 100 mg, and -11.5 (21.2) for 40 mg, though statistical significance was reached only in the per protocol set (p = 0.03). Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms remained lower than baseline at 12-month follow-up (p < 0.001) with 76% (n = 25) not meeting posttraumatic stress disorder criteria. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, and the treatment was well-tolerated.

Conclusions

Our findings support previous investigations of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as an innovative, efficacious treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^116XAQVc]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

PTSD is a particularly persistent and incapacitating condition when expressed in conjunction with other disorders of mood and affect. In the present study, perhaps most compelling are the data indicating efficacy in participants with chronic and severe PTSD, and the associated comorbidities including childhood trauma, depression, suicidality, history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and dissociation, because these groups are all typically considered treatment resistant –. Given that more than 80% of those assigned a PTSD diagnosis have at least one comorbid disorder, the identification of a therapy that is effective in those with complicated PTSD and dual diagnoses could greatly improve PTSD treatment. Additional studies should therefore be conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD in those with specific comorbidities.

Although recent research suggests that dissociative subtype PTSD is difficult to treat, participants with the dissociative subtype who received MDMA-assisted therapy had significant symptom reduction that was at least similar to that of their counterparts with non-dissociative PTSD. Given that this covariate was significant, it warrants further study. Furthermore, given that other treatments for PTSD are not consistently effective for those with the dissociative subtype, these data, if replicated, would indicate an important novel therapeutic niche for MDMA-assisted therapy for typically hard-to-treat populations.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized phase 2 controlled trial [^111DmVWK]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

Power calculations were performed using results from a completed randomized, inactive-placebo controlled study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. The current pilot study was underpowered to detect small to medium effect sizes, but could possibly detect a large effect. Efficacy analyses for all measures were performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) set, consisting of all who had at least one MDMA session and completed an outcome assessment after baseline. CAPS-IV data were also analyzed in the per protocol (PP) set, which included all participants who completed both blinded sessions, primary outcome assessment, and did not experience a major protocol deviation. Participants who completed the open-label crossover were included in the crossover ITT set. Safety analyses included all participants who received at least one dose of MDMA.

The primary efficacy outcome was the change in CAPS-IV Total scores from baseline to one month after the second blinded session, analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with α = 0.05. Preplanned t -tests compared dose groups when significant main effects were found. Secondary measures (BDI-II, PSQI, DES-II) were analyzed with the same method. Cohen's d independent-groups pretest-posttest design was used for comparator-subtracted effect size estimates. Descriptive statistics display the percentage of participants not meeting PTSD criteria on CAPS-IV (diagnostic score) and those attaining a ⩾30% decrease in scores post-treatment.

For the open-label crossover, within-subjects t -tests compared scores on all measures at one-month after two open-label sessions to the primary endpoint. To explore whether a third active dose MDMA session produced further benefit, within-subjects t -tests of individual treatment groups compared scores of two vs three sessions. Peak vital signs averaged across the two blinded MDMA sessions were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA with t -tests to comparing groups. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS, version 20.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA).

The Future for MDMA Clinical Research: Training MDMA Therapists

In November 2016 MAPS received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to go ahead with phase III studies, and now plan multicenter, multinational studies, including plans for several sites in the UK and Europe. Pending the starting, and eventual outcome, of these studies, MAPS states 2021 as a potential date when MDMA could be licensed for prescribed practice. In which case the field will need many new MDMA therapists in the next few years. MAPS has subsequently begun a program of therapist training, with teams based in Boulder, Colorado, and Charleston, South Carolina. Training entails various stages, which include reading the MAPS manual on how to deliver MDMA therapy for PTSD, completing the MAPS online training modules, undertaking a week-long video training watching many hours of video footage of patients undergoing MDMA therapy, taking part in role play, discussion and nondrug experiential breath-work sessions, and, finally, undergoing an MDMA and a placebo therapy session with trained guides. While it is relatively easy to organize large-scale video training and discussion groups, is a bottle-neck when it comes to getting the experiential training with MDMA. To date, only a small handful of people around the world have completed the full training.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for moderate to severe PTSD: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^113fjzYU]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The notable effect seen in the placebo with therapy arm could suggest the standalone value of the manualized inner-directed therapy that was developed for use with MDMA. Additional head-to-head studies will need to be conducted to evaluate whether this form of manualized therapy provides greater value in the treatment of PTSD than the current first-line cognitive behavioral therapy and prolonged exposure therapy treatments.

Although treatment expectancy, per se, was not measured in this study, prospective treatment expectancy would likely have been high in both study arms, with random assignment expected to distribute this equally between groups. Although expectancy effects are a well-known issue in psychiatric clinical trials and are intertwined with the observation of treatment benefit during a trial, several observations support expectancy mitigation in the current study: (1) the groups did not separate after the first experimental session; (2) placebo with therapy dropouts did not uniformly occur after the first experimental session; and (3) blinding survey data (Supplementary Table 6) showed that not all participants correctly identified the treatment that they received.

The therapists who participated in this study were required to complete the sponsor's training program (see Supplementary Methods for further details). To ensure consistent clinical practice and to mitigate harm, it may be of benefit for prescribers to complete additional training and continuing education if MDMA-AT is approved for use by a regulatory agency.

This confirmatory phase 3 trial showed consistent benefits of MDMA-AT in an ethnoracially diverse group of individuals with longstanding moderate to severe PTSD and numerous comorbidities. The dropout rate was low, and treatment was generally well tolerated. These findings represent the culmination of over two decades of research, and, together with MAPP1, indicate that further consideration of this treatment in individuals with moderate to severe PTSD is warranted.

### A randomized controlled trial of 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and fear extinction retention in healthy adults [^1149oGL9]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Fear conditioning and extinction are well-characterized cross-species models of fear-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and recent animal data suggest that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) enhances fear extinction retention.

Aims

This study investigated the effect of MDMA on fear learning, extinction training, and retention in healthy humans.

Methods

The study involved a randomized placebo-controlled, two-group, parallel design trial in a sample of healthy adults, age 21–55 recruited from a major metropolitan area. The experimental paradigm included a fear acquisition session followed by an extinction training session 24hours later, and 2hours after study drug administration. Fear extinction retention was measured 48hours after extinction training. Participants (N = 34; 70.6% male and 29.4% female) were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to 100mg MDMA or placebo. All randomized participants completed the trial and were included in primary analyses. Safety was monitored via adverse events and vital signs. MDMA was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events.

Results

Results indicated a significant main effect of session between extinction training and retention with no significant group differences. Significantly more participants in the MDMA group retained extinction learning compared to the placebo group (χ² = 7.29, p = 0.007).

Conclusion

Although we did not observe the hypothesized facilitation of extinction retention, the findings from this initial human trial provide compelling rationale to continue to explore the potential for MDMA to impact extinction retention.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for moderate to severe PTSD: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^115uvQzk]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study MAPP2 was published by Jennifer M Mitchell and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Posttraumatic stress disorder. In the MAPP2 study, the trial question was: what is the role of MDMA-assisted therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe PTSD? In the MAPP2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the MAPP2 study, the population was: 104 patients (74 female, 30 male). The inclusion criteria were patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe PTSD. The key exclusion criteria were uncontrolled hypertension; history of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes; significant medical disorders; symptomatic liver disease; hyponatremia or hyperthermia. In the MAPP2 study, the interventions were: n = 53 MDMA-assisted therapy (at a split dose of 120–180 mg for approximately 3 months) n = 51 placebo with therapy (matching placebo with therapy for 3 months). In the MAPP2 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mean reduction in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 total severity score at week 18 (23.7 points vs. 14.8 points; AD 8.9 points, 95% CI 4.12 to 13.7). In the MAPP2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in mean reduction in Sheehan Disability Scale score (3.3 points vs. 2.1 points; AD 1.2 points, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.26). In the MAPP2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in severe treatment-emergent adverse events. In the MAPP2 study, the conclusion was: in patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe PTSD, MDMA-assisted therapy was superior to placebo with therapy with respect to mean reduction in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 total severity score at week 18.

### A randomized, controlled pilot study of MDMA (± 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine)-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of resistant, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [^1158V26g]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Psychiatrists and psychotherapists in the US (1970s to 1985) and Switzerland (1988–1993) used MDMA legally as a prescription drug, to enhance the effectiveness of psychotherapy. Early reports suggest that it is useful in treating trauma-related disorders. Recently, the first completed pilot study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD yielded encouraging results. Designed to test the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in patients with treatment-resistant PTSD; our randomized, double-blind, active-placebo controlled trial enrolled 12 patients for treatment with either low-dose (25 mg, plus 12.5 mg supplemental dose) or full-dose MDMA (125 mg, plus 62.5 mg supplemental dose). MDMA was administered during three experimental sessions, interspersed with weekly non-drug-based psychotherapy sessions. Outcome measures used were the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS). Patients were assessed at baseline, three weeks after the second and third MDMA session (end of treatment), and at the 2-month and 1-year follow-ups. We found that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be safely administered in a clinical setting. No drug-related serious adverse events occurred. We did not see statistically significant reductions in CAPS scores (p = 0.066), although there was clinically and statistically significant self-reported (PDS) improvement (p = 0.014). CAPS scores improved further at the 1-year follow-up. In addition, three MDMA sessions were more effective than two (p = 0.016).

Introduction

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disabling condition characterized by overwhelming negative emotions, panic, anxiety, intrusive re-experiencing of traumatic events, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition, and hyperarousal symptoms. Approximately 8% of the US population (24 m individuals) will suffer from PTSD in their lifetime, and existing treatment approaches have limited effectiveness. Nonresponse and treatment dropout rates are high, and at least 35% are left with debilitating symptoms that significantly impact quality of life. Individuals often feel fragmented and disconnected from self and others. They seem to be continuously living a story that is in the distant past, and consequentially are not fully living in present time. The social impact includes alienation, loneliness, and functional impairment. There is an immense need for innovative treatment options that improve outcomes, especially for PTSD refractory to psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapies.

3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy is a novel approach that combines psychotherapy with limited administration of MDMA in a controlled setting to enable people suffering from PTSD to process trauma more effectively. Early reports of use in psychotherapy have suggested the potential utility of MDMA in psychotherapy. Two previous randomized controlled trials showed promising safety and efficacy results for treatment of PTSD. MDMA's unique subjective and therapeutic effects induce an optimal state that complements the process of working through traumatic memories while reducing the fear response. Trauma theorists have asserted that emotional engagement is necessary for processing traumatic experiences and, under the influence of MDMA, people are able to remain emotionally connected while working with difficult traumatic material.

This article presents results from a blinded, phase 2 dose response trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MDMA (40, 100, or 125 mg) as an adjunct to psychotherapy in 28 participants with chronic PTSD. PTSD symptom severity, dissociation, depression symptoms, and sleep quality were assessed at baseline, one-month after the second blinded session, after open-label sessions, and at 12-month follow-up. Safety outcomes were collected throughout the treatment period.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^113UyqaM]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) presents a major public health problem for which currently available treatments are modestly effective. We report the findings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03537014) to test the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for the treatment of patients with severe PTSD, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. After psychiatric medication washout, participants (n = 90) were randomized 1:1 to receive manualized therapy with MDMA or with placebo, combined with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms, measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5, the primary endpoint), and functional impairment, measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS, the secondary endpoint) were assessed at baseline and at 2months after the last experimental session. Adverse events and suicidality were tracked throughout the study. MDMA was found to induce significant and robust attenuation in CAPS-5 score compared with placebo (P < 0.0001, d = 0.91) and to significantly decrease the SDS total score (P = 0.0116, d = 0.43). The mean change in CAPS-5 scores in participants completing treatment was -24.4 (s.d. 11.6) in the MDMA group and -13.9 (s.d. 11.5) in the placebo group. MDMA did not induce adverse events of abuse potential, suicidality or QT prolongation. These data indicate that, compared with manualized therapy with inactive placebo, MDMA-assisted therapy is highly efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, and treatment is safe and well-tolerated, even in those with comorbidities. We conclude that MDMA-assisted therapy represents a potential breakthrough treatment that merits expedited clinical evaluation.

Randomization, masking and bias minimization

Participants were randomized in a blinded fashion and were allocated 1:1 to either the MDMA-assisted therapy group or the placebo with therapy group. Randomization was stratified by site and occurred following enrollment confirmation (after preparatory visits). Randomization was managed via an interactive web randomization system — ITClinical IWRS, version 11.0.1 (ITClinical, LDA) — based on a centralized randomization schedule developed by an independent third-party vendor to maintain blinding. Participants, site staff and the sponsor were blinded to participant group assignment until after the database was locked.

An inactive placebo with therapy was utilized as the comparator to isolate the efficacy of the MDMA itself. Although low-dose MDMA improved blinding in phase 2 studies, it led to decreased effectiveness compared with an inactive placebo in a PTSD population, making it easier to detect a difference between the active and comparator groups. The use of inactive placebo also allows for uncontaminated comparison of safety data between groups. Therefore, an inactive placebo was determined in partnership with the FDA as a more conservative statistical comparison, and the study utilized observer-blinded efficacy assessments to minimize bias in efficacy measurements.

An observer-blind and centralized independent rater pool was used to administer the primary and secondary outcome measures, that is, the CAPS-5 and the SDS for functional impairment, the latter of which was adapted to limit missing item-level data as per the FDA requirements and included use of the three-item mean as the total score and imputation of work-related impairment as the maximum score, if caused by PTSD. The independent rater measurements were conducted at baseline and following each experimental session via live video interviews. Independent raters did not repeatedly see the same participant and the independent rater pool was blinded to the complete study design, visit number, treatment assignment, and all data collected by the therapy team after baseline, with the exception of safety data related to suicidality. Participants were instructed to withhold their opinion on treatment group assignment from independent raters and to refrain from sharing details regarding the study design and their number of completed visits. To ensure that all site and sponsor staff were shielded from study outcome measures, primary and secondary outcome measures were collected from the blinded independent rater pool and stored in a dedicated database that was separate from the blinded, clinical database.

### A rapid narrative review of the clinical evolution of psychedelic treatment in clinical trials [^113y5U2H]. Npj Mental Health Research (2024). Medium credibility.

As psilocybin in the treatment of depressionand MDMA-assisted therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)are investigated in phase II and III studies and with their supervised use approved in Oregon and Australia, there is a need for rigorous research to evaluate the impact and therapist effects and associated interventions. To that end, a review of the pre-prohibition period becomes crucial, as it originally inspired sophisticated reflections on the intricate relationship between biological and psychological factors in treating mental illness. Despite the limitations of that period, marked by poor controls, inconsistent diagnoses, unvalidated outcomes and lack of adverse effect reporting, revisiting the two aforementioned fundamental factors can inform current and future research in this evolving field.

In this article, we examine selected pre-prohibition trials, explore clinician and patient narratives pertaining to the treatment process, and discuss their relevance to modern research. We gathered articles from the pre-prohibition era that showcase this period's diverse perspectives and therapy methods. The chosen articles provide a clinically meaningful, representative sample of the essential aspects that defined psychedelic research and treatment during this period. Our aim is to trace the evolution of contemporary psychedelic treatment protocols, as observed in modern randomized clinical trials (RCTs). This includes an analysis of various components from the pre-prohibition era including clinician-reported psychedelic phenomenology, preparation, treatment sessions, and integration practices. The overarching objective is to contribute valuable insights to inform best practices and guide future research endeavors.

PTSD pharmacotherapy and psychedelic interventions — research needs and current evidence: It is also recommended that future investigations focus on the long-term effectiveness and safety of psychedelics like MDMA, psilocybin, and ketamine in treating PTSD. Mustafa et al. (2024), writing for the Institute of Clinical and Economic Review, reviewed two of the main trials, raising "substantial concerns about the validity of the results", and concluded that the available evidence for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy was insufficient at present; protocol violations resulted in the retraction of three MDMA trials previously published in Psychopharmacology. The FDA declined to approve MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD on August 9, 2024, and it's also vital to examine potential risks, especially among vulnerable populations like those with a history of substance -use or severe mental health conditions, and to establish clear guidelines for the safe and supportive administration of these therapies to minimize harm.

The number of participants experiencing one or more SAEs or AESIs relating to suicidality, cardiovascular symptoms that could indicate QT prolongation, and abuse potential following the first experimental session.

Suicidality was tracked throughout the study using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at each study visit. More than 90% of participants reported suicidal ideation in their lifetime, and 17 of 46 participants (37%) in the MDMA group and 14 of 44 participants (32%) in the placebo group reported suicidal ideation at baseline. Although the number of participants who reported suicidal ideation varied throughout the visits, prevalence never exceeded baseline and was not exacerbated in the MDMA group. Serious suicidal ideation (a score of 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS) was minimal during the study and occurred almost entirely in the placebo arm (Fig. 4).

### The efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis from randomized controlled trials [^116ShK5z]. Psychiatry Research (2024). Medium credibility.

3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ecstasy, is one of the most widely used illicit substances worldwide. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy has become a novel treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed over the past decade. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review and demonstrate the efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to October 27, 2023, selected RCTs assessing the efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD, and evaluated their quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Seven RCTs were selected from the retrieved references. The results revealed that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy effectively reduced the change from baseline score in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale in patients with PTSD compared with either placebo or active controls. However, MDMA causes a series of adverse events, including muscle tightness, nausea, and decreased appetite. To a certain extent, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may improve symptoms in patients with PTSD. However, side effects and abuse issues still seriously hinder clinical application of MDMA.

### Why psychiatry needs 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine: a child psychiatrist's perspective [^117Hf8s4]. Neurotherapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Since the late 1980s the psychoactive drug 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has had a well-known history as the recreationally used drug ecstasy. What is less well known by the public is that MDMA started its life as a therapeutic agent and that in recent years an increasing amount of clinical research has been undertaken to revisit the drug's medical potential. MDMA has unique pharmacological properties that translate well to its proposed agent to assist trauma-focused psychotherapy. Psychological trauma — especially that which arises early in life from child abuse — underpins many chronic adult mental disorders, including addictions. Several studies of recent years have investigated the potential role of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, with ongoing plans to see MDMA therapy licensed and approved within the next 5 years. Issues of safety and controversy frequently surround this research, owing to MDMA's often negative media-driven bias. However, accurate examination of the relative risks and benefits of clinical MDMA — in contrast to the recreational use of ecstasy — must be considered when assessing its potential benefits and the merits of future research. In this review, the author describes these potential benefits and explores the relatives risks of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the context of his experience as a child and adolescent psychiatrist, having seen the relative limitations of current pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies for treating complex post-traumatic stress disorder arising from child abuse.

Diversity of samples — pharmacologic and MDMA-assisted psychotherapy updates for adult posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) report the following participant characteristics: Across four MDMA-assisted trials, the mean ages ranged from 37.2 to 42 years and about 16% to 85% of participants identified as female. Ketamine reviews spanning 584 patients reported average ages from 36.05 to 43 years with approximately 16% to 43% female; the proportion identifying as White ranged from 20% to 95% and, of reported data, between 11% and 20% identified as Hispanic/Latino/a/e/x, with studies primarily conducted in the United States. An updated pharmacologic review combined 5,170 patients, with mean ages from 37 to 54 years and between 0% and 100% female; non-White identification ranged from 0 to 100% and Hispanic/Latino/a/e/x from 0% to 65%, with the majority of studies in the United States and a small number in China, Iran, and South Africa.

### Pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders in the 21st century: a call for novel approaches [^112FTaWt]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologically assisted psychosocial interventions

While recent advances in our understanding of memory processes have led to novel strategies to combine pharmacotherapy and psychotherapeutic approaches — the emergence of brief and targeted administration of drugs as a way to pharmacologically manipulate memory processes — these approaches fall into broader efforts in the field of anxiety disorders (and psychiatric disorders in general) to use pharmacotherapy to assist or enhance psychosocial interventions.

Although widely known as the active ingredient in the recreational drug ecstasy, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) was historically used as an adjunct to psychotherapy in the late 1970s, prior to its designation as a Schedule I drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration in 1985. MDMA's proposed mechanism of action is both complex and unclear, but appears to primarily involve inducing the release of norepinephrine and serotonin as well as concomitantly inhibiting their reuptake. Due to its enhancement of feelings of inner awareness and social bonding, it was suggested to be particularly well suited to psychiatric states characterised by emotional numbing, fear state or social disconnection, such as PTSD.MDMA has recently been the focus of much attention with regard to its use to facilitate the processing of trauma memories during therapy.MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is currently undergoing clinical trials for treatment of PTSD, with a phase II randomised, double-blind study of first responders with severe treatment-resistant PTSD showing promising efficacy results maintained at 12-month follow-up.

While psychedelic agents were initially the focus of intensive research to treat psychiatric disorders, societal views shifted dramatically towards the end of the 1960s in the face of widespread recreational use and highly publicised media accounts of adverse events. These agents appear to exert their primary effect via agonist activity at the 5-HT2A receptor, although the 5-HT1A receptor has also been implicated. Similarly to recent efforts focused on MDMA, others have recently revisited the potential use of these compounds during therapy sessions. While much of both the scientific literature as well as media attention have remained focused on the use of psychedelics in the treatment of major depressive disorder, an increasing body of evidence suggests that psychedelics may exert significant effects on anxiety disorders. The efficacy of psychedelic compounds has been in every case studied when administered under some degree of psychological support, often with non-directive psychotherapy and instrumental evocative music, leading to the use of the term 'psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy' to describe these treatment modalities.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for moderate to severe PTSD: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^111XUSWt]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

This multi-site, randomized, double-blind, confirmatory phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) versus placebo with identical therapy in participants with moderate to severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Changes in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) total severity score (primary endpoint) and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) functional impairment score (key secondary endpoint) were assessed by blinded independent assessors. Participants were randomized to MDMA-AT (n = 53) or placebo with therapy (n = 51). Overall, 26.9% (28/104) of participants had moderate PTSD, and 73.1% (76/104) of participants had severe PTSD. Participants were ethnoracially diverse: 28 of 104 (26.9%) identified as Hispanic/Latino, and 35 of 104 (33.7%) identified as other than White. Least squares (LS) mean change in CAPS-5 score (95% confidence interval (CI)) was -23.7 (-26.94, -20.44) for MDMA-AT versus -14.8 (-18.28, -11.28) for placebo with therapy (P < 0.001, d = 0.7). LS mean change in SDS score (95% CI) was -3.3 (-4.03, -2.60) for MDMA-AT versus -2.1 (-2.89, -1.33) for placebo with therapy (P = 0.03, d = 0.4). Seven participants had a severe treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) (MDMA-AT, n = 5 (9.4%); placebo with therapy, n = 2 (3.9%)). There were no deaths or serious TEAEs. These data suggest that MDMA-AT reduced PTSD symptoms and functional impairment in a diverse population with moderate to severe PTSD and was generally well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04077437.

Discussion

In this confirmatory phase 3 study of participants with moderate to severe PTSD, MDMA-AT significantly improved PTSD symptoms and functional impairment, as assessed by CAPS-5 and SDS, respectively, compared to placebo with therapy over 18 weeks. Notably, 45 of 52 (86.5%) participants treated with MDMA-AT achieved a clinically meaningful benefit, and 37 of 52 (71.2%) participants no longer met criteria for PTSD by study end. In a historic first, to our knowledge, for psychedelic treatment studies, participants who identified as ethnically or racially diverse encompassed approximately half of the study sample. These findings confirm and extend the results observed in MAPP1 (ref.), with general consistency across endpoints.

Given the diverse population and degree of participant complexity, the replication of efficacy is particularly notable. In our study, 26.9% (28/104) of participants expressed moderate PTSD, whereas, in MAPP1, all participants expressed severe PTSD. A substantial proportion of participants displayed comorbid features associated with high treatment resistance, such as major depression, multiple sources of trauma (including childhood and combat trauma) and dissociative subtype PTSD. In keeping with MAPP1, treatment was not significantly affected by disease severity, risk of hazardous alcohol or substance use disorder, severe adverse childhood experiences or dissociative subtype. Furthermore, there was no observed site-to-site variability and no differential effect if participants stayed overnight after the experimental session. However, lifetime history of SSRIs, female sex assigned at birth and BDI-II score ≥ 23 at baseline were associated with positive impacts on outcomes and may warrant further study based on the exploratory nature of these analyses.

### Novel pharmacologic and other somatic treatment approaches for posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: state of the evidence [^115ZWTx7]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder that can become chronic and debilitating when left untreated. The most commonly recommended first-line treatments for PTSD among adults are individual trauma-focused psychotherapies. Other evidence-based treatments include specific antidepressant medications and non-trauma-focused psychotherapies. Despite the effectiveness of these available treatments, many patients' symptoms do not remit. This has led to the search for novel treatments for PTSD. In this review, the authors critically evaluate the data supporting several emerging pharmacological and other somatic interventions in the categories of medication-assisted psychotherapy, novel medication monotherapy strategies, and neuromodulation, selected because of the salience of their mechanisms of action to the pathophysiology of PTSD (e.g. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, ketamine, cannabidiol, transcranial magnetic stimulation). The authors also evaluate the evidence for treatments that are the focus of increasing scientific or public interest (i.e., hyperbaric oxygen therapy, stellate ganglion block, neurofeedback). To date, the evidence supporting most novel pharmacological and somatic treatments for PTSD is preliminary and highly variable; however, the data for several specific treatments, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, are encouraging.

### Potential psychiatric uses for MDMA [^114HYacy]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Phase II trials of 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy have demonstrated initial safety and efficacy for treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with potential for expansion to depression and anxiety disorders. In these trials, single doses of MDMA are administered in a model of medication‐assisted psychotherapy, differing from trials involving daily drug administration without psychotherapy. This model presents an opportunity to utilize accelerated regulatory pathways, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Breakthrough Therapy Designation, to most effectively and expeditiously test such novel approaches.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^112UZqCv]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

An independent data monitoring committee monitored adverse events for safety and conducted one administrative interim analysis, after completion of enrollment and of 60% of primary endpoints to examine the adequacy of the sample size. The data monitoring committee recommended that no additional participants should be added, based on conditional power calculations supporting 90% statistical power, but in keeping with the SAP did not provide the sponsor with any information on the conditional power or effect size. The alpha level was set to 0.05, and 2% of the alpha (0.001) was spent on the interim analysis and 98% (0.0499) was left for the final analysis.

Statistics for the primary and secondary efficacy comparisons (CAPS and SDS) are reported as P values from the results of the MMRM analysis. In exploratory analyses, additional baseline covariates of age, gender, ethnicity, prior use of SSRIs, depression as measured by the BDI-II, adverse childhood experiences, and alcohol and substance use disorders were assessed in the model, with the threshold of significance set at P < 0.05 (Supplementary Table 1). BDI-II score was also assessed as an exploratory efficacy outcome measure with a paired, two-tailed t -test. Results are reported as mean (s.d.) throughout the text. Between-group effect size was calculated with Cohen's d, and 95% CIs are reported. SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) was used for analyses.

The safety analysis included all participants who were given at least one dose of the study drug or placebo. The primary safety analysis evaluated TEAEs as a participant-level analysis. An association with MDMA was determined based on the relative incidence of TEAEs with at least a twofold difference between the MDMA and placebo groups.

Outcomes

Independent assessors conducted CAPS-5 and SDS outcome assessments at baseline, after experimental sessions 1 and 2 and 6–8 weeks after experimental session 3 (18 weeks after baseline) via video interviews. Primary and secondary objectives were mean change in CAPS-5 total severity and SDS scores, respectively, for MDMA-AT versus placebo with therapy from baseline to 18 weeks after baseline.

Exploratory outcome measurements included characterization of the treatment response and differences between the treatment groups by demographics and characteristics. Responder analyses were based on categorical diagnostic assessment data and the CAPS-5 total severity score assessment. PTSD severity was defined using the CAPS-5 total severity score as follows: asymptomatic (0–10), mild (11–22), moderate (23–34), severe (35–46) and extreme (47+). A ≥ 10-point reduction in CAPS-5 total severity score was considered to be clinically meaningful as agreed upon with the FDA through a Special Protocol Assessment. Four responder categories were derived and compared at each post-experimental session visit using CAPS-5 scores. These categories were: non-responder (< 10-point reduction from baseline), responder (≥ 10-point reduction from baseline), loss of diagnosis (≥ 10-point reduction from baseline and no longer meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria) and remission (CAPS-5 total severity score of 11 or less and no longer meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria).

### Potential psychiatric uses for MDMA [^112QVCNq]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Phase II trials of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy have demonstrated initial safety and efficacy for treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with potential for expansion to depression and anxiety disorders. In these trials, single doses of MDMA are administered in a model of medication-assisted psychotherapy, differing from trials involving daily drug administration without psychotherapy. This model presents an opportunity to utilize accelerated regulatory pathways, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Breakthrough Therapy Designation, to most effectively and expeditiously test such novel approaches.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^113VThzT]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Here, we demonstrate that three doses of MDMA given in conjunction with manualized therapy over the course of 18 weeks results in a significant and robust attenuation of PTSD symptoms and functional impairment as assessed using the CAPS-5 and SDS, respectively. MDMA also significantly mitigated depressive symptoms as assessed using the BDI-II. Of note, MDMA did not increase the occurrence of suicidality during the study.

These data illustrate the potential benefit of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD over the FDA-approved first-line pharmacotherapies sertraline and paroxetine, which have both exhibited smaller effect sizes in pivotal studies. Previous comparison of change in CAPS score between sertraline and placebo showed effect sizes of 0.31 and 0.37. Similarly, comparison of change in CAPS score between paroxetine and placebo showed effect sizes of 0.56, 0.45 and 0.09. By contrast, the effect size of 0.91 demonstrated in this study between MDMA-assisted therapy and placebo with therapy was larger than that for any other previously identified PTSD pharmacotherapy –. To directly assess superiority, a head-to-head comparison of MDMA-assisted therapy with SSRIs for PTSD would be needed. Although the present study tested the effects of MDMA using a model in which both treatment groups received supportive therapy, participants who received MDMA and supportive therapy (d = 2.1) had greater improvement in PTSD change scores compared with those who received placebo with supportive therapy (d = 1.2), suggesting that MDMA enhanced the effects of supportive therapy. In clinical practice, both MDMA and supportive therapy will be components of this PTSD treatment.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder in military veterans, firefighters, and police officers: a randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 clinical trial [^115cZV7s]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in military personnel and first responders, many of whom do not respond to currently available treatments. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treating chronic PTSD in this population.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 trial at an outpatient psychiatric clinic in the USA. We included service personnel who were 18 years or older, with chronic PTSD duration of 6 months or more, and who had a Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) total score of 50 or greater. Using a web-based randomisation system, we randomly assigned participants (1:1:2) to three different dose groups of MDMA plus psychotherapy: 30 mg (active control), 75 mg, or 125 mg. We masked investigators, independent outcome raters, and participants until after the primary endpoint. MDMA was administered orally in two 8-h sessions with concomitant manualised psychotherapy. The primary outcome was mean change in CAPS-IV total score from baseline to 1 month after the second experimental session. Participants in the 30 mg and 75 mg groups subsequently underwent three 100–125 mg MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions in an open-label crossover, and all participants were assessed 12 months after the last MDMA session. Safety was monitored through adverse events, spontaneously reported expected reactions, vital signs, and suicidal ideation and behaviour. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01211405.

Findings

Between Nov 10, 2010, and Jan 29, 2015, 26 veterans and first responders met eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg (n = 7), 75 mg (n = 7), or 125 mg (n = 12) of MDMA plus psychotherapy. At the primary endpoint, the 75 mg and 125 mg groups had significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptom severity (mean change CAPS-IV total scores of -58·3 [SD 9·8] and -44·3 [28·7]; p = 0·001) than the 30 mg group (-11·4 [12·7]). Compared with the 30 mg group, Cohen's d effect sizes were large: 2·8 (95% CI 1·19–4·39) for the 75 mg group and 1·1 (0·04–2·08) for the 125 mg group. In the open-label crossover with full-dose MDMA (100–125 mg), PTSD symptom severity significantly decreased in the group that had previously received 30 mg (p = 0·01), whereas no further significant decreases were observed in the group that previously achieved a large response after 75 mg doses in the blinded segment (p = 0·81). PTSD symptoms were significantly reduced at the 12-month follow-up compared with baseline after all groups had full-dose MDMA (mean CAPS-IV total score of 38·8 [SD 28·1] vs 87·1 [16·1]; p < 0·0001). 85 adverse events were reported by 20 participants. Of these adverse events, four (5%) were serious: three were deemed unrelated and one possibly related to study drug treatment.

Interpretation

Active doses (75 mg and 125 mg) of MDMA with adjunctive psychotherapy in a controlled setting were effective and well tolerated in reducing PTSD symptoms in veterans and first responders.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for moderate to severe PTSD: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^111jVVuY]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious neuropsychiatric condition affecting approximately 5% of the US population each year. Managing PTSD is particularly complicated in individuals experiencing the dissociative subtype of PTSD, recurrent exposure to trauma and comorbidities, such as mood disorders and alcohol and substance use disorders –. Together, these factors are associated with symptom exacerbation, treatment resistance and treatment discontinuation. Trauma-focused psychotherapies are the gold standard treatment for PTSD. However, many individuals have persisting symptomology, and dropout rates are high –. Although the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) sertraline and paroxetine are FDA approved for treating PTSD, 35–47% of individuals do not respond to treatment. More effective, therapeutic interventions are needed to address the immense individual, societal and economic burdens of PTSD.

Mounting evidence supports substituted phenethylamine 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) as a treatment for PTSD. MDMA, an entactogen that promotes monoamine reuptake inhibition and release (primarily by inducing conformational change of pre-synaptic transporters –), effectively modulates fear memory reconsolidation, enhances fear extinction and promotes openness and prosocial behavior –. Several phase 2 trials indicated that MDMA-AT has an acceptable risk–benefit profile in individuals with PTSD. A pivotal phase 3 study (MAPP1) showed that MDMA-AT was generally well tolerated and met the trial's primary and secondary endpoints of reduced PTSD symptom severity and decreased functional impairment.

Due to disparities in trauma exposure, gender-diverse and transgender individuals, ethnoracial minorities, first responders, military personnel, veterans and victims of chronic sexual abuse have a disproportionately higher risk of developing PTSD. However, these diverse populations are historically underrepresented in clinical trials. Here we report the results of MAPP2, the second, confirmatory phase 3 study that extends the findings of MAPP1 (refs.) in an ethnoracially diverse population with moderate to severe PTSD (Supplementary Table 1).

MECHANISM AND TARGET INDICATIONS

MDMA produces complex pharmacological effects that may be further influenced by psychotherapy. MDMA potentiates the release of monoamines through reversal of transporter proteins and reuptake inhibition, with the greatest effects on serotonin and norepinephrine. 3 Effects on dopamine release, secondary to serotonin release, are dose‐ and species‐dependent, with less dopamine involvement in humans. 3 Downstream targets include α2‐adrenergic and serotonin receptors. Serotonergic signaling triggers a cascade of oxytocin, vasopressin, prolactin, and corticosteroids. 2, 3, 4 MDMA also modulates glucocorticoids through the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, 4 which may have important implications for PTSD treatment, as glucocorticoid hypersensitivity and HPA axis dysregulation are hallmarks of PTSD. MDMA decreases amygdalar and hippocampal activity, and increases prefrontal cortex activity, correlating with subjective effects. 2 In a mouse PTSD model, MDMA administered before training facilitated fear extinction learning, dependent on brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the amygdala. 1 Recovery from PTSD and extinction learning is dependent on BDNF, which regulates memory reconsolidation after recall in the amygdala–hippocampus circuit. 1 These neurobiological effects are not specific to PTSD, as reduced emotional impact of fear memories was corroborated in healthy volunteer imaging studies, 2 and BDNF elevations were also observed in recreational MDMA users. MDMA promotes neuroplasticity through BDNF and regulates the HPA axis, improving functional outcomes through effects on learning and memory, which are reinforced in the context of psychotherapy.

In MDMA studies, participants report improved self‐knowledge, sleep regulation, accuracy in perceiving mental states of others, coping strategies, emotion regulation, and cognitive insights. 3 Objective measures support attenuated impact of social rejection and reduced amygdalar response to angry or fearful faces. 3 These changes provide insight into potential indications for MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy, which may enhance secure attachment and engagement of cognitive and positive valence systems, with corresponding reduction in negative valence. MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy could be useful in the treatment of disorders associated with attachment insecurities, including PTSD, depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive‐compulsive disorder, suicidality, substance use disorders, and eating disorders. 5 In phase II PTSD studies, 2 months after two to three active‐dose MDMA treatments, 55% of chronic PTSD subjects no longer met the PTSD Diagnostic Criteria (N = 100) and 66.2% were in remission at least 12 months postdrug (N = 65). Clinical effects are rapid‐onset but not rapid offset, with durable treatment outcomes reported long after MDMA had been eliminated from the body.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^1149MGst]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The mean change in CAPS-5 scores from baseline to 18 weeks after baseline in the completers (per protocol set) was −24.4 (s.d. 11.6) (n = 42) in the MDMA-assisted therapy group compared with −13.9 (s.d. 11.5) (n = 37) in the placebo with therapy group.

The effect size of the MDMA-assisted therapy treatment compared with placebo with therapy was d = 0.91 (95% CI = 0.44–1.37, pooled s.d. = 11.55) in the de jure estimand and d = 0.97 (95% CI = 0.51–1.42) in the de facto estimand. When the within-group treatment effect (which included the effect of the supportive therapy that was administered in both arms) was compared between the MDMA and placebo groups, the effect size was 2.1 (95% CI = −5.6 to 1.4) in the MDMA group and 1.2 (95% CI = −4.9 to 2.5) in the placebo group.

Over the same period, MDMA significantly reduced clinician-rated functional impairment as assessed with the SDS. MMRM analysis of the de jure estimand showed a significant difference in treatment arms (n = 89 (MDMA n = 46), P = 0.0116, d.f. = 71, effect size = 0.43, 95% CI = −0.01 to 0.88, pooled s.d. = 2.53) (Fig. 2b). The mean change in SDS scores from baseline to 18 weeks after baseline in the completers was −3.1 (s.d. 2.6) (n = 42) in the MDMA-assisted therapy group and −2.0 (s.d. 2.4) (n = 37) in the placebo with therapy group.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine facilitates fear extinction learning [^114v1pnG]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Acutely administered 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') has been proposed to have long-term positive effects on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms when combined with psychotherapy. No preclinical data support a mechanistic basis for these claims. Given the persistent nature of psychotherapeutic gains facilitated by MDMA, we hypothesized that MDMA improves fear extinction learning, a key process in exposure-based therapies for PTSD. In these experiments, mice were first exposed to cued fear conditioning and treated with drug vehicle or MDMA before extinction training 2 days later. MDMA was administered systemically and also directly targeted to brain structures known to contribute to extinction. In addition to behavioral measures of extinction, changes in mRNA levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) and Fos were measured after MDMA treatment and extinction. MDMA (7.8 mg kg⁻¹) persistently and robustly enhanced long-term extinction when administered before extinction training. MDMA increased the expression of Fos in the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), whereas increases in Bdnf expression were observed only in the amygdala after extinction training. Extinction enhancements were recapitulated when MDMA (1 μg) was infused directly into the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), and enhancement was abolished when BDNF signaling was inhibited before extinction. These findings suggest that MDMA enhances fear memory extinction through a BDNF-dependent mechanism, and that MDMA may be a useful adjunct to exposure-based therapies for PTSD and other anxiety disorders characterized by altered fear learning.

### Therapeutic effect of increased openness: investigating mechanism of action in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy [^112nNTCd]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Interestingly, ± 3, 4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), which shares some properties with psilocybin and other classic psychedelic compounds, has been used in clinical trials as an adjunct, or enhancing agent, for therapeutic change in combination with psychotherapy for PTSD. Initial findings from our group have been promising, showing significant reductions in PTSD symptoms that are on average sustained up to 45.4 ± 17.3 months post treatment after several sessions of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. While the pharmacological mechanism of action of MDMA as a PTSD treatment is not well understood, MDMA is known to cause serotonin release and release of the neurohormones oxytocin, prolactin, and cortisol. It is possible that this pharmacology might augment exposure-based therapy by temporarily reducing avoidance, allowing patients to tolerate feelings associated with revisiting the trauma memory and fully engage in the exposure. In controlled trials studying MDMA administration in normal volunteers, subjects have reported that the drug produces distinctive subjective pleasurable effects, and seems to reduce activity in the left amygdala, a brain area associated with anxiety and stress reactivity.

### Potential psychiatric uses for MDMA [^112cTtAd]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Outcomes of MDMA use are context‐dependent, as seen by elevations in BDNF in both recreational settings and fear extinction studies, as well as phase II trial results. While it is true that MDMA has moderate abuse potential and has seen widespread use in nonmedical settings, studies have shown this is self‐limiting and typically ceases when life circumstances change, suggesting self‐medication or intentional self‐exploration as probable motivations for use. Neuroplasticity triggered by BDNF supports the beneficial effects of MDMA in a treatment context, similar to other medication‐assisted therapies for treatment of substance use disorders. Consistent with this concept, an upcoming study of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy is planned for treatment of alcoholism. These observations, as well as current phase II results, support utilizing MDMA as a probe of social behavior and the psychopathology of fear, depression, stress, and anxiety.

### Treating posttraumatic stress disorder and alcohol use disorder comorbidity: current pharmacological therapies and the future of MDMA-integrated psychotherapy [^116jXZtB]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) frequently co-occur in patients who have experienced trauma. This comorbidity leads to a vicious cycle where PTSD symptoms beget heavy drinking and vice versa. There are no FDA-approved medications to treat PTSD-AUD; therefore, individuals suffering from this comorbidity are treated with medication approved to treat the disorders separately or with off-label pharmacological interventions. However, these medications are limited in their efficacy for treating PTSD-AUD comorbidity. Emerging research on the nonclassical psychedelic drug 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) suggests that it may be an effective drug used in conjunction with psychotherapy. The following reviews the current research for clinical pharmacotherapies, as well as MDMA-integrative psychotherapy as they pertain to PTSD and AUD in isolation and co-occurrence. Future directions for the role of psychedelic-integrative therapy for the treatment of this comorbidity are discussed.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^117MUo98]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Main

PTSD is a common and debilitating condition with immeasurable social and economic costs that affects the lives of hundreds of millions of people annually. There are a number of environmental and biological risk factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of PTSD, and poor PTSD treatment outcomes are associated with several comorbid conditions that include childhood trauma, alcohol and substance use disorders, depression, suicidal ideationand dissociation. It is therefore imperative to identify a therapeutic that is beneficial in those individuals with the comorbidities that typically confer treatment resistance.

The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) sertraline and paroxetine are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved first-line therapeutics for the treatment of PTSD. However, an estimated 40–60% of patients do not respond to these compounds. Likewise, although evidenced-based trauma-focused psychotherapies such as prolonged exposure and cognitive behavioral therapy are considered to be the gold standard treatments for PTSD, many participants fail to respond or continue to have significant symptoms, and dropout rates are high. Novel cost-effective therapeutics are therefore desperately needed.

The substituted amphetamine 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) induces serotonin release by binding primarily to presynaptic serotonin transporters. MDMA has been shown to enhance fear memory extinction, modulate fear memory reconsolidation (possibly through an oxytocin-dependent mechanism), and bolster social behavior in animal models. Pooled analysis of six phase 2 trials of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD have now shown promising safety and efficacy findings.

Here, we assess the efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted therapy in individuals with severe PTSD. Participants were given three doses of MDMA or placebo in a controlled clinical environment and in the presence of a trained therapy team. Primary and secondary outcome measures (CAPS-5 and SDS, respectively) were assessed by a centralized pool of blinded, independent diagnostic assessors. MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD was granted an FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation, and the protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP) were developed in conjunction with the FDA.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized phase 2 controlled trial [^116pGf6T]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Consistent with prior research, this study provides supportive evidence that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be safe and efficacious in individuals with chronic PTSD refractory to medication and/or psychotherapy. This is the first trial to employ multiple therapy teams with newly trained therapists implementing the manualized approach, which is encouraging regarding the likelihood that other newly-trained providers may replicate these findings in phase 3 trials. Although significant group differences were detected only in the PP set for the primary outcome, over half of participants in the ITT set who received active MDMA doses reached a 30% or greater drop in CAPS-IV total scores compared to 16.7% in the 40 mg group. After two blinded MDMA sessions, active dose groups had the largest reductions in CAPS-IV total scores with more participants attaining clinically significant improvements in PTSD symptoms relative to the 40 mg group, supporting a dose response.

To understand if three experimental sessions were more beneficial than two sessions, outcomes were evaluated again two months after the third (last) MDMA session. After the third experimental session, both the 100 mg and 125 mg groups showed further reductions in CAPS-IV scores, providing evidence that an additional session significantly improved PTSD outcomes. On the other hand, after the 40 mg group crossed over, a large treatment response resulted after two open-label sessions with little change after the third. The difference in time to respond is likely due to individual variation in the small samples, although there may have been a small additional therapeutic effect from the initial two low-dose sessions. Importantly, the gains were maintained over a 12-month follow-up after all groups had received active doses of MDMA in either blinded or open-label sessions, with 76% (n = 25) of individuals not meeting the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD. The fact that CAPS scores continued to improve between the two-month and 12-month follow-up visits lends support to the hypothesis that MDMA helps to catalyze a therapeutic process that continues long after the last drug administration. Moreover, the secondary outcome measures (depression, sleep, and dissociation) all showed significant reduction of symptoms at 12 months compared to baseline. At the 12-month visit, only one participant was taking a medication for PTSD; nine others were taking medications for insomnia, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and anxiety.

### Development of an Australian clinical practice guideline on methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder [^117XK9JH]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite recent clinical and research interest, medical use of psychedelics has not been legalised in most jurisdictions. The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration rescheduled methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in July 2023 to permit authorised prescribing of MDMA for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) outside of the clinical trial setting.

Objective

This manuscript describes the development of the Australian Clinical Practice Guideline on MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) for PTSD.

Methods

The Guideline will be developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) process. The Guideline will consider the benefits and harms of MDMA-AP compared to other treatments in people with PTSD. High quality systematic reviews identified via an overview of systematic reviews will be used as index and supplementary reviews. Using the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision framework, the multidisciplinary Guideline Development Group (GDG) will consider treatment benefits and harms, certainty of evidence, patient preferences and values, resources, equity, acceptability and feasibility. The GDG will be supported by a Stakeholder Group, Expert Group, Conflict of Interest Oversight Committee, and Evidence Review Team. The Guideline will be developed using an integrated knowledge translation approach, emphasising the co-production of knowledge through active participation and shared decision-making with end-users.

Conclusion

The Guideline will be published on the digital platform MAGICapp and disseminated in peer-reviewed publications, professional conferences and via specific stakeholder groups. A Companion Guide will be developed for people living with PTSD and their carers, family members, and supports.

### The safety and efficacy of { ± } 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy in subjects with chronic, treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder: the first randomized controlled pilot study [^1121UY27]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2011). Low credibility.

Case reports indicate that psychiatrists administered ± 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as a catalyst to psychotherapy before recreational use of MDMA as 'Ecstasy' resulted in its criminalization in 1985. Over two decades later, this study is the first completed clinical trial evaluating MDMA as a therapeutic adjunct. Twenty patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder, refractory to both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, were randomly assigned to psychotherapy with concomitant active drug (n = 12) or inactive placebo (n = 8) administered during two 8-h experimental psychotherapy sessions. Both groups received preparatory and follow-up non-drug psychotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, administered at baseline, 4 days after each experimental session, and 2 months after the second session. Neurocognitive testing, blood pressure, and temperature monitoring were performed. After 2-month follow-up, placebo subjects were offered the option to re-enroll in the experimental procedure with open-label MDMA. Decrease in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale scores from baseline was significantly greater for the group that received MDMA than for the placebo group at all three time points after baseline. The rate of clinical response was 10/12 (83%) in the active treatment group versus 2/8 (25%) in the placebo group. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, adverse neurocognitive effects or clinically significant blood pressure increases. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be administered to posttraumatic stress disorder patients without evidence of harm, and it may be useful in patients refractory to other treatments.

REGULATORY PATHWAY AND MEDICAL NEED

Following promising results from multiple FDA and DEA‐approved phase II studies of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy for PTSD, permission has been requested for a phase III program. These trials utilize a gold‐standard objective primary outcome measure and incorporate secondary exploratory measures to better assess benefit in complex clinical cases. Several measures of depression, anxiety, and PTSD are recognized by the FDA, and development of improved objective functional outcome measures is ongoing. Recently, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) revised its opinion on RCTs, advising active‐controlled trials rather than placebo‐controlled, justifying approvals based on added value rather than absolute superiority. Provided trials are randomized and outcomes are assessed by an objective centralized group, and bias can be effectively minimized. In line with FDA recommendations, proposed phase III success criteria for MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy include statistical superiority over psychotherapy with placebo in reducing PTSD symptoms as assessed objectively by a blinded centralized independent rater group at 2‐month follow‐up.

Unlike most FDA‐approved drugs that require a chronic daily dosing regimen for efficacy, with maintenance treatment required to prevent relapse, MDMA is administered as two to three single‐dose treatments, frequently with a strong response after the first session. In contrast to maintenance dosing, which can place significant burden on metabolic pathways and increase potential adverse effects, single‐dose treatments have a more favorable risk/benefit profile. Therefore, single‐dose toxicity studies with assessments for delayed toxicity and reversibility after washout appear more appropriate than repeated‐dose toxicology studies. Likewise, pre‐postnatal development studies with daily dosing covering development up to sexual maturity, currently required in all countries to support marketing approval, may be beyond the scope of what should be required to demonstrate safety of single‐dose treatments. This is especially true if highly effective methods of birth control and a negative pregnancy test just prior to each treatment continue to be required postapproval.

### Therapeutic potential of MDMA-and psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for adolescent depression and trauma [^117Ee5n1]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is a mental health crisis affecting youth, and the utility of existing treatments is often limited by lack of effectiveness and tolerability. The aim of this review is to report on outcomes of clinical trials for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for adults with depression and MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and discuss recommendations for exploring these treatments in adolescent populations.

Recent Findings

There have been encouraging data supporting the use of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for depression, including previously treatment-resistant symptoms. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is showing similar promise in treating PTSD, with excellent response and remission rates that appear durable. However, no studies have looked at the use of these treatments in younger patients. The safety and efficacy of psychedelic- and MDMA-assisted psychotherapies should be investigated in adolescents, especially considering the burden of untreated and undertreated psychiatric illness in youth, and the benefits of a potentially earlier, more effective, and more tolerable recovery process. Research and implementation should be tailored to the needs of this population, and equity and access should be considered at every stage. In this novel and rapidly evolving landscape, the psychiatric community is encouraged to advocate for safe, appropriate, and inclusive inquiry into, and application and scaling of these treatment models in adolescent patients.

Statistics and reproducibility

Statistical power calculations for the initial sample size were made by fitting an MMRM of CAPS-4 data (converted to the CAPS-5 scale and pooled from the phase 2 studies) to obtain variance and covariance parameter estimates. Using the estimated effect size and variance and covariance parameters, the sample size was calculated to achieve a power of 90% at an alpha of 0.049.

The intent-to-treat (ITT) set consisted of 91 randomized participants, however, one participant declined dosing on the morning of the session and provided no additional data, and therefore it was not possible to complete this analysis. Participants were randomized in a blinded fashion with 1:1 allocation as described in the section on randomization, masking and bias minimization above. The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) set consisted of 90 randomized participants who had completed at least one blinded experimental session and at least one post-treatment assessment. The mITT set consisted of 46 participants randomized to the MDMA group and 44 participants randomized to the placebo group, with identical therapy. The per protocol set (completers) consisted of all participants who completed three experimental sessions and assessments (MDMA, n = 42; placebo, n = 37) (Fig. 1).

The SAP was guided by the ICH E9 (R1) guidelines, which describe the use of estimands and sensitivity analyses to measure the effects of the drug if taken as directed (de jure, assessment of efficacy), and the effects of the drug if taken as assigned, regardless of adherence (de facto, assessment of effectiveness). The SAP was developed in accordance with FDA requirements and was approved by the European Medicines Agency to meet the requirements for future marketing applications. The primary and secondary efficacy analyses therefore utilized a de jure estimand of the mITT set for assessing treatment efficacy from the CAPS-5 and SDS data while on the study drug. The de jure dataset did not include outcome measurements taken after treatment discontinuation in the analysis of treatment efficacy. Missing data were not imputed.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized phase 2 controlled trial [^115X37mW]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The promising efficacy and safety results from this dose response study, along with findings from five other phase 2 trials form the basis for expansion into multi-site phase 3 trials. In addition, the FDA granted "Breakthrough therapy" designation for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD treatment, which may expedite the drug development process. Both short-term (one and two month) and long-term (12 month) follow-up results were positive across numerous therapy teams, demonstrating generalizability of the approach. The treatment was safe and well-tolerated. More research is needed to determine the optimal number of MDMA sessions needed to achieve symptom remission. Upcoming phase 3 trials, with a planned enrollment of 200–300 participants will evaluate the time to response and other factors that influence outcomes. If findings are replicated in phase 3 trials, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy will become an available treatment option for people suffering with PTSD.

Treatment response and remission in the MDMA-AT (n = 53) and placebo with therapy (n = 50) groups.

A ≥ 10-point reduction in CAPS-5 total severity score was considered to be clinically meaningful. Responders (≥ 10-point reduction from baseline), loss of diagnosis (≥ 10-point reduction from baseline and no longer meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria) and remission (loss of diagnosis and CAPS-5 total severity score of 11 or less) were tracked in both groups as a percentage of participants. Non-responders were defined as any CAPS-5 total severity score change < 10-point reduction from baseline.

Source data

Covariate analyses demonstrated similar responses to treatment regardless of disease severity, risk of hazardous alcohol or substance use disorder, severe adverse childhood experiences or dissociative subtype PTSD. The only measured exploratory covariate with a significant interaction with treatment was lifetime history of SSRI use, which was associated with improved efficacy of MDMA-AT (P = 0.02; Supplementary Table 5). Covariates significantly impacting the main effect were sex assigned at birth and baseline Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II score; female sex assigned at birth and baseline BDI-II score ≥ 23 were both associated with improved outcomes irrespective of treatment assignment (P < 0.05).

A blinding survey conducted at study termination showed that 33 of 44 (75.0%) participants in the placebo with therapy group were certain or thought they received placebo, whereas nine of 44 (20.5%) participants inaccurately thought that they received MDMA, and two of 44 (4.5%) participants could not tell. In the MDMA-AT group, 49 of 52 (94.2%) participants were certain or thought that they received MDMA; one of 52 (1.9%) participants inaccurately thought that they received placebo; and two of 52 (3.8%) participants could not tell (Supplementary Table 6). When asked for the reason for their belief in treatment assignment, most participants in the MDMA-AT group reported attributing their response on the blinding survey to experiencing positive mental or emotional effect (45/52 (86.5%)) and positive physical effect (29/52 (55.8%)), whereas most of the participants in the placebo with therapy group reported experiencing no effect (28/44 (63.6%)).

### The emerging field of psychedelic psychotherapy [^113PQC6o]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

Few treatments are available for patients with mood disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who have already failed multiple interventions. After several decades when research into psychedelics was effectively halted by federal legislation, the past several years have shown the re-emergence of thoughtful investigations studying the utility of compounds such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and psilocybin.

Recent Findings

Several studies have coupled the safe administration of psychedelic compounds in a controlled environment after several hours of preparation of study participants and followed by multiple sessions to integrate the psychedelic experience. The improvement participants experience appear related to the often profound perspective changes experienced and seem unlike the improvements seen in the currently available care paradigms. Studies cited include treatment resistant depression, end of life despair, and PTSD.

Summary

Psychedelic psychotherapy, a unique remarriage of biological therapy and psychotherapy, has the potential to transform mental health care.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder: evolving conceptualization and evidence, and future research directions [^112FUYk7]. World Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

The understanding of responses to traumatic events has been greatly influenced by the introduction of the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this paper we review the initial versions of the diagnostic criteria for this condition and the associated epidemiological findings, including sociocultural differences. We consider evidence for post-traumatic reactions occurring in multiple contexts not previously defined as traumatic, and the implications that these observations have for the diagnosis. More recent developments such as the DSM-5 dissociative subtype and the ICD-11 diagnosis of complex PTSD are reviewed, adding to evidence that there are several distinct PTSD phenotypes. We describe the psychological foundations of PTSD, involving disturbances to memory as well as to identity. A broader focus on identity may be able to accommodate group and communal influences on the experience of trauma and PTSD, as well as the impact of resource loss. We then summarize current evidence concerning the biological foundations of PTSD, with a particular focus on genetic and neuroimaging studies. Whereas progress in prevention has been disappointing, there is now an extensive evidence supporting the efficacy of a variety of psychological treatments for established PTSD, including trauma-focused interventions - such as trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) - and non-trauma-focused therapies, which also include some emerging identity-based approaches such as present-centered and compassion-focused therapies. Additionally, there are promising interventions that are neither psychological nor pharmacological, or that combine a pharmacological and a psychological approach, such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy. We review advances in the priority areas of adapting interventions in resource-limited settings and across cultural contexts, and of community-based approaches. We conclude by identifying future directions for work on trauma and mental health.

### Potential psychiatric uses for MDMA [^111VdDKk]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

In cases of unmet medical need, the FDA has provided special programs with accelerated pathways for approval that may apply to MDMA, as effect size estimates for PTSD are large, relapse rates are low, and administration under strictly controlled conditions improves compliance over available treatments. In addition, risk evaluation mitigation strategies (REMS) will allow sponsor oversight of certification of treatment providers, to assure that they have the necessary experience and qualifications to administer MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy. Appropriate mechanisms to prevent abuse and diversion will likely preclude take‐home prescriptions, and may involve restricting use to licensed clinics. Based on coadministration studies with psychiatric medications typically prescribed, MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy is unlikely to cause safety concerns within an integrated medication management model, but washout of other medications may be needed for optimal results. The outcome of negotiations with the FDA regarding phase III clinical trials and subsequent marketing remain to be determined.

As MDMA is not patentable and will be difficult to commercialize with single‐dose treatments, the most suitable avenue is nonprofit drug development. The nonprofit organization funding and sponsoring clinical trials of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy has made substantial progress using rigorous scientific approaches complying with cautious regulatory requirements. This progress demonstrates that it is possible to study Schedule 1 drugs under the current regulatory structure, but that progress in this area has been undesirably slow. Meticulously establishing safety and efficacy is crucial to evaluating the risk/benefit profile of single‐dose treatments as an adjunct to psychotherapy, which may offer improved safety and compliance over available treatments. Fostering open science principles, e.g. prioritizing publishing in peer‐reviewed journals and data transparency, will ultimately prove beneficial in shaping and expediting the regulatory environment that applies to MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy and similar models with other compounds. Implementation of novel MDMA‐assisted therapies could hold the promise of lasting improvements in social and psychological function for patients, and of deeper understanding of psychiatric disturbances across multiple disorders.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^112gktHX]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

We may soon be confronted with the potentially enormous economic and social repercussions of PTSD, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Overwhelmingly high rates of psychological and mental health impairment could be with us for years to come and are likely to impart a considerable emotional and economic burden. Novel PTSD therapeutics are desperately needed, especially for those for whom comorbidities confer treatment resistance.

In summary, MDMA-assisted therapy induces rapid onset of treatment efficacy, even in those with severe PTSD, and in those with associated comorbidities including dissociative PTSD, depression, history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. Not only is MDMA-assisted therapy efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, but it may also provide improved patient safety. Compared with current first-line pharmacological and behavioral therapies, MDMA-assisted therapy has the potential to dramatically transform treatment for PTSD and should be expeditiously evaluated for clinical use.

### An update on psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD [^117Thj9d]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are part of the normal response to trauma. Most trauma survivors will recover over time without intervention, but a significant minority will develop chronic PTSD, which is unlikely to remit without intervention. Currently, only two medications, sertraline and paroxetine, are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat PTSD, and the combination of brexpiprazole and sertraline and MDMA-assisted therapy have FDA applications pending. These medications, and the combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, are not recommended as first-line treatments in any published PTSD treatment guidelines. The only interventions recommended as first-line treatments are trauma-focused psychotherapies; the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense PTSD treatment guideline recommends prolonged exposure (PE), cognitive processing therapy (CPT), and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, and the American Psychological Association PTSD treatment guideline recommends PE, CPT, cognitive therapy, and trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy. Although published clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy have not incorporated evidence-based PTSD psychotherapies, they have achieved greater response rates than other trials of combination treatment, and there is some enthusiasm about combining psychedelic medications with evidence-based psychotherapies. The state-of-the-art PTSD psychotherapies are briefly reviewed here, including their effects on clinical and neurobiological measures.

### Negative affect circuit subtypes and neural, behavioral, and affective responses to MDMA: a randomized clinical trial [^116Gmxja]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Rapidly acting therapeutics like 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) are promising treatments for disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, understanding who benefits most and the underlying neural mechanisms remains a critical gap. Stratifying individuals by neural circuit profiles could help differentiate neural, behavioral, and affective responses to MDMA, enabling personalized treatment strategies.

Objective

To investigate whether baseline stratification of individuals based on negative affect circuit profiles, particularly in response to nonconscious threat stimuli, can differentiate acute responses to MDMA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial, implementing a double-blinded, within-participant, placebo- and baseline-controlled design, was conducted at Stanford University School of Medicine between November 2, 2021, and November 9, 2022, for wave 1 data collection. Participants had used MDMA on at least 2 prior occasions, but not in the past 6 months, and had subthreshold PTSD symptoms and early life trauma but no current psychiatric disorders. Data were analyzed from March 1, 2023, to January 1, 2024.

Interventions

Participants completed 4 visits: 1 baseline session followed by 1 placebo session and 2 MDMA sessions in a randomized order, totaling 64 visits. Baseline functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessed the negative affect circuit using a nonconscious threat processing task (NTN).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes included activity and connectivity of amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) defining the negative affect circuit. Secondary outcomes were behavioral measures of implicit threat bias, likability of threat expressions, and affective assessments.

Results

Sixteen participants (10 [63%] female; mean [SD] age, 40.8 [7.6] years) were stratified into subgroups with high and low levels of NTN activity in the amygdala (NTNA+ [n = 8] and NTNA- [n = 8], respectively), based on a median split of baseline nonconscious threat-evoked fMRI responses. Following administration of the 120 mg of MDMA vs placebo, the NTNA+ subgroup showed significant reductions in amygdala (contrast estimate [CE], -1.43; 95% CI, -2.60 to -0.27; Cohen d, -1.22; p = 0.02) and sgACC activity (CE, -1.48; 95% CI, -2.42 to -0.54; Cohen d, -1.56; p = 0.004), increased sgACC-amygdala connectivity (CE, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.02–1.28; Cohen d, 1.02; p = 0.04), and increased likability of threat expressions (CE, 14.38; 95% CI, 1.46–27.29; Cohen d, 0.86; p = 0.03) compared with the NTNA- subgroup.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial of MDMA's acute profiles, 120 mg of MDMA acutely normalized negative affect circuit reactivity in participants stratified by heightened amygdala reactivity at baseline, demonstrating the potential of neuroimaging to identify prospective biomarkers and guide personalized MDMA-based therapies.

### Treating posttraumatic stress disorder with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy: a preliminary meta-analysis and comparison to prolonged exposure therapy [^115it3Vh]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

Since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become a major area of research and development. The most widely accepted treatment for PTSD is prolonged exposure (PE) therapy, but for many patients it is intolerable or ineffective. ± 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) has recently re-emerged as a new treatment option, with two clinical trials having been published and both producing promising results. However, these results have yet to be compared to existing treatments. The present paper seeks to bridge this gap in the literature. Often the statistical significance of clinical trials is overemphasized, while the magnitude of the treatment effects is overlooked. The current meta-analysis aims to provide a comparison of the cumulative effect size of the MDMA-AP studies with those of PE. Effect sizes were calculated for primary and secondary outcome measures in the MDMA-AP clinical trials and compared to those of a meta-analysis including several PE clinical trials. It was found that MDMA-AP had larger effect sizes in both clinician-observed outcomes than PE did (Hedges' g = 1.17 vs. g = 1.08, respectively) and patient self-report outcomes (Hedges' g = 0.87 vs. g = 0.77, respectively). The dropout rates of PE and MDMA-AP were also compared, revealing that MDMA-AP had a considerably lower percentage of patients dropping out than PE did. These results suggest that MDMA-AP offers a promising treatment for PTSD.

The Future of Psychedelic Treatments

Psychedelics remain in an early stage of research. In the era of modern psychedelic research, participants numbering only in the hundreds have received MDMA and psilocybin in clinical research settings. While the early clinical trials have been impressive and demonstrate the promise of psychedelic treatments, findings have yet to replicate on a large scale. The sole phase 3 clinical trial on MDMA for PTSD so far (Mitchell et al. 2020) itself included just 90 patients. Fortunately, further phase 3 clinical trials for MDMA are underway, and phase 3 trials on psilocybin for PTSD are also currently being planned. For psilocybin, the largest trial thus far has been a phase 2, dose finding study where 233 patients were randomized to 1mg, 10mg, or 25mg of psilocybin. A phase 3 clinical trial on psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression with likely start by the end of 2022.

One major area for future research is the generalizability of these clinical trials. The large majority of participants in these trials are white individuals being treated in carefully controlled research settings. Whether people from diverse socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic backgrounds respond to and benefit from psychedelic therapies in the same way as the participants in clinical trials so far remains a crucial open question. Moreover, the comparative risks and benefits of MDMA and psilocybin versus other novel psychiatric treatments, such as ketamine and various neuromodulation techniques, remain unknown. However, there is promise that psychedelics could outperform existing treatments. Psilocybin, for example, has demonstrated rapid and sustained antidepressant effects without tolerance or dependence in trials so far. Compared with ketamine, whose effects wear off after a few weeks of treatment, often requiring repeated dosing and carrying the risk of dependence and tolerance, psilocybin may carry a more favorable risk–benefit profile, though more research is required to definitively determine this. For MDMA, one pontential major comparative advantage is its efficacy in dissociative PTSD, an area for which psychiatry has relatively few effective pharmacological treatments. Whether or not these effects will translate into a treatment of dissociation more generally remains unknown.

Since the mid 2000s, however, there has been a resurgence of interest in MDMA as a medicine to treat various conditions. Considerable research concerning its pharmacological effects and efficacy as a tool in psychotherapy, including several clinical studies in human volunteers, has been conducted recently. At the forefront of this new wave of research is the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), who conducted an early trial with MDMA in humans and published the results in 2011, which opened new avenues of research. Since then, MAPS and other scientific institutions have conducted a host of clinical trials to ascertain MDMA's effectiveness in treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The outcomes of these trials have yielded highly favourable results, which suggest that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is significantly more effective at treating PTSD than any other treatment currently available. This led the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to grant breakthrough therapy status to MDMA in 2017, thereby agreeing to expedite and aid the approval process if it stands up to further scrutiny. MDMA is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials and is expected to appear on the market as a treatment for PTSD in 2021.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^114RBoA3]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study MAPP1 was published by Jennifer M Mitchell and colleagues in 2021 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Posttraumatic stress disorder. In the MAPP1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of MDMA-assisted therapy in patients with severe PTSD? In the MAPP1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the MAPP1 study, the population was: 90 patients (59 female, 31 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with severe PTSD, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. The key exclusion criteria were primary psychotic disorder, bipolar I disorder, dissociative identity disorder, eating disorders with active purging, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, personality disorders, current alcohol and substance use disorders. In the MAPP1 study, the interventions were: n = 46 MDMA-assisted therapy (manualized MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions) n = 44 placebo with therapy (inactive placebo-assisted psychotherapy with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions). In the MAPP1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in PTSD symptoms, as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 at 18 weeks (24.4 points vs. 13.9 points; AD 10.5 points, 95% CI 5.25 to 15.75). In the MAPP1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in functional impairment score, as measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (3.1 points vs. 2 points; AD 1.1 points, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.95) Significant increase in reduction in depressive symptoms, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory II (19.7 vs. 10.8; AD 8.9, 95% CI 3.12 to 14.68). In the MAPP1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in suicidality, QT prolongation. significant difference in patients with remission after three sessions (33% vs. 5%). In the MAPP1 study, the conclusion was: in patients with severe PTSD, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma, MDMA-assisted therapy was superior to placebo with therapy with respect to reduction in PTSD symptoms, as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 at 18 weeks.

Modern Psychedelic Research

MDMA

While interest in psychedelics between the 1970s and 1990s never entirely disappeared, the new millennium brought about a renaissance in psychedelic research. Between 2004 and 2017, there were six positive phase 2 clinical trials investigating the use of MDMA for PTSD. Averaging across these trials, MDMA had a large effect size compared with control groups (Cohen's d = 0.8) on PTSD symptoms, with a mean difference in CAPS-IV scores of − 22.0 points. Depending on the specific trial design, patients received MDMA or control in two or three dosing sessions, which were separated by a month. All the trials involved several psychotherapy sessions before the dose, and three integration sessions after each dose.

On the basis of these results, MDMA gained the FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation in 2017. During this time, one important phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated the feasibility of maintaining consistent protocols across multiple treatment sites in preparation for a phase 3 trial. The first phase 3 clinical trial, published in 2021, compared active MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in 46 patients with placebo + therapy in 44 patients. This trial demonstrated a large effect size of MDMA-assisted therapy compared to placebo with therapy (Cohen's d = 0.9) and had a similar structure for pre- and post-dose therapeutic sessions as the phase 2 trials described above. Of note, patients with the dissociative subtype of PTSD, which is often considered more difficult to treat, improved at least as much as patients with the non-dissociative subtype. Moreover, patients in the placebo group also showed significant improvements in PTSD, supporting the efficacy of psychotherapy (as well as the efficacy of set and setting independent of drug effects) in treating PTSD.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine facilitates fear extinction learning [^1133GWfE]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Acutely administered 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') has been proposed to have long-term positive effects on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms when combined with psychotherapy. No preclinical data support a mechanistic basis for these claims. Given the persistent nature of psychotherapeutic gains facilitated by MDMA, we hypothesized that MDMA improves fear extinction learning, a key process in exposure-based therapies for PTSD. In these experiments, mice were first exposed to cued fear conditioning and treated with drug vehicle or MDMA before extinction training 2 days later. MDMA was administered systemically and also directly targeted to brain structures known to contribute to extinction. In addition to behavioral measures of extinction, changes in mRNA levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) and Fos were measured after MDMA treatment and extinction. MDMA (7.8 mg kg⁻¹) persistently and robustly enhanced long-term extinction when administered before extinction training. MDMA increased the expression of Fos in the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), whereas increases in Bdnf expression were observed only in the amygdala after extinction training. Extinction enhancements were recapitulated when MDMA (1 μg) was infused directly into the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), and enhancement was abolished when BDNF signaling was inhibited before extinction. These findings suggest that MDMA enhances fear memory extinction through a BDNF-dependent mechanism, and that MDMA may be a useful adjunct to exposure-based therapies for PTSD and other anxiety disorders characterized by altered fear learning.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder [^116Porac]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD PTSD CPG — MDMA-assisted psychotherapy — Recommendation 23 states there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added). MDMA-assisted psychotherapy involves an individual taking MDMA before 2–3 eight hour psychotherapy sessions; typically, 3 preparatory sessions occur before the first MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session, and up to 3 "integration" sessions occur after each MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session (for a total of 12–15 sessions), and MDMA sessions are provided by two therapists, typically a man and a woman. Five small to moderately sized RCTs (including a total of 176 participants) have found this form of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to benefit individuals with PTSD, but studies have differed notably in the control condition used; some have used low-dose MDMA as the control condition, whereas others have used an inactive placebo, and studies using low-dose MDMA as the control condition generally demonstrated much better blinding; additionally, these studies included few Veterans and no active duty Service members, and it would be challenging to implement MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in current VA and DoD health care systems.

### Expanded access to psychedelic treatments: comparing American and Canadian policies [^116Njh3f]. General Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

In the United States of America (USA), the FDA has a similar programme to Health Canada's SAP, known as expanded access, which serves as a potential pathway for patients with a serious or life-threatening condition to gain access to an investigational treatment outside of clinical trials when there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy. Expanded access was first granted for MDMA in January 2020 as sponsored by Lykos Therapeutics (previously Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) as part of the FDA's efforts to facilitate the development of this potential new medicine that the agency had designated as a breakthrough therapy. This application of the expanded access pathway allowed the drug to be administered to a total of up to 50 patients with PTSD at 10 qualified treatment sites. Based on available records, expanded access for MDMA via Lykos Therapeutics was available from November 2021 to August 2023. To the author's knowledge, complete data on the safety and efficacy of this expanded access programme have not been made publicly available. As a potential proxy, available data based on the randomised, placebo-controlled phase III trial of MDMA-assisted therapy by the same sponsor indicated that in an ethno-racially diverse sample of 104 participants with PTSD (71.15% female, Mean age = 39.08 (standard deviation (SD) = 10.38)), 71.2% of participants in the MDMA group no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD post-treatment compared with 47.6% in the placebo group. However, both mild and severe, but no serious (ie, life-threatening), treatment-emergent adverse events were noted as part of the study, including muscle tightness, nausea and decreased appetite, as well as suicidal ideation, insomnia and anxiety. These findings highlight the importance of physiological and psychological safety monitoring by present staff during sessions and systematic post-session monitoring in the weeks and months following treatment, especially in the context of expanded access. This will enable the continued documentation of adverse events on the part of patients accessing treatment via this expanded access pathway and facilitate appropriate intervention if necessary.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^111R1iVf]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

PTSD treatment key questions and evidence sources — the Panel used six questions to guide scoping: comparative effectiveness of different psychological treatments for adults with PTSD and how effectiveness varies by patient characteristics or type of trauma; comparative effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for adults diagnosed with PTSD and how effectiveness varies by patient characteristics or type of trauma; comparative effectiveness of different psychological and pharmacological treatments for adults diagnosed with PTSD and how effectiveness varies by patient characteristics or type of trauma; how combinations of psychological and pharmacological treatments compare with either one alone; whether any PTSD treatments are more effective for particular trauma types; and what adverse events are associated with treatments for adults diagnosed with PTSD. Despite an updated AHRQ review expanding psychological and pharmacological interventions, notable gaps remained, including not addressing complex PTSD, pharmacological augmentation interventions, family-based therapies, MDMA augmentation, ketamine, maintenance of treatment gains over time (i.e., 3, 6, 12-month follow-up), or complementary and integrative health interventions. The Panel considered using the AHRQ PTSD repository review with the update as a "package review", but the repository only reported raw data and did not provide the meta-analytic effect size information necessary for drafting recommendations.

### Therapeutic effect of increased openness: investigating mechanism of action in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy [^116ZmxhH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

How MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can result in rather abrupt and lasting personality change is a perplexing question. Qualitatively, a consistent subjective theme emerged, with our subjects reporting a profound cathartic experience, often described as going to a "place" (in their mind) where they had never been before. It is interesting to speculate that MDMA acts as a catalyst, increasing openness, and thereby reducing PTSD-related symptoms and associated negative neuroticism. As such, MDMA, and its ability to facilitate personality change, may prove to be a frontline treatment for those with "complex" PTSD. While therapeutic experiences with psychedelic drugs do seem to result in lasting pervasively positive personality change, had cautioned that the mystical experience is necessary, but not sufficient, for personality change to occur. Likewise, we would argue that the MDMA experience is only therapeutic in the context of psychotherapy. In a non-therapeutic context, it is quite possible that the reverse effect could occur. We speculate that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy facilitates, or "primes", a profound susceptibility for increased openness to experiences, which, in turn, enhances therapy's effectiveness. This notion was supported by our findings that those who had the greatest personality changes following treatment also had significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptoms. Considering that MDMA has been shown to acutely elevate oxytocin levels, it is of interest that personality is affected by pharmacological administration of oxytocin. Future research intends to investigate potential links between reported cathartic experience with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy-linked symptom reduction and personality change.

Enrolled participants underwent three 90-min preparation sessions with a two-person therapy team, including at least one licensed therapist, and were then randomized 1:1 to receive MDMA-AT or placebo with therapy for approximately 3 months. The treatment period consisted of three 8-h dosing sessions, in conjunction with therapy, spaced approximately 1 month apart. Therapy was conducted by trained personnel in accordance with the MAPS MDMA-AT treatment manual and trial protocol. During experimental sessions, and in keeping with the dosing in MAPP1, participants received a split dose of 120–180 mg of MDMA or placebo. For the first experimental session, the initial dose of 80 mg was followed by a supplemental half-dose of 40 mg. In the second and third experimental sessions, the initial dose of 120 mg was followed by a supplemental half-dose of 60 mg. The supplemental half dose was administered 1.5–2 h after the initial dose. Participants in both treatment groups received identical therapy. The 120-mg (80 mg + 40 mg) split dose was selected for the first experimental session in phase 3 trials to allow patients to acclimate to the treatment regimen using a clinical titration approach based on clinician recommendations from a phase 2 trial in veterans and first responders. During the second and third experimental sessions, doses were escalated to 180 mg (120 mg + 60 mg), as this was the most frequently studied efficacious dose in phase 2 trials. This dosing regimen also provides clinicians with the option of dose adjustments if needed.

Within the MDMA-AT group, three participants did not undergo dose escalation in experimental sessions 2 and 3, and two participants experienced dose administration timing errors (Supplementary Table 2). Each experimental session was followed by three 90-min integration sessions to support participants in processing and understanding their experience (Supplementary Fig. 1). Full procedures, including details on therapy teams and training, are outlined in the Supplementary Methods.

### A comparison of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to non-assisted psychotherapy in treatment-resistant PTSD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1122vNjS]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Novel, evidence-based treatments are required for treatment-resistant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has beneficially augmented psychotherapy in several small clinical trials.

Objective

To review the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in treatment-resistant PTSD.

Methods

Systematic searches of four databases were conducted from inception to February 2020. A meta-analysis was performed on trials which were double-blinded, randomised, and compared MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to psychotherapy and placebo. The primary outcomes were the differences in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) score and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). Secondary outcome measures included neurocognitive and physical adverse effects, at the time, and within 7 days of intervention.

Results

Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met inclusion criteria. When compared to active placebo, intervention groups taking 75mg (MD -46.90; 95% (confidence intervals) CI -58.78, -35.02), 125mg (MD -20.98; 95% CI -34.35, -7.61) but not 100mg (MD -12.90; 95% CI -36.09, 10.29) of MDMA with psychotherapy, had significant decreases in CAPS-IV scores, as did the inactive placebo arm (MD -33.20; 95% CI -40.53, -25.87). A significant decrease in BDI when compared to active placebo (MD -10.80; 95% CI -20.39, -1.21) was only observed at 75mg. Compared to placebo, participants reported significantly more episodes of low mood, nausea and jaw-clenching during sessions and lack of appetite after 7 days.

Conclusion

These results demonstrate potential therapeutic benefit with minimal physical and neurocognitive risk for the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in TR-PTSD, despite little effect on Beck's Depression Inventory. Better powered RCTs are required to investigate further.

### Durability of improvement in post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and absence of harmful effects or drug dependency after 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy: a prospective long-term follow-up study [^114dJWYW]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Over a decade ago, we conceived this study in an attempt to develop and test a novel therapy for PTSD, a clinical condition for which a wider array of effective treatment options has remained a crucial need. Using rigorous scientific methodology, we describe a potentially beneficial new therapeutic modality with support from solid empirical data. Following this promising first step, we now report very long-term outcome results in the original cohort, demonstrating a sustained benefit over time, with no cases of subsequent drug abuse and no reports of neurocognitive decline. These results indicate that there was a favorable long-term risk/benefit ratio for PTSD treatment with just a few doses of pure MDMA administered in a supportive setting, in conjunction with psychotherapy. Should further research validate our initial findings, we predict that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy will become an important treatment option for this very challenging clinical and public health problem.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine facilitates fear extinction learning [^117SWU3C]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by recurrent and intrusive memories for a traumatic experience. Clinical studies report long-lasting improvements in symptoms of PTSD following psychotherapy sessions paired with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), an amphetamine derivative with mildly hallucinogenic and profound mood-elevating properties. However, no preclinical data provide a mechanistic basis for these findings. Although the most readily observable effects of MDMA are its increases in positive mood and social behavior, other mood elevators, such as anxiolytics, do not produce long-term reductions in conditioned fear or lasting positive outcomes as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Given that reported improvements in PTSD symptoms following MDMA-assisted psychotherapy last for years after the intervention, we hypothesized that acute MDMA affects fear learning and molecular memory processes important in extinguishing conditioned fear responses.

Mechanisms of the learning and extinction of fear have been studied extensively in rodent models. In these models, a conditioned fear response is instated by pairing a previously neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus; CS) and aversive stimulus (unconditioned stimulus; US), and the response is later extinguished with repeated re-exposure to the CS in the absence of the US. This is a useful model for understanding the learning and memory processes required for long-term recovery from PTSD because it resembles exposure-based therapy, wherein repeated exposure to a fear-eliciting stimulus or memory promotes a reduced fear response to future reminders of the trauma. The effect of clinically relevant doses of MDMA on either fear extinction or exposure-based therapy has not been explored to date, despite the fact that acute doses of MDMA increase serotonergic and noradrenergic signaling known to be important for fear extinction learning across species.

### Review of potential psychedelic treatments for PTSD [^117UZczx]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental illness with limited treatment options and a high treatment dropout rate. Psychedelics, often in combination with psychotherapy, are now under investigation as a potential treatment option for a variety of psychiatric conditions including PTSD. This paper reviews the proposed mechanism of action for 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and classical psychedelics such as psilocybin in treating PTSD, along with available clinical evidence, safety and side effects. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is in FDA phase III clinical trials for PTSD and is purported to work by way of increased empathy and decreased amygdala activation during the therapeutic encounter and trauma processing. Classical psychedelics may create change by a subjective transformative experience along with an observable process of brain network alterations, though these substances have not been clinically studied in the context PTSD. In recent human-subject studies MDMA-assisted therapy resulted in significant improvement in PTSD symptoms with a good safety and side effect profile. There is not yet direct clinical evidence for classical psychedelics in treating PTSD, but the evidence supports such a trial. The studies to date have been relatively small, and participants are wellscreened for potential co-morbidities which could increase the risks of psychedelic treatment. Nonetheless, the data is promising for psychedelic-assisted treatment to become a much-needed treatment option for PTSD.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized phase 2 controlled trial [^116QGW64]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Background:

Posttraumatic stress disorder often does not resolve after conventional psychotherapies or pharmacotherapies. Pilot studies have reported that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) combined with psychotherapy reduces posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.

Aims:

This pilot dose response trial assessed efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy across multiple therapy teams.

Methods:

Twenty-eight people with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder were randomized in a double-blind dose response comparison of two active doses (100 and 125 mg) with a low dose (40 mg) of MDMA administered during eight-hour psychotherapy sessions. Change in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale total scores one month after two sessions of MDMA served as the primary outcome. Active dose groups had one additional open-label session; the low dose group crossed over for three open-label active dose sessions. A 12-month follow-up assessment occurred after the final MDMA session.

Results:

In the intent-to-treat set, the active groups had the largest reduction in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale total scores at the primary endpoint, with mean (standard deviation) changes of −26.3 (29.5) for 125 mg, −24.4 (24.2) for 100 mg, and −11.5 (21.2) for 40 mg, though statistical significance was reached only in the per protocol set (p = 0.03). Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms remained lower than baseline at 12-month follow-up (p < 0.001) with 76% (n = 25) not meeting posttraumatic stress disorder criteria. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, and the treatment was well-tolerated.

Conclusions:

Our findings support previous investigations of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as an innovative, efficacious treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder.

### Expanded access to psychedelic treatments: comparing American and Canadian policies [^112rGrQM]. General Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

The United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) August 2024 determination that an additional phase III study will be required to consider the approval of midomafetamine for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could delay the potential approval of this promising treatment by several years. In principle, the FDA's expanded access pathway could enable broader access to investigational treatments as clinical trials continue. However, this alternative pathway is so burdensome that few patients are likely to benefit. Adoption of elements based on the Canadian model to expanded access may help more patients gain access to psychedelic therapy while simultaneously providing data about safety and efficacy for the FDA to consider in future reviews of these treatment approaches.

In January 2022, Health Canada instituted regulatory amendments to include 3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-4-phosphoryloxy indole (psilocybin) and N -methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDMA) as drugs that can be requested as part of the special access program (SAP). The SAP is designed to support licensed healthcare practitioners who are seeking treatment options for patients with a serious or life-threatening condition where conventional treatments have either failed, are unsuitable or are not available in the country. In order to submit a request, an SAP form must be completed on a case-by-case basis, providing details on the patient's diagnostic history, previous treatment attempts (typically involving pharmacotherapies and non-pharmacological therapies) and scientific references indicating sufficient evidence of safety and efficacy to support the requested use. Currently, conditions explicitly named by Health Canada as falling within the scope of the SAP involving psychedelic-assisted therapy include end-of-life distress and treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (for psilocybin) and PTSD (for MDMA). Mandatory follow-up forms monitoring treatment response and serious and/or unexpected adverse reactions are required by Health Canada after drug administration.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for moderate to severe PTSD: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^113bFzVH]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design and oversight

This multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy and safety of MDMA-AT versus placebo with therapy in participants diagnosed with moderate or severe PTSD. Thirteen study sites (11 in the United States and two in Israel, both institutional and private) participated. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Council for Harmonization and with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. An independent data monitoring committee ensured that the study was conducted safely and had sufficient sample size. The review boards and institutions that approved the study protocol are listed in the Supplementary Methods.

Participants

After written informed consent, participants were screened for eligibility. Adults (≥ 18 years of age) meeting the full DSM-5 criteria for current PTSD per CAPS-5 assessment, and a CAPS-5 total severity score ≥ 28 (moderate or higher severity) with symptom duration of ≥ 6 months were eligible for enrollment confirmation. During the Preparation Period that preceded the Treatment Period, participants were tapered off all psychiatric medications before baseline to avoid potential drug interactions and confounding efficacy (Supplementary Fig. 1). Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are outlined in the Supplementary Methods.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for moderate to severe PTSD: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^1172SMPV]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Randomization and masking

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 allocation and in a blinded fashion to the MDMA-AT and placebo with therapy groups, stratified by clinical site. Randomization was managed via an interactive web randomization system (IWRS) (IT Clinical version 11.0.1) based on a centralized randomization schedule developed by an independent third-party vendor to maintain blinding.

A central pool of blinded independent assessors was used to mitigate the risk of functional unblinding. Assessors were trained and supervised by independent consultants with expertise in PTSD diagnostics and the CAPS-5 to ensure inter-rater reliability and validity of assessments. Supervision involved reviewing each assessor's first two assessments as well as 20% of all assessments (chosen at random) throughout the study, with each review resulting in detailed feedback for the assessor. The independent assessors were blinded to the general study design, study visit, treatment assignment, number of treatments received and any safety data for the participant. Participants were instructed to withhold their opinion on treatment group assignment and the number of completed visits from the independent assessors. Each assessor conducted no more than one CAPS-5 assessment with each participant to reduce potential bias and expectancy effect from having conducted repeat CAPS-5s with a participant. Assessors were also vetted before their onboarding to ensure that there were no conflicts of interest (such as other involvement within the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) organization or a bias toward MDMA-AT), and assessors were instructed to not expose themselves to scholarly presentations and papers related to MDMA-AT for PTSD to maintain their blinding to study design.

To ensure that all site and sponsor staff were shielded from study outcomes, the blinded independent assessor pool collected and stored outcome measures in a dedicated database that was separate from the blinded clinical database. A blinding survey was conducted at study termination (visit 20) to assess if participants thought that they received MDMA or placebo.

### MDMA and MDMA-assisted therapy [^113Sm2pF]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

MDMA (i.e., 3,4-methylenedixoymethamphetamine), commonly known as "Ecstasy" or "Molly", has been used since the 1970s both in recreational and therapeutic settings. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designated MDMA-Assisted Therapy (MDMA-AT) as a Breakthrough Therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 2017, and the FDA is requiring an additional phase 3 trial after rejecting the initial New Drug Application in 2024. Unlike other psychedelics, MDMA uniquely induces prosocial subjective effects of heightened trust and self-compassion while maintaining ego functioning as well as cognitive and perceptual lucidity. While recreational use in nonmedical settings may still cause harm, especially due to adulterants or when used without proper precautions, conclusions that can be drawn from studies of recreational use are limited by many confounds. This especially limits the extent to which evidence related to recreational use can be extrapolated to therapeutic use. A considerable body of preliminary evidence suggests that MDMA-AT delivered in a controlled clinical setting is a safe and efficacious treatment for PTSD. After a course of MDMA-AT involving three MDMA administrations supported by psychotherapy, 67%-71% of individuals with PTSD no longer meet diagnostic criteria after MDMA-AT versus 32%-48% with placebo-assisted therapy, and effects endure at long-term follow-up. This review primarily aims to distinguish evidence of recreational use in nonclinical settings versus MDMA-AT using pharmaceutical-grade MDMA in controlled clinical settings. This review further describes the putative neurobiological mechanisms of MDMA underlying its therapeutic effects, the clinical evidence of MDMA-AT, considerations at the level of public health and policy, and future research directions.

### The emerging field of psychedelic psychotherapy [^1151znQP]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Few treatments are available for patients with mood disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who have already failed multiple interventions. After several decades when research into psychedelics was effectively halted by federal legislation, the past several years have shown the re-emergence of thoughtful investigations studying the utility of compounds such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and psilocybin.

Recent Findings

Several studies have coupled the safe administration of psychedelic compounds in a controlled environment after several hours of preparation of study participants and followed by multiple sessions to integrate the psychedelic experience. The improvement participants experience appear related to the often profound perspective changes experienced and seem unlike the improvements seen in the currently available care paradigms. Studies cited include treatment resistant depression, end of life despair, and PTSD. Psychedelic psychotherapy, a unique remarriage of biological therapy and psychotherapy, has the potential to transform mental health care.

### How could MDMA (ecstasy) help anxiety disorders? A neurobiological rationale [^115N9i2w]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Exposure therapy is known to be an effective treatment for anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, exposure is not used as much as it should be, and instead patients are often given supportive medications such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines, which may even interfere with the extinction learning that is the aim of treatment. Given that randomized controlled trials are now investigating a few doses of ± 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') in combination with psychotherapy for treatment-resistant anxiety disorders, we would like to suggest the following three mechanisms for this potentially important new approach: 1) MDMA increases oxytocin levels, which may strengthen the therapeutic alliance; 2) MDMA increases ventromedial prefrontal activity and decreases amygdala activity, which may improve emotional regulation and decrease avoidance and 3) MDMA increases norepinephrine release and circulating cortisol levels, which may facilitate emotional engagement and enhance extinction of learned fear associations. Thus, MDMA has a combination of pharmacological effects that, in a therapeutic setting, could provide a balance of activating emotions while feeling safe and in control, as described in case reports of MDMA-augmented psychotherapy. Further clinical and preclinical studies of the therapeutic value of MDMA are indicated.

### Therapeutic effect of increased openness: investigating mechanism of action in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy [^113yL9rN]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Psychological research suggests that MDMA increases prosocial feelings and behaviors, which, in turn, appears to reduce negative mood when subjects are asked to think of a difficult memory. Others have proposed inhibition of the fear response to a perceived emotional threat that allows the patient to place the emotional sequelae of past experiences into a realistic perspective in their current emotional lives and relationships as another potential psychological mechanism of change for MDMA. To date, no study has investigated the relationship between MDMA and personality changes in subjects with PTSD. While a single catastrophic event can result in PTSD and/or "complex" PTSD with enduring adverse personality changes, it would seem possible that the converse might also be true (i.e. changes in certain personality features could reduce PTSD symptoms). The present study theorized that the profound therapeutic effect of MDMA in PTSD-treatment resistant individuals is influenced by its ability to broaden characteristics of the way an individual feels, thinks, and interacts (as measured by personality changes in Openness). We have previously reported that MDMA treatment is effective at reducing PTSD symptoms. The present study reanalyzed data from,) to investigate whether personality changes were associated with PTSD symptom reduction. Given the strong relationship between PTSD and personality change, it was hypothesized that changes in Openness and Neuroticism would interact with PTSD symptom reduction. Group differences (MDMA-assisted psychotherapy vs. therapy only) in Openness and Neuroticism at baseline and 2-month follow-up also were investigated to test the hypothesis that there would be greater increases in Openness and decreases in Neuroticism in the MDMA treatment group. Lastly, Openness and Neuroticism at baseline and long-term follow-up (LTFU) (following the drug crossover trials) were examined to test the hypothesis that changes in personality following MDMA-assisted psychotherapy would persist.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized phase 2 controlled trial [^113hstV2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Possible mechanisms for the treatment effect demonstrated in this sample are theorized based on the pharmacological effects of MDMA and its actions in the context of psychotherapy. Subjective effects of MDMA that bolster prosocial feelings and behaviors make unpleasant memories more tolerable, and enhance empathy, self-compassion, and trusting in the pace of processing the experience, could all be beneficial in promoting a strong therapeutic alliance and inducing an optimal state of engagement for effectively processing traumatic memories. Healthy volunteers also report that MDMA can change the significance or meaning of perceptions. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is meant to maintain the optional "window of tolerance". An enhanced therapeutic alliance combined with reduced anxiety or discomfort around difficult memories, increased self-compassion, and openness to expanding meaning of thoughts, feelings or experiences may all contribute toward therapeutic effects. Similar therapeutic procedures that include attention to setting, a pair of therapists offering nondirective, supportive care and substances that alter consciousness, are also used in psilocybin and ayahuasca research in people with depression.

Other proposed models include an explicit role for experiential "regression" and re-examination of past experiences, and non-ordinary or transpersonal experiences in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

MDMA-stimulated decrease in amygdala and insular cortex activity may allow for emotional engagement without overwhelming anxiety during processing of painful traumatic memories. In healthy humans, MDMA acutely modulates brain circuitry important for memory and affective processing, and implicated in the pathophysiology of PTSD, including increased resting state functional connectivity between the hippocampus and amygdala and decreased coupling of the medial prefrontal cortex with the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex. Given that MDMA modulates emotional memory, neural pathways, fear extinction and memory reconsolidation might play a role in the underlying mechanisms for the positive treatment response.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults — study inclusion/exclusion decisions varied by the particular systematic review/meta-analysis based on the PICOTS, and although two reviews included a few nonrandomized trials, overall the reviews only included randomized controlled trial (RCTs) studies as those met quality criteria for questions regarding efficacy. The Panel observed that a prior review did not include complex PTSD or trauma and excluded "complementary and alternative medicine approaches" and "psychological or pharmacological interventions not listed as included", and there was significant clinical interest in complementary and integrative health interventions, psychedelic interventions (e.g., ketamine, MDMA), and augmentation approaches. Given the date of the AHRQ review and being inclusive of other interventions, the Panel agreed to include 15 systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

### Potential causal association between gut microbiome and posttraumatic stress disorder [^113DD9Dk]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Current first-line treatments for PTSD, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and α1-adrenoreceptor antagonists, have shown limited effectiveness in managing symptoms. There is a pressing need for alternative approaches and innovative therapies to address the complex nature of PTSD and provide better outcomes for individuals affected by this condition. Unfortunately, these results are unable to be replicated. 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), as the designation of Breakthrough Therapy for promising treatment granted by the FDA in 2017, has shown to be effective and well tolerated in several clinical trials. In a rat model of PTSD, researchers led by Emily A Ridge found that MDMA directly impacts the components of the gut microbiome. Moreover, treatment with MDMA was shown to rapidly restore the composition of the gut microbiome. Clinical interventions targeting gut microbiome, which has been revealed in depression and anxiety, may benefit the improvement of symptoms in patients with PTSD. A clinical trial conducted in the United States (Identifier: NCT04150380) used Lactobacillus rhamnosus, as a gram-positive immunoregulatory species with anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties, to treat PTSD. The study emphasized the need to investigate inflammatory, metabolic, and mitochondrial dysfunctional pathways as part of PTSD therapeutics, as these areas have received limited attention the microbiome. This highlights a promising direction for future research to develop innovative treatments targeting these pathways in PTSD. Overall, the findings suggest that restoring the gut microbiome could be a beneficial approach for treating PTSD.

### Potential psychiatric uses for MDMA [^113PpP61]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

SET AND SETTING

An array of chronic psychiatric disorders share a common core of intractable symptoms that respond favorably to MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy, which has been studied in clinical trials treating PTSD, anxiety associated with life‐threatening illness, and social anxiety in autistic adults. 2 These studies demonstrate the success of careful approaches to therapeutic set and setting designed to minimize adverse events and maximize benefits with minimal targeted exposure to drug. All recent MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy registration studies are RCTs, meeting rigorous standards for drug development regulated by the FDA and overseen by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). Furthermore, due to the Schedule 1 status of MDMA, compliance with DEA and state‐level controlled substance review committees is required, placing these studies in the most regulated area of drug development, and introducing a disincentive to potential researchers. Researchers who are willing to take on the challenge of managing compliance with this complex oversight often only do so because of the potential to relieve suffering that has not responded to existing established treatments, and the hope of providing the field of psychiatry with methods of effectively combining psychopharmacology with psychotherapy in a patient‐centered approach that respects and fosters the innate healing capacity of the individual.

12-Month follow-up

Twelve months after the last active dose of MDMA (Table 5), PTSD symptom severity was evaluated again. CAPS-IV total scores for the ITT set at baseline and 12-month follow-up mean (SD) were 92.0 (18.0) and 31.0 (24.2), respectively. PTSD severity was significantly lower compared to baseline (t₂₄ = 11.30, p < 0.0001). CAPS-IV total scores declined on average −9.6 (19.5) from treatment exit to the 12-month assessment. The majority (76%) did not meet PTSD diagnostic criteria, demonstrating enduring positive effects of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Analysis of secondary outcomes also found significant improvement at the 12-month follow-up compared to baseline for depression (BDI-II: t₂₃ = 8.15, p < 0.0001), sleep quality (PSQI: t₂₂ = 6.46, p < 0.0001), and dissociation (DES-II: t₂₂ = 5.7, p < 0.0001), indicating sustained gains well after the active treatment period ended.

### Potential psychiatric uses for MDMA [^114EcesA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND

MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy employs single doses, administered under continuous medical supervision on two to three occasions a month apart. Drug administration is preceded by preparatory sessions and followed by psychotherapy sessions supporting integration of therapeutic changes into daily life (Figure 1). MDMA was placed in Schedule 1 by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in 1985 on the basis of widespread nonmedical use and concerns of abuse potential, despite a Schedule 3 recommendation by an administrative law judge. The results indicate promising therapeutic applications, but MDMA remains in Schedule 1, defined as having no accepted medical use, high abuse potential, and lack of accepted safety. Data from phase II randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exploring MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy were submitted to the FDA as initial indications of safety and efficacy. These studies build on published case reports on clinical use of MDMA prior to DEA scheduling. 1 Completion of successful phase III trials is the remaining requirement for FDA approval of MDMA as a therapeutic agent.
