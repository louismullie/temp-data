## Question

According to espen guidelines what is the amino acid requirement and precotion in preterm neonate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ESPEN-aligned amino acid requirements and precautions for parenteral nutrition in preterm neonates, including timing, dosing, safety, and monitoring, with explicit acknowledgment of conflicting guidance and the strength of evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which ESPEN-endorsed sources directly inform preterm PN amino acid dosing. Then, I should verify the recommended starting dose, escalation targets, and maximum dose. Next, I will review timing of initiation and the rationale for early provision. After that, I need to examine safety signals and precautions, including sepsis, azotemia, and neurodevelopmental concerns. Finally, I will reconcile differences with other societies and outline practical monitoring and implementation considerations, making sure I double-check where the evidence is weak and where consensus is strong.

> Let me first confirm the most authoritative ESPEN-aligned source in the provided materials. The 2025 Pediatric Research review explicitly integrates ESPGHAN/ESPEN/ESPR/CSPEN guidance and is the clearest ESPEN-linked statement on preterm PN amino acids, so I will anchor to that while cross-checking with ESPNIC critical care recommendations and contemporary ASPEN guidance for context and safety signals.

> Now, I should verify the starting dose and escalation. The ESPGHAN/ESPEN/ESPR/CSPEN-aligned recommendation is to start parenteral amino acids on day 1 at 1.5–2 g/kg/day and quickly advance to 2.5–3.5 g/kg/day, with the upper bound of 3.5 g/kg/day as the practical maximum for routine care, which aligns with the cautionary stance seen in ASPEN 2023 and with respiratory RDS consensus guidance that uses a similar early escalation framework [^11658sjq] [^111v9KSp] [^112FvwFE].

> Wait, let me verify the maximum dose and the rationale for not exceeding it. The ESPEN-linked review advises that parenteral amino acid intake above 3.5 g/kg/day should be reserved for clinical trials, reflecting concerns about metabolic intolerance and potential harm without proven added benefit; ASPEN 2023 similarly recommends a minimum of 3 g/kg/day and not exceeding 3.5 g/kg/day, citing increased sepsis risk with higher initiation doses and lack of consistent neurodevelopmental benefit beyond 3.5 g/kg/day, so I should be explicit that routine dosing should cap at 3.5 g/kg/day [^111UXbVh] [^111v9KSp] [^1132pkF1].

> I need to check the timing of initiation. Early initiation within the first 24 hours is supported to rapidly achieve positive nitrogen balance and mitigate catabolism, with Cochrane and European consensus statements supporting early AA within 24 hours, while acknowledging that some critical illness contexts may warrant individualized decisions; nonetheless, the ESPEN-aligned position favors day 1 initiation with prompt advancement when clinically feasible [^113nyoP7] [^112FvwFE] [^11658sjq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about benefits beyond growth. I should confirm what outcomes are actually improved. Higher parenteral amino acid intake reduces postnatal growth failure and shortens time to regain birthweight, and may modestly improve head growth, but high-quality evidence for neurodevelopmental benefit is limited and inconsistent; pooled analyses show no clear advantage on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, so claims should be cautious and centered on growth and nitrogen balance rather than cognition [^1151SpwF] [^1163vVHK] [^11658sjq].

> Next, I should review safety signals and precautions. Higher AA dosing is associated with increased BUN and azotemia, indicating reduced tolerance in some infants, and at least one trial linked an initial dose of 3.5 g/kg/day with higher sepsis risk; additionally, early high-dose AA can precipitate metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, and electrolyte shifts, particularly if non-protein energy is insufficient, so I need to ensure adequate non-protein calories accompany protein to avoid catabolism and solute load toxicity [^1151SpwF] [^111ubT6Z] [^116veXTj].

> Let me consider the energy–nitrogen interplay, because I should confirm that protein is matched with non-protein energy. A practical minimum of about 65–90 non-protein kcal/kg/day supports protein accretion; insufficient energy with high AA can drive urea generation without growth, while excessive glucose can cause hyperglycemia that itself impairs protein utilization, so individualized titration of dextrose and lipids alongside AA is essential, especially in ELBW infants with limited insulin reserve [^11658sjq] [^111VR5Z6] [^114QzhJ2].

> I should double-check conflicting guidance so I don't overstate uniformity. Australasian consensus allows advancement up to 4 g/kg/day by days 3–5, whereas ESPEN-linked and ASPEN guidance converge on 3–3.5 g/kg/day as the routine ceiling; given the sepsis signal and lack of consistent neurodevelopmental gains beyond 3.5 g/kg/day, I will prioritize the more conservative, safety-conscious ESPEN/ASPEN range for routine practice and reserve higher doses for trials or exceptional circumstances with close monitoring [^114AaoQ2] [^11658sjq] [^111v9KSp].

> Next, I should review monitoring and implementation. Daily assessment of tolerance should include BUN and ammonia, acid–base status, electrolytes including phosphate and calcium, and glucose, with vigilance for refeeding-like phenomena when aggressive early AA is paired with delayed electrolyte provision; implementation is aided by starter PN to ensure day 1 availability, but routine use of fixed standardized solutions thereafter is discouraged in favor of individualized prescriptions, and protocolized advancement has been associated with improved early nutrition delivery and reduced sepsis in some cohorts [^116veXTj] [^111EpUrF] [^114Nwr9k] [^113PsopE].

> But wait, what if the infant is extremely preterm or critically ill with sepsis or NEC — should I pause or reduce AA? The evidence is limited and heterogeneous; ESPNIC notes insufficient evidence to support very high AA intakes during acute critical illness and highlights the potential for metabolic stress, so in unstable phases I should individualize, consider moderating AA toward the lower end of the range, and prioritize hemodynamic stability and electrolyte balance while maintaining adequate non-protein energy to prevent catabolism [^112ZMJVf] [^116VRckD].

> In summary, I should confirm the practical ESPEN-aligned regimen as follows: start parenteral amino acids at 1.5–2 g/kg/day on day 1, advance promptly to 2.5–3.5 g/kg/day, do not exceed 3.5 g/kg/day in routine care, pair with sufficient non-protein energy, and monitor closely for azotemia, acid–base disturbances, electrolyte shifts, and sepsis; this balances growth benefits with safety signals and aligns with contemporary ESPEN-linked and ASPEN guidance while acknowledging legitimate variability across societies and the need for ongoing research [^11658sjq] [^111v9KSp] [^112FvwFE].

---

Per ESPEN guidance, preterm neonates should receive **parenteral amino acids at 1.5–2 g/kg/day from day 1**, rapidly advancing to **2.5–3.5 g/kg/day** to achieve positive nitrogen balance and support growth [^11658sjq] [^112FvwFE]. Intakes above 3.5 g/kg/day are not recommended outside trials due to potential metabolic harm [^11658sjq] [^111v9KSp]. Monitor for hyperammonemia, azotemia, and electrolyte disturbances, and adjust dosing for renal or hepatic impairment [^1172RF5X] [^1151SpwF].

## Recommended amino acid intake for preterm neonates

ESPGHAN/ESPEN/ESPR/CSPEN recommend the following parenteral amino acid intakes:

| **Phase** | **Recommended intake** |
|-|-|
| Initial phase (day 1) | 1.5–2 g/kg/day [^111UXbVh] |
| Advancement phase (day 2–3) | Rapidly increase to 2.5–3.5 g/kg/day [^11658sjq] [^111UXbVh] |
| Maximum intake | 3.5 g/kg/day (not to exceed outside trials) [^11658sjq] [^111UXbVh] |

---

These intakes aim to achieve **positive nitrogen balance**, support growth, and prevent postnatal growth restriction [^1151SpwF].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommendations

Evidence supports **early, moderate amino acid provision** to improve nitrogen balance and growth without increasing adverse events [^1151SpwF] [^113nyoP7]. Higher intakes (> 3.5 g/kg/day) have not shown additional benefit and may increase metabolic risk [^11658sjq] [^111v9KSp].

---

## Potential risks and precautions

### Metabolic risks

- **Hyperammonemia**: Elevated ammonia can occur with excessive intake or impaired clearance; monitor ammonia levels, especially with renal or hepatic impairment [^1172RF5X].
- **Azotemia**: Higher amino acid loads can raise BUN; monitor renal function and adjust dosing as needed [^1151SpwF].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Monitor and correct calcium, phosphate, and other electrolytes to prevent metabolic complications [^116veXTj].

---

### Clinical precautions

- **Renal impairment**: Reduce dose and monitor closely.
- **Hepatic impairment**: Adjust dosing and monitor ammonia and liver function.
- **Individualized dosing**: Tailor intake to gestational age, weight, and clinical status [^114QzhJ2].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment strategies

Regular monitoring and **individualized adjustments** are essential:

- **Growth monitoring**: Track weight, length, and head circumference to guide intake [^11341eTY].
- **Biochemical monitoring**: Check BUN, ammonia, and electrolytes regularly [^1172RF5X].
- **Clinical assessment**: Adjust dosing based on tolerance, renal/hepatic function, and clinical course [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial intake**: 1.5–2 g/kg/day from day 1 [^112FvwFE].
- **Advancement**: Rapidly increase to 2.5–3.5 g/kg/day [^11658sjq] [^112FvwFE].
- **Maximum intake**: 3.5 g/kg/day (not to exceed outside trials) [^11658sjq] [^111v9KSp].
- **Monitoring**: Regular growth and biochemical monitoring; adjust for renal/hepatic impairment [^116veXTj] [^1172RF5X].

---

ESPGHAN/ESPEN/ESPR/CSPEN recommend **1.5–2 g/kg/day from day 1**, advancing to **2.5–3.5 g/kg/day**, with a maximum of 3.5 g/kg/day to balance growth benefits with metabolic safety [^11658sjq] [^112FvwFE].

Discussion

This position statement with clinical recommendations provides new guidance based on new evidence, as well as reinforcing most of the existing 2017 ASPEN Guidelines. These ASPEN PICU nutrition guidelines published in 2017 were based on a literature search from January 1995 to March 2016 and consisted of 17 recommendations. These ESPNIC clinical recommendations are based on an updated literature search until November 2018. Both the American (ASPEN) and our European guidelines provide expert opinion which is essential in this setting where limited data are available. Our recommendations are predominantly consistent with the ASPEN guideline recommendations (Table 2) which helps assist in the uptake and implementation of guidelines into practice. Implementation of evidence into clinical practice remains problematic, in 2017 a European survey of 59 PICUs found that 69% of PICUs still had no local feeding guidelines. Additionally, this position statement generated new clinical guidance as half of our clinical questions differed from the ASPEN guidelines. These included guidance on feeding neonates with arterial umbilical arterial catheters; the type of enteral formula to be used; the amount or type of each macronutrient to provide; the value of gastric residual volume to assess feeding tolerance; the use of prokinetics to enhance feeding tolerance and the use of feeding protocols to improve outcomes. Furthermore, these new ESPNIC recommendations covered in more detail the indications for enteral nutrition in various subgroups of patients in clinicians are in general uncertain on how to progress feeding (i.e. term neonates and children on haemodynamic support and after cardiac surgery). In addition, our position statement provides a different stand on two recommendations as compared with the ASPEN guidelines, based on new available research. In contrast with the ASPEN guidelines we recommend to consider withholding parenteral nutrition during the first week in neonates and children, independent of their nutritional state. Furthermore, there was also strong consensus in our working group that there is insufficient evidence to recommend a protein/amino acid intake of 1.5 g/kg/day or higher during the acute phase of disease to benefit clinical outcomes. The intake of 1.5 g/kg/day or higher has shown to prevent cumulative negative protein balance. However, future research should consider that the exact threshold is unknown and might overestimate protein/amino acid requirements during acute critical illness; thus further work should, therefore, also investigate low protein/amino acid intakes during that phase.

Amino acid (AA) dosing in parenteral nutrition — preterm infants: We recommend against an initial dose of > 3 g/kg/day, and we recommend providing parenteral AA at a minimum of 3 g/kg/day and not exceeding 3.5 g/kg/day. Quality of evidence: Low. Strength of recommendation: Strong. Initial doses investigated were as low as 0.5–1 g/kg/day, the maximum doses in lower-AA groups ranged from 2.5 to 3.5 g/kg/day, and maximum doses in higher-AA groups ranged from 3 to 4.5 g/kg/day; current evidence remains limited in distinguishing any benefit, namely improved growth, comparing a maximum AA dose of 3.5 vs 4 g/kg/day.

### Early versus late parenteral nutrition in term and late preterm infants: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^115Rr2ww]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A recent retrospective cohort study found that preterm infants (born between 30 + 0 and 32 + 6 weeks' gestation) who were commenced PN within the first 7 days of life had a higher rate of survival but higher rates of necrotising enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, late-onset sepsis and the need for surgical procedures.

The recommendations from the recently published ESPGHAN/ESPEN/ESPR/CPEN and NICE guidelines are substantially different in this area. The NICE guidelines recommend the commencement of PN within 72 h after birth if no progress is made with EN in term and late preterm infants. On the other hand, the ESPGHAN/ESPEN/ESPR/CPEN guidelines recommend clinicians to consider withholding parenteral amino acids for 1 week in critically ill term infants; they do not make a recommendation on the timing of parenteral lipids. The surveys have reported variations in clinical practice, demonstrating the uncertainties in this area.

Parenteral amino acids in preterm infants — We recommend prompt initiation of PN (parenteral nutrition) after birth as soon as appropriate vascular access is obtained. We recommend against an initial dose of > 3 g/kg/day given that a single trial found an increased rate of sepsis in infants who were prescribed an initiating AA dose of 3.5 g/kg/day. In considering the maximal target dose, we recommend providing parenteral AA at a minimum of 3 g/kg/day and not exceeding 3.5 g/kg/day; current evidence remains limited in distinguishing any benefit — namely, improved growth — comparing a maximum AA dose of 3.5 vs 4 g/kg/day. For neurodevelopmental outcomes, we recommend providing parenteral AA doses at a minimum of 3 g/kg/day without increasing beyond 3.5 g/kg/day, and there is the suggestion that exceeding 3.5 g/kg/day may not be without harm. Quality of evidence: Very low for prompt initiation and Low for AA dose questions; Strength of recommendation: Strong across these recommendations.

### Protein intakes for preterm infants, and the need for a multi-nutrient holistic approach [^11658sjq]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In this edition of Pediatric Research, Das et al. present the results of a systematic review of high versus low dietary protein intake in neonates born preterm. The review assessed the potential benefits or risks of higher protein intakes during the first month of life reported in 44 studies and concluded that whilst growth prior to discharge was often greater, there were no longer term growth benefits and higher intakes may represent a risk for neonatal metabolism and later neuro-disability. However, the level of certainty for most findings was low, or non-significant, and the number of participants in most studies was small. Nevertheless, many have previously expressed concerns that currently recommended protein intakes may be too high. Most neonatal randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of nutritional interventions have been powered on short-term outcomes such as anthropometry and there are few RCTs powered to detect a meaningful difference in functional outcomes such as infant neurodevelopment.

The PEPaNIC study was a ground-breaking RCT conducted in infants and children and demonstrated the risks of inappropriately high nutrient intakes to acutely critically ill patients. Whilst the study did not recruit preterm infants, the study highlights that nutrient intake in excess of dietary requirement and/or metabolic capacity can be harmful, especially for amino acid intakes. This is critically important for preterm infants where short-term biochemical derangement such as hyper- and hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia and hypophosphatemia are common, and where predicted protein requirements are, in part, based on factorial methods. A 2018 multi-society guideline on parenteral nutrition (PN) recommended to start parenteral amino acids immediately after birth in preterm neonates and to increase the next day to 2.5–3.5 g/kg/day accompanied by sufficient non-protein energy (> 65 kcal/kg/day) and micronutrients. The recent ESPGHAN position paper on enteral nutritionstrongly recommends a total protein intake of 3.5–4.0 g/kg/day, which may be increased to 4.5 g/kg/day where growth is slower than anticipated and where other correctable causes of growth faltering such as suboptimal energy intakes or electrolyte abnormalities have been addressed, but note that the maximum parenteral amino acid intakes are still limited at 3.5 g/kg/day.

Amino acids

There is no definitive evidence about what dose of parenteral amino acid is appropriate and when to initiate parenteral AA supplementation in neonates. Delay in administering amino acids could result in a protein catabolic state and could impact on growth and development in preterm neonates. However, potential benefits of improved nitrogen balance, growth and infant health may be outweighed by the infant's ability to utilise high intakes of parenteral amino acid, especially in the days after birth, resulting in high concentrations of amino acids, ammonia and urea, and an exacerbation of metabolic acidosis. The 2017 consensus agreement incorporates the findings of three new systematic reviews that evaluated the efficacy and safety of parenteral AA in preterm neonates.

The Consensus Group recommendations remained unchanged: (1) commence parenteral AA within the first 24 h of birth (LOE I, GOR C); (2) commence parenteral AA at 2 g/kg/day (LOE I, GOR C) and; (3) incrementally increase amino acid infusions to a maximum 4 g/kg/day by day 3–5 of life in preterm neonates (LOE I, GOR C). The Consensus Group considered the safety of (1) commencement parenteral AA in excess of 3 to 3.5 g/kg/day and (2) maintenance AA intake in excess of 4.5 g/kg/day has not been proven in clinical trials.

Carbohydrates

Consensus recommendations regarding carbohydrates remain unchanged. Proposed standard preterm and term PN formulations contain 10 and 12% dextrose respectively, providing 13.5 g/kg/day (9.4 mg/kg/min) and 17 g/kg/day (11.8 mg/kg/min) at 135 ml/kg/day respectively (LOE I, GOR C).

Parenteral amino acid dosing and neurodevelopment in preterm infants — recommendation — states: we recommend providing parenteral AA doses at a maximum of 3 g/ kg/day without increasing beyond 3.5 g/kg/day. The current evidence remains limited in distinguishing any benefit — namely, improved neurodevelopment — comparing a maximum AA dose of 3.5 vs 4 g/ kg/day, and there is the suggestion that exceeding 3.5 g/kg/day may not be without harm. Strength of recommendation: Strong. Quality of evidence: Low. Rationale notes that initial doses were as low as 0.5–1 g/kg/day and the maximum target dose range studied was 3–4 g/kg/day; the single trial targeting up to 4.5 g/ kg/day did not evaluate neurodevelopment; and one trial showed that higher AA doses were associated with lower scores at one measurement time, 18 months' corrected age, in a relatively small group of infants.

### Early versus late parenteral nutrition in term and late preterm infants: a randomised controlled trial [^116qDd2N]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Background

Term and late preterm infants (≥ 34 weeks of gestation) with critical illness may not tolerate enteral nutrition (EN), which necessitates the use of parenteral nutrition (PN). However, currently, there is limited evidence regarding the optimal time to commence PN in term and late preterm infants. A subgroup analysis of a paediatric multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) concluded that early commencement of PN was associated with longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay but lower risk of hypoglycaemia compared with late PN in term neonates. Given the limited evidence in this area, guidelines from professional bodies have varied. The NICE guidelines recommend commencing PN within 72 hours after birth if no progress is made with EN in term and late preterm infants. In contrast, the ESPGHAN/ESPEN/ESPR/CPEN guidelines recommend withholding parenteral amino acids for 1 week in critically ill term infants; they do not make a recommendation on the timing of parenteral lipids. Recent surveys have also reported variations in practice among clinicians.

Early commencement of PN has the potential to minimise catabolism, prevent essential fatty acid and amino acid deficiency, improve weight gain and clinical outcomes. However, there are concerns about the harmful effects of PN. Parenteral amino acids may lead to hyperammonaemia, azotaemia, metabolic acidosis, free radical injury and slower growth of head circumference and metabolic syndromes later in life. Parenteral lipids may exacerbating free radical activity, increasing the risk of sepsis, worsening respiratory function by decreasing arterial oxygenation, increasing the risk of kernicterus in infants with hyperbilirubinaemia due to free fatty acids displacing bilirubin from albumin binding sitesand may worsen pulmonary hypertension.

Many reports have described abnormal blood amino acid profiles, especially phenylalanine, in critically ill neonates, suggesting metabolic derangements of certain amino acids during critical illness. If such infants are administered parenteral amino acids early during their critical illness, plasma levels may reach very high levels, leading to potential harm. Observational studies have demonstrated that high plasma amino acid concentrations are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Experimental studies have shown that hyperphenylalaninaemia can induce oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. Hence, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits of commencing PN very early in the neonatal period.

### Optimizing parenteral nutrition to achieve an adequate weight gain according to the current guidelines in preterm infants with birth weight less than 1500 g: a prospective observational study [^115bb1F3]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Parenteral nutrition (PN) is critical for the care of preterm infants and provides relatively safe means of meeting nutrient intakes, as their immature gastrointestinal (GI) tract cannot tolerate sufficient energy and nutrients enterally to meet nutrient requirements. PN for preterm infants is a highly complex combination of amino acids, lipid emulsions, carbohydrates, electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals that differs significantly from the adult PN. What is optimal PN for very preterm infants remains unanswered. Several guidelines have been established to help improve the management of nutritional needs in preterm infants. Chinese Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (CSPEN) guidelines for nutrition support in neonates have been used in our center since 2013. In 2018, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) released the guidelines on pediatric PN. Subtle differences exist between the guidelines in terms of amino acids, lipid emulsions, glucose and energy intakes, and timings. Currently, the fact that nutrition practice differs from the recommendations established in the guidelines and the recommended intake is not administered in most cases is widespread.

As clinical neonatologists have increasingly recognized that it may be inappropriate to compare preterm infant growth with the growth of their in utero counterparts, some new insights in preterm nutrition have been proposed. A recent study found that improved nutritional supply and growth during early life have been related to the better long-term growth of brain structures and a more favorable neurodevelopmental outcome. Another research revealed that very rapid catch-up growth after a period of growth faltering has been linked to adverse metabolic consequences. So, "adequate" instead of "aggressive" nutrient supply should be provided to reach a positive weight gain and prevent postnatal growth faltering. To date, there is no international consensus regarding what constitutes the ideal pattern of growth of preterm infants. Some authors suggested that the growth assessments should be comprehensive, including weight, length, and head circumference measures, and if possible, fat and fat-free mass. Weight gain is typically measured rather than overall growth anthropometric measures in current clinical practice.

We aimed to analyze the PN regimen, compare it with ESPEN guidelines on pediatric parenteral nutrition in 2018, evaluate weight gain during PN, and explore the correlation of macronutrients and energy of PN with weight gain outcome after PN in VLBW and ELBW infants.

Preterm parenteral nutrition — amino acid (AA) dosing — combined analysis for cerebral palsy did not meet statistical significance and showed directional consistency favoring lower AA, and the document notes that in trials included in combined analysis, higher target doses were 3.6 g/kg/day, 4 g/kg/day, and an additional 1 g/day above routine AA dose; the strong recommendation for parenteral AA dosing between 3 and 3.5 g/kg/day is within the range tested and reflects caution until future studies using higher AA clarify the issue.

### Early versus late parenteral nutrition in term and late preterm infants: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^113V93eH]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the wide use of parenteral nutrition (PN) in neonatal intensive care units (NICU), there is limited evidence regarding the optimal time to commence PN in term and late preterm infants. The recommendations from the recently published ESPGHAN/ESPEN/ESPR/CPEN and NICE guidelines are substantially different in this area, and surveys have reported variations in clinical practice. The aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the benefits and risks of early versus late PN in term and late preterm infants.

Methods/design

This study is a single-centre, non-blinded RCT in the NICU of Perth Children's Hospital, Western Australia. A total of 60 infants born ≥ 34 weeks of gestation who have a high likelihood of intolerance to enteral nutrition (EN) for at least 3–5 days will be randomised to early (day 1 or day 2 of admission) or late commencement (day 6 of admission) of PN after informed parental consent. In both groups, EN will be commenced as early as clinically feasible. Primary outcomes are plasma phenylalanine and plasma F 2 -isoprostane levels on Day 4 and Day 8 of admission. Secondary outcomes are total and individual plasma amino acid profiles, plasma and red blood cell fatty acid profiles, in-hospital all-cause mortality, hospital-acquired infections, length of hospital/NICU stay, z scores and changes in z scores at discharge for weight, height and head circumference, time to full EN, duration of respiratory (mechanical, non-invasive) support, duration of inotropic support, the incidence of hyper and hypoglycaemia, incidence of metabolic acidosis, liver function, blood urea nitrogen, and C-reactive protein (CRP).

Discussion

This RCT will examine the effects of early versus late PN in term and late preterm infants by comparing key biochemical and clinical outcomes and has the potential to identify underlying pathways for beneficial or harmful effects related to the timing of commencement of PN in such infants.

### Biological impact of recent guidelines on parenteral nutrition in preterm infants [^116veXTj]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Recent guidelines for preterm neonates recommend early initiation of parenteral nutrition (PN) with high protein and relatively high caloric intake. This review considers whether these changes could influence homeostasis in very preterm infants during the first few postnatal weeks.

Methods

This systematic review of relevant literature from searches of PubMed and recent guidelines was reviewed by investigators from several perinatal centers in France.

Results

New recommendations for PN could be associated with metabolic acidosis via the increase in the amino acid ion gap, hyperchloremic acidosis, and ammonia acidosis. The introduction of high-intake amino acids soon after birth could induce hypophosphatemia and hypercalcemia, simulating a "repeat feeding-like syndrome" and could be prevented by the early intake of phosphorus, especially in preterm infants born after fetal growth restriction. Early high-dose amino acid infusions are relatively well tolerated in the preterm infant with regard to renal function. Additional studies, however, are warranted to determine markers of protein intolerance and to specify the optimal composition and amount of amino acid solutions.

Conclusions

Optimal PN following new guidelines in very preterm infants, despite their demonstrated benefits on growth, may induce adverse effects on ionic homeostasis. Clinicians should implement appropriate monitoring to prevent and/or correct them.

Parenteral amino acid dosing in preterm infants — secondary outcomes — shows that in combined analysis blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was not significantly different between groups (MD = 1.23 mg/dl; 95% CI, −2.34 to 4.80; P = 0.5). Two individual trials showed a significantly higher risk of sepsis with a higher dose of amino acids, including one with an initiation dose of 3.5 g/kg/day and another comparing 3.5 g/kg/day as compared with 2 g/kg/day. In addition, one trial comparing a maximum dose of 4 vs 2.5 g/kg/day showed a lower incidence of hyperglycemia with a higher amino acid dose, but we do not advise a higher dose of AA for the purpose of lowering blood glucose levels.

### Protein intakes to optimize outcomes for preterm infants [^117DkfBr]. Seminars in Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Proteins are key structural components of all human cells and are also involved in key physiologic processes through their roles as enzymes, hormones and transport proteins. Protein requirements are substantially higher in preterm infants than those born at term, yet inadequate protein intakes are a common problem on many neonatal units. Very preterm infants (VPT, < 32 weeks) commonly receive parenteral amino acid solutions which are typically commenced on admission, and increased over the next few days. Several recent studies have explored differing parenteral amino acid intakes in the first few days, and recommendations have recently been updated. Parenteral nutrition intakes are decreased as enteral feeds are tolerated, but human milk alone will not meet protein needs in most VPT and supplementation or fortification will be required. This review paper considers basic protein and amino acid physiology in the newborn period, and the evidence base for current recommendations.

### Nutritional management of the critically ill neonate: a position paper of the ESPGHAN committee on nutrition [^114Eow3w]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The nutritional management of critically ill term neonates and preterm infants varies widely, and controversies exist in regard to when to initiate nutrition, mode of feeding, energy requirements, and composition of enteral and parenteral feeds. Recommendations for nutritional support in critical illness are needed.

Methods

The ESPGHAN Committee on Nutrition (ESPGHAN-CoN) conducted a systematic literature search on nutritional support in critically ill neonates, including studies on basic metabolism. The Medline database and the Cochrane Library were used in the search for relevant publications. The quality of evidence was reviewed and discussed before voting on recommendations, and a consensus of 90% or more was required for the final approval. Important research gaps were also identified.

Results

This position paper provides clinical recommendations on nutritional support during different phases of critical illness in preterm and term neonates based on available literature and expert opinion.

Conclusion

Basic research along with adequately powered trials are urgently needed to resolve key uncertainties on metabolism and nutrient requirements in this heterogeneous patient population.

Preterm infant PN terminology and component definitions: For this guideline, PN includes intravenous amino acids (AAs), dextrose, and lipid injectable emulsion (ILE), and when AA appears it refers to an age-appropriate, neonatal crystalline AA solution. For ILE, ASPEN designations are used, such that an ILE composed of 100% SO is referred to as SO-ILE; because the guideline does not address preterm infants with PNALD, it does not include studies of an ILE composed of 100% FO. Micronutrients are defined as individual nutrients required in relatively small amounts, and single nutrients prescribed individually (for example, glutamine or carnitine) in clinical trials were also classified as micronutrients. Studies do not always specify use of immediately available "starter" or "stock" PN, though such solutions may have been used to provide PN within hours of birth.

### Guidelines for parenteral nutrition in preterm infants: the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition [^117PZahQ]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Parenteral nutrition (PN) is prescribed for preterm infants until nutrition needs are met via the enteral route, but unanswered questions remain regarding PN best practices in this population.

Methods

An interdisciplinary committee was assembled to answer 12 questions concerning the provision of PN to preterm infants. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used. Questions addressed parenteral macronutrient doses, lipid injectable emulsion (ILE) composition, and clinically relevant outcomes, including PNALD, early childhood growth, and neurodevelopment. Preterm infants with congenital gastrointestinal disorders or infants already diagnosed with necrotizing enterocolitis or PN-associated liver disease (PNALD) at study entry were excluded.

Results

The committee reviewed 2460 citations published between 2001 and 2023 and evaluated 57 clinical trials. For most questions, quality of evidence was very low. Most analyses yielded no significant differences between comparison groups. A multicomponent oil ILE was associated with a reduction in stage 3 or higher retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) compared to an ILE containing 100% soybean oil. For all other questions, expert opinion was provided.

Conclusion

Most clinical outcomes were not significantly different between comparison groups when evaluating timing of PN initiation, amino acid dose, and ILE composition. Future clinical trials should standardize outcome definitions to permit statistical conflation of data, thereby permitting more evidence based recommendations in future guidelines. This guideline has been approved by the ASPEN 2022–2023 Board of Directors.

Question 10 — Parenteral micronutrients in preterm infants — Given the paucity of available data from clinical trials, we recommend that micronutrient provisions, including calcium and phosphate prescribing, be in accordance with doses advised in consensus guidelines such as those provided by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN), with quality of evidence very low and strength of recommendation strong. Interventional trials considered five parenteral nutrients — acetate, carnitine, glutamine, manganese, and iron (with or without erythropoietin) — and no studies evaluated osteopenia of prematurity as a specific outcome; providing carnitine was not associated with the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and the outcome of sepsis was evaluated in single trials of carnitine, glutamine, and manganese. Importantly, no harm was identified in these trials, the clinical trials did not ultimately provide sufficient information to suggest a specific dose for any of these nutrients by which outcomes assessed will be altered, and therefore, based on this very low quality of evidence, an appropriate approach is to utilize consensus recommendations such as those provided by ASPEN and ESPGHAN until such information is available through clinical trials.

### Optimizing parenteral nutrition to achieve an adequate weight gain according to the current guidelines in preterm infants with birth weight less than 1500 g: a prospective observational study [^117Eupir]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In recent years, much attention has been focused on enhancing the nutritional support of very low birth weight infants. Despite international guidance, PN strategy varies widely in clinical practice. In this study, the PN regimen used was not adequate according to the latest guideline on the whole.

Amino acid: in this study, many infants did not receive the starting dose of at least 1.5 g/kg/d on the first postnatal day. Days to reach maximum PN amino acid [9 (6, 13) days] were longer than the recommendation. And, the maximum amino acid intake was 3.5 (3.2, 3.8) g/kg/d. Clinicians were still not used to initiating PN amino acid at a higher level despite evidence from studies demonstrating the safety of providing higher levels of amino acids as early as the first day of postnatal life. A secondary analysis revealed that ELBW infants who received a minimum of 3 g/kg/d of parenteral amino acid in the first 5 days of life were found to have significantly better growth outcomes, suggesting that ELBW infants can tolerate the amino acid dose of 3–3.5 g/kg/d well within the first few days of life. A study evaluating metabolic responses to early high amino acid supplementation found serum blood urea nitrogen was higher when the infants were provided a higher dose of amino acid, which reflects a suboptimal balance of amino acids for unstable or "sick" preterm infants. Also, recent data does not suggest improvement in growth or neurodevelopmental outcomes with use of parenteral amino acid greater than 3.5 g/kg/day in premature infants. We should increase the starting dose of parenteral amino acid to 1.5 g/kg/d at least, decrease the maximum amino acid intake and shorten the days to reach maximum PN amino acid to improve the weight gain outcome of our infants. Further study should be implemented.

### Evidence and unknowns for the relevancy of applying current parenteral nutrition support recommendations among infants born less than 750 g or younger than 25 weeks' gestation: a narrative review [^114QzhJ2]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines provide varying recommendations for glucose administration in preterm infants. Koletzko et al.recommend glucose provision of 4–12 g/kg/day during the initial phase, increasing to 10–15 g/kg/day in the stable phase for infants between 500 and < 1000 g. The ESPGHAN Committee on Nutritiontakes a different approach, recommending glucose infusion rates (GIRs) of 3.5–5.5 mg/kg/min during the early acute phase, 5–7 mg/kg/min during the late acute phase, and 7.5–10 mg/kg/min during the recovery phase.

However, several critical knowledge gaps exist specifically for nanopreterm infants. There is limited evidence regarding optimal initial and advancement rates for glucose infusion, and the duration of different metabolic phases remains unclear. The impact of glucose management strategies on protein synthesis and utilizationand the long‐term effects of early glucose management on metabolic programming are not well understood. Additionally, optimal glucose targets considering their limited insulin production and glucose transporter expression require further investigation.

Current recommendations may require significant modification for nanopreterm infants because of their unique metabolic limitations. Their lower muscle and adipose tissue mass suggests potentially lower glucose requirements, whereas their immature insulin response affects glucose tolerance, thus creating a risk of perpetuating periods of hyperglycemia with inappropriate PN GIRs. Clinical management requires careful consideration of individual factors, as persistent hyperglycemia inhibits amino acid incorporationand maintaining euglycemia is crucial for optimal nutrient utilization.,

Based on these physiological differences, several modifications to current recommendations should be considered. Initial GIRs may need to be lower than those recommended for the general ELBW population, with more frequent monitoring of glucose response. GIR advancement rates should be individualized based on metabolic capacity, and glucose provision must be carefully balanced with protein administration to optimize utilization. This complex interplay between glucose metabolism and protein utilization underscores the need for nanopreterm‐specific guidelines that account for their unique physiological characteristics and metabolic capabilities, especially during early postnatal life.

### Balancing the risks and benefits of parenteral nutrition for preterm infants: can we define the optimal composition? [^114WcH7i]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Nutrient intakes in preterm infants are frequently inadequate and are associated with worse neuro-developmental outcome. Preterm infants take time to establish enteral intakes, and parenteral nutrition (PN) is now an integral component of care. Despite this, the evidence base for PN intakes is extremely limited. There remains uncertainty over safe initial and maximum amounts of macronutrients, and the optimal amino acid and lipid composition. Studies have tended to focus on short-term growth measures and there are few studies with long-term follow-up. There may be a tradeoff between improving cognitive outcomes while minimising metabolic harm that means determining the optimal regimen will require long-term follow-up. Given the importance of appropriate nutrition for long-term metabolic and cognitive health, and the associated healthcare costs, optimising the composition of PN deserves to be seen as a research priority in neonatal medicine.

### Low-versus high-dose and early versus late parenteral amino-acid administration in very-low-birth-weight infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115AVTVj]. Neonatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Providing parenteral amino acids to very-low-birth-weight infants during the first weeks of life is critical for adequate growth and neurodevelopment. However, there is no consensus about what dose is appropriate or when to initiate supplementation. As a result, daily practice varies among neonatal intensive care units. The objective of our study was to determine the effects of early parenteral amino-acid supplementation (within 24 h of birth) versus later initiation and high dose (> 3.0 g/kg/day) versus a lower dose on growth and morbidities.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of publications identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was conducted. Randomized controlled studies were eligible if information on growth was available.

Results

The search identified 14 studies. No differences were observed in growth or morbidity after early or high-dose amino-acid supplementation, but for several outcomes, meta-analysis was not possible due to study heterogeneity. Initiation of amino acids within the first 24 h of life appeared to be safe and well tolerated, and leads more rapidly to a positive nitrogen balance.

Conclusions

Administering a high dose (> 3.0 g/kg/day) or an early dose (≤ 24 h) of parenteral amino acids is safe and well tolerated but does not offer significant benefits on growth. Further large-scale randomized controlled trials in preterm infants are needed to study the effects of early and high-dose amino acids on growth and morbidity more consistently and extensively.

Background

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most devastating diseases in the neonatal population, with extremely low birth weight and extremely preterm infants at greatest risk.

Method

A systematic review of the best available evidence to answer a series of questions regarding nutrition support of neonates at risk of NEC was undertaken and evaluated using concepts adopted from the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group. A consensus process was used to develop the clinical guideline recommendations prior to external and internal review and approval by the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors. RESULTS/ CONCLUSIONS: (1) When and how should feeds be started in infants at high risk for NEC? We suggest that minimal enteral nutrition be initiated within the first 2 days of life and advanced by 30 mL/kg/d in infants ≥ 1, 000 g. (Weak) (2) Does the provision of mother's milk reduce the risk of developing NEC? We suggest the exclusive use of mother's milk rather than bovine-based products or formula in infants at risk for NEC. (Weak) (3) Do probiotics reduce the risk of developing NEC? There are insufficient data to recommend the use of probiotics in infants at risk for NEC. (Further research needed.) (4) Do nutrients either prevent or predispose to the development of NEC? We do not recommend glutamine supplementation for infants at risk for NEC (Strong). There is insufficient evidence to recommend arginine and/or long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for infants at risk for NEC. (Further research needed.) (5) When should feeds be reintroduced to infants with NEC? There are insufficient data to make a recommendation regarding time to reintroduce feedings to infants after NEC. (Further research needed.).

Sick newborn and preterm infants frequently are not able to be fed enterally, necessitating parenteral fluid and nutrition. Potential benefits of higher parenteral amino acid (AA) intake for improved nitrogen balance, growth, and infant health may be outweighed by the infant's ability to utilise high intake of parenteral AA, especially in the days after birth.

Objectives

The primary objective is to determine whether higher versus lower intake of parenteral AA is associated with improved growth and disability-free survival in newborn infants receiving parenteral nutrition. Secondary objectives include determining whether:• higher versus lower starting or initial intake of amino acids is associated with improved growth and disability-free survival without side effects;• higher versus lower intake of amino acids at maximal intake is associated with improved growth and disability-free survival without side effects; and• increased amino acid intake should replace non-protein energy intake (glucose and lipid), should be added to non-protein energy intake, or should be provided simultaneously with non-protein energy intake. We conducted subgroup analyses to look for any differences in the effects of higher versus lower intake of amino acids according to gestational age, birth weight, age at commencement, and condition of the infant, or concomitant increases in fluid intake.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2 June 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to 2 June 2017), Embase (1980 to 2 June 2017), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 2 June 2017). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and citations of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of higher versus lower intake of AAs as parenteral nutrition in newborn infants. Comparisons of higher intake at commencement, at maximal intake, and at both commencement and maximal intake were performed.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality, and extracted data from included studies. We performed fixed-effect analyses and expressed treatment effects as mean difference (MD), risk ratio (RR), and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Thirty-two studies were eligible for inclusion. Six were short-term biochemical tolerance studies, one was in infants at > 35 weeks' gestation, one in term surgical newborns, and three yielding no usable data. The 21 remaining studies reported clinical outcomes in very preterm or low birth weight infants for inclusion in meta-analysis for this review. Higher AA intake had no effect on mortality before hospital discharge (typical RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.17; participants = 1407; studies = 14; I² = 0%; quality of evidence: low). Evidence was insufficient to show an effect on neurodevelopment and suggest no reported benefit (quality of evidence: very low). Higher AA intake was associated with a reduction in postnatal growth failure (< 10th centile) at discharge (typical RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.97; participants = 203; studies = 3; I² = 22%; typical RD -0.15, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.02; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 7, 95% CI 4 to 50; quality of evidence: very low). Subgroup analyses found reduced postnatal growth failure in infants that commenced on high amino acid intake (> 2 to ≤ 3 g/kg/day); that occurred with increased amino acid and non-protein caloric intake; that commenced on intake at < 24 hours' age; and that occurred with early lipid infusion. Higher AA intake was associated with a reduction in days needed to regain birth weight (MD -1.14, 95% CI -1.73 to -0.56; participants = 950; studies = 13; I² = 77%). Data show varying effects on growth parameters and no consistent effects on anthropometric z-scores at any time point, as well as increased growth in head circumference at discharge (MD 0.09 cm/week, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.13; participants = 315; studies = 4; I² = 90%; quality of evidence: very low). Higher AA intake was not associated with effects on days to full enteral feeds, late-onset sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis, chronic lung disease, any or severe intraventricular haemorrhage, or periventricular leukomalacia. Data show a reduction in retinopathy of prematurity (typical RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.93; participants = 269; studies = 4; I² = 31%; quality of evidence: very low) but no difference in severe retinopathy of prematurity. Higher AA intake was associated with an increase in positive protein balance and nitrogen balance. Potential biochemical intolerances were reported, including risk of abnormal blood urea nitrogen (typical RR 2.77, 95% CI 2.13 to 3.61; participants = 688; studies = 7; I² = 6%; typical RD 0.26, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.32; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 4; 95% CI 3 to 5; quality of evidence: high). Higher amino acid intake in parenteral nutrition was associated with a reduction in hyperglycaemia (> 8.3 mmol/L) (typical RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.96; participants = 505; studies = 5; I² = 68%), although the incidence of hyperglycaemia treated with insulin was not different.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-quality evidence suggests that higher AA intake in parenteral nutrition does not affect mortality. Very low-quality evidence suggests that higher AA intake reduces the incidence of postnatal growth failure. Evidence was insufficient to show an effect on neurodevelopment. Very low-quality evidence suggests that higher AA intake reduces retinopathy of prematurity but not severe retinopathy of prematurity. Higher AA intake was associated with potentially adverse biochemical effects resulting from excess amino acid load, including azotaemia. Adequately powered trials in very preterm infants are required to determine the optimal intake of AA and effects of caloric balance in parenteral nutrition on the brain and on neurodevelopment.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

NOURESS for use as an additive to amino acid solutions to meet nutritional requirements is not indicated for use in adults. Appropriate administration of NOURESS is not expected to cause major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with cysteine hydrochloride.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

NOURESS is used as an additive to amino acid solutions to meet nutritional requirements of neonates requiring total parenteral nutrition and is not indicated for use in adults. There are no data on the presence of cysteine hydrochloride in human or animal milk or the effects on milk production. Data available on the effects of cysteine hydrochloride on infants, either directly or through breastmilk, do not suggest a significant risk of adverse reactions from exposure.

8.4 Pediatric Use

NOURESS is indicated for use as an additive to amino acid solutions to meet the nutritional requirements of neonates, including preterm infants, requiring total parenteral nutrition. The safety profile for NOURESS use in neonates includes risks of acid-base imbalance and hepatobiliary dysfunction.

Acid-base imbalance, including metabolic acidosis, and liver dysfunction may occur with NOURESS administration in preterm infants. Frequent clinical and laboratory assessments are necessary to monitor and manage fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, liver tests, and acid-base balance during parenteral nutrition therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Hyperammonemia is of special significance in neonates. This reaction appears to be related to a deficiency of the urea cycle amino acids of genetic or product origin. It is essential that blood ammonia be measured during treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Because of immature renal function, neonates including preterm infants, receiving prolonged parenteral nutrition with NOURESS may be at higher risk of aluminum toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Preterm parenteral nutrition — lipid injectable emulsion (ILE) dosing — states: To improve growth, we recommend daily advancement of ILE to a dose of 3 g/kg/day if using SO-ILE or multicomponent ILE, with quality of evidence very low and strength of recommendation strong; across studies, starting ILE doses ranged from 0.5 g/kg/day (with 2 g/kg/day commonly the higher starting dose) and the highest maximum dose was 3.8 g/kg/day, a higher starting dose was associated with a smaller postnatal weight loss, fewer infants with discharge weight in the < 10th percentile for age, and greater head size compared with lower dose; specific dose reductions of any ILE may lead to EFAD in preterm infants, and we recommend caution and close attention to ensure the provision of sufficient fatty acids to prevent an EFAD if ever considering an ILE dose reduction.

Regarding specific circumstances for parenteral nutrition, more specifically with respect to preterm infants, ASPEN 2023 guidelines recommend to increase daily lipid injectable emulsion to a dose of 3 g/kg/day to improve growth when using soybean oil-lipid injectable emulsion or multicomponent lipid injectable emulsion. Ensure lipid injectable emulsion provides sufficient fatty acids to avoid an essential fatty acid deficiency. Insufficient evidence to recommend any specific lipid injectable emulsion composition for enhanced growth.

### Protein intakes for preterm infants, and the need for a multi-nutrient holistic approach [^112WjLPV]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The amino acid composition of breastmilk uniquely meets the needs of healthy term infants; bovine protein contains a different balance of amino acids and needs to be provided in a higher dose to compensate for relative shortage of certain (conditionally) essential amino acid. The optimal composition of amino acids in PN has not been widely studied and it remains unclear what the reference ranges for plasma amino acids should be, particularly because fetal blood concentrations differ from healthy infants ex-utero. Several PN studies show a wide range of concentrations for both essential and non-essential amino acids, raising the possibility that certain amino acids may be provided in excess and could be neuro-toxic, or conversely that they may be rate limiting for lean mass accretion. Regardless of the optimal plasma amino acid profile, currently available PN solutions will not provide a 'protein quality' as high as human milk protein. In addition, most studies do not consider the hydration factor of amino acids in PN, thereby overestimating true protein intakes. Around 15% of the weight of an individual amino acid in PN is lost in the form of water once polymers are formed as protein. Therefore, a higher intake of amino acids (as nitrogen) in PN might be needed to match the quality and quantity of protein provided by human milk.

Whilst there are few large RCTs with long term cognitive outcome, there are data in preterm infants to show that neonatal macronutrient intakes are associated with outcomes in adolescents. Combined with observational follow-up studies, the idea was supported that higher intakes are beneficial, despite the largest study was conducted in infants born over 30 years ago. Furthermore, the higher protein intakes were typically ~3 g/kg/day rather than over 3.5–4.0 g/kg/day, so the impact of higher intakes require further study. In addition, even if enteral protein intakes > 3.5 g/kg/day result in greater growth rates on the NICU, there is scant evidence this improves later cognition, and there are increasing concerns about whether higher infant protein intakes increase the risk of later adverse cardio-metabolic outcomes. Furthermore, position papers and recommendations for intakes are provided assuming a heterogenous group of 'healthy growing preterm infants', yet macronutrient needs vary considerably between 24 weeks and 34 weeks gestation; more premature infants probably require higher intakes.

### Preterm infant (VLBW) enteral nutrition guideline (2017–2020) [^111cDuPL]. AND (2020). High credibility.

VLBW preterm infant formula nutrient targets — protein, calcium, and phosphorus: Based on comparative recommendations, preterm formulas should contain 3.2g to 3.3g of protein per 100kcal. Recommended calcium content for preterm formulas had the following range: 109mg to 185mg per 100 kcal, and recommended phosphorus content had the following range: 55mg to 109mg per 100 kcal. Protein guidance includes that the VLBW Preterm Infant systematic review recommends 3.5g to 4.0g per kg per day; LSRO protein recommendations are 2.5g to 3.6g per 100 kcal which at 120kcal per kg would provide a daily intake of 3.0g to 4.3g per kg per day; and AAP 2020 recommendations are 3.0g to 4.1g per 100kcal; 4.1g per 100kcal, at 120kcal per kg would provide up to 4.9g per kg. The guideline notes that if infants are provided within the lower end of the AAP (110kcal to 130kcal per kg per day) and ESPGHAN (110kcal to 135kcal per day) energy ranges, LSRO's lower end of their protein recommendation is not likely to provide sufficient protein (110 x 2.5 = 2.8g per kg per day).

### Nutrition practice, compliance to guidelines and postnatal growth in moderately premature babies: the NUTRIQUAL French survey [^112Gp81o]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In the last decades, several studies demonstrated serious cumulative nutritional deficit and extra-uterine growth retardation (EUGR) in preterm infants during the first weeks of life.

More recently, the causes of this growth failure have been explored and in part identified. The implementation of continuous education, the carrying out of surveys to focus on trends in clinical practice and the adherence of postnatal nutrition to current recommendations, have been addressed as possible solutions for improving growth and reducing EUGR.

All this literature relates to extremely or very low birth weight (VLBW) infants and very little is known about the nutritional care of the more "healthy" but still immature babies, born between 30 and 33 weeks of gestational age (GA), even though they account for 15% of preterm life births and 30% of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions.

Some reports have demonstrated that these infants, too, fail to achieve intrauterine growth rates during hospital stay and that significant variations in feeding practices and growth outcomes exist among NICUs. However, to date, no study has evaluated the adherence to guidelines for energy and amino acids (AA) intake in this specific population.

Infants within this cohort are generally less "sick" when compared with their very preterm counterparts and they have more subtle feeding issues and complications. Moreover, they often require a limited technological support and the choice of avoiding the central venous line (CVL) insertion – in order to reduce the possible associated complications - may limit the supply of the recommended protein and caloric intake, especially during the transitional period.

So, the determinants of postnatal growth and the factors influencing the adequacy of nutrition support in moderately preterm babies may be different from those of VLBW infants and deserve a better understanding.

The aims of this study were the following: 1) to describe nutrition practice intentions in a large cohort of moderately premature babies; 2) to compare nutrition practice intentions to actual practice; 3) to describe the adherence of units' actual practice to current nutrition guidelines; 4) to measure the growth outcomes during hospital stay in this cohort.

### Neonatal refeeding syndrome and clinical outcome in extremely low-birth-weight babies: secondary cohort analysis from the proVIDe trial [^111EpUrF]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Neonatal RS has been associated with metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, hypovolemia, ischemia, respiratory alkalosis, delayed full enteral feeding, 9, 11 and clinical problems, such as sepsis 6 and chronic lung disease. 9 Possible mechanisms are shown in Figure 1. The hypernatremia that has been reported may be due to hypertonic dehydration accompanying the hypovolemia, a risk for all ELBW babies due to high rates of transepidermal water loss.

Figure 1
Proposed mechanisms for neonatal refeeding syndrome and effects on clinical outcomes.

For many years, international‐consensus preterm nutrition guidelines recommended the early initiation of high IV amino acid and energy intakes in combination with little or no sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphate for the first 24–48 hours after birth. 25 The rationale for giving higher amino acids and energy was to prevent early nutrient deficits and subsequent growth faltering. Delayed electrolyte supplementation until after the onset of extracellular fluid contraction was thought to help prevent hyperkalemia and reduce the incidence of chronic lung disease. In fact, this combination may promote the subsequent development of neonatal RS (Figure 1). Recent 2018 European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) preterm IV nutrition guidelines 26, 27 now recommend sodium, phosphate, and potassium supplementation in IV nutrition solutions from birth, although the authors acknowledge this recommendation is not based on level 1 evidence. Further investigation is needed to determine how common neonatal RS is and whether it influences important neonatal health outcomes.

The ProVIDe (impact of protein intravenous nutrition on development) Trial randomized 434 ELBW babies in 6 New Zealand (NZ) and 2 Australian neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) between 2014 and 2018 to receive either 1 g.d −1 of IV amino acids or placebo (saline) in the first 5 days after birth, in addition to standard nutrition support. The primary outcome of the trial is survival free from neurodevelopmental disability at 2 years' corrected age (CA), expected to be available in 2021. Baseline nutrition intakes were not mandated, meaning that participants in both the intervention and placebo groups received a range of nutrient intakes because of the differences in nutrition policies and composition of IV nutrition solutions at each site. The aim of this blinded cohort analysis was to investigate the incidence of RS and relationships between RS and clinical outcomes, birth characteristics, growth, and nutrient intake.

### Early versus late administration of amino acids in preterm infants receiving parenteral nutrition [^113nyoP7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Observational studies in preterm newborns suggest that delay in administering amino acids (AA) could result in a protein catabolic state and impact on growth and development.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of early versus late administration of intravenous AA in neonates born at < 37 weeks of gestation.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trial registries in March 2023. We checked the reference lists of included studies and studies/systematic reviews where subject matter related to the intervention or population examined in this review.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing early administration of AA with late administration in premature newborn infants. We defined early administration of AA solution as the administration of AA in isolation or with total parenteral nutrition within the first 24 hours of birth, and late administration as the administration of AA in isolation or with total parenteral nutrition after the first 24 hours of birth.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

Nine studies (383 participants) were eligible for inclusion in the review. All study participants were born at < 37 weeks of gestation and were inpatients in neonatal intensive care units. No studies reported growth during the first months of life as assessed by difference in weight. Early administration of AA may have little or no effect on growth in the first month of life as measured by length (mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.41 to 0.41; 1 study; 21 participants; low-certainty evidence) and head circumference (MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.14; 2 studies; 87 participants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported the discharge weight outcome. Early administration of AA may result in little to no difference in neurodevelopmental outcome assessed by Mental Developmental Index (MDI) of < 70 at two years of age (odds ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.28; 1 study; 111 participants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported all-cause mortality at 28 days and before discharge. Early administration of AA may result in a large increase in positive nitrogen balance in the first three days of life (MD 250.42, 95% CI 224.91 to 275.93; 4 studies; 93 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests that there may be little to no difference between early and late administration of AA in growth (measured by length and head circumference during the first month after birth) and neurodevelopmental outcome (assessed by MDI of < 70). No RCTs reported on weight in the first month of life, mortality (all-cause mortality at 28 days and before discharge), or discharge weight. Low-certainty evidence suggests a large increase in positive nitrogen balance in preterm infants who received AA within 24 hours of birth. The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. The number of infants in the RCTs included in the review was small, and there was clinical heterogeneity amongst trials. Adequately powered trials in infants < 37 weeks' gestation are required to determine optimal timing of initiation of AA. We identified two ongoing studies. Both studies will be recruiting infants ≥ 34 weeks of gestation and may or may not add to the outcome data for this review.

### The effect of implementing parenteral nutrition guideline on growth and clinical outcomes in preterm infants: a comparative study [^113PsopE]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The implementation of a standardized PN protocol in a preterm neonatal population was associated with improved early nutritional intake, enhanced weight gain by day 28 of life, and a reduction in the incidence of bacterial sepsis. While total caloric intake remained below ESPGHAN recommendations, the protocol facilitated more structured and consistent early nutrition delivery. These findings support the adoption of standardized PN protocols in preterm care and underscore the importance of optimizing and integrating enteral feeding strategies to enhance long-term outcomes.

### Protein metabolism in preterm infants with particular reference to intrauterine growth restriction [^113Bt8Pv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2007). Low credibility.

There is growing evidence that neonatal and long-term morbidity in preterm infants, particularly those born before 32 weeks' gestation, can be modified by attained growth rate in the neonatal period. Guidelines for optimal growth and the nutritional intakes, particular of protein, required to achieve this are not well defined. Due to delays in postnatal feeding and a lack of energy stores developed in the last trimester of pregnancy, preterm infants often suffer early postnatal catabolism until feeding is established. There are indications that infants born with intrauterine growth restriction have perturbations in protein metabolism. Therefore, they may have different protein requirements than appropriate for gestational age infants. This review summarises what is known about protein requirements and metabolism in the fetus and preterm infant, with particular emphasis on the distinct requirements of the growth-restricted infant.

### Phenylalanine requirements of enterally fed term and preterm neonates [^114dNCpF]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Phenylalanine, which is an essential aromatic amino acid, is either used for protein synthesis or irreversibly hydroxylated to tyrosine. The provision of optimal amounts of dietary phenylalanine is not only important for growth and development but might also influence catecholamine synthesis and release rates. The current recommended aromatic amino acid requirement for infants aged 0–6 mo is based on the amino acid content of human milk.

Objective

We quantified the requirements for phenylalanine in the presence of excess tyrosine (166 or 177 mg/kg per day for term and preterm infants, respectively) for term and preterm neonates by using the indicator amino acid oxidation method with l-[1-(13)C]lysine 2HCl as an indicator. Hence, we determined the minimum obligatory phenylalanine requirement.

Design

Fully enterally fed term and preterm infants received randomly graded amounts of phenylalanine (5–177 mg/kg per day) as part of an elemental formula. Data are expressed as means ± SDs.

Results

Twenty term (birth weight: 3.19 ± 0.34 kg; gestational age: 38.9 ± 1 wk) and 16 preterm (birth weight: 1.75 ± 0.17 kg; gestational age: 32.5 ± 0.6 wk) Asian infants participated at a postnatal age of 17 ± 8 d. In total, 44 studies were performed. The minimum obligatory phenylalanine requirement was 58 mg/kg per day (95% CI: 38–78 mg/kg per day) and 80 mg/kg per day (95% CI: 40–119 mg/kg per day) for term and preterm infants, respectively.

Conclusion

The determined mean phenylalanine-requirement estimates are lower than the contents of term and preterm formulas currently on the market. This trial was registered at www.trialregister.nl as NTR1610.

### Optimizing parenteral nutrition to achieve an adequate weight gain according to the current guidelines in preterm infants with birth weight less than 1500 g: a prospective observational study [^115prbxQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Growth assessment: In this study, 23.9% of infants were SGA at birth. Poor weight gain outcome after PN was observed in 62% of infants. More than half of premature infants suffered poor weight gain during PN. Though avoidance of excessive rates of early growth could have a role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, there are no data to suggest an overall benefit of limiting nutrient intake, or restricting growth in preterm infants. Meanwhile, strong data suggest that inadequate nutrition and growth may permanently affect brain outcomes. So, we should do our best to optimize the early weight gain of preterm infants currently.

Optimizing PN regimen: in this study, average lipid during the first postnatal week, maximum amino acid, and days to reach maximum glucose / PN energy were all associated with weight gain outcome after PN. Nutrient intakes were independent predictors of growth. Although no large randomized controlled studies have been reported so far, early and moderate provision of lipid is supported by evidence. A retrospective study on 121 ELBW infants reports a negative correlation between the delay in introducing lipid emulsions and growth in the 1st month in preterm PN. Another research revealed that neurodevelopment assessed at 1 year of age correlated with cumulative fat intake in the first 14 days. Also, lipid supply, which decreases glucose utilization, is crucial for the maintenance of blood glucose in preterm infants. Infants who received higher protein intakes (3.8 g/kg/d) had a significantly greater growth velocity over the first 30 days after regaining birth weight and a lesser z-score change between birth and discharge for weight. However, ELBW infants (4 g/kg/d amino acid group) received an extra 8 g/kg of amino acids over the first 10 days of life without any significant difference in short- and long-term growth. Maximum PN amino acid in this study have reached the recommendation of 3.5 g/kg/d. Increase of maximum PN amino acid needs further investigation. Though brain accounts for 90% of whole-body glucose utilization in the neonate, parenteral glucose supply should be guided by the balance between meeting energy needs, the risk of overfeeding/excess glucose load, phase of illness, parenteral amino acid, parenteral lipid, etc. with medication. It is unreasonable to aim for the target amount as soon as possible. Lipid and glucose contribute to the energy of parenteral nutrition. The primary shortcoming in parenteral energy supply in our clinical practice is low late lipid supply and relatively low glucose supply. There is no evidence that gradual increments in the infusion rate of lipids improve fat tolerance. We should provide parenteral lipid earlier and higher to improve the energy supply.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of enteral protein intake effects on growth in preterm infants [^116hS7dz]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the association between enteral protein intake and growth in preterm infants with less than 32 weeks of gestation demonstrated a significant linear relationship between protein intake and weight gain. Our review is unique in that it includes only clinical trials with accurate measurements of actual protein intake and comprehensive analyses of growth throughout the enteral nutrition phase, coupled with a focus on studies in which enteral protein intake was provided as fortified human milk.

Protein is a critical nutrient for preterm infants to achieve an intrauterine-like growth rate. Using meta-regression, we found that aiming for growth rates of 20 g/kg/day — similar to those of a fetus at 23–25 weeks — would require approximately 4.4 g/kg/day of protein intake. Similarly, achieving growth rates of 17 g/kg/day, comparable to a fetus at around 28 weeks, would require 4 g/kg/day. This suggests the most preterm infants may require upward of the 4 g/kg/day recommended as standard by ESPGHAN, and perhaps need closer to the maximum recommended amount of 4.5 g/kg/day in order to achieve in utero growth rates. However, this conclusion should be interpreted with caution for infants at the extremes of prematurity, given that the median gestational ages of the infants included in our analyses were 27–30 weeks.

### Effects of mixed oil emulsion on short-term clinical outcomes in premature infants: a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial [^114AKvu9]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Preterm infants are at a higher risk for hypertriglyceridemia than term neonates due to the lack of adequate muscle and fat reserves, which accounts for a reduced hydrolytic capacity of the lipoprotein lipase enzyme. We found that the proportion of preterm infants with TG < 2.26 mmol/L in the SMOF group was higher (192/231 [83.1%] vs. 214/234 [91.5%], P = 0.007) and TG > 3.4 mmol/L was lower (13/231 [5.6%] vs. 4/234 [1.7%] P = 0.024). Pereira-da-Silva et al. reported that the level of TG was significantly higher in the MCT/LCT group than in the SMOF group (181 mg/dL vs. 134 mg/dL, P = 0.006), which is consistent with our findings. This can be explained by the levels of ω-3 LCPUFAs in SMOF, which have been shown to accelerate the clearance of chylomicrons, thereby effectively reducing the concentration of serum triglycerides and increasing triglyceride clearance and reducing adipogenesis by inhibiting the steroid response element binding protein-1. We further identified that SMOF improved lipid tolerance of VPI and VLBWI. Additionally, the dose of amino acids and lipid for PN recommend by Guidelines for Clinical Application of Neonatal Nutritional Support in China (2013), is widely used in Chinese NICUs, which is more conservative than the dose recommend by the ESPGHAN/ESPEN/ESPR/CSPEN guidelines. Thus, the applicability of our results may be limited in some regions where ESPGHAN/ESPEN/ESPR/CSPEN guidelines are prevalent.

Future research directions in preterm infant PN: The document calls for targeted studies to improve safety and outcome measurement, noting that "A major limitation to the inclusion of relevant clinical trials is the heterogeneity in defining outcomes". It urges investigation of dosing for the most premature infants "born at earlier gestational ages (ie, 22–23 weeks of gestation)". Priorities include "Reconsideration of a more unifying definition of EFAD" and work to define when "the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy is increased by ILE displacement of bilirubin". It also highlights uncertainty during metabolic stress (eg, sepsis, NEC) where "the infusion of nutrients only adds metabolic stress" and asks whether "pausing PN or reducing doses of specific parenteral macronutrients or micronutrients is metabolically advantageous".

### SCAMP: standardised, concentrated, additional macronutrients, parenteral nutrition in very preterm infants: a phase IV randomised, controlled exploratory study of macronutrient intake, growth and other aspects of neonatal care [^111VR5Z6]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Very preterm infants have a gut that is too immature to digest milk in sufficient quantity to meet nutritional requirements. Virtually all preterm infants < 29 weeks gestation and < 1200 g require parenteral nutrition (PN) for a period that depends on gestation birthweight and other morbidities. The mean duration of PN (> 75% all nutrition) in these infants (survivors) is 15.6 days increasing to 20.8 days for infants < 700 g. Given these infants have the highest incidence of early and late growth failure and long term neurocognitive disability, effective PN delivery is essential to avoid major early nutritional deficits in these infants.

Inadequate and/or inconsistent nutritional strategies are one barrier to effective PN delivery but there are others. The most important is metabolic "intolerance". Early concerns about amino acid tolerance continue to have profound effects on nutritional policies. More recent evidence evaluating neonatal amino acid PN formulations, suggests amino acids can be rapidly introduced without metabolic complications even in sick infants and without causing acidosis. This is essential if fetal protein accretion rates are to be matched and the large protein deficits which are routinely encountered in the first week of life are to be avoided. Recommended maximum protein intake is 4 g/kg/day.

Optimal utilisation of protein for preterm infant growth depends on an adequate non-protein energy intake. A minimum of 20–25kcal/g protein is required indicating that 100–120kcal/kg/day is needed to achieve maximal protein accretion. Glucose and lipid infusion rates needed to achieve this may not be tolerated, especially in the first week, leading to hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia. Increasing protein intake without providing an adequate non-protein calorie intake may result in growth failure and increased blood levels of urea and amino acids. Carbohydrate may be the major determinant of optimal growth in preterm infants and should account for 60–75% calories. Glucose intolerance can be managed with reducing intake but is routinely managed effectively with an insulin infusion although the long term risks and benefits of this approach are still unknown.

Standardized parenteral nutrition (PN) solutions in preterm infants — growth outcomes: Given the lack of clinical trials, standardized PN solutions are not advised for routine care; the guideline states, "we do not recommend using standardized PN solutions for routine care of preterm infants". This does not preclude "premade PN solutions utilized for the first 24 h after birth (commonly referred to as 'starter' or 'stock' PN), which are useful given their immediate availability at all hours". Evidence grading is "Quality of evidence: Very low" with "Strength of recommendation: Strong", and the text acknowledges potential implementation advantages in low-resource settings.

### Early amino-acid administration improves preterm infant weight [^116byyfT]. Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

The preterm infant misses the last trimester of fetal nutrient accretion, and requirement for immediate nutrient delivery that included amino acids may be essential due to limited glycogen and fat reserves. Despite this information, significant nutrient deficiencies are observed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)and premature infants are frequently discharged at weights less than the 10th percentile. Perhaps more concerning than low discharge weights is the association of poor growth in the early weeks of hospitalization with abnormal neurodevelopment and an increased prevalence of cerebral palsy. The goal of early amino-acid (EAA) supplementation is to provide the preterm infant with intravenous substrate that promotes protein deposition and increased lean body mass that more closely approximates fetal energy production and growth. Recently, it has become evident that protein delivery of 3 g kg −1 per day beginning on day 1 of life is safe and is associated with plasma amino-acid concentrations similar to those of second and third trimester fetuses. Protein deliveries as minimal as 1.5 g kg −1 per day have resulted in a neutral/positive nitrogen balance in most infantsbut maximizing protein to provide 3 g kg −1 per day beginning immediately after delivery may further enhance protein deposition that is essential for early growth. The amount of energy required to support post-delivery growth rates in premature infants has been demonstrated to be approximately 3 g kg −1 per day of protein and 90 kcal kg −1 per day. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that early administration (< 24 h of life) of parenteral nutrition with EAA supplementation would be associated with better growth in preterm infants than in infants in which amino-acid supplementation was delayed (> 24 h of life) (late amino acids, LAA).

### Nutritional support during the first week for infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and respiratory distress: a multicenter cohort study in China [^111UXbVh]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

As nutritional support during the first week of life for very preterm infants, both enteral and parenteral nutrition are crucial and interrelated. Our data showed that infants without BPD reached full EN earlier and that their rate of reaching parenteral protein was lower during the first week. In contrast, the percentage of infants with parenteral protein > 3.5 g/kg/d was greater in infants with BPD due to delayed enteral nutrition. Thus, a parenteral protein concentration > 3.5 g/kg/d was associated with BPD development and was the reason for the longer duration of full enteral nutrition. It was recommended that the amino acid supply in parenteral nutrition start on the first postnatal day at least 1.5 g/kg/d to achieve an anabolic state and between 2.5 g/kg/d and 3.5 g/kg/d and should be accompanied by nonprotein intake > 65 kcal/kg/d and adequate micronutrient intake beginning on day 2 of life according to the ESPGHAN/ESPEN/ESPR guidelines. It has also been shown that parenteral amino acid intake above 3.5 g/kg/d should be administered only as part of clinical trials. In addition to the amount of parenteral protein, it is also necessary to consider the nonprotein energy and the energy–nitrogen ratio. This topic requires further study.

Our results demonstrated that infants with BPD had lower energy intake during the first week, increased EUGR incidence at 36 weeks PMA, and prolonged days for birth weight recovery. Adequate nutrition is required for somatic and lung growth promotion. The effects of postnatal malnutrition on lung development have been studied in animal models. Early postnatal nutritional restriction impairs alveolarization and impacts the bronchiolar epithelium, therefore decreasing epithelial cell division and Clara cell conversion to ciliated cells. According to other animal studies, malnutrition worsens the detrimental effects of hyperoxia on lung alveolarization and extracellular matrix deposition. Consistent with our findings, other studies have reported lower caloric intake among infants with BPD during the first two weeks. However, unlike these studies, our study did not confirm that early lower caloric intake after birth was a risk factor for BPD occurrence.

### Parenteral nutrition in the neonatal intensive care unit… [^111HmfNR]. publications.aap.org (2011). Low credibility.

Neonatal parenteral nutrition is readily available in many hospitals and plays an essential role in the management of sick and growing preterm and term infants. PN can be used as the sole source of nutrition support for infants who cannot be fed or as an adjunct to enteral feeding. Preterm infants are a particularly vulnerable population because they are born at a time, if they had remained in utero, of rapid intrauterine brain and body growth. The impact of early malnutrition can have long-lasting negative effects on central nervous system development and growth. Despite this, PN is often provided to preterm infants based on local traditions rather than experimental evidence. The quality of PN and its early initiation are critical in providing the most adequate substrates for appropriate development.

This article reviews the energy and fluid requirements of infants and presents by component the available literature on neonatal PN and its complications. In addition, suggested guidelines for PN administration for preterm and term neonates are presented. Skip Nav Destination Article navigation Comments Meeting the Energy Requirement with TPN In Table 2, the authors set the following goals for TPN in the premature infant: Intralipid 3. 5 gm/kg/day, dextrose 12 mg/kg/min and amino acid 4 gm/kg/day. When you do the calculations, this solution provides 35 kcal/kg/day from Intralipid, 59 kcal/kg/day from dextrose, and 16 kcal/kg/day from amino acid. Even if you include the calories from amino acid, this solution only provides 110 kcal/kg/day.

In my experience, the only way to get to 120 kcal/kg/day is to increase the dextrose intake beyond the maximum intake suggested by the authors. I would like to know if the authors include the amino acid calories when calculating total caloric intake and if they consider 120 kcal/kg/day a realistic goal with TPN. Conflict of Interest: None declared.

### Enteral feeding of the preterm infant… [^11341eTY]. publications.aap.org (2018). Low credibility.

The targeted weight gain is 18 g/kg per day, head circumference growth of more than 0. 9 cm/week, and length gain of 1 cm/week. The smallest and least mature infants need the most protein, but energy needs escalate with increasing body weight. Early protein intake is a major contributor to improved weight gain velocity and a decreased risk of neurocognitive impairment. Premature Formula Formula specifically designed for preterm infants is appropriate to use if maternal or donor HM is not available. The specific formulations are based on fetal accretion rates and studies of metabolism and gastrointestinal tract development. Premature formula provides greater amounts of protein, calcium, zinc, iron, phosphorus, and copper than term formula without exceeding the overall energy intake goal. Despite sodium content being higher than HM or standard infant formula, some infants may still require supplementation.

Premature formula is composed mainly of whey, rather than casein, reducing the frequency of metabolic acidosis. Compared with standard formula, the protein content is 50% greater and provides 3 to 4 g/kg per day. This improves weight gain and protein accretion. Vitamin concentration is also higher. Fat content is provided by nearly equal quantities of long-chain and medium-chain triglycerides. Preterm infants have a relative lactase deficiency, and premature formula has a lower lactose concentration. Standard premature formula has low iron concentration, but higher iron versions are available that provide 15 mg/L, which is optimal for a discharge formula. Use of premature formula results in higher verbal IQ scores than when term formula is used for preterm infants. Fortification to prevent poor growth and osteopenia should be started in infants of less than 32 weeks' GA or less than 1, 500 g birthweight.

Appropriate fortification must be initiated no later than when HM enteral feedings reach 100 mL/kg per day but may be started as early as 50 mL/kg per day. Faster advancement shortens the time to achieve full feedings and regain birthweight without increasing NEC. Feedings should be advanced with goals of achieving an enteral volume intake of 150 to 160 mL/kg per day, as well as 110 to 130 kcal/kg per day energy and 3. 5 to
4. 5 g/kg per day protein.
