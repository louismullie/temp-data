## Question

Can ticagrelor be used to prevent bacterial endocarditis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ticagrelor can be used to prevent bacterial endocarditis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what current guidelines endorse for infective endocarditis prophylaxis and who actually qualifies for it. Then, I should verify ticagrelor's approved indications and mechanism to see if there is any plausible role in infection prevention. Next, I will review the clinical and mechanistic evidence linking ticagrelor to infection outcomes, and I need to check whether any of it focuses on endocarditis incidence or true prophylaxis. Finally, I will synthesize the clinical implications, highlight gaps, and state a clear recommendation aligned with authoritative guidance.

> Let me first confirm the standard of care for endocarditis prevention. High-quality guidelines consistently recommend antibiotic prophylaxis, and only for clearly defined high-risk cardiac conditions undergoing procedures likely to cause bacteremia, most notably certain dental procedures; antiplatelet agents are not included in these recommendations, which focus on targeted antibiotics rather than platelet inhibition [^1117ghTf] [^114BRUvb] [^112HGKiF] [^114SYay3].

> Wait, let me verify the antibiotic agents because I recall clindamycin being listed historically as an alternative in penicillin-allergic patients; however, I should confirm the most recent AHA statement. Hold on, I should verify this against the 2021 AHA viridans streptococcal IE prevention update, which removed clindamycin and favors options such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, doxycycline, or certain cephalosporins when appropriate, rather than clindamycin; so my initial recollection of clindamycin as a standard alternative was outdated and needs correction to reflect current guidance [^112wDTSh]. I will now examine non-dental contexts as well: routine GI/GU procedural prophylaxis is generally not recommended solely for IE prevention except in select high-risk scenarios where systemic antibiotics are considered by specialty guidance, further underscoring that when prophylaxis is indicated it is antibiotic-based, not antiplatelet-based [^111hVmR5] [^112M9juY] [^1153dkrk] [^1116PWSo].

> Next, I should review ticagrelor's indications and pharmacology. Ticagrelor is an oral, reversible P2Y12 inhibitor approved for antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndromes, typically given as a 180 mg loading dose followed by 90 mg twice daily; its mechanism is inhibition of platelet activation and aggregation, not antibacterial killing, and there is no labeled or guideline-supported role in infection prophylaxis or in preventing infective endocarditis [^112WTc93] [^112CfT1X] [^112AWk49].

> I need to check the clinical evidence linking ticagrelor to infections. In a large observational STEMI cohort, ticagrelor showed no significant reduction in in-hospital infections compared with clopidogrel, suggesting no clear preventive effect on generalized infections during hospitalization; by contrast, a retrospective ACS cohort associated ticagrelor with a lower risk of gram-positive infections within one year, but this was non-randomized, endpoint- and population-limited, and not designed for endocarditis prevention, with the observed association dissipating after DAPT cessation, which limits causal inference and prophylaxis relevance [^114tAiMg] [^113mNjbi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from mechanistic observations either. Experimental work indicates ticagrelor may protect platelets from Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin injury and enhance platelet-mediated killing in vitro and in animal models, and there is a case report of adjunctive ticagrelor with clearance of bacteremia in an endovascular S. aureus infection, but these data are mechanistic or anecdotal and do not establish efficacy for prophylaxis against endocarditis in humans [^112qmveP]. Let me consider broader host-directed hypotheses too; a recent integrative analysis proposes platelet/thrombosis pathways as potential adjunctive therapeutic targets in S. aureus bacteremia, but again, this frames ticagrelor as a potential adjunctive treatment strategy in established infection rather than a proven prophylactic, and it does not constitute guideline-level evidence for preventing IE [^116Tm1kp].

> I should double-check the gap between what we would need to use ticagrelor for prophylaxis and what the evidence shows. The available ticagrelor infection datasets involve ACS populations rather than the high-risk cardiac cohorts targeted for IE prophylaxis; endpoints are general infections, not incident endocarditis; designs are observational or preclinical rather than randomized prophylaxis trials; and, crucially, prophylaxis for IE is procedure-focused with brief peri-procedural antibiotic exposure to prevent bacterial seeding, whereas ticagrelor's platelet inhibition does not sterilize transient bacteremias or replace antibiotics for this purpose; consequently, the evidentiary and mechanistic mismatch is substantial and clinically decisive against prophylactic use for IE [^114BRUvb] [^1117ghTf] [^112wDTSh].

> But wait, what if someone argues for a theoretical benefit of antithrombotic approaches based on vegetation biology or animal models of antiplatelet therapy reducing experimental IE? I need to ensure I address this carefully. Preclinical data with other antiplatelets and anticoagulants in experimental IE exist, yet translation to clinical prophylaxis has not materialized; meanwhile, contemporary human guidelines continue to specify antibiotics when prophylaxis is indicated and do not endorse antiplatelets for IE prevention, reinforcing that such strategies remain investigational rather than standard of care [^1128mT8X] [^114BRUvb] [^1117ghTf].

> Let me reconsider safety context and unintended consequences. Adding or repurposing ticagrelor for an unproven prophylactic indication would expose patients to bleeding risk without demonstrated infection-preventive benefit, and contemporary guidance already cautions on minimizing unnecessary antithrombotic intensity in other settings; importantly, when device or valve procedures are performed, the recommended periprocedural prevention strategies are antisepsis and targeted antibiotics, not antiplatelet escalation for infection prevention [^117FxaV1] [^1138QMUt] [^1156xu5t].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line and make it explicit. Ticagrelor should not be used to prevent bacterial endocarditis; current evidence does not support a prophylactic effect on IE, and no guideline recommends antiplatelet therapy for this purpose. The standard remains antibiotic prophylaxis only for selected high-risk patients undergoing specific procedures, per ACC/AHA and ESC guidance, and ongoing ticagrelor therapy for ACS does not obviate the need for indicated antibiotic prophylaxis when appropriate [^1117ghTf] [^114BRUvb] [^112wDTSh].

Ticagrelor is **not recommended** for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis [^114BRUvb]. Current ESC [^114BRUvb] and ACC/AHA guidelines endorse **only antibiotic prophylaxis** for high-risk patients undergoing specific procedures [^1117ghTf] [^112wDTSh]. Ticagrelor's antiplatelet and limited antibacterial effects do not prevent bacteremia or IE, and **its bleeding risk outweighs any theoretical benefit**. There is no clinical evidence supporting ticagrelor for IE prevention [^112wDTSh], and **it should not be used for this purpose**.

---

## Current clinical guidelines for endocarditis prophylaxis

Current clinical guidelines from the ESC and ACC/AHA provide clear recommendations on **bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis** [^114BRUvb] [^1117ghTf]. The ESC 2023 guidelines recommend **antibiotic prophylaxis** for high-risk patients undergoing specific dental, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cardiac procedures [^114BRUvb] [^111qqtws] [^1153dkrk] [^1116PWSo] [^1138QMUt]. The ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines similarly recommend **antibiotic prophylaxis** for high-risk patients undergoing dental procedures involving manipulation of gingival tissue, the periapical region, or perforation of the oral mucosa [^1117ghTf]. Both emphasize antibiotic prophylaxis only for high-risk patients and procedures, with **no mention or recommendation of antiplatelet agents** such as ticagrelor for prophylaxis [^112wDTSh].

---

## Ticagrelor's pharmacological properties and potential antibacterial effects

Ticagrelor is a reversible oral P2Y12 receptor antagonist used primarily as an antiplatelet agent in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [^112CfT1X] [^112AWk49]. Recent studies suggest it may possess **limited antibacterial properties**, particularly against gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus [^112qmveP]. In vitro studies show that ticagrelor enhances **platelet-mediated killing of Staphylococcus aureus**, potentially through inhibition of bacterial α-toxin-mediated platelet injury [^112qmveP]. Clinical observations from a retrospective cohort study suggest a **reduced risk of gram-positive infections** in patients treated with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel following ACS hospitalization [^113mNjbi]. However, these effects are limited and **not sufficient to prevent bacteremia or bacterial colonization** of cardiac valves — critical steps in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis [^114tAiMg].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding ticagrelor for endocarditis prophylaxis

There is **no clinical evidence or randomized controlled trials** specifically evaluating ticagrelor for prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis [^114BRUvb]. Available evidence regarding ticagrelor's antibacterial effects is limited to in vitro studies, animal models, and observational clinical studies, none of which directly address its efficacy in preventing endocarditis [^112qmveP] [^1128mT8X] [^113mNjbi]. Animal studies indicate that antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and ticlopidine have shown some **protective effects in experimental endocarditis**, but these findings have not translated into clinical practice or guidelines [^1128mT8X]. Clinical studies have not specifically evaluated **ticagrelor for endocarditis prophylaxis**.

---

## Risks and benefits of ticagrelor compared to standard antibiotic prophylaxis

When considering ticagrelor for endocarditis prophylaxis, it is essential to weigh potential risks and benefits against standard antibiotic prophylaxis. Benefits are limited: ticagrelor's potential antibacterial effects are **insufficient to prevent bacteremia or bacterial colonization** of cardiac valves, so any theoretical benefit is minimal and unsupported by clinical evidence [^112qmveP] [^113mNjbi]. Risks include **significant bleeding** — including major bleeding events well documented in clinical trials and guidelines — as well as dyspnea and other adverse effects that further limit its suitability for prophylactic use. In contrast, **antibiotic prophylaxis is specifically targeted** to prevent bacterial colonization and infection, with well-established efficacy and safety profiles in high-risk patients undergoing specific procedures [^1117ghTf] [^114BRUvb].

---

## Current clinical recommendations and expert consensus

There are **no clinical guidelines or expert consensus statements recommending ticagrelor** for prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis [^112wDTSh]. The ESC and ACC/AHA guidelines explicitly recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for high-risk patients undergoing specific procedures, with no mention of antiplatelet agents such as ticagrelor [^114BRUvb] [^1117ghTf].

---

## Ongoing clinical trials and research

As of now, there are **no ongoing clinical trials specifically investigating ticagrelor** for prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis. Available research primarily focuses on ticagrelor's role in cardiovascular disease management and its potential antibacterial effects in other clinical contexts [^112CfT1X] [^112qmveP].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, **ticagrelor is not recommended** for prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis [^114BRUvb]. Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus explicitly recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for high-risk patients undergoing specific procedures, with no mention or support for antiplatelet agents such as ticagrelor [^112wDTSh]. The limited antibacterial effects of ticagrelor are insufficient to prevent bacteremia or bacterial colonization of cardiac valves, and its significant bleeding risk further limits suitability for prophylactic use [^112qmveP]. Therefore, **ticagrelor should not be used** for prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis, and **antibiotic prophylaxis remains the standard of care** for high-risk patients undergoing specific procedures [^1117ghTf].

### Ticagrelor and the risk of infections during hospitalization in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^114tAiMg]. Atherosclerosis (2021). High credibility.

Although ticagrelor exerts antibacterial activity, its effect on infections in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is unclear. We aimed to assess whether ticagrelor and clopidogrel affect infections in these patients during hospitalization.

- **Methods**: A total of 2116 consecutive patients with STEMI undergoing PCI were divided into ticagrelor (n = 388) and clopidogrel (n = 1728) groups. The primary outcome was infection onset. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). Propensity score analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results.

- **Results**: Infections developed in 327 (15.4%) patients. There was no significant difference in infection between both groups (ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel: 13.1% vs. 16.0%, p = 0.164). Patients in the ticagrelor group had lower rates of in-hospital all-cause death and MACCE than patients in the clopidogrel group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis determined that ticagrelor and clopidogrel had a similar preventive effect on infections during hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80–1.78, p = 0.380). Compared to the patients treated with clopidogrel, patients treated with ticagrelor had a slightly lower risk of other outcomes, but no statistical difference. Propensity score analyses demonstrated similar results for infections and other outcomes.

- **Conclusions**: Comparisons were drawn between ticagrelor and clopidogrel treatments, indicating some differences in outcomes such as in-hospital death and MACCE rates, while noting no significant statistical differences for infection prevention.

### Impact of a specific echocardiographic report comment regarding endocarditis prophylaxis on compliance with American Heart Association recommendations [^114mRfr5]. Circulation (2002). High credibility.

There is substantial underuse and overuse of antibiotic prophylaxis. American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations are heavily dependent on echocardiographic data that may not be familiar to referring physicians. We sought to determine the impact of a specific prophylaxis report comment on compliance with AHA recommendations.

- **Methods and results**: Using a standardized electronic reporting system, physicians interpreting approximately 50% of echocardiograms included a concluding comment classifying endocarditis risk and stating whether prophylaxis was indicated. The remaining reports were identical in format/content but did not include such comments. Of 1461 eligible outpatients during a 6-month period, 969 (66.3%) responded to a mail survey regarding prophylaxis instructions. Overall, 50% reported taking prophylaxes. Compliance with AHA recommendations was greater among those with a comment (73.2% versus 65.4% for those receiving versus those not receiving comments, respectively; P = 0.011), with particular improvement among moderate-risk patients (69.5% versus 59.9%, P = 0.024).

- **Conclusions**: An echocardiographic report statement regarding endocarditis risk and need for prophylaxis is a simple low-cost intervention that improves compliance with AHA recommendations. Interpreting physicians should become familiar with AHA recommendations and include a concluding statement addressing prophylaxis.

The recommendations for endocarditis prophylaxis from the American Heart Association have changed for three main reasons: 1) most cases of endocarditis are not attributable to an invasive procedure but rather are the result of randomly occurring bacteremia from routine daily activities; 2) prophylaxis may only prevent a small number of cases of infective endocarditis in women undergoing genitourinary procedures; and 3) the risk of antibiotic-associated adverse events exceeds the benefit, if any, from prophylactic antibiotic therapy. The specific changes pertinent to the obstetrician-gynecologist are discussed.

### The cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis [^116FJfkL]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Cost-effectiveness estimates are subject to uncertainty relating to values of the input parameters on clinical effectiveness, costs, and health outcomes. This uncertainty is a genuine concern because any decision could be incorrect; health benefits could be lost because of investment in a treatment that is not cost-effective. The value of eliminating all uncertainty, so there is no risk of an incorrect decision, is called the Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI), which provides an estimate of the upper bound of the cost of any additional research that would reduce uncertainty. For the all-at-risk population, the EVPI is near zero (£9,020 [$11,997; €10,824] for amoxicillin, £11,409 [$15,174; €13,691] for clindamycin over 10 years in England). This is because there is little uncertainty; AP is almost certainly cost-effective, and therefore, reducing uncertainty in any of the input parameters would be unlikely to lead to a different conclusion. However, the clinical effectiveness of AP is subject to some uncertainty because of reliance on observational data and interrupted time-series analysis.

Accordingly, we conducted an additional exploratory analysis in which assumptions concerning uncertainty around the efficacy of AP in the all-at-risk population were increased. The base case analysis assumes that withdrawal of AP led to 34.9 additional cases of IE per month. Therefore, a model averaging approach was used such that half the sample maintained this estimate and half used an estimate of zero (i.e. AP has no effect). This resulted in AP (a

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for GI endoscopy [^111hVmR5]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). High credibility.

In the context of preventing infective endocarditis, particularly concerning antibiotic prophylaxis for gastrointestinal procedures, the ASGE 2015 guidelines recommend against the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis before gastrointestinal endoscopy solely for the prevention of infective endocarditis. However, consider administering antibiotics to patients with high-risk cardiac conditions and those with established gastrointestinal tract infections where enterococci may be part of the infecting bacterial flora.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: Before and after study [^112i6ccw]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Based on the variability of the monthly data before the change, we set the margin as a 15% increase over the fitted number for cases and deaths. To carry out the test, we constructed a 95% confidence interval for the monthly mean number of cases or deaths for the 25 months after the guideline change. If the upper limit of the confidence interval corresponded to an increase of less than 15% over the model's estimate for the number of cases or deaths for March 2008 (that is, < 139.8 or < 22.4, respectively), we considered that the number of cases or deaths had not increased significantly.

Prespecified secondary tests of whether cases of infective endocarditis or deaths had increased since the introduction of the guideline were conducted. They included testing whether there was an increase in the time trend in the Poisson regression models and noting whether in 17 or more months from April 2008 to April 2010 the number of cases or deaths exceeded the fitted value for March 2008 (121.6 cases or 19.5 deaths). The probability of 25 independent counts of 17 exceeding this level was 0.22 (that is, < 5%), and so we set 17 as the test statistic.

### Effect of ticagrelor on reducing the risk of gram-positive infections in patients with acute coronary syndrome [^113mNjbi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

In light of recent studies describing the antibacterial properties of ticagrelor, the association between treatment with ticagrelor and subsequent risk for infection following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is taking on increased importance. A single-center, retrospective, matched cohort analysis was performed. All patients older than 30 years of age admitted between January 1, 2013, and November 1, 2019, for an ACS and discharged with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) were included. The primary outcome was defined as hospital admissions due to infections likely caused by gram-positive bacteria up to 1 year following the ACS hospitalization.

The base cohort included 3,909 patients: 2,035 (52.1%) were treated with ticagrelor and 1,874 (47.9%) with clopidogrel. Patients treated with ticagrelor had a 64% lower risk of gram-positive infection during the first year following hospitalization after adjusting for demographic and comorbidity factors compared with those treated with clopidogrel (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.61; p < 0.001). In a cohort starting from 1 year (conclusion of DAPT period) and up to 3 years following ACS hospitalization, the risk of gram-positive infection was comparable in both groups (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.19; p = 0.182). Treatment with ticagrelor was not associated with a reduced risk of gram-negative infections (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.21 to 1.06; p = 0.07).

In conclusion, a DAPT regimen that includes aspirin and ticagrelor is associated with a reduced risk of gram-positive infection compared with the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel.

- **Patient follow-up and information**: Patients being treated for infective endocarditis (IE) should be offered written information about IE. Patients who are discharged following treatment for an episode of IE should be advised of the risk of relapse and recurrence, how these can be reduced, and how to recognize the symptoms of IE. In addition to usual discharge letters, patients with IE should be advised to inform their general practitioner if they have a persistent non-specific feverish illness to trigger appropriate collection of blood cultures and onward referral. All patients with IE should be offered follow-up in a valve or general cardiology clinic; patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) should be followed up in ACHD services.

- **Governance**: Endocarditis teams should have a regular (e.g. yearly) review of quality, focusing on patient outcomes. Cases of healthcare-associated endocarditis should be investigated by root cause analysis and linked to existing systems for organizational learning and patient safety.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: updated guidance from the Joint British Societies [^114ZGSB7]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) remains a difficult condition to diagnose and treat and is an infection of high consequence for patients. It causes long hospital stays, life-changing complications, and high mortality. A new multidisciplinary, multiprofessional Working Party, led by the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC), was convened to undertake a focused systematic review of the literature and update the previous BSAC guidelines related to the delivery of services for patients with IE. A scoping exercise identified new questions concerning the optimal delivery of care, and the systematic review identified 16,231 papers, of which 20 met the inclusion criteria.

- **Endocarditis teams, infrastructure, and support**: Recommendations are made regarding the formation and support of endocarditis teams.

- **Endocarditis referral processes, patient follow-up, and patient information**: Specific guidelines address referral processes, follow-up, and patient education.

- **Governance and research recommendations**: The report also includes governance advice and research suggestions.

This report is a collaborative effort by the Working Party of the BSAC, British Cardiovascular Society, British Heart Valve Society, British Society of Echocardiography, Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, British Congenital Cardiac Association, and British Infection Association.

### Prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis: To use or not to use [^114cGiYC]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) published their revised guidelines in 2007 in which they markedly limited the recommendations for the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of infective endocarditis (IE), except for patients who are at the highest risk of adverse outcomes. A recent focused update on valvular heart diseases changed the recommendation for antibiotic use for patients with many underlying heart conditions, including mitral valve prolapse (MVP), which were considered as "low risk" heart defects. In this article, we argue that antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered until concrete clinical evidence is provided to dispute the use of this strategy, especially for patients with MVP. This approach is cost-efficient and provides a chance to prevent a dreadful disease. We have also enlisted two clinical cases to support our argument. These are not uncommon clinical scenarios and emphasize that IE can be fatal in spite of optimum treatment. Patients have the right to make the final decision, and they should be allowed to participate in choosing for, or against this approach until adequate clinical evidence is available.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for GI endoscopy [^116raHXs]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for infective endocarditis, specifically concerning antibiotic prophylaxis during gastrointestinal procedures, the ASGE 2015 guidelines recommend initiating antibiotic therapy upon admission. This should be done with intravenous ceftriaxone or an antibiotic with equivalent microbial coverage, such as oral norfloxacin, for patients allergic to or intolerant of ceftriaxone. This recommendation applies to all patients with cirrhosis admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Genome-scale meta-analysis of host responses to Staphylococcus aureus identifies pathways for host-directed therapeutic targeting [^116Tm1kp]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

There is interest in the modulation of thrombosis and platelet responses as an adjunct to antimicrobials in SAB, including a case report of ticagrelor adjunctive therapy in a person with persistent SAB associated with endovascular infection and metastatic foci. Our analysis supports therapeutic targeting of mechanisms associated with thrombocytopenia (for example, ticagrelor) and bacteria/fibrin/platelet microthrombus formation, for example, using dabigatran. Differential treatment effects are likely to exist between endotypes of S. aureus disease, as has been demonstrated for adjunctive rifampicin. Low platelet counts were associated with endocarditis, suggesting preventing platelet loss could be beneficial. In contrast, higher counts were associated with musculoskeletal metastatic infection (without endocarditis), suggesting that inhibiting microthrombus formation could be more beneficial.

There are important limitations to this study. First, the ranking is based on the strength of evidence for any association with S. aureus disease and cannot distinguish between pro- or antibacterial effects of a given host factor, or roles in dysregulated immunity. For example, C5AR1 was a prioritized gene, and activation by C5a impairs neutrophil phagolysosomal killing of S. aureus, contributing to immune failure during critical illness. Second, included studies were heterogeneous in terms of the model systems and bacterial strains used. While this is also a strength that provides a global view of the host response, it means the final ranking applies at the broadest level.

### A comparison of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of infective endocarditis [^115M5uRd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a microbial infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. Antibiotics are the cornerstone of treatment, but their use is not standardized due to differences in presentation, populations affected, and the wide variety of microorganisms responsible. This text updates a review published in 2016.

- **Objectives**: To assess the existing evidence about the clinical benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens used to treat people with infective endocarditis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase Classic and Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science on 6 January 2020. We also searched three trials registers and hand-searched the reference lists of included papers, applying no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of antibiotic regimens for treating definitive infective endocarditis diagnosed according to modified Duke's criteria. We considered all-cause mortality, cure rates, and adverse events as the primary outcomes. We excluded people with possible infective endocarditis and pregnant women.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction in duplicate. We constructed 'Summary of findings' tables and used GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence. We described the included studies narratively.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: Before and after study [^114rJxHb]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Over the past 10 years, there has been a general move to reduce antibiotic prescribing to save costs and prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Although this could have contributed to the reduction in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis, it seems unlikely given the size and suddenness of the reduction. This reduction coincided with the introduction of the NICE guideline, the low cost of a single dose of amoxicillin or clindamycin, and national prescribing data that show a slight increase in the general prescribing of penicillins and macrolide antibiotics over the same period.

The results of this analysis cover a large group of patients for whom antibiotic prophylaxis was prescribed before the introduction of the NICE guideline. Our results suggest that for most of these patients, including those with a history of rheumatic fever or a heart murmur, there may be little or no benefit in giving antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis. However, because we cannot exclude the possibility that residual antibiotic prophylaxis prescribing targets those perceived to be at the highest risk of infective endocarditis, it does not completely tackle the problem of whether a subset of patients, particularly those with prosthetic heart valves or a history of infective endocarditis, might still benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis. To more directly answer this question, a carefully designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of antibiotic prophylaxis in these patients would be required.

### Infective endocarditis hospitalizations and antibiotic prophylaxis rates before and after the 2007 American Heart Association guideline revision [^111e1Y8K]. Circulation (2019). Low credibility.

In 2007, the American Heart Association recommended antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of infective endocarditis (IE) for only the highest-risk patients. Whether this change affected the use of antibiotic prophylaxis and the incidence of IE is unclear.

- **Methods**: IE-related hospitalizations were identified from 2002 to 2014 among all adults and those at high and moderate risk for IE, stratified by age. Prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis were obtained from the Ontario Drug Benefit database for adults aged 65 years and older. Outcomes were antibiotic prophylaxis prescription rates and incidence of IE-related hospitalization. Trends in patient and pathogen characteristics were analyzed. Time series analyses were performed with segmented regression and change-point analyses.

- **Results**: Prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis decreased substantially in the moderate-risk cohort after the guideline revision (mean quarterly prescriptions, 30,680 versus 17,954 [level change, -6,481; P = 0.0004] per 1 million population) with a minimal, yet significant, decrease followed by a slow increase in the high-risk group. There were 7,551 IE-related hospitalizations among 6,884 adults aged 18 years and older. Among adults aged 65 years and older, the mean IE rate increased from 872 to 1,385 and 229 to 283 per 1 million population at risk per quarter in the high- and moderate-risk groups, respectively. Change-point analyses indicated that this increase occurred in the second half of 2010 in adults aged 65 years and older, 3 years after the American Heart Association guideline revision.

### The cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis [^116RZAk8]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

The study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) regimen previously used in the United Kingdom before the 2008 NICE guidelines, which recommended either a single 3-g oral dose of amoxicillin or a single 600-mg oral dose of clindamycin for individuals allergic to penicillin or who had received amoxicillin in the last month. This was compared to a strategy of no AP, as per the NICE guidelines, and a strategy restricting AP to just those at high risk of infective endocarditis (IE), in line with the European and North American guidelines. English National Health Service costs were estimated and health effects measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).

A decision model was constructed, based on the model used by NICE for its health-economic analysis, to inform the 2008 guidelines. The model estimates differences in costs and health benefits from both the short-term and long-term consequences of the decision to administer AP or not. These include AP-related adverse events and IE, which may be fatal or result in differences in the probability of a patient's health status, requiring valve replacement surgery or experiencing congestive heart failure (CHF). A state transition model, with 1-year cycle periods and a 50-year time horizon, was used to capture these longer-term impacts. The analysis employed Treeage Pro software and the Sheffield Accelerated Value of Information tool.

### Prevention of viridans group streptococcal infective endocarditis: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112wDTSh]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

In 2007, the American Heart Association published updated evidence-based guidelines on the recommended use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent viridans group streptococcal (VGS) infective endocarditis (IE) in cardiac patients undergoing invasive procedures. The 2007 guidelines significantly scaled back the underlying conditions for which antibiotic prophylaxis was recommended, leaving only four categories thought to confer the highest risk of adverse outcomes. The purpose of this update is to examine interval evidence of the acceptance and impact of the 2007 recommendations on VGS IE and, if needed, to make revisions based on this evidence.

- **Methods and results**: A writing group was formed consisting of experts in the prevention and treatment of infective endocarditis, including members of the American Dental Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, in addition to the American Heart Association. MEDLINE database searches were done for English language articles on compliance with the recommendations in the 2007 guidelines and the frequency of and morbidity or mortality from VGS IE after publication of the 2007 guidelines. Overall, there was good general awareness of the 2007 guidelines but variable compliance with recommendations. There was no convincing evidence that VGS IE frequency, morbidity, or mortality has increased since 2007.

- **Conclusions**: On the basis of a review of the available evidence, there are no recommended changes to the 2007 VGS IE prevention guidelines. We continue to recommend VGS IE prophylaxis.

### The cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis [^1146QAvm]. Circulation (2016). High credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) is a widely used prevention measure for those at risk of developing infective endocarditis (IE). Following the suggestion that bacteremia secondary to invasive dental procedures might cause IE, the American Heart Association's Committee on Prevention of Rheumatic Fever and Bacterial Endocarditis was the first to recommend that individuals at increased risk of IE should be given AP before invasive dental procedures some 60 years ago. Over time, the American Heart Association and other international guideline committees have gradually restricted AP use, moving to single-dose AP strategies and limiting the types of patients for whom AP is recommended. In 2008, this culminated with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommending that the use of AP to prevent IE should cease in the United Kingdom. This recommendation was confirmed in a recent review of the NICE guidelines but is in contrast with European, North American, and other international guidelines that recommend AP for high-risk individuals undergoing invasive dental procedures.

A recent interrupted time series study found that AP prescribing in England fell sharply after the 2008 NICE guidance, with a significant increase in the incidence of IE. By March 2013, it was estimated that there were 34.9 (95% confidence interval, 7.9–61.9) more cases of IE per month than would have been expected from the previous trend. This increase was statistically significant both for those at high risk (previous history of IE, prosthetic heart valve, valve.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: Updated guidance from the Joint British Societies [^1144hyvU]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

The scoping exercise for this guideline revision identified new questions concerning the optimal delivery of care for patients with infective endocarditis (IE). The primary questions were: (1) how should IE services be delivered? (2) what outpatient follow-up should be provided? and (3) what information should be given to patients? After excluding duplicates, 16,231 papers related to IE were identified, of which 20 were related to the delivery of IE services and met the inclusion criteria.

- **Endocarditis teams**: The findings of these papers were categorized into broad themes, including endocarditis teams.
- **Infrastructure and support**: Among the papers, eight studies involved adults only, and 12 did not state age inclusion or exclusion criteria.
- **Referral processes, patient follow-up and information, governance**: No study explicitly included children.

### Ticagrelor plus aspirin for 1 month, followed by ticagrelor monotherapy for 23 months vs aspirin plus clopidogrel or ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by aspirin monotherapy for 12 months after implantation of a drug-eluting stent: A multicentre, open-label, randomised superiority trial [^114owJzS]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin for 1 month, followed by ticagrelor alone, improves outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention compared with standard antiplatelet regimens.

- **Methods**: GLOBAL LEADERS was a randomized, open-label superiority trial conducted at 130 sites in 18 countries. Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with a biolimus A9-eluting stent for stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 75–100 mg aspirin daily plus 90 mg ticagrelor twice daily for 1 month, followed by 23 months of ticagrelor monotherapy. Alternatively, patients received standard dual antiplatelet therapy with 75–100 mg aspirin daily plus either 75 mg clopidogrel daily (for patients with stable coronary artery disease) or 90 mg ticagrelor twice daily (for patients with acute coronary syndromes) for 12 months, followed by aspirin monotherapy for 12 months. Randomization was concealed, stratified by center and clinical presentation (stable coronary artery disease vs. acute coronary syndrome), and blocked, with randomly varied block sizes of two and four.

- **Endpoints**: The primary endpoint at 2 years was a composite of all-cause mortality or non-fatal centrally adjudicated new Q-wave myocardial infarction, as assessed by a core lab in a blinded manner. The key secondary safety endpoint was site-reported bleeding assessed according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium criteria (grade 3 or 5).

### Erythromycin lactobionate [^111yLSn6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Although no controlled clinical efficacy trials have been conducted, oral erythromycin has been recommended by the American Heart Association for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis in penicillin-allergic patients. This includes those with prosthetic cardiac valves, most congenital cardiac malformations, surgically constructed systemic pulmonary shunts, rheumatic or other acquired valvular dysfunction, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS), previous history of bacterial endocarditis, and mitral valve prolapse with insufficiency during dental procedures and surgical procedures of the upper respiratory tract.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of erythromycin and other antibacterial drugs, erythromycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: A meta-analysis [^112ngrFb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy were evaluated in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention through a meta-analysis. This study aimed to provide insights into the potential benefits and risks associated with this treatment approach.

- **Study design and methodology**: The analysis included data from numerous clinical trials to assess various factors, such as efficacy and safety measures. Comprehensive statistical methods were employed to ensure accurate results.

- **Findings and implications**: Results of the meta-analysis indicated that ticagrelor monotherapy may offer certain advantages in terms of clinical outcomes. However, the safety profile requires careful consideration due to the observed risk factors.

This research is critical for informing clinical practices and guiding future studies concerning ticagrelor monotherapy in cardiovascular interventions.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: updated guidance from the Joint British Societies [^117FFGTn]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

In 2012, the Endocarditis Working Party of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) published updated guidelines for the treatment of endocarditis. Given the significant progress in the field, a new multidisciplinary and multiprofessional BSAC Working Party was convened to systematically review the literature and update the previous guideline where appropriate. This statement includes native valve endocarditis (NVE) and prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). For the purposes of this guideline, 'PVE' incorporates prosthetic valves of all types, annuloplasty rings, intracardiac patches, aortic root grafts and patches, and shunts. There is some overlap with the management of implantable cardiac electronic device infections, but many issues have been previously addressed elsewhere.

Infective endocarditis (IE) remains a challenging condition to diagnose with high mortality. Patients with IE can present with a wide variety of symptoms, signs, and complications, and are consequently managed by teams from a wide range of specialties. In the UK, patients with IE may present acutely to district general hospitals or to a heart centre (hospital with a cardiac surgical unit). Only patients living in the immediate catchment of a heart centre are likely to be admitted directly to a heart centre. Detailed data on the place of presentation are lacking, but a recent study from a heart centre in London found the vast majority of patients were transferred from district general hospitals. Clinicians with primary responsibility for patients with IE may have relatively little experience.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: Before and after study [^1144WRma]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to quantify the change in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis before invasive dental procedures. This followed the introduction of a clinical guideline from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in March 2008, which recommended the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in the United Kingdom.

- **Design**: A before and after study was conducted.

- **Setting**: The study took place in England, focusing on all patients admitted to hospitals with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of acute or subacute infective endocarditis.

- **Main outcome measures**: Researchers measured the monthly number of prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis, consisting of a single 3 g oral dose of amoxicillin or a single 600 mg oral dose of clindamycin. They also tracked the monthly cases of infective endocarditis, related deaths in hospitals, or cases with a possible oral origin for streptococci.

- **Results**: Following the introduction of the NICE guideline, there was a highly significant 78.6% reduction (P < 0.001) in the prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis, from a mean of 10,277 (SD 1068) prescriptions per month to 2,292 (SD 176). There was no significant evidence (P = 0.61) that the general upward trend in cases of infective endocarditis before the guideline introduction was altered subsequently. Using a non-inferiority test, it was determined that an increase in the number of cases by 9.3% or more could be excluded after the guideline's introduction. Similarly, an increase in infective endocarditis-related deaths was not significant.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^112nvaPw]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

Before the guideline change, the estimated annual percentage changes in the number of cases and deaths were analyzed. From January 2000 to March 2008, there was an increasing trend in the number of cases of infective endocarditis (P < 0.001), cases possibly attributable to oral streptococci (P < 0.001), and deaths from infective endocarditis (P = 0.008). The number of cases was significantly correlated with the number of deaths (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.46, P = 0.001).

The estimated annual percentage change in cases of infective endocarditis before and after the introduction of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis is detailed below. All estimates in a row are from a single Poisson regression model, adjusting for population size, and with one term for months since January 2000 and another for months since the guideline change.

- **Statistical notes**:
	- ✱ p value for test of the term for change before the introduction of the guideline*.
	- †P value for the test of whether the term after the guideline change is 0 — that is, whether the annual percentage change differs between before and after the guideline was introduced.
	- ‡Percentage difference in the annual percentage increase in cases before and after the guideline was introduced.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: Updated guidance from the Joint British Societies [^1147QxcG]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

The starting point for this review was the previous 2012 guideline, and we sought evidence that warranted a change from previous recommendations. The Working Party was recruited from the BSAC membership and specialist cardiology societies that might wish to be involved in the preparation of the guideline, each society nominating a participant following approval from their respective governance structures. Other members were invited to ensure diverse expert and non-expert representation, including infection specialists, cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, pharmacists, laboratory scientists, and a patient and public representative.

The joint Working Party comprised members of the BSAC, the British Cardiovascular Society, the British Heart Valve Society, the British Society of Echocardiography, the Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, and the British Infection Association. The British Congenital Cardiac Association joined later in the process and contributed to the final guideline. During a face-to-face meeting, an initial scoping exercise was undertaken by Working Party members to identify key clinical questions concerning the delivery of specialist IE services to patients in the UK NHS, followed by round-table discussion to determine and prioritize principal guideline topics. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken (see online supplemental file for search strategy and methods for screening and selection of papers for inclusion), followed by the development of initial recommendations from the literature review.

### Perspectives on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the prevention of infective endocarditis [^113B2rJW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

In 2007, the American Heart Association published a guideline statement dramatically changing its previous position on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients at risk of infective endocarditis (IE). This year, these views were incorporated in an update of the 2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease. The new recommendations represent a dramatic shift with regard to which patients should receive antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of IE and for what procedures.

The shift in recommendations is striking in that the recommendations are based not on new data, but on no data. There are no large, prospective, randomized double-blind trials testing the efficacy of IE prophylaxis. However, available data suggest that there may be no real risk associated with IE prophylaxis. Even if few cases of IE are successfully prevented using antibiotic prophylaxis, those few cases may represent a favorable risk-benefit ratio.

On an individual basis, patients with organic heart valve disease who are trying to delay or avoid surgical intervention have something very real to risk if they develop IE, and a very real benefit if they avoid it. Pending data from prospective randomized trials, a strategy of individual decision-making by informed patients may be best.

### Efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy by clinical presentation: Pre-specified analysis of the GLOBAL LEADERS trial [^115U3a9f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

In conclusion, this analysis provides novel, large-scale randomized evidence to support the use of ticagrelor monotherapy following an abbreviated treatment with DAPT to mitigate the risk of bleeding in patients with ACS while preserving efficacy. Ticagrelor monotherapy after PCI in patients with ACS, therefore, deserves further study.

### Ticagrelor increases platelet-mediated Staphylococcus aureus killing, resulting in clearance of bacteremia [^112qmveP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Platelets are a critical immune defense against Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections. Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin is a virulence factor that decreases platelet viability and accelerates platelet clearance. It has been shown that ticagrelor blocks α-toxin-mediated platelet injury and resulting thrombocytopenia, protecting mice in a lethal S. aureus sepsis model.

We now present the use of ticagrelor as adjunctive therapy in a patient with a S. aureus endovascular infection and thrombocytopenia, associated with restoration of platelet count and bacteremia clearance. Ticagrelor enhanced platelet killing of the S. aureus bloodstream isolate from the treated patient in vitro.

### De-escalation to ticagrelor monotherapy versus 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with and without acute coronary syndromes: a systematic review and individual patient-level meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115wy1i5]. Lancet (2024). High credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 12 months is the standard of care after coronary stenting in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The aim of this individual patient-level meta-analysis was to summarize the evidence comparing DAPT de-escalation to ticagrelor monotherapy versus continuing DAPT for 12 months after coronary drug-eluting stent implantation.

- **Methods**: A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD)-level meta-analysis of randomized trials with centrally adjudicated endpoints was performed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy (90 mg twice a day) after short-term DAPT (from 2 weeks to 3 months) versus 12-month DAPT in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with a coronary drug-eluting stent. Randomized trials comparing P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy with DAPT after coronary revascularization were searched in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and two websites (www.tctmd.com and www.escardio.org) from database inception up to May 20, 2024. Trials that included patients with an indication for long-term oral anticoagulants were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The principal investigators of the eligible trials provided IPD by means of an anonymized electronic dataset. The three ranked coprimary endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (MACCE; a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) tested for non-inferiority in the per-protocol population; and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 3 or 5.

### Prophylaxis of infective endocarditis: Current tendencies, continuing controversies [^114ToEa4]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a severe disease with high mortality and often results from a combination of bacteraemia, sometimes provoked, and a predisposing cardiac condition. Prophylaxis for infective endocarditis has been recommended by different countries based on the supposed pathophysiology of the disease; however, no randomized clinical trial has confirmed its efficacy. We review the data presented over the past few decades, challenge the principles underlying prophylaxis recommendations, and analyze the arguments explaining the general recent tendency to decrease prophylaxis indications. Such arguments include the probable important role of everyday-life bacteraemia in the occurrence of infective endocarditis, the estimated huge number of prophylaxis doses required to avoid a single case of infective endocarditis, and the lack of scientific evidence to identify procedures that should lead to prophylaxis. Recommendations for prophylaxis are now essentially focused on patients with high-risk predisposing cardiac conditions before dental procedures.

### Proleukin [^112k3Gn6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Serious infections including sepsis**: Proleukin can cause impaired neutrophil function, such as reduced chemotaxis, and an increased risk of disseminated infection, including sepsis and bacterial endocarditis. Pre-existing bacterial infections should be treated before initiating Proleukin. Consider antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with indwelling central lines. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection during treatment, and withhold Proleukin based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Renal toxicity**: Serious renal toxicity, including oliguria and renal failure, can occur with Proleukin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. Pre-existing renal impairment or coadministration with other products known to cause renal toxicity may increase this risk. If possible, avoid using Proleukin concomitantly with products known to cause renal toxicity. Serum creatinine should be ≤ 1.5 mg/dL before starting Proleukin treatment. Monitor serum creatinine at baseline and daily throughout each therapy course. Withhold or permanently discontinue Proleukin based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Immune-mediated adverse reactions**: Exacerbation of pre-existing autoimmune disease or initial presentation of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders has been reported following Proleukin treatment. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. These include exacerbation of Crohn's disease, colitis, scleroderma, thyroiditis, and inflammatory arthritis.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^112DEFQs]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a rare disease with high morbidity and mortality. For more than 50 years, antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive procedures has been the primary focus for preventing infective endocarditis and remains the standard of care for patients with the disease in most parts of the world. The rationale for such treatment is to reduce or eliminate the bacteremia that may result from such procedures. A particular focus is on antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, as oral streptococci have been implicated in 18% to 65% of cases of infective endocarditis, although most studies suggest the proportion is closer to 35%-45%. Regardless, little or no firm scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing infective endocarditis, and two case-control studies provide evidence that dental treatment is unlikely to be a risk factor. Some authors therefore suggest that the focus on antibiotic prophylaxis is an unproved, expensive, and potentially harmful standard of care, whereas others argue that it prevents cases of infective endocarditis. Owing to ethical and medicolegal issues, cost, and the large number of patients necessary to achieve statistically significant results, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of antibiotic prophylaxis has never been attempted.

In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom produced controversial new guidance recommending the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for all patients at risk of infective endocarditis.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: Updated guidance from the Joint British Societies [^113LSTDH]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

The lack of high-quality evidence to inform practice around the delivery of care for patients with suspected or confirmed infective endocarditis (IE) was striking. The following research questions arise in the wake of this guideline development process:

- **IE team**: What are the clinical and cost benefits of an IE team? What is the most clinically and cost-effective model of service delivery?

- **Infrastructure and location of care for patients with IE**: What are the relative benefits and risks of patients with IE being cared for in a local hospital without the facilities of a heart centre on site, such as the availability of transoesophageal echocardiography or cardiac surgical support?

- **Patient follow-up**: What is the most clinically and cost-effective timing, nature, and frequency of follow-up after an episode of IE?

- **Patient information**: What information would patients prefer, and how is this best provided?

- **People who inject drugs**: What are the clinical and cost-effective benefits of substance misuse teams to support people who inject drugs (PWID) who also have IE?

- **IE registry**: Would an IE registry improve benchmarking and research? Can local data be linked to central NHS Digital or other relevant databases to report on patient outcomes?

- **Children**: How are IE services best delivered for children?

### New British and American guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of infective endocarditis: Do the changes make sense? A critical review [^111JqndQ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy and the American Heart Association have radically revised their guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis. This review discusses the evidence behind the most controversial changes and considers possible future developments.

The new guidelines emphasize good oral hygiene for preventing viridans streptococcal endocarditis. Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures is only recommended for patients with the highest-risk cardiac conditions. American Heart Association guidelines no longer recommend prophylaxis for urological and gastrointestinal procedures.

While only up to 6% of endocarditis cases may be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis, there is controversy as to what to recommend for the individual cardiac patient undergoing a given procedure. The new guidelines about dental prophylaxis are based on epidemiological studies that failed to include sufficient subjects undergoing specific interventions. When considering viridans streptococcal rather than total bacteraemia rates, asserting that the prevalence of bacteraemia after invasive dental procedures is similar to that after toothbrushing may be incorrect. The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy report probably overestimates the risk of fatal anaphylaxis after an oral dose of amoxicillin. In contrast, the American Heart Association guidelines comment on the absence of any reports of fatal anaphylaxis associated with the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis.

### Prophylaxis of experimental endocarditis with antiplatelet and antithrombin agents: A role for long-term prevention of infective endocarditis in humans [^1128mT8X]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) mostly occurs after spontaneous low-grade bacteremia; thus, IE cannot be prevented by circumstantial antibiotic prophylaxis. Platelet activation following bacterial-fibrinogen interaction or thrombin-mediated fibrinogen-fibrin polymerization is a critical step in vegetation formation. We tested the efficacy of antiplatelet and antithrombin to prevent experimental IE.

- **Methods**: A rat model of experimental IE following prolonged low-grade bacteremia mimicking smoldering bacteremia in humans was used. Prophylaxis with antiplatelets (aspirin, ticlopidine [alone or in combination], eptifibatide, or abciximab) or anticoagulants (antithrombin dabigatran etexilate or anti-vitamin K acenocoumarol) was started 2 days before inoculation with Streptococcus gordonii or Staphylococcus aureus. Valve infection was assessed 24 hours later.

- **Results**: Aspirin plus ticlopidine, as well as abciximab, protected 45%-88% of animals against S. gordonii and S. aureus IE (P < .05). Dabigatran etexilate protected 75% of rats against IE due to S. aureus (P < .005) but failed to protect against S. gordonii (< 30% protection). Acenocoumarol was ineffective.

- **Conclusions**: Antiplatelet and direct antithrombin agents may be useful in the prophylaxis of IE in humans. In particular, the potential dual benefit of dabigatran etexilate might be reconsidered for patients with prosthetic valves, who require life-long anticoagulation and in whom S. aureus IE is associated with high mortality.

### Impact of prior antiplatelet therapy on risk of embolism in infective endocarditis [^114gpyZQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Embolism is a dreaded complication of infective endocarditis (IE). Currently, antimicrobial therapy is the only medical intervention proven to decrease the risk of embolism associated with IE. We hypothesized that, because platelet aggregation is operative in the pathogenesis of vegetation formation, embolism associated with IE should occur less frequently among patients who have received prior, continuous daily antiplatelet therapy for noninfectious reasons.

- **Methods**: We studied a retrospective cohort of adult patients with a diagnosis of IE who presented to the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) during 1980–1998. The cohort was divided into two groups based on whether they had received continuous daily antiplatelet therapy for at least six months prior to hospitalization for IE. Antiplatelet therapy included aspirin, dipyridamole, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, or any combination of these agents. The primary endpoint was a symptomatic embolic event that occurred prior to or during hospitalization. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the impact of continuous daily antiplatelet therapy on the risk of symptomatic emboli associated with IE.

- **Results**: One hundred forty-seven (24.5%) of the 600 patients experienced a symptomatic embolic event; the most common embolic manifestation was stroke (in 48.2% of patients). Embolic events occurred significantly less often among those who had received prior, continuous daily antiplatelet therapy (12.0% of patients who had received therapy vs. 27.8% of patients who had not received therapy; p < 0.001).

### Using ticagrelor to prevent recurrent type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarctions: Boon or bane [^117UYTmv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The issue of whether ticagrelor is effective in preventing recurrent type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarctions is a subject of active investigation. The potential benefits, as well as the drawbacks, must be carefully weighed. Various clinical trials have shown differing results regarding the drug's efficacy and safety, necessitating further comprehensive studies. More detailed insights can be found in the editorial by Bonaca et al, which explores these aspects in depth.
