## Question

autoimmune screening labs for dysautonomia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about autoimmune screening labs for dysautonomia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which high-credibility guidelines explicitly recommend autoimmune antibody testing in autonomic failure. Then, I should verify the specific antibody targets that are most relevant. Next, I will define the clinical context that triggers testing, assess availability and practice patterns, and synthesize a pragmatic screening approach. Finally, I need to consider disease-specific nuances and close with a concise summary that aligns with guideline strength and laboratory realities [^113ZTfCR].

> Let me first confirm the highest-credibility recommendation before proceeding. Wait, I almost attributed this to the ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline, but that focuses on autonomic evaluation referrals rather than explicit autoantibody testing; I should double-check the ESC guideline text instead. The 2018 ESC syncope guideline explicitly recommends obtaining paraneoplastic antibodies and anti–ganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibodies in patients with acute or subacute onset of multidomain autonomic failure, which is the clearest evidence-based directive for autoimmune screening in dysautonomia presentations fitting that profile [^113ZTfCR] [^113Ln782].

> Next, I should review and verify the key antibody targets. Anti–ganglionic (nicotinic) acetylcholine receptor antibodies directed at the α3 subunit are tightly linked to autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy and represent the prototypical serological marker of immune-mediated autonomic failure, especially in cases with relatively rapid onset and widespread autonomic impairment [^111yfNLF] [^1139PUZq]. Paraneoplastic neuronal antibody panels, with anti-Hu prominently represented, are also important because anti-Hu paraneoplastic neurological syndromes frequently include dysautonomia across gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and other autonomic domains, with contemporary series quantifying dysautonomia in approximately a quarter of anti-Hu patients [^115R1Bpj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing everyone with orthostatic intolerance. I need to ensure the clinical context matches the guideline trigger. The ESC recommendation applies when the onset is acute or subacute and the autonomic failure is multidomain, such as combined adrenergic, cardiovagal, and sudomotor involvement, or when a paraneoplastic or autoimmune mechanism is clinically suspected or the case is idiopathic but immune-mediated disease is plausible, rather than in chronic degenerative synucleinopathies or isolated POTS without red flags [^113ZTfCR] [^115fYbXB]. I should confirm that this targeted use increases diagnostic yield while avoiding low-value testing in chronic neurodegenerative dysautonomias where autoantibodies are typically not contributory [^115fYbXB].

> I will now examine laboratory availability and real-world practice patterns to set expectations. Let me check the European ANS laboratory surveys for hard numbers. Multiple surveys report that autoantibody testing and catecholamines are not universally available, with roughly half to two-thirds of autonomic laboratories offering autoantibody testing and a similar proportion measuring catecholamines, underscoring that these assays often require referral pathways or send-out logistics to reference laboratories [^115tB8aS] [^114LbKQx]. Next, I should review who should interpret results; the AANEM position stresses that autonomic testing and integration of serology should be supervised and interpreted by physicians with domain expertise to avoid misclassification and to anchor findings to physiology and phenotype, which is especially critical when antibody titers are low or when phenotypes are atypical [^113hAgmS].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic primary screening approach while staying faithful to guideline strength. For suspected immune autonomic neuropathy or autonomic failure with acute or subacute multidomain onset, the core serology consists of anti–ganglionic AChR antibodies targeting the α3 subunit and a comprehensive paraneoplastic autoantibody panel that includes neuronal nuclear and cytoplasmic autoantibodies such as anti-Hu and related onconeural markers, interpreted in clinical context and followed by malignancy screening if positive or if suspicion remains high despite seronegativity [^113ZTfCR] [^115R1Bpj]. But wait, what about emerging assays like GPCR autoantibodies in POTS? I should be cautious: while associations have been reported, these are not yet recommended for routine screening in dysautonomia and should not displace guideline-backed tests in autonomic failure phenotypes that meet immune-screening criteria [^115yPhUU].

> I should confirm supporting and contextual investigations that, while not autoimmune per se, often run in parallel and guide interpretation. Catecholamine profiling is commonly used in autonomic laboratories, helpful for distinguishing neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and characterizing sympathetic deficits in conjunction with reflex testing, and its availability across European centers sits near two-thirds, aligning with its supportive role rather than standalone diagnostic value for immunity [^114LbKQx]. Let me also consider cardiac sympathetic imaging and sudomotor testing; 123I-MIBG scintigraphy can show cardiac sympathetic denervation in seropositive autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy and has been described in neurosarcoidosis with autonomic features, though this is adjunctive and should be anchored to clinical physiology and serology rather than used as a first-line screen for autoimmunity [^115SWirC].

> Next, I should review disease-specific nuances that modify pretest probability and downstream steps. In anti-Hu paraneoplastic syndromes, dysautonomia is common and clinically meaningful, with gastrointestinal and cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction predominating and specific patterns linked to outcomes, so a positive paraneoplastic panel should prompt robust cancer surveillance and tailored management of autonomic complications [^115R1Bpj]. Let me not forget immune neuropathy contexts: neurosarcoidosis can rarely associate with anti–ganglionic AChR antibodies and cardiac sympathetic dysfunction on MIBG, suggesting an immune-mediated autonomic component in selected cases, whereas in CIDP the autonomic involvement is typically mild and testing strategy should be guided by the broader neuropathy evaluation rather than an immune autonomic screen-first approach [^115SWirC] [^116eTcDB].

> Hold on, I should verify that interpretation is integrated with formal autonomic function testing to avoid false positives and missed phenotypes. Standardized cardiovascular and sudomotor autonomic reflex testing remains foundational for defining the pattern and severity of failure, contextualizing serology, and prioritizing immune therapies when appropriate; this testing framework is consistently emphasized across autonomic practice statements and quantitative testing reviews and should precede or accompany autoimmune screening in suspected immune-mediated cases [^113cTiJ2] [^113hAgmS].

> In summary, I need to ensure the recommendation remains precise. The core autoimmune screening labs for dysautonomia, when the phenotype is acute or subacute and multidomain or when an autoimmune or paraneoplastic cause is suspected, are anti–ganglionic AChR antibodies and a comprehensive paraneoplastic antibody panel, interpreted alongside formal autonomic testing and clinical context, with recognition that access often requires referral to specialized centers and that adjunct studies such as catecholamines and 123I-MIBG are supportive rather than primary screens [^113ZTfCR] [^115tB8aS] [^113hAgmS] [^115SWirC].

Autoimmune screening in dysautonomia focuses on identifying **treatable immune-mediated causes** [^115fYbXB]. The **key autoimmune tests** are anti-ganglionic acetylcholine receptor (α3-AChR) antibodies [^111yfNLF] for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, and paraneoplastic antibodies (anti-Hu, anti-CV2/CRMP5, anti-Ri, anti-Ma2, anti-amphiphysin) when a paraneoplastic process is suspected [^113ZTfCR] [^115R1Bpj]. Additional screening includes ANA, ENA panel, anti-dsDNA, ANCA, anti-SSA/SSB, anti-TPO, anti-thyroglobulin, and anti-GAD65 to evaluate for systemic autoimmune diseases that can cause autonomic dysfunction [^115fYbXB]. These tests should be interpreted in clinical context [^113ZTfCR] and combined with autonomic function testing (tilt table, Valsalva, QSART) [^113cTiJ2] to confirm dysautonomia and guide management.

---

## Indications for autoimmune screening in dysautonomia

Autoimmune screening is indicated when clinical features suggest an **immune-mediated** process — particularly with **subacute onset** or systemic features [^113ZTfCR]:

- **Subacute onset**: Rapid progression over days to weeks [^115fYbXB].
- **Multidomain involvement**: Cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, sudomotor, and pupillomotor domains.
- **Systemic features**: Weight loss, fever, or other systemic symptoms.
- **Paraneoplastic suspicion**: History or suspicion of malignancy [^115R1Bpj].
- **Autoimmune history**: Personal or family history of autoimmune disease.

---

## Recommended autoimmune screening laboratories

The following autoimmune tests are recommended for patients with **suspected autoimmune dysautonomia**:

| **Autoantibody test** | **Clinical relevance** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Anti-ganglionic acetylcholine receptor (α3-AChR) antibodies [^113ZTfCR] | Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG) | - Subacute autonomic failure <br/> - Suspected AAG |
| Paraneoplastic antibodies (anti-Hu, anti-CV2/CRMP5, anti-Ri, anti-Ma2, anti-amphiphysin) [^115R1Bpj] | Paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy | - Suspected paraneoplastic syndrome <br/> - Malignancy |
| Antinuclear antibody (ANA) [^115fYbXB] | Systemic autoimmune diseases (e.g. SLE, Sjögren's) | General autoimmune screening |
| Extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) panel (SSA, SSB, RNP, Sm, Scl-70, Jo-1) | Specific systemic autoimmune diseases | Suspected connective tissue disease |
| Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) | Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) | Suspected SLE |
| Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) | Vasculitis | Suspected vasculitis |
| Anti-thyroid antibodies (anti-TPO, anti-thyroglobulin) | Autoimmune thyroid disease | Suspected thyroid dysfunction |
| Anti-GAD65 antibodies [^115fYbXB] | - Autoimmune diabetes <br/> - Stiff-person syndrome | - Suspected autoimmune diabetes <br/> - Neurological syndromes |

## Additional laboratory evaluations

In addition to autoimmune screening, obtain the following tests to identify **secondary causes** of dysautonomia:

- **CBC**: Evaluate for anemia or infection.
- **Electrolytes**: Sodium, potassium, chloride.
- **Renal function**: Creatinine, urea.
- **TSH**: Thyroid dysfunction.
- **Morning cortisol**: Adrenal insufficiency.
- **Ferritin**: Iron deficiency [^113gbTQU].

---

## Autonomic function testing

Autonomic function testing is **essential** to confirm dysautonomia and determine severity [^113cTiJ2]:

- **Tilt table testing**: Orthostatic intolerance, POTS, orthostatic hypotension [^113MytTA].
- **Valsalva maneuver**: Baroreflex function [^112CozYj].
- **QSART**: Sudomotor function [^115fQ2XR].
- **Heart rate variability**: Cardiovagal function [^112tDok8].

---

## Clinical implications of positive autoimmune screening

Positive autoimmune screening results guide **targeted therapy** — including immunotherapy (IVIG, plasma exchange, corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressants) — for autoimmune dysautonomia [^115fYbXB]. They also prompt paraneoplastic evaluation with appropriate cancer screening and oncologic management [^115R1Bpj] and direct management of associated systemic autoimmune diseases via rheumatology or endocrinology referral.

---

## Limitations and considerations

Autoimmune screening can yield **false positives** — low-titer antibodies may be nonspecific — and **false negatives**, as not all autoimmune dysautonomias have detectable antibodies. Results must be interpreted in clinical context for accurate diagnosis and management.

---

Autoimmune screening in dysautonomia includes anti-ganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibodies, paraneoplastic antibodies, and general autoimmune panels. These tests, combined with autonomic function testing, help **identify treatable autoimmune causes** and guide management [^113ZTfCR].

Although autonomic neuropathy may occur as a secondary consequence of various diseases, other patients without any obvious underlying diseases show profound autonomic dysfunctions from the early phase of the disease. These idiopathic or primary cases are divided into pure autonomic neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy with sensory impairment, and autonomic neuropathy with sensory and motor impairment based on the presence or absence of sensory or motor dysfunctions. The discovery of the antiganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody has suggested the involvement of immune mechanisms in idiopathic cases, especially in those with pure autonomic neuropathy. The ability to test for the presence of this antibody has significantly expanded the concept of autonomic neuropathy to include cases with a chronic progressive course that mimics pure autonomic failure.

Recent work based on the antiganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody has established autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy as an isolated nosological entity. Other forms of primary autonomic neuropathies include acute autonomic and sensory neuropathy and acute autonomic sensory and motor neuropathy, although the nosological relationship of the latter to Guillain-Barré syndrome should be discussed. Although the possibility of infectious, metabolic, or toxic etiologies should be carefully excluded in these forms of autonomic neuropathy, the monophasic clinical course and the presence of antecedent infections suggest the involvement of immune mechanisms similar to Guillain-Barré syndrome.

### Clinical autonomic nervous system laboratories in Europe: A joint survey of the European Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Autonomic Societies [^115fQ2XR]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Disorders of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are common conditions estimated to affect 70 million people worldwide. The cardiovascular ANS is the most frequently affected domain, with an incidence of a first-in-life syncope episode of 6.2 per 1000 person-years. In contrast to other neurological disciplines, the evaluation of the ANS is associated with special caveats. Since, on most occasions, the ANS cannot be tested directly, its assessment relies on examining noninvasive physiological variables that express not only the activity of the autonomic reflex arch, but also the function of the effector organ and interaction of the body with external physical stimuli.

The evaluation is extensive and time-consuming, and test batteries typically include the head-up tilt test, the Valsalva maneuver, and deep breathing for the evaluation of sympathetic adrenergic and cardiovagal function. Additionally, the quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART), thermoregulatory sweat test, sympathetic skin response, and electrochemical skin conductance measurement are used for the evaluation of sudomotor function.

### Proper performance of autonomic function testing [^113hAgmS]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of this position statement is to provide a recommendation from experts at the American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) on the proper performance of autonomic testing.

- **Methods**: The AANEM Professional Practice Committee and selected AANEM members reached a consensus based on expert opinion on the training required to perform autonomic testing and the appropriate performance of such tests.

- **Results**: Individuals without sufficient medical education in autonomic disorders are unqualified to interpret the data generated or to coordinate the findings with other clinical information in order to reach a clinical diagnosis.

- **Conclusions**: The AANEM strongly recommends that autonomic testing procedures be performed by physicians with comprehensive knowledge of neurologic and autonomic disorders to ensure precise interpretation and diagnosis at the completion of the testing. The same physician should obtain a relevant history and physical examination and should directly supervise and interpret the data on-site and in real time.

### Clinical autonomic nervous system laboratories in Europe: A joint survey of the European Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Autonomic Societies [^114LbKQx]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Disorders of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are common conditions, but it is unclear whether access to ANS healthcare provision is homogeneous across European countries. The aim of this study was to identify neurology-driven or interdisciplinary clinical ANS laboratories in Europe, describe their characteristics, and explore regional differences.

- **Methods**: We contacted the European national ANS and neurological societies, as well as members of our professional network, to identify clinical ANS laboratories in each country and invite them to answer a web-based survey.

- **Results**: We identified 84 laboratories in 22 countries, and 46 (55%) answered the survey. All laboratories perform cardiovascular autonomic function tests, and 83% also perform sweat tests. Testing for catecholamines and autoantibodies is performed in 63% and 56% of laboratories, respectively, and epidermal nerve fiber density analysis in 63%. Each laboratory is staffed by a median of two consultants, one resident, one technician, and one nurse. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of head-up tilt tests per laboratory per year is 105 (49–251). Reflex syncope and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension are the most frequently diagnosed cardiovascular ANS disorders. Thirty-five centers (76%) have an ANS outpatient clinic, with a median (IQR) of 200 (100–360) outpatient visits per year; 42 centers (91%) also offer inpatient care (median 20 [IQR 4–110] inpatient stays per year). Forty-one laboratories (89%) are involved in research activities. We observed a significant difference in the geographical distribution.

### Association between neurosarcoidosis with autonomic dysfunction and anti-ganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibodies [^115SWirC]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

At the site of lesion in dysautonomia, postganglionic denervation was more common, and we found reduced H/M ratios and increased washout rates in 123 I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy in our three illustrative cases. Cardiac sympathetic dysfunction in sarcoidosis comorbid with SFN was previously demonstrated by 123 I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy. Previous studies have revealed the presence of cardiac sympathetic dysfunction in up to 50% of patients with SSFN by 123 I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy. Importantly, anti-gAChR antibodies were detected in Cases 1 and 2 in our study. It has been demonstrated that a decreased H/M ratio is observed in 80% of seropositive AAG cases, with several cases showing improvements in their H/M ratio by immunotherapy. In the present Case 3, the reduced H/M ratio in 123 I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy was improved by steroid therapy; therefore, it may have resulted from functional impairments in autonomic nerve fiber transmission. Autoantibodies against gAChR, which could have interfered with autonomic ganglionic synaptic transmission of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, were not detected in this case. We speculate that other immunologic blocking factors, such as unknown antibodies or cytokines, may have caused the functional impairment in the postganglionic pathways.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1156ADPY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Syncope can have a variety of aetiologies and may result in falls and associated injuries. It is defined as a sudden yet transient complete loss of consciousness in which the individual is unable to maintain postural tone, followed by rapid and spontaneous recovery.

Standing for 2 to 3 minutes is usually sufficient to observe the fall in blood pressure (BP) associated with syncope; however, in the case presented here, BP was measured after 5 minutes of standing. Determining the underlying cause of syncopal episodes is an important diagnostic step to appropriately guide management. A relatively common cause of syncope is orthostatic hypotension (OH), characterized by a drop in BP of ≥ 20 mmHg systolic or ≥ 10 mmHg diastolic within a few minutes of standing.

- **Potential causes of syncope**: Neurogenic OH (nOH; that is, OH resulting from autonomic dysfunction) can be differentiated from non-neurogenic causes of OH (e.g. hypovolemia) clinically by autonomic function tests and by an insufficient compensatory heart rate (HR) increase on standing. Common clinical signs and symptoms of nOH include dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, and falls.

Neurogenic OH is frequently comorbid with other disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and type 2 diabetes. Neurogenic OH increases the risk of falls, which in turn interferes with activities of daily living and increases the burden of symptoms for patients and their caregivers.

### Canadian guideline for Parkinson disease [^116cfC2q]. CMAJ (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Parkinson's disease, specifically concerning autonomic dysfunction, the CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend advising patients to avoid coffee before bedtime and to limit water ingestion for the treatment of urinary urgency and incontinence, excluding urinary tract infections when symptoms appear suddenly. They make the following suggestions:

- **Reduce fluid intake**: Decrease fluid consumption after 6 p.m. and sleep with the bed head-up to reduce urine production and control nocturia.
- **Optimize dopaminergic therapy**: Enhance nighttime dopaminergic therapy.
- **Administer urinary urgency medication**: Use anticholinergic or antispasmodic drugs for urinary urgency, particularly for an overactive bladder, while being mindful of central adverse effects.
- **Use botulinum toxin**: Administer botulinum toxin type A injection in the detrusor muscle.

### Autonomic dysfunction in genetic forms of synucleinopathies [^112UzCXK]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The discovery of genetic links between alpha-synuclein and Parkinson's disease (PD) has opened unprecedented opportunities for research into a new group of diseases, now collectively known as synucleinopathies. Autonomic dysfunction, including cardiac sympathetic denervation, has been reported in familial forms of synucleinopathies that have Lewy bodies at the core of their pathogenesis. SNCA mutations and multiplications, LRRK2 disease with Lewy bodies, as well as other common sporadic forms of idiopathic PD, multiple system atrophy (MSA), pure autonomic failure, and dementia with Lewy bodies have all been associated with dysautonomia. By contrast, in familial cases of parkinsonism without Lewy bodies, such as in PARK2, the autonomic profile remains normal throughout the course of the disease.

The degeneration of the central and peripheral autonomic systems in genetic as well as sporadic forms of neurodegenerative synucleinopathies correlates with the accumulation of alpha-synuclein immunoreactive-containing inclusions. Given that dysautonomia has a significant impact on the quality of life of sufferers and autonomic symptoms are generally treatable, prompt diagnostic testing and treatment should be provided. Moreover, new evidence suggests that autonomic dysfunction can be used as an outcome prediction factor in some forms of synucleinopathies or as premotor diagnostic markers that could be used in the future to define further research avenues. In this review, we describe the autonomic dysfunction of genetic synucleinopathies in comparison to the dysautonomia of sporadic forms of alpha-synuclein accumulation.

### Autonomic innervation in multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure [^1124wMM7]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Pure autonomic failure (PAF) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are both characterized by chronic dysautonomia, although presenting different disability and prognosis. Skin autonomic function evaluation by indirect tests has revealed conflicting results in these disorders. Here, the authors report the first direct analysis of skin sympathetic fibers, including structure and function, in PAF and MSA to ascertain different underlying autonomic lesion sites, which may help differentiate between the two conditions.

- **Methods**: The authors studied eight patients with probable MSA (mean age 60 ± 5 years) and nine patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria for PAF (64 ± 8 years). They underwent head-up tilt test (HUTT), extensive microneurographic search for muscle and skin sympathetic nerve activities from the peroneal nerve, and punch skin biopsies from the finger, thigh, and leg to evaluate cholinergic and adrenergic autonomic dermal annexes innervation, graded by a semiquantitative score presenting a high level of reliability.

- **Results**: MSA and PAF patients presented comparable neurogenic orthostatic hypotension during HUTT and a high failure rate of microneurographic trials to record sympathetic nerve activity, suggesting a similar extent of chronic dysautonomia. In contrast, they presented different skin autonomic innervation in the immunofluorescence analysis. MSA patients showed a generally preserved skin autonomic innervation with a significantly higher score than PAF patients, who showed marked postganglionic sympathetic denervation. In MSA patients with a long disease duration, morpho

### Autonomic nervous system dysfunction: JACC focus seminar [^112tDok8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Autonomic nervous system control of the heart is a dynamic process in both health and disease. A multilevel neural network is responsible for the control of chronotropy, lusitropy, dromotropy, and inotropy. Intrinsic autonomic dysfunction arises from diseases that directly affect the autonomic nerves, such as diabetes mellitus and syndromes of primary autonomic failure. Extrinsic autonomic dysfunction reflects changes in autonomic function that are secondarily induced by cardiac or other diseases.

An array of tests interrogates various aspects of cardiac autonomic control, either in resting conditions or with physiological perturbations from resting conditions. The prognostic significance of these assessments has been well established. Clinical usefulness, however, has not been established, and the precise mechanistic link to mortality is less well understood. Further efforts are required to develop optimal approaches to delineate cardiac autonomic dysfunction and its adverse effects to create tools that can guide clinical decision-making.

### Autonomic nervous system testing may not distinguish multiple system atrophy from Parkinson's disease [^114om8My]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Formal laboratory testing of autonomic function is reported to distinguish between patients with Parkinson's disease and those with multiple system atrophy (MSA), but such studies segregate patients according to clinical criteria that select those with autonomic dysfunction for the MSA category.

- **Objective**: To characterise the profiles of autonomic disturbances in patients in whom the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease or MSA used criteria other than autonomic dysfunction.

- **Methods**: Forty-seven patients with parkinsonism and autonomic symptoms who had undergone autonomic laboratory testing were identified and their case records reviewed for non-autonomic features. They were classified clinically into three diagnostic groups: Parkinson's disease (19), MSA (14), and uncertain (14). The performance of the patients with Parkinson's disease was compared with that of the MSA patients on five autonomic tests: RR variation on deep breathing, heart rate changes with the Valsalva manoeuvre, tilt table testing, the sudomotor axon reflex test, and thermoregulatory sweat testing.

- **Results**: None of the tests distinguished one group from the other with any statistical significance, alone or in combination. Parkinson's disease and MSA patients showed similar patterns of autonomic dysfunction on formal testing of cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic, vasomotor, and central and peripheral sudomotor functions.

- **Conclusions**: This study supports the clinical observation that Parkinson's disease is often indistinguishable from MSA when it involves the autonomic nervous system.

### Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease [^111Nky6H]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Symptoms of cardiovascular dysautonomia are a common occurrence in Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition to this dysautonomia as part of PD itself, dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) can be triggered as a side effect of drug treatment interacting with the ANS, or if prominent and early, an indication of a different disease such as multiple system atrophy (MSA). Various diagnostic tests are available to demonstrate autonomic failure.

- **Autonomic function tests**: These can differentiate parasympathetic from sympathetic dysfunction. Cardiac imaging can define the pathophysiologically involved site of a lesion.
- **Standard tests**: Tests such as 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements can identify significant autonomic failure which needs treatment. The most frequent and disturbing symptom of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is orthostatic hypotension. Symptoms include generalized weakness, light-headedness, and mental "clouding" up to syncope.
- **Factors worsening orthostatic hypotension**: Heat, food, alcohol, exercise, activities that increase intrathoracic pressure (such as defecation and coughing), and certain drugs (such as vasodilators) can worsen probably asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension.
- **Therapies**: Non-medical and medical therapies can help the patient cope with disabling symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Supine hypertension is often associated with orthostatic hypotension.

The prognostic role of cardiovagal and baroreflex dysfunction is still not yet known.

### Autonomic nervous system evaluation of patients with vasomotor rhinitis [^111hKDuW]. The Laryngoscope (2000). Low credibility.

To demonstrate the utility of quantitative neurological laboratory testing of autonomic nervous system dysfunction and to apply this methodology to further study the relation of chronic vasomotor (nonallergic) rhinitis to the autonomic nervous system.

- **Methods**: It has been suspected that vasomotor rhinitis is due either to a hyperactive parasympathetic nervous system or an imbalance between it and the sympathetic nervous system. The exact relation has not been determined. Recently, neurological laboratories have been developed in which a battery of tests can be performed to determine the reactivity of the autonomic nervous system.

- **Results**: Autonomic nervous system testing was performed on 19 patients with symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for vasomotor rhinitis, and the results were compared with 75 sex- and age-matched control subjects. Patients with vasomotor rhinitis had significant abnormalities of their sudomotor, cardiovagal, and adrenergic subscores. Their composite autonomic scale score was significantly impaired at 2.43, compared to 0.11 for controls (P < .005).

- **Conclusion**: Autonomic nervous system dysfunction is significant in patients with vasomotor rhinitis. Possible factors that trigger this dysfunction, including nasal trauma and extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux, are discussed.

### Canadian guideline for Parkinson disease [^116banNr]. CMAJ (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Parkinson's disease, specifically concerning the management of autonomic dysfunction, CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend offering the following general measures for treating constipation in patients with PD:

- **Increased intake of fluid and fiber**: Encourage patients to consume more fluids and dietary fiber.
- **Increased physical activity**: Engage patients in regular physical exercise to improve bowel function.
- **Polyethylene glycol solution**: Utilize as a treatment option for bowel management.
- **Fiber supplements**: Incorporate fiber supplements such as psyllium or methylcellulose for enhanced bowel regulation.
- **Osmotic laxatives**: Administer osmotic laxatives, including lactulose, to alleviate constipation.
- **Short-term irritant laxatives**: Use in selected patients for temporary relief.
- **Reduction or discontinuation of anticholinergic drugs**: Minimize or stop medications with anticholinergic activity to avoid exacerbating constipation.
- **Add domperidone**: Consider adding domperidone to improve gastrointestinal motility.

### Autonomic nervous system function in chronic dizziness [^112L63pT]. Otology & Neurotology (2007). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to validate the clinical diagnosis of autonomic dizziness as a cause of chronic nonvertiginous dizziness that may be exacerbated by physical exertion or orthostatic challenges, estimate its prevalence in a tertiary referral population, and investigate the usefulness of three autonomic challenges as objective tests for this condition.

- **Study design**: Laboratory investigation of autonomic activity.
- **Setting**: Tertiary care balance center.
- **Patients**: Fifteen men and women with symptoms indicative of autonomic dizziness. Subjects with other causes of dizziness, histories of syncope, or psychiatric disorders were excluded.
- **Interventions**: Autonomic tests included 45 minutes of head upright tilt (HUT), 20 minutes of 5% CO2 inhalation and then HUT, and 2 minutes of voluntary hyperventilation and then HUT.
- **Main outcome measures**: Patterns of cardiovascular and respiratory responses and subjective ratings of dizziness, autonomic symptoms, and anxiety during autonomic challenges.

Results showed that twelve subjects had evidence of autonomic dysfunction, including ten with abnormal heart rate, blood pressure, or respiratory responses to HUT. Two other subjects experienced prolonged hypocarbia after voluntary hyperventilation. Many of these abnormalities would have been missed by autonomous testing paradigms. In one subject, CO2 inhalation revealed latent anxiety. In two subjects, the presence of high symptom ratings without objective autonomic dysfunction prompted a successful search for other diagnoses.

### The phoenix from the ashes: Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia [^113dQ3Yc]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with autonomic failure may experience postural dizziness, syncope, and falls. Identifying symptomatic dysautonomia in dementia is important to ensure appropriate management and reduce the risk of falls.

- **Objective**: The aim of this prospective study is to identify cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in patients suffering from behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD).

- **Methods**: Patients were prospectively recruited from 2009 until 2013. Clinical autonomic function tests were carried out in an Autonomic Unit according to Ewing's cardiovascular battery. Parasympathetic tests included resting heart rate variability, deep breathing, and Valsalva. Sympathetic function tests examined blood pressure regulation on Valsalva, cutaneous cold stimulation, and 70° head-up tilt including plasma noradrenaline levels.

- **Results**: 26 patients (17 female) with bvFTD and 18 patients (10 female) with AD were examined. The mean age of bvFTD patients was 69 ± 11 years, and AD patients were 74 ± 9 years. History taking was often not conclusive and did not correlate with autonomic signs. In 42% of bvFTD patients and 44% of AD patients, autonomic dysfunction was demonstrated. Manifest orthostatic hypotension (OH) was present in 19% of bvFTD and 33% of AD patients. The frequency of autonomic dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension did not differ between bvFTD and AD but was significantly higher than in healthy controls. Autonomic dysfunction was associated with an increased risk of falling, as assessed with the Tinetti Score.

- **Conclusion**: This is the first prospective study to el

### Cardiovascular autonomic function tests in an African population [^1137vEkp]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

DAN usually begins with impairment of the parasympathetic nervous system, followed by damage to the sympathetic nervous system. The process is patchy, with increasing involvement of both systems. A variety of tests assessing the function of both nervous systems are therefore suggested. Our study included five non-invasive and easy-to-use autonomic function tests. The Valsalva manoeuvre and sustained handgrip test were not included, even though they are common autonomic function tests. The Valsalva manoeuvre may be associated with intraocular haemorrhage and dislocation of the lens, while the sustained handgrip test ideally requires a handgrip dynamometer and continuous BP recording, which often is not available in resource-poor settings. Both tests require good communication and depend on the patient's cooperation.

In our test battery, we added resting HR and postural changes in DBP — two tests that are suitable for resource-poor circumstances — to the more commonly used tests of HR variation in response to deep breathing, HR response to standing, and postural changes in SBP. Reduced parasympathetic activity causes resting tachycardia, and this test is therefore associated with cardiovascular autonomic failure. Postural changes in SBP and DBP are included in the criteria for defining orthostatic hypotension by the Consensus Committee of the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology. In autonomic function test batteries, the postural change in SBP is usually included, while postural change in DBP is used less commonly.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^115f5hXG]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

If standard orthostatic blood pressure testing does not reveal orthostatic hypotension (OH) in an at-risk individual with unexplained postural symptoms, falls, or syncope, then any of the following are appropriate as next steps:

- **Extended at-home blood pressure monitoring**: Results recorded by the patient or caregiver.
- **24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring**: The patient can annotate times when supine or standing to determine a typical range of blood pressures during the day and, with patient annotation of position, help to understand fluctuations.
- **Autonomic function tests**: Some individuals may develop delayed OH later than 3 minutes of standing, which can be identified with prolonged standing blood pressures or prolonged tilt table testing (HUT).

The specialized tests described below are considered by the panel to be beyond the scope of many primary care clinicians and usually require referral to a center specializing in autonomic disorders. Specialized tests for a definitive diagnosis of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) include autonomic reflex testing, which encompasses:

- **Heart rate variability to paced breathing**
- **Heart rate and blood pressure response to a Valsalva maneuver**
- **Continuous blood pressure response to a prolonged HUT**

Other tests used to help diagnose nOH may include plasma fractionated catecholamine levels and/or sudomotor function testing. These specialized tests may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of nOH by demonstrating baroreflex dysfunction based on HUT testing with beat-to-beat blood pressure measurement.

### Quantitative studies of autonomic function [^113cTiJ2]. Muscle & Nerve (2006). Low credibility.

Dysfunction of the peripheral and central autonomic nervous system is common in many neurological and general medical diseases. The quantitative assessment of sympathetic and parasympathetic function is essential to confirm the diagnosis of autonomic failure, to provide the basis for follow-up examinations, and potentially to monitor successful treatment. Various procedures have been described as useful tools to quantify autonomic dysfunction. The most important tests evaluate cardiovascular and sudomotor autonomic function.

In this review, we therefore focus on standard tests of cardiovascular and sudomotor function such as heart-rate variability at rest and during deep breathing, active standing, the Valsalva maneuver, and on the sympathetic skin response. These tests are widely used for routine clinical evaluation in patients with peripheral neuropathies. Refined methods of studying heart-rate variability, baroreflex testing, and detailed measures of sweat output are mostly used for research purposes.

In this context, we describe the spectral analysis of slow modulation of heart rate or blood pressure, reflecting sympathetic and parasympathetic influences, and consider various approaches to baroreflex testing, the thermoregulatory sweat test, and the quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test. Finally, we discuss microneurography as a technique of direct recording of muscle sympathetic nerve activity.

### Autonomic dysfunction in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy [^116eTcDB]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

The autonomic deficits in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) have not been adequately quantitated. The Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS) is a validated instrument for laboratory quantitation of autonomic failure derived from standard autonomic reflex tests. We characterized dysautonomia in CIDP using CASS.

- **Methods**: Autonomic function was retrospectively analyzed in 47 patients meeting CIDP criteria. CASS ranges from 0 (normal) to 10 (pandysautonomia), reflecting the summation of sudomotor (0–3), cardiovagal (0–3), and adrenergic (0–4) subscores. The severity of neurologic deficits was measured with the Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS). The degree of small fiber involvement was assessed with quantitative sensation testing. A thermoregulatory sweat test (TST) was available in 8 patients.

- **Results**: Patients (25 men) were middle-aged (45.0 ± 14.9 years) with longstanding CIDP (3.5 ± 4.3 years) of moderate severity (NIS, 46.5 ± 32.7). Autonomic symptoms were uncommon, mainly gastrointestinal (9/47; 19%) and genitourinary (8/47; 17%). Autonomic deficits (CASS ≥ 1) were frequent (22/47; 47%) but very mild (CASS, 0.8 ± 0.9; CASS ≤ 3, all cases). Deficits were predominantly sudomotor (16/47; 34%) and cardiovagal (10/47; 21%) with relative adrenergic sparing (4/47; 9%). TST was abnormal in 5 of 8 patients (anhidrosis range, 2%-59%). Sudomotor impairment was predominantly distal and postganglionic. Somatic deficits (disease duration, severity, small fiber deficits) did not predict the presence of autonomic deficits.

- **Conclusion**: Our data characterize the autonomic dysfunction in CIDP, revealing that autonomic deficits are frequently mild and occur independently of somatic neuropathy severity.

### Autonomic dysfunction in peripheral nerve disease [^1139PUZq]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

Autonomic neuropathies are inherited or acquired neuropathies in which autonomic nerve fibers are selectively or disproportionately affected. Generally, sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers are both affected, but there are exceptions. Acquired cases can be autoimmune — due to diabetes, amyloidosis, drugs, or toxins — or idiopathic. Autoimmune autonomic neuropathy is often subacute, sometimes associated with a neoplasm, and linked with high titers of antibodies to the ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in about half of the severe cases. The molecular basis of inherited autonomic neuropathies is better understood, including recent identification of the loci and genes of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies types I, III, and IV. The inherited amyloid neuropathies are due to mutations of three proteins: transthyretin, apolipoprotein A1, and gelsolin. Non-invasive autonomic testing complements clinical and electrophysiological characterization of these neuropathies.

### Autonomic nervous system dysfunction in advanced cancer [^1144fxUN]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) innervates every organ in the body and is largely involuntary. There have been reports of autonomic dysfunction in cancer patients, but most are case reports. There are suggestions that this abnormality may be common in advanced cancer. Inpatients and outpatients with advanced cancer were enrolled. Patients were excluded if they had a previous diagnosis of a disease associated with ANS abnormalities or had taken or were taking drugs affecting the ANS. Autonomic function was evaluated using five bedside cardiovascular tests:

1. Heart rate response to deep breathing
2. Heart rate response to standing
3. Heart rate response to the Valsalva maneuver
4. Blood pressure response to standing
5. Blood pressure response to static exercise

Each test result was scored according to a validated scale of 0, 0.5, or 1. The individual scores were added together, and each patient received a dysfunction score: none (0–1), mild (1.5–2), moderate (2.5–3), or severe (3.5–5). Twenty-eight men and 22 women participated, with a median age of 64 years. The median ECOG performance status was 2. Lung and prostate cancer were the most common (N = 9, 5). Two hundred forty-five tests were performed; 86 (35%) individual tests were normal or borderline. Composite dysfunction scores were calculated, and all participants had a score consistent with abnormality. The median number of symptoms was 6 (range 1–15). Twenty-eight participants rated at least one symptom as severe (median 2, range 0–5), but symptoms did not correlate with test abnormalities.

### Clinical autonomic nervous system laboratories in Europe: A joint survey of the European Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Autonomic Societies [^113m6qgM]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Health disparities, defined as differences in health and healthcare among different groups of people, can affect individuals with any disease, including neurological disorders. The term "neurodisparity" has been used to highlight this inequity, which has existed across a range of neurological conditions for decades, both in the United States and Europe. In order to minimize neurodisparities, neurology stakeholders must first recognize differences in the availability of neurological care and then act accordingly. A significant example of neurodisparity in Europe is observed in access to treatment and physical rehabilitation for people with multiple sclerosis, where geographical location determines both access to and the type of treatment provided.

Similarly, our survey identified neurodisparity in the availability of ANS services across Europe. Laboratories were more frequent in North/West Europe compared to South/East/Greater Europe. This indicates that geographical factors are particularly relevant in producing neurodisparity in Europe. However, additional factors must be considered when examining a wider European context, such as differences in population density among European regions, reimbursement policies for ANS services in each country, and the historical autonomic background of some countries.

- **Organizational differences**: We also observed interesting organizational differences among countries. Some, such as the United Kingdom and Croatia, have a centralized model with one or two high‐volume centers per country. Others, such as the Netherlands, Italy, Austria, France, and Germany, adopt different organizational structures.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^114LYqVk]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Autonomic function testing was performed to determine whether the orthostatic hypotension (OH) was neurogenic in origin. Tilt table testing revealed a blood pressure (BP) drop from 112/68 mm Hg (heart rate [HR], 74 bpm) after 6 minutes in the supine position to 76/60 mm Hg (83 bpm) within 2 minutes of tilt to the 80° head-up position. This BP drop was accompanied by dizziness and weakness at 2 minutes of tilt and presyncope at 4 minutes of tilt. Continuous recording with transcranial Doppler during tilt testing indicated no changes in mean cerebral blood flow.

ECG tracings during the HR with deep breathing test (paced breathing at six breaths per minute) showed an expiration/inhalation ratio of 1.02, which is abnormal for the patient's age and sex, indicating depressed baseline autonomic tone and decreased vagal tone. Valsalva testing (measured at 40 mm Hg) revealed a Valsalva ratio of 1.15, which is also abnormal for the patient's age and sex. Taken together, the results of autonomic testing were consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) for this patient.

### Treatment of dysautonomia in extrapyramidal disorders [^1155SMeX]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Although extrapyramidal diseases are commonly thought to solely affect the motor system, non-motor symptoms such as behavioral abnormalities, dysautonomia, sleep disturbances, and sensory dysfunctions are also frequently observed. Autonomic dysfunction is an important clinical component of extrapyramidal disease, but it is often not formally assessed and thus frequently misdiagnosed. Symptoms of autonomic dysfunction can impact quality of life more significantly than motor symptoms. Appropriate symptom-oriented diagnosis and symptomatic treatment, as part of an interdisciplinary approach, can greatly benefit the patient. This review provides a limited overview of the treatment of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, and sudomotor autonomic dysfunction in various extrapyramidal syndromes.

### Postural tachycardia syndrome — current experience and concepts [^114VvGBj]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) is a poorly understood but important cause of orthostatic intolerance resulting from cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. It is distinct from the syndromes of autonomic failure usually associated with orthostatic hypotension, such as pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. Individuals affected by PoTS are mainly young (aged between 15 and 40 years) and predominantly female. Symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and occasionally syncope mainly occur when the patient is standing upright and are often relieved by sitting or lying flat. Common stimuli in daily life, including modest exertion, food ingestion, and heat, are now recognized to exacerbate the symptoms.

The onset of the syndrome can be linked to infection, trauma, surgery, or stress. PoTS can be associated with various other disorders, particularly joint hypermobility syndrome (also known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type, formerly termed Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III). This review describes the characteristics and neuroepidemiology of PoTS and outlines possible pathophysiological mechanisms of this syndrome, as well as investigational treatments.

### Heterogeneous pattern of autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease [^113CdjrH]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Dysautonomic symptoms are frequent non-motor complaints in patients with Parkinson's disease. Numerous neuropathological studies have shown that Lewy bodies and neurites, the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease, are widely distributed throughout the peripheral autonomic nervous systems and across end organs. However, few investigations integrally explored the symptoms and physiology of dysautonomia in Parkinson's disease. We, therefore, performed a comprehensive evaluation of the autonomic function in a prospective group of 45 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

- **Autonomic components**: Pupillomotor, tear, salivary, cardiovascular, digestive, urinary, sexual, sudomotor functions, and skin sensitivity were evaluated using questionnaires and functional tests. Skin biopsy was performed for intraepidermal nerve fibre density quantification. In addition, all patients underwent polysomnography and a complete neuropsychological and neurological assessment. The analysis association of autonomic components showed that dysautonomic signs and symptoms were heterogeneously distributed among patients.

- **Skin denervation**: Assessed by intraepidermal nerve fibre density quantification, it was only associated with quantitative thermal sensory testing (OR = 12.0, p = 0.02), constipation (OR = 5.5, p = 0.01), and ocular dryness symptoms (OR = 8.29, p = 0.04).

- **Cognitive alteration**: It was associated with cardiovascular symptoms (OR = 4.33, p = 0.03) and dysfunction (OR = 5.83, p = 0.02) as well as with constipation (OR = 5.38, p = 0.02).

Axial motor impairment and rapid eye movement (REM) disorders were noted in some patients, indicating a complex and heterogeneous presentation of autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.

### Multiple system atrophy: An update and emerging directions of biomarkers and clinical trials [^115AwTkh]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction (dysautonomia), parkinsonism, and cerebellar syndrome are essential clinical characteristics listed in the new criteria. Autonomic dysfunction significantly impacts blood pressure and bladder control. The presence and severity of orthostatic hypotension (OH) can be determined by cardiovascular autonomic function tests that measure supine and standing blood pressure and changes in heart rate. Continuous blood pressure monitoring and head-up tilt (HUT) testing provide additional information and help differentiate multiple system atrophy (MSA) from similar diseases.

Although autonomic tests regarding post-void residual (PVR) or HUT are easily performed and reported to be useful in diagnosing MSA, normal cardiac sympathetic imaging (123 I-MIBG-scintigraphy) also benefits the diagnosis of MSA and even distinguishes Parkinson's disease (PD) from MSA patients. As cardiac sympathetic postganglionic denervation distinguishes PD from MSA patients with intact innervation, the radiolabeled noradrenaline analog 123 I-MIBG may assist in distinguishing MSA from PD. MSA patients exhibit preserved tracer uptake, whereas PD patients exhibit reduced tracer uptake. Furthermore, a supine plasma noradrenaline level > 100 pg/ml associated with neurogenic OH might support the diagnosis of MSA.

Taken together, imaging biomarker 123 I-MIBG and plasma biomarker noradrenaline level may support the diagnosis of MSA before the appearance of severe autonomic dysfunction and motor disability. In addition, an elevated PVR volume (> 100 ml) is the most specific indicator of bladder impairment in MSA, which can be detected by urodynamic testing or post-void residual measurement.

### Clinical autonomic nervous system laboratories in Europe: A joint survey of the European Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Autonomic Societies [^115Kqt7S]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Disorders of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are common conditions, but it is unclear whether access to ANS healthcare provision is homogeneous across European countries. The aim of this study was to identify neurology-driven or interdisciplinary clinical ANS laboratories in Europe, describe their characteristics, and explore regional differences.

We contacted the European national ANS and neurological societies, as well as members of our professional network, to identify clinical ANS laboratories in each country and invite them to answer a web-based survey.

We identified 84 laboratories in 22 countries, and 46 (55%) answered the survey. All laboratories perform cardiovascular autonomic function tests, and 83% also perform sweat tests. Testing for catecholamines and autoantibodies is performed in 63% and 56% of laboratories, respectively, with epidermal nerve fiber density analysis in 63%. Each laboratory is staffed by a median of two consultants, one resident, one technician, and one nurse. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of head-up tilt tests/laboratory/year is 105 (49–251). Reflex syncope and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension are the most frequently diagnosed cardiovascular ANS disorders. Thirty-five centers (76%) have an ANS outpatient clinic, with a median (IQR) of 200 (100–360) outpatient visits/year; 42 centers (91%) also offer inpatient care (median 20 [IQR 4–110] inpatient stays/year). Forty-one laboratories (89%) are involved in research activities. We observed a significant difference in the geographical distribution of these laboratories across Europe.

### Clinical autonomic nervous system laboratories in Europe: A joint survey of the European Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Autonomic Societies [^11377MPW]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

In 2005, the ANS panel of the European Federation of Neurological Societies conducted a survey on the distribution of ANS laboratories in Europe. The survey requested information on applied methods and equipment, existence of own normative data, commercial versus self-developed systems, and research and educational activities. Although this survey included all types of ANS laboratories (such as cardiological and endocrinological) and not only neurologically oriented ones, it highlighted a high heterogeneity in ANS services across Europe. More importantly, it revealed large diversities in the techniques used to investigate ANS disorders, underlining an unmet need for ANS testing standards across European countries.

Recently, significant efforts have been made to standardize the clinical assessment of the ANS. Consensus definitions have been published to diagnose critical aspects of cardiovascular autonomic failure, such as orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension. The European Federation of Autonomic Societies (EFAS), endorsed by the American Autonomic Society (AAS) and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN), provided recommendations on the use of tilt table testing in diagnosing disorders that may cause transient loss of consciousness. The AAS and the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN) released definitions of autonomic disorders and methodological guidance for appropriate autonomic function testing. The latter consensus statement emphasized the importance of evaluating the ANS with screening batteries encompassing tests of sympathetic adrenergic.

### The clinical approach to autonomic failure in neurological disorders [^115fYbXB]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Central or peripheral neurological disorders can manifest with autonomic failure or autonomic hyperactivity, which may affect the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and/or enteric nervous systems. Disorders causing autonomic failure can be classified according to the presence or absence of associated neurological manifestations, such as peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonism, and their temporal profile — acute or subacute, chronic progressive, static, or episodic. A systematic approach allows focused evaluation to detect treatable, potentially disabling, or life-threatening conditions.

Subacute isolated autonomic failure affecting sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous system function, in various combinations, occurs in autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, which might be the first manifestation of an underlying neoplasm. Autonomic failure can be an important feature of several types of peripheral neuropathy, including sensorimotor peripheral neuropathies, sensory ganglionopathy, and distal painful peripheral neuropathies. Progressive autonomic failure occurs in neurodegenerative synucleinopathies such as multiple system atrophy and Lewy body disorders. Autonomic failure may also occur in hereditary leukoencephalopathies or prion disorders.

This review outlines the clinical approach to patients with generalized autonomic failure, focusing predominantly on classification and diagnosis, but also touching briefly on treatment and management.

### Cardiovascular autonomic testing in extrapyramidal disorders [^114FFzns]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Various diagnostic tests are available to demonstrate autonomic failure in extrapyramidal disease. Autonomic function tests can identify parasympathetic and sympathetic dysfunction. While specialized tests are only available in autonomic labs, routine tests, such as 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements, can be broadly used in clinical practice as screening tests. In this review, we briefly introduce functional cardiovascular autonomic testing and propose a workup plan for patients with extrapyramidal disease. In all patients with extrapyramidal disease, screening for autonomic dysfunction should be performed. In the case of pathological findings, detailed autonomic testing should be considered, with repeated measurements at follow-up visits.

### Dysautonomias: Clinical disorders of the autonomic nervous system [^113vL47U]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The term "dysautonomia" refers to a change in autonomic nervous system function that adversely affects health. The changes range from transient, occasional episodes of neurally mediated hypotension to progressive neurodegenerative diseases; from disorders in which altered autonomic function plays a primary pathophysiologic role to disorders in which it worsens an independent pathologic state; and from mechanistically straightforward to mysterious and controversial entities.

In chronic autonomic failure (such as pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, or autonomic failure in Parkinson's disease), orthostatic hypotension reflects sympathetic neurocirculatory failure from sympathetic denervation or deranged reflexive regulation of sympathetic outflows. Chronic orthostatic intolerance associated with postural tachycardia can arise from cardiac sympathetic activation after "patchy" autonomic impairment, blood volume depletion, or, as highlighted, from a primary abnormality that augments the delivery of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine to its receptors in the heart. Increased sympathetic nerve traffic to the heart and kidneys seems to occur as essential hypertension develops. Acute panic can evoke coronary spasm that is associated with sympathoneural and adrenomedullary excitation. In congestive heart failure, compensatory cardiac sympathetic activation may chronically worsen myocardial function, which rationalizes treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blockers. A high frequency of positive results on tilt-table testing has confirmed an association between dysautonomias and various clinical presentations.

### Pediatric autonomic testing: Retrospective review of a large series [^112FvnHQ]. Clinical Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To describe the reasons for referral, autonomic diagnoses, test results, and patient management in a large pediatric population referred for testing for an autonomic disorder.

- **Design**: The authors reviewed autonomic testing data and medical records for patients aged 18 years and younger who underwent testing between 1993 and 2007 and who had adequate clinical data. The relevance of test results to clinical symptoms was ranked on a 3-point scale. Treatments were noted, and their benefit was ranked on a 5-point scale.

- **Results**: Among 142 pediatric patients identified, postural tachycardia syndrome was most common (71%) while orthostatic hypotension was rare (5%). Testing provided relevant information regarding the patient's symptoms in 88% of the cases. Beta-blockers were the most commonly prescribed medication (59%); 73% improved.

- **Conclusions**: Postural tachycardia syndrome was common in this large pediatric population, whereas orthostatic hypotension was infrequent. The symptomatic improvement in the majority bears an unclear relationship to treatment. Prospective studies are needed.

### Dysautonomia in anti-Hu paraneoplastic neurological syndromes [^115R1Bpj]. Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Dysautonomia has been associated with paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS)-related mortality in anti-Hu PNS, but its frequency and spectrum remain ill-defined. This study describes anti-Hu patients with dysautonomia, estimates its frequency, and compares them to patients without dysautonomia.

- **Methods**: Patients with anti-Hu antibodies diagnosed in the study center (1990–2022) were retrospectively reviewed; those with autonomic signs and symptoms were identified.

- **Results**: Among 477 anti-Hu patients, 126 (26%) had dysautonomia, with it being the only PNS manifestation in 7 (6%) of these patients. Manifestations included gastrointestinal (82/126, 65%), cardiovascular (64/126, 51%), urogenital (24/126, 19%), pupillomotor/secretomotor (each 11/126, 9%), and central hypoventilation (10/126, 8%).

	- Patients with isolated CNS involvement less frequently had gastrointestinal dysautonomia than those with peripheral (alone or combined with CNS) involvement (7/23, 30% vs. 31/44, 70% vs. 37/52, 71%; P = 0.002), while they more frequently exhibited central hypoventilation (7/23, 30% vs. 1/44, 2.3% vs. 2/52, 4%; P < 0.001) and/or cardiovascular alterations (18/23, 78% vs. 20/44, 45% vs. 26/52, 50%; P = 0.055).

	- Median [95% CI] overall survival was not significantly different between patients with (37 [17; 91] months) or without dysautonomia (28 [22; 39] months; P = 0.78). Cardiovascular dysautonomia (HR: 1.57, 95% CI [1.05; 2.36]; P = 0.030) and central hypoventilation (HR: 3.51, 95% CI [1.54; 8.01]; P = 0.003) were associated with a higher risk of death, whereas secretomotor dysautonomia was linked to a lower risk (HR: 0.28, 95% CI [0.09; 0.89]; P = 0.032).

### Cardiac autonomic neuropathy in obesity, the metabolic syndrome and prediabetes: A narrative review [^115MARvY]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Clinical examination signs suggesting the presence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) include a resting tachycardia, exercise intolerance, and a postural blood pressure drop of at least 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure or at least 10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure within 3 minutes of standing. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is a useful tool that can be offered to patients to help demonstrate a loss of the normal blood pressure circadian rhythm. This should prompt formal testing for CAN with cardiovascular reflex tests.

Objective evidence of CAN is defined and assessed using standard bedside cardiovascular reflex tests and heart rate variation (HRV). The diagnosis of CAN should be based on the results of a battery of tests rather than a single result, as no one test is superior. Cardiovascular reflex tests are considered the gold standard because they are reproducible, safe, sensitive, specific, and correlate with peripheral neuropathy. Different protocols of cardiovascular reflex testing can be used based on the responses of the heart rate (measured by the R–R interval on an electrocardiogram) and blood pressure to a variety of stimuli. Spectral analysis of HRV uses a 10-minute continuous resting ECG recording, which should occur at the start of the tests to avoid any bias. Advanced computer processing produces the power spectrum.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^113D1zKx]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of syncope, collapse, and fluctuating blood pressure (BP). His medications included midodrine (10 mg, three times per day) and fludrocortisone (0.1 mg, two times per day), but neither treatment afforded symptomatic relief. Autonomic testing was performed. Head-up tilt table testing revealed a supine BP of 112/68 mm Hg (heart rate, 74 beats per minute (bpm)) after 6 minutes, which dropped to 76/60 mm Hg (83 bpm) within 2 minutes of an 80° head-up tilt. Findings from a heart rate with deep breathing test and a Valsalva test were consistent with autonomic dysfunction. The patient was diagnosed with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and treated with droxidopa (100 mg, two times per day; titrated to 100 mg, one time per day). After initiating treatment with droxidopa, the patient no longer reported losing consciousness on standing and experienced improvement in activities of daily living. These improvements were maintained through 1 year of follow-up.

### Autonomic dysfunction in chronic persistent dizziness [^114hMgBj]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate autonomic dysfunction in patients with chronic persistent dizziness using standardized autonomic function tests.

The methods involved the prospective recruitment of 18 patients with chronic persistent dizziness after extensive investigations excluded other causes. A standardized battery of autonomic tests was performed, including the head-up tilt (HUT) test, Valsalva maneuver (VM), and heart rate (HR) response to deep breathing.

Results indicated that approximately eighty percent of the patients showed at least one abnormality in autonomic tests. Two patterns of autonomic abnormality were identified:

- **Sympathetic failure**: This included an abnormal decrease in blood pressure (BP) during the HUT test or abnormal sympathetic indices related to BP recovery during late phase II and phase IV during VM.
- **Sympathetic hyperactivity**: This included an abnormal increase in HR response during the HUT test or an exaggerated phase IV response, manifesting increased β-adrenergic tone during VM.

In conclusion, autonomic dysfunction is frequently found in patients with chronic persistent dizziness, even after excluding other causes through extensive investigations. Sympathetic failure or hyperactivity may be postulated as potential causes of chronic persistent dizziness. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of autonomic dysfunction in patients with chronic dizziness, even if the dizziness is persistent rather than orthostatic.

### Autonomic nervous system function in chronic hypotension associated with Bartter and Gitelman syndromes [^111Wm8qk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Autonomic nervous system dysfunction plays a major role in the decrease in blood pressure (BP) associated with orthostatic hypotension and syncope. The clinical picture of Bartter and Gitelman syndromes includes reduced extracellular fluid volume and normotension or hypotension, but no study has explored the autonomic nervous system status in patients with hypotensive episodes associated with these diseases. We tested sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system function in four patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndromes with chronic hypotension. Each patient underwent a battery of autonomic reflex tests, including BP and heart rate response to orthostatism, the Valsalva maneuver, the cold-pressor test, the hand-grip test, and deep breathing. Plasma catecholamines also were measured. BP was monitored during tests by means of continuous noninvasive finger BP recording.

Orthostatic hypotension was observed in one patient who experienced syncope episodes. The Valsalva ratio ranged from 1.21 to 1.61. During the cold-pressor test, the range of systolic and diastolic BP increases were 8 to 31 mm Hg and 6 to 24 mm Hg, respectively. During the hand-grip test, systolic and diastolic BP increases ranged from 10 to 39 mm Hg and 8 to 32 mm Hg, respectively. During hyperventilation, the difference between the highest and lowest heart rates was 12 or more beats per minute in all patients. Patients' plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased during standing.

Our preliminary results suggest that chronic hypotension in patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndromes is not associated with sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system dysfunction.

### Dysautonomia following COVID-19 is not associated with subjective limitations or symptoms but is associated with objective functional limitations [^111DRXh5]. Heart Rhythm (2022). Low credibility.

Individuals who contract coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can suffer from persistent and debilitating symptoms long after the initial acute illness. Heart rate (HR) profiles determined during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and delivered as part of a post-COVID recovery service may provide insight into the presence and impact of dysautonomia on functional ability.

- **Objective**: Using an active, working-age, post-COVID-19 population, the purpose of this study was to (1) determine and characterize any association between subjective symptoms and dysautonomia and (2) identify objective exercise capacity differences between patients classified "with" and those "without" dysautonomia.

- **Methods**: Patients referred to a post-COVID-19 service underwent comprehensive clinical assessment, including self-reported symptoms, CPET, and secondary care investigations when indicated. Resting HR > 75 bpm, HR increase with exercise.05). Patients with dysautonomia demonstrated objective functional limitations with significantly reduced work rate (219 ± 37 W vs. 253 ± 52 W; P < .001) and peak oxygen consumption (V̇o 2: 30.6 ± 5.5 mL/kg/min vs. 35.8 ± 7.6 mL/kg/min; P < .001).

### Differential impact of individual autonomic domains on clinical outcomes in Parkinson's disease [^112s4S4w]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

In summary, our results showed that among autonomic domains, cardiovascular dysautonomia was associated with a higher risk of developing disability milestones and worse progression of functional impairment and HRQoL over the course of 5 years. Whether cardiovascular dysautonomia directly causes worse outcomes in PD or is only one of the features of a multifaceted malignant phenotype remains a major knowledge gap. To clarify these hypotheses, and to determine the potential role of delaying, or even preventing, the development of dementia and other disability milestones by treating cardiovascular dysautonomia, additional prospective research in larger multicentric cohorts is needed.

### Autonomic dysfunction presenting as orthostatic intolerance in patients suffering from mitochondrial cytopathy [^111USdxb]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Disturbances in autonomic nervous system function have been reported to occur in patients suffering from mitochondrial cytopathies. However, there is a paucity of literature on the occurrence of orthostatic intolerance (OI) in these patients. We report on a series of patients diagnosed with mitochondrial cytopathy who developed features of autonomic dysfunction in the form of OI.

- **Methods**: This was a single-center report on a series of six patients who were followed in our clinic for orthostatic intolerance. All of these patients had a diagnosis of mitochondrial cytopathy based on muscle biopsy and were being followed at a center specializing in the treatment of mitochondrial disorders. This study was approved by our local institutional review board. Each of the patients suffered from symptoms of fatigue, palpitations, near syncope, and syncope. The diagnosis of OI was confirmed by a head-up tilt test. Collected data included demographic information, presenting symptoms, laboratory data, tilt-table response, and treatment outcomes.

- **Results**: Six patients (three females) were identified for inclusion in this report. The mean age of the group was 48 ± 8 years (range, 40–60 years). All of these patients underwent head-up tilt table testing and all had a positive response that reproduced their clinical symptoms. Among those with an abnormal tilt-table pattern, one had a neurocardiogenic response, one had a dysautonomic response, and four had a postural orthostatic tachycardia response. All but one patient reported marked symptom relief with pharmacotherapy.

### Management of hypertension in the setting of autonomic failure: A pathophysiological approach [^115dZAAz]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

We discuss two cases presenting clinically with disabling orthostatic hypotension and severe supine hypertension. This is a common presentation of autonomic failure, and one that challenges conventional treatment. Clinical findings of isolated autonomic failure were the most prominent manifestation in case 1, whereas a movement disorder was the key finding in case 2. The differential diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic hypotension are discussed from a pathophysiological approach. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of disorders of the autonomic nervous system is fundamental for the effective management of these patients and provides insight into more common disorders, such as essential hypertension.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^111JYUVe]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). High credibility.

EFNS 2006 guidelines recommend several diagnostic investigations for orthostatic hypotension. The initial evaluation of patients with suspected orthostatic hypotension (OH) should include:

- **Structured history taking**: A comprehensive review of the patient's medical history.
- **Detailed physical examination**: A thorough examination to detect any physical signs associated with OH.
- **Supine and upright BP measurements**: Blood pressure (BP) should be measured while the patient is supine and upright to assess postural changes.
- **12-lead ECG recording**: An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be recorded to check for underlying cardiac conditions.
- **Active standing or head-up tilt tests**: These should ideally be conducted with continuous assessment of BP and heart rate (HR) for 3 minutes.

### Parkinson's disease outside the brain: Targeting the autonomic nervous system [^117NsBRQ]. The Lancet Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with Parkinson's disease present with signs and symptoms of dysregulation of the peripheral autonomic nervous system that can even precede motor deficits. This dysregulation might reflect early pathology and therefore could be targeted for the development of prodromal or diagnostic biomarkers. Only a few objective clinical tests assess disease progression and are used to evaluate the entire spectrum of autonomic dysregulation in patients with Parkinson's disease.

However, results from epidemiological studies and findings from new animal models suggest that the dysfunctional autonomic nervous system is a probable route by which Parkinson's disease pathology can spread both to and from the CNS. The autonomic innervation of the gut, heart, and skin is affected by α-synuclein pathology in the early stages of the disease and might initiate α-synuclein spread via the autonomic connectome to the CNS.

The development of easy-to-use and reliable clinical tests of autonomic nervous system function seems crucial for early diagnosis, and for developing strategies to stop or prevent neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.

### High incidence of autonomic dysfunction and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in patients with long COVID: Implications for management and health care planning [^111gJBNc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction, including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), has been reported in individuals with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). However, the degree of dysautonomia in PASC has not been compared to those with POTS and healthy controls.

- **Methods**: All participants were prospectively enrolled between August 5, 2021, and October 31, 2022. Autonomic testing included beat-to-beat hemodynamic monitoring to assess respiratory sinus arrhythmia, Valsalva ratio, and orthostatic changes during a 10-minute active standing test, as well as sudomotor assessment. The Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (COMPASS-31) was used to assess symptoms, and the EuroQuol 5-Dimension survey (EQ-5D-5L) was used to assess health-related quality of life (HrQoL) measures.

- **Results**: A total of 99 participants (n = 33 PASC, n = 33 POTS, and n = 33 healthy controls; median age 32 years, 85.9% females) were included. Compared with healthy controls, the PASC and POTS cohorts demonstrated significantly reduced respiratory sinus arrhythmia (P < .001), greater heart rate increase during a 10-minute active standing test (P < .001), greater burden of autonomic dysfunction evidenced by higher COMPASS-31 scores across all subdomains (all P < .001), poor HrQoL across all EQ-5D-5L domains (all P < .001), lower median EuroQol-visual analogue scale (P < .001), and lower utility scores (P < .001). The majority (79%) of those with PASC met the internationally established criteria for POTS.

- **Conclusion**: The prevalence of autonomic symptomology for POTS was high in those with PASC.
