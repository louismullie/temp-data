## Question

When do you recommend ablations for atrial flutter?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to recommend catheter ablation for atrial flutter. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing typical (cavotricuspid isthmus–dependent) from atypical (non–CTI-dependent) flutter. Then, I should verify symptomatic status and hemodynamic impact. Next, I will review guideline-backed indications for ablation in typical flutter, including first-line scenarios and special contexts like antiarrhythmic-induced flutter. After that, I need to examine indications for atypical flutter and the role of prior antiarrhythmic failure. Finally, I should confirm anticoagulation strategy, post-ablation AF surveillance, and procedural risks and success rates before synthesizing a practical recommendation framework.

> Let me first confirm the classification because management hinges on it. Typical atrial flutter is CTI-dependent with a macroreentrant circuit around the tricuspid annulus and isthmus, whereas atypical flutter is non–CTI-dependent and often related to scar or prior ablation; distinguishing these drives both ablation strategy and expected success, so I need to ensure the ECG and, when needed, electrophysiology mapping support this distinction before recommending ablation [^8e971134] [^61b7300d].

> Next, I should review symptom status and hemodynamics. Symptomatic patients with palpitations, dyspnea, chest discomfort, fatigue, or presyncope are prime candidates for rhythm-control strategies, and ablation is particularly attractive when symptoms are recurrent or refractory to rate control; I should also screen for tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy, because in that scenario ablation can reverse LV dysfunction and is strongly favored [^8e971134] [^79329858] [^ee36b44d].

> For typical CTI-dependent flutter, I need to check whether ablation is first-line. The ESC recommends considering ablation even after the first symptomatic episode, and contemporary ACC/AHA/ACCP guidance gives ablation a Class 1 recommendation to improve symptoms in symptomatic or clinically significant flutter; Canadian guidance similarly supports ablation as a reasonable alternative to drugs, and meta-analytic data show high acute success around 90–92% with low complication rates near 2.6%, reinforcing ablation as an excellent upfront option when symptoms warrant rhythm control [^ba96d3b8] [^ac7342bb] [^6e6b73aa] [^9178e421] [^c20c9eb9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about asymptomatic patients. I initially thought ablation is never indicated if asymptomatic, but wait, I should verify the nuance. ACC/AHA/HRS allows that ablation may be reasonable in selected asymptomatic patients with recurrent typical flutter, balancing the high success and low risk against the lack of symptom relief; however, I need to ensure shared decision-making and consider AF risk, because asymptomatic flutter often coexists with or heralds AF, which changes anticoagulation planning [^024dcf0e] [^621a4f9b] [^1e3cf536].

> I will now examine special contexts where ablation is particularly compelling. If flutter is provoked by flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone used for AF, CTI ablation is recommended to prevent recurrent flutter while allowing continuation of AF therapy; likewise, if flutter is documented or inducible at the time of AF ablation, adding CTI ablation reduces future flutter and is advised; and in patients with persistent flutter or tachycardiomyopathy, ablation is favored to restore rhythm and improve ventricular function [^7378b9e4] [^b99d19dc] [^5f9f3b41] [^79329858] [^ee36b44d].

> For atypical non–CTI-dependent flutter, I should confirm that ablation is generally reserved after failure of at least one antiarrhythmic drug, given lower success and more complex mapping; ESC guidance supports ablation in experienced centers for symptomatic, recurrent non–CTI flutter after drug failure, and ACC/AHA/HRS aligns with ablation after failure of at least one agent, with success dependent on detailed activation and entrainment mapping [^6b565e62] [^d59d8e2a] [^61b7300d].

> But wait, what about anticoagulation and post-ablation AF surveillance; I need to ensure I don't miss this. Anticoagulation for flutter follows AF risk schemes, and after successful CTI ablation, continue anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks and then tailor long-term therapy to thromboembolic risk; importantly, new-onset AF occurs in roughly 16–82% over time, higher with prior AF, so I should arrange monitoring to detect silent AF in high-risk patients and consider ongoing anticoagulation if stroke risk is elevated, using ambulatory monitors or implantable devices as appropriate [^5e44052b] [^97aa0407] [^c20c9eb9] [^1ca5102e] [^602f7de0].

> I should double-check procedural risks and expected outcomes to counsel accurately. Typical flutter ablation achieves acute success around 90–97% with single or multiple procedures and a complication rate near 2.6%, while atypical flutter carries lower success and higher recurrence, necessitating experienced operators and realistic expectations; shared decision-making should incorporate these figures alongside the patient's symptoms, comorbidities, and preferences [^9178e421] [^c20c9eb9] [^61b7300d].

> Let me synthesize a practical framework. I recommend ablation for atrial flutter in the following scenarios: typical CTI-dependent flutter with symptomatic recurrences or intolerance to rate-control drugs; a first symptomatic episode of typical flutter when a durable rhythm-control strategy is desired; persistent flutter or tachycardiomyopathy; flutter provoked by antiarrhythmic therapy for AF; and documented or inducible flutter at the time of AF ablation. For atypical flutter, I recommend ablation after failure of at least one antiarrhythmic agent, ideally in experienced centers. Throughout, align anticoagulation with AF risk and plan for post-ablation AF surveillance in high-risk patients [^ba96d3b8] [^ac7342bb] [^8e971134] [^6b565e62] [^5e44052b].

---

I recommend **catheter ablation** for atrial flutter when symptoms are recurrent or refractory despite medical therapy, or when flutter is drug-induced or coexists with atrial fibrillation [^8e971134] [^7378b9e4]. Ablation is also appropriate as **first-line therapy** for symptomatic typical flutter because of its high success (> 90%) and low complication rate (~2.6%) [^9178e421] [^c20c9eb9]. After successful ablation, continue anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks and manage long-term anticoagulation per AF risk, as AF commonly develops after flutter ablation [^5e44052b] [^c20c9eb9].

## Indications for ablation in atrial flutter

### Symptomatic atrial flutter

- **Recurrent symptomatic typical atrial flutter**: Catheter ablation is recommended as first-line therapy due to high success and low risk [^ba96d3b8] [^9178e421].
- **Symptomatic atrial flutter refractory to medical therapy**: Ablation is indicated when rate or rhythm control drugs fail or are not tolerated [^8e971134] [^ccb73fd8].
- **Drug-induced atrial flutter**: Flutter from flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone warrants CTI ablation to prevent recurrence while continuing AF therapy [^7378b9e4] [^b99d19dc].

---

### Asymptomatic atrial flutter

In asymptomatic patients, **recurrent atrial flutter** may be considered for ablation to prevent tachycardiomyopathy or AF progression, though decisions should be individualized [^024dcf0e] [^621a4f9b].

---

### Special considerations

- **Coexisting atrial fibrillation**: Ablation is reasonable when flutter coexists with AF, especially if flutter is documented or inducible during AF ablation [^7378b9e4] [^5f9f3b41].
- **Congenital heart disease**: Ablation is reasonable in adults with congenital heart disease and recurrent flutter [^c0882d61].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **inability to tolerate anticoagulation** during and after the procedure, and **left atrial thrombus** should be excluded before ablation. Precautions include careful patient selection in those with extensive atrial scarring or complex anatomy, and ensuring experienced operators and appropriate facilities [^ff0ec75c] [^0498ae84].

---

## Success rates and complications

Typical flutter ablation has **acute success > 90%** and a complication rate ~2.6% [^9178e421] [^c20c9eb9]. Complications include vascular injury, bleeding, and rare atrial-esophageal fistula; recurrence is ~10–20%, often due to incomplete isthmus block or AF development [^c20c9eb9] [^1e3cf536].

---

## Post-ablation management and follow-up

- **Anticoagulation**: Continue for at least 4 weeks after successful ablation; long-term anticoagulation is guided by AF risk, as AF develops in 16–82% after flutter ablation [^5e44052b] [^c20c9eb9].
- **Monitoring**: Regular ECG or ambulatory monitoring is recommended to detect silent AF or flutter recurrence [^c20c9eb9] [^602f7de0].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Address modifiable risk factors (hypertension, obesity, sleep apnea) to reduce AF risk [^d2cc2b95].

---

## Comparison with medical management

Medical therapy can control symptoms but has **lower efficacy and more side effects** than ablation; ablation improves quality of life, reduces hospitalizations, and is cost-effective long term [^df2d4277] [^79e0e1ba].

---

## Current guidelines summary

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation level** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Symptomatic typical flutter | Class I | Level A |
| Drug-induced flutter | Class I | Level B |
| Asymptomatic recurrent flutter | Class IIa | Level B |
| Non-CTI-dependent flutter after failed AAD | Class I | Level B |

---

Catheter ablation is the **preferred therapy** for symptomatic typical atrial flutter because of its high success and low risk, and is reasonable in selected asymptomatic or drug-induced cases. Post-ablation anticoagulation and monitoring are essential given the high incidence of subsequent AF.

### Key recommendations… [^5c9080f1]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

- Direct oral anticoagulants are recommended over warfarin for AF without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical valve. Warfarin is still recommended for mitral stenosis and mechanical valves.
- Although CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores of 0 for men and 1 for women do not require treatment, scores of 1 for men and 2 for women are indeterminate and anticoagulation may be considered by shared decision-making. Treatment recommendations apply to paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent AF as well as atrial flutter. In this update, the sections on anticoagulation, catheter ablation, and management of AF complicating acute coronary syndrome were modified, and new sections were added outlining weight loss and device detection of AF; however, this summary focuses on the new and revised recommendations for choosing an anticoagulant and new recommendations for preventing stroke via nonpharmacologic options and use of catheter ablation.

Key Recommendations HIGH-QUALITY EVIDENCE Based on high-quality evidence, oral anticoagulants should be prescribed for women with AF and a CHA. Based on new evidence and FDA approval of a new appendage closure system, percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion is an option for patients with AF and a higher risk of stroke who are unable to take anticoagulants for a long duration because of bleeding risk or poor tolerance. Patients treated via this method have fewer hemorrhagic strokes than those treated with warfarin, but with a nonsignificant trend towards more ischemic strokes. For patients with symptomatic AF and heart failure who have decreased left ventricular function, catheter ablation can decrease mortality and hospitalizations linked to heart failure. Evidence indicates that catheter ablation reduces mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure and improves ejection fraction compared with guideline-directed medical therapy alone.

Ablation controls sinus rhythm better than amiodarone. In 2017, the American Academy of Family Physicians published guidelines on AF with the American College of Physicians. These guidelines recommend using the HAS-BLED score to quantify bleeding risk like the ACCP recommendations, but recommend anticoagulant consideration for all patients with CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores of 2 or higher. — Michael Arnold, MD, Editorial Fellow.

### 2012 HRS / EHRA / ECAS expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation: recommendations for patient selection, procedural techniques, patient management and follow-up, definitions, endpoints, and research trial design [^4e2f91df]. Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation — standards for reporting outcomes in clinical trials specify that the primary end point is freedom from AF/flutter/tachycardia off antiarrhythmic therapy, and time to recurrence is acceptable for research but may under-represent benefit; freedom from AF/flutter/tachycardia at various points following ablation should be considered as a secondary endpoint. We recommend that single procedure outcomes be reported in all trials of AF ablation. Consistent monitoring techniques should be employed, and it is critical that an indication of percentage compliance with monitoring requirements be included in every published study of AF ablation. For efficacy reporting, the gold standard should remain freedom from AF/flutter/tachycardia of greater than 30 seconds' duration off all antiarrhythmic drugs, and if a duration of AF greater than 30 seconds is employed, a specific rationale for doing so should be provided. Because Kaplan-Meier analyses may underestimate true effectiveness, it is recommended that other alternative and/or secondary endpoints be reported in clinical trials; we would therefore propose that clinical trials also report AF/flutter/tachycardia at various points following ablation, and another endpoint that should be considered in clinical trials is an assessment of "AF burden".

Left atrial flutter after atrial fibrillation ablation — incidence and clinical context: Left atrial flutter (LAFL) after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is described as common, occurring "between 12% and 50% of patients", yet it is "rarely observed in the context of paroxysmal AF ablation when the procedure is limited to PV". The statement adds that LAFL is "relatively uncommon (< 1%) when the cryoballoon is used for treatment of patients with paroxysmal AF". Risk increases because "the likelihood of developing a LAFL increases markedly in patients with longstanding persistent AF, markedly dilated atria, and where linear ablation strategies are employed", and many patients are highly symptomatic with rate control challenges, "making the performance of another ablation procedure mandatory in many patients".

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation — training volume and supervision guidance states that a clinical competence statement proposed a minimum of 30–50 AF ablation procedures during fellowships, Canadian Guidelines recommend that trainees perform 15–20 complex flutter ablations, and comparisons suggest outcomes are better at centers that have performed more than 100 procedures; trainees intending independent AF ablation might consider additional training if they performed less than 50 AF ablation procedures during training; there is no numeric threshold for competence, but as a guideline experienced electrophysiologists should be supervised when they begin, electrophysiologists should perform several AF ablation procedures per month to remain active, should track outcomes and verify appropriate follow-up, and it would be inappropriate for non-electrophysiologists to consider performing AF ablation.

Clinical response outcomes in the minimum set — treatment and management targets are defined: Three clinical response measures are included in the minimum set and are divided into 'Treatment Response' and 'Overall Management Response'; AF, atrial flutter (AFL), or atrial tachycardia (AT) recurrence and AF progression (paroxysmal to persistent AF) are recommended to capture treatment response for treatments such as catheter ablation, surgical ablation, or antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and thromboembolic events, defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack, and systemic embolism, should be measured to assess clinical response with respect to AF management.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) repeat ablation reporting and efficacy endpoints — trial recommendations and definitions are as follows: It is recommended that all clinical trials report the single procedure efficacy of catheter ablation, with success defined as freedom from symptomatic or asymptomatic AF/atrial flutter (AFL)/atrial tachycardia (AT) of 30 seconds or longer at 12 months postablation; recurrences during the first 3-month blanking period post-AF ablation are not considered a failure, whereas any repeat ablation after the initial procedure is considered a failure of a single-procedure strategy; if a multiprocedure success is the primary endpoint, efficacy should be defined as freedom from AF/AFlutter or tachycardia at 12 months after the final ablation procedure, repeat ablations can be performed at any time following the initial procedure, all procedures are subject to a 3-month post blanking window, and trials should report efficacy at 12 months after the final ablation procedure.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation with concomitant atrial flutter — pharmacological rate control and prophylaxis: a patient treated with atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking drugs whose ventricular rate is well controlled during AF may experience a rise or fall in rate if atrial flutter develops; antiarrhythmic agents such as propafenone or flecainide used to prevent recurrent AF may increase the likelihood of 1:1 AV conduction during atrial flutter, so when these agents are given for prophylaxis against recurrent paroxysmal AF or atrial flutter, AV nodal blocking drugs should be routinely coadministered, with an exception for patients with paroxysmal AF after catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus to prevent atrial flutter.

ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS 2023 — Anticoagulation of typical atrial flutter (AFL): For patients with AFL, anticoagulation therapy is recommended according to the same risk profile used for atrial fibrillation (AF). In patients with AFL who undergo successful cardioversion or ablation resulting in restoration of sinus rhythm, anticoagulation should be continued for at least 4 weeks postprocedure. Patients with typical AFL who have undergone successful cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation and have had AF previously detected before AFL ablation should receive ongoing oral anticoagulation as indicated for AF. Patients with typical AFL who have undergone successful CTI ablation and are deemed to be at high thromboembolic risk, without any known previous history of AF, should receive close follow-up and arrhythmia monitoring to detect silent AF if they are not receiving ongoing anticoagulation in view of significant risk of AF. In patients with typical AFL who have undergone successful CTI ablation without any known previous history of AF who are at high risk for development of AF, it may be reasonable to prescribe long-term anticoagulation if thromboembolic risk assessment suggests high risk (> 2% annual risk) for stroke.

AF catheter ablation — indications and first-line use in atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL): In patients with symptomatic AF in whom antiarrhythmic drugs have been ineffective, contraindicated, not tolerated or not preferred, and continued rhythm control is desired, catheter ablation is useful to improve symptoms (Class 1, Level A). In selected patients (generally younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF in whom rhythm control is desired, catheter ablation is useful as first-line therapy to improve symptoms and reduce progression to persistent AF (Class 1, Level A). In patients with symptomatic or clinically significant AFL, catheter ablation is useful for improving symptoms (Class 1, Level A). In patients who are undergoing ablation for AF, ablation of additional clinically significant supraventricular arrhythmias can be useful to reduce the likelihood of future atrial arrhythmias (Class 2a, Level B-NR). In patients (other than younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF who are being managed with a rhythm-control strategy, catheter ablation as first-line therapy can be useful to improve symptoms (Class 2a, Level B-R).

Atrial flutter ongoing management — Catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) is useful in patients with atrial flutter that is either symptomatic or refractory to pharmacological rate control, and beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are useful to control the ventricular rate in patients with hemodynamically tolerated atrial flutter. Catheter ablation is useful in patients with recurrent symptomatic non–CTI-dependent flutter after failure of at least 1 antiarrhythmic agent, and ongoing management with antithrombotic therapy is recommended in patients with atrial flutter to align with recommended antithrombotic therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). For rhythm maintenance in symptomatic, recurrent atrial flutter, the following drugs can be useful with the drug choice depending on underlying heart disease and comorbidities: amiodarone, dofetilide, or sotalol. Catheter ablation is reasonable in patients with CTI-dependent atrial flutter that occurs as the result of flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone used for treatment of AF, and catheter ablation of the CTI is reasonable in patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF who also have a history of documented clinical or induced CTI-dependent atrial flutter. Catheter ablation is reasonable in patients with recurrent symptomatic non–CTI-dependent flutter as primary therapy, before therapeutic trials of antiarrhythmic drugs, after carefully weighing potential risks and benefits of treatment options; flecainide or propafenone may be considered to maintain sinus rhythm in patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have symptomatic recurrent atrial flutter; and catheter ablation may be reasonable for asymptomatic patients with recurrent atrial flutter.

Atrial flutter (AFL) ablation outcomes and post-procedure management emphasize high acute success but substantial atrial fibrillation (AF) incidence, ongoing anticoagulation by risk, and vigilant monitoring. Procedural efficacy is high with "92% with a single procedure and 97% with multiple procedures in a meta-analysis", yet "the subsequent incidence of AF occurring after ablation of CTI-dependent AFL is reported to be 16% to 82%, with a higher incidence in patients with a history of AF before ablation than those without (53% versus 23% after 16–18 months; P < 0.05)", and "In 1 study, 82% of patients who underwent typical AFL ablation experienced new-onset AF during long-term follow-up (mean, 39 months)". Because AF may persist, "continued anticoagulation is recommended based on thromboembolic risk assessment", and "close follow-up and monitoring are recommended", with detection increasing "with more frequent monitoring and/or longer duration of follow-up", especially in those "at high risk of stroke or thromboembolism (≥ 2%/ year)". Monitoring options include that "Intermittent monitoring may be performed with ambulatory monitors or wearable devices", while "implantable devices can provide more prolonged and continuous monitoring", and "Implantable cardiac monitors have been used in multiple settings to detect AF, including after AF ablation or in patients with cryptogenic stroke".

### Stroke and thromboembolism prevention in atrial fibrillation [^3b1857b8]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolism remains the cornerstone for management of atrial fibrillation (AF) and flutter. Multiple risk assessment models for stroke and systemic thromboembolism are currently available. The score, with its known limitations, remains as the recommended risk stratification tool in most major guidelines. Once at-risk patients are identified, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and, more recently, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the primary medical therapy for stroke prevention. In those with contraindication for long-term anticoagulation, left atrial appendage occluding devices are developing as a possible alternative therapy. Some controversy exists regarding anticoagulation management for cardioversion of acute AF (< 48 hours); however, systemic anticoagulation precardioversion and postcardioversion is recommended for those with longer duration of AF. Anticoagulation management peri-AF ablation is also evolving. Uninterrupted VKA and DOAC therapy has been shown to reduce perioperative thromboembolic risk with no significant escalation in major bleeding. Currently, under investigation is a minimally interrupted approach to anticoagulation with DOACs periablation. Questions remain, especially regarding the delivery of anticoagulation care and integration of wearable rhythm monitors in AF management.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation technique — consensus recommendations: Ablation strategies that target the pulmonary veins (PVs) and/or PV antrum are the cornerstone for most AF ablation procedures, and if the PVs are targeted, electrical isolation should be the goal. Achievement of electrical isolation requires, at a minimum, assessment and demonstration of entrance block into the PV, and for surgical PV isolation, entrance and/or exit block should be demonstrated. Monitoring for PV reconduction for 20 minutes following initial PV isolation should be considered, and careful identification of the PV ostia is mandatory to avoid ablation within the PVs. If a focal trigger is identified outside a PV at the time of an AF ablation procedure, ablation of that focal trigger should be considered; if additional linear lesions are applied, operators should consider using mapping and pacing maneuvers to assess for line completeness. Ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus is recommended in patients with a history of typical atrial flutter or inducible cavotricuspid isthmus dependent atrial flutter. If patients with long standing persistent AF are approached, operators should consider more extensive ablation based on linear lesions or complex fractionated electrograms, and it is recommended that RF power be reduced when creating lesions along the posterior wall near the esophagus.

The treatment for atrial fibrillation has evolved significantly over time. Previously, medication management was the mainstay of treatment. As we have developed more robust technologies and modalities for catheter ablation, these treatment recommendations have changed. Catheter ablation is a safe and effective strategy for treating atrial fibrillation that is now considered first-line therapy in some patient populations. In this review, we discuss historical perspectives regarding the treatment and management of atrial fibrillation. We review the literature on studies investigating catheter ablation as first-line therapy, including the impact of catheter ablation on arrhythmia recurrence, cardiovascular outcomes, and healthcare utilization. Finally, we discuss future directions for the management of atrial fibrillation as the technology for catheter ablation continues to grow and progress.

Concomitant arrhythmia ablation during AF procedures — utility and limits: During ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF), ablation of previously documented or inducible sustained supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or atrial flutter (AFL) is described as useful to reduce recurrent arrhythmias, but when AF alone or inducible SVT is targeted in patients with both AF and AFL the likelihood of recurrent arrhythmias is high. Prophylactic cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation without documented or inducible AFL likely has minimal benefit. A comparative study reported cryoballoon pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) as first-line treatment for AFL is equally effective as standard CTI ablation for preventing recurrent atrial arrhythmia and better at preventing new-onset AF.

Recurrent AF/atrial flutter (AFL)/atrial tachycardia (AT) "is defined as AF/AFL/AT of at least 30 seconds' duration that is documented by an ECG or device recording system and occurs following catheter ablation". Early recurrence "is defined as a recurrence of atrial fibrillation within three months of ablation", whereas postablation recurrence "is defined as a recurrence of atrial fibrillation more than 3 months following AF ablation", and late recurrence "is defined as a recurrence of atrial fibrillation 12 months or more after AF ablation". A blanking period is specified: "A blanking period of three months should be employed after ablation when reporting efficacy outcomes", and "early recurrences of AF/AFL/AT within the first 3 months should not be classified as a 'treatment failure'". If shorter blanking is used, "If a blanking period of less than 3 months is chosen, it should be prespecified and included in the Methods section".

Electrophysiological (EP) study — An EP study can be helpful when AF is a consequence of reentrant tachycardia such as atrial flutter, intra-atrial reentry, or atrioventricular (AV) reentry involving an accessory pathway. Detection of a delta wave on the surface ECG in a patient with a history of AF or syncope is a firm indication for EP study and ablation of the bypass tract. Some patients with documented atrial flutter also have AF, and ablation of flutter can eliminate AF, although this is not common and successful ablation of flutter does not eliminate the possibility of developing AF in the future; AF with rapid ventricular rates and wide-complex QRS morphology may be mislabeled as ventricular tachycardia, and an EP study will differentiate the 2 arrhythmias. In short, EP testing is indicated when ablative therapy of arrhythmias that trigger AF or ablation of AF is planned.

Atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation (AF) — coexistence, post–CTI ablation AF, and antiarrhythmic-induced flutter: It is common for AF and atrial flutter to coexist in the same patient. After CTI ablation, 22% to 50% of patients have been reported to develop AF after a mean follow-up of 14 to 30 months, although 1 study reported a much higher rate of AF development, with 82% of patients treated by catheter ablation for atrial flutter manifesting AF within 5 years. Risk factors for the manifesting AF after atrial flutter ablation include prior AF, depressed left ventricular function, structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease, inducible AF, and increased LA size. Atrial flutter may result from antiarrhythmic therapy of AF, particularly when flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone is used for treatment of AF, and ablation of the CTI-dependent flutter may prevent recurrent flutter while antiarrhythmic therapy for AF is continued.

### Atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation ablation-sequential or combined? A cost-benefit and risk analysis of primary prevention pulmonary vein ablation [^a3e65935]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have tested the hypothesis that preventive pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) at time of atrial flutter ablation in patients who have not had atrial fibrillation (AF) will reduce future incidence of AF.

Objective

To model relative procedural costs, risks, and benefits of sequential versus combined ablation strategies.

Methods

The decision model compares a sequential ablation strategy of atrial flutter ablation, followed by future PVI if necessary, with an initial combined flutter and preventive PVI ablation strategy. Assumptions are AF incidence 20% per year, PVI success rate 70%, PVI complication rate 4%, atrial flutter complication rate 1%, and costs $13,056 for PVI and $8,466 for atrial flutter ablation.

Results

The sequential ablation strategy is less expensive, at 1.4 vs 1.6 expected flutter ablation equivalents (FAE) ($11,852 vs $13,545) per patient, and entails less average risk, at 2% vs 4%. A combined ablation strategy is more expensive if the relative cost of PVI is more than 24.6% higher than atrial flutter ablation. A combined ablation strategy has higher total risk if PVI procedural risk is 24.6% more than atrial flutter ablation.

Conclusions

Under base case assumptions of relative cost of PVI to flutter ablation 1.5 and relative risk 4, a sequential ablation approach has less total expected cost and less expected risk. There appears to be no compelling reason to adopt a combined ablation approach into standard practice. Nomograms are presented to allow the reader to assess which strategy is preferred according to local relative costs and risk.

5 Recommendations on Efficacy

Classes I–III recommendations are reported in Tables 1, 2, 3, respectively. Flowcharts showing clinical conditions for which catheter ablation of AF is indicated based on the proposed recommendation scheme are reported below in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 3b. Supporting Information: Figures S1–S3 provide complimentary information on clinical data including number of patients enrolled, randomization ratio and follow‐up duration in reference studies. Supporting Information: Figures S4, S5a, and S5b provide an alternative scheme of Supporting Information: Figures S1, S2a, S2b, S3a, and S3b, focusing primarily on techniques and technologies used to obtain designated outcomes. Supporting Information material provides the list of literature contributions representing the basis of our research (pages 24–54). Criteria for selection of recommendation classes in the present document are reported below.

Compilation of the present recommendation scheme is made under the assumption that future studies showing evidence against the current indications or new evidence from previously unaddressed indications will lead to appropriate changes in the new programmed edition of ECAS guidelines. This will apply especially for studies reporting outcome results from single high‐quality studies and for follow‐up extended beyond 12‐month duration, where applicable.

5.1 Criteria for Class I Recommendations

The criteria guiding selection of recommendation classes in the present document have been discussed elsewhere. In brief, Class I indicates a recommendation in favor of the practice of catheter ablation or of any specific ablation strategy or technique, where:
a. evidence of greater benefit than risk or
b. similar efficacy and safety profiles between comparative technologies or techniques

is provided by high‐quality randomized multicenter controlled trials of sufficient sample sizes. High‐quality controlled trials guiding selection were defined as having:
a. low Risk of Bias for all crucial domains
b. high precision of effect expressed by a narrow 95% confidence interval
c. absence of other contradicting similar high‐quality evidence
d. compliance with the principle of directness, comparability between the population investigated in the reference trial and the population to which the recommendation is directed.

Finally, multi‐center trials were required to ensure representativeness of proposed recommendations on large scale.

Failure to comply with these criteria resulted in a down‐grading of the ablation practice, strategy or technique to a recommendation Class II level (Table 1).

### Cryoablation or drug therapy for initial treatment of atrial fibrillation [^484bc5ff]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend a trial of one or more antiarrhythmic drugs before catheter ablation is considered in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, first-line ablation may be more effective in maintaining sinus rhythm.

Methods

We randomly assigned 303 patients with symptomatic, paroxysmal, untreated atrial fibrillation to undergo catheter ablation with a cryothermy balloon or to receive antiarrhythmic drug therapy for initial rhythm control. All the patients received an implantable cardiac monitoring device to detect atrial tachyarrhythmia. The follow-up period was 12 months. The primary end point was the first documented recurrence of any atrial tachyarrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia) between 91 and 365 days after catheter ablation or the initiation of an antiarrhythmic drug. The secondary end points included freedom from symptomatic arrhythmia, the atrial fibrillation burden, and quality of life.

Results

At 1 year, a recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmia had occurred in 66 of 154 patients (42.9%) assigned to undergo ablation and in 101 of 149 patients (67.8%) assigned to receive antiarrhythmic drugs (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35 to 0.66; P < 0.001). Symptomatic atrial tachyarrhythmia had recurred in 11.0% of the patients who underwent ablation and in 26.2% of those who received antiarrhythmic drugs (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.68). The median percentage of time in atrial fibrillation was 0% (interquartile range, 0 to 0.08) with ablation and 0.13% (interquartile range, 0 to 1.60) with antiarrhythmic drugs. Serious adverse events occurred in 5 patients (3.2%) who underwent ablation and in 6 patients (4.0%) who received antiarrhythmic drugs.

Conclusions

Among patients receiving initial treatment for symptomatic, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, there was a significantly lower rate of atrial fibrillation recurrence with catheter cryoballoon ablation than with antiarrhythmic drug therapy, as assessed by continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^d2cc2b95]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Explanations of this gap between prior expert consensus recommendations and routine clinical practice might reflect the current disconnect between indications for catheter ablation and clinical outcomes of the procedure. Another factor can be cost. On one hand, the main indication for catheter ablation is symptomatic AF and decisions regarding continuation of anticoagulation therapy should be based on the patient's risk factors for stroke and not on the presence of or type of AF. At the same time, transtelephonic or long-term monitoring is at times recommended after ablation to capture even asymptomatic episodes of AF to evaluate the need to continue anticoagulation. The majority of writing group members do not believe that data currently exist to support this common practice of making decisions regarding anticoagulation based on the presence or absence of AF (see Section 7).

A significant amount of information has accumulated showing that cardiac risk factors such as obesity, sleep apnea, and hypertension are associated with structural and electrical remodeling of the atria, which forms the substrate leading to AF development and progression (see Section 3). The recommended indefinite annual follow-up visits with a health care professional allow for the evaluation and treatment of associated diseases and lifestyle modification rather than monitoring of the rhythm itself.

Early Recurrence After Ablation

Definition and Incidence

Early recurrences of AF after AF ablation has been defined as any recurrence of AF > 30 seconds during the first 3 months of follow-up. Late recurrence has been defined as any recurrence of AF > 30 seconds between 3 and 12 months after AF. In using the term early recurrence of AF (ERAF) it is recognized that the early recurrence might be AFL or AT. Although we considered defining a new term, early recurrence of ATAs, post-AF ablation, for simplicity we have employed the term early recurrence of AF. Throughout the document and this section of the document, we note that recurrences can present in the form of AF, flutter, or tachycardia.

Early recurrences of AF after RF catheter ablation have been reported in up to 50% of patients within the first 3 months of AF ablation. Because these arrhythmias do not definitively indicate therapy failure over the long term (only half of these patients will manifest later recurrences), this period is also referred to as the blanking or therapy stabilization period. It is also important to recognize that the later AF recurrences are observed during the blanking phase, the lower the chance of long-term success.

Anticoagulation for typical cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)–dependent atrial flutter (AFL) is directed by treatment path and thromboembolic risk. For patients managed with "Rate control or rhythm control with antiarrhythmic therapy" or those with "Unsuccessful typical AFL ablation (without plans for re-do ablation)", the pathway directs "Anticoagulation according to same risk profile as AF (1)". After "Successful typical AFL ablation", patients with "Known prior history of AF" receive "Anticoagulation according to same risk profile as AF (1)". In those with "No known prior history of AF", a "High-risk thromboembolic profile" leads to "Consider anticoagulation if high-risk features for development of AF† (2b)", whereas a "Low-risk thromboembolic profile" leads to "Monitor off anticoagulation (clinical follow-up and arrhythmia monitoring) (1)".

### HRS policy statement: clinical cardiac electrophysiology fellowship curriculum: update 2011 [^81a6e5e5]. Heart Rhythm (2011). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation and flutter — heart rate control and rhythm control with drugs remain the mainstay of therapy, and when drug therapy fails to control symptoms this goal can be accomplished by ablation. Accumulating evidence that restoration of sinus rhythm by ablation improves symptoms, cardiac function and exercise capacity in selected groups has led to morbidity and mortality trials, and competence in endocardial ablation for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter has become a requirement for graduating EP fellows. Anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin) remains the mainstay of stroke prevention, and left atrial occlusion devices are likely to become clinically available. A prototypical direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, is now approved in the US, while other direct thrombin inhibitors and direct factor Xa antagonists are undergoing clinical trials and will likely be clinically available soon.

16 Summary and Future Directions

Adopting the growing request for rigor and transparency, the present document provides a concise scheme on Classes I–III recommendations relative to beneficial effects of catheter ablation of AF and of specific ablation strategies or techniques for which high‐quality evidence of greater benefit than risk is demonstrated. Consistent with the rigorous methods adopted, subclassifications and levels of evidence have been deleted with the aim of mitigating arbitrariness in document production. The copious ongoing research in the field, of which we have provided a custom‐built list for readers reference, will enrich our recommendation list in future guidelines, with the awareness that new paradigms may surface offering different base theories, methods of investigation and validation may subvert current guidelines' structure. The model used here is meant to preserve the original mission of guidelines to assist, not to impose practitioner decisions about appropriate health care and reconcile them with the true art of medicine. The rigor, simplicity and transparency of the present document may serve other societies in preparation guideline documents.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy — management principles state that treatment goals are to slow the heart rate or reduce extrasystoles, relieve symptoms, prevent hospitalization, and improve survival; management of TICMP comprises evidence-based treatment for heart failure (HF) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and aldosterone receptor antagonists, and diuretics may be used to relieve congestive symptoms. Rate control therapy commonly includes beta-blockers and/or digoxin, and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists should be avoided in the context of systolic HF associated with TICMP. In TICMP due to atrial fibrillation (AF), options include rate-controlling drugs, antiarrhythmic drugs, direct current cardioversion, or catheter ablation in addition to anticoagulation. While older randomized trials of rhythm vs rate control in AF found no differences in morbidity or mortality, two recent randomized controlled trials (AATAC and CASTLE-AF) have demonstrated superiority in reducing AF burden, reduced hospitalization, and reduced mortality with catheter ablation in systolic HF when compared to drug therapy; however, these studies had a narrow clinical profile from highly specialized units and are not fully generalizable, and whether findings extrapolate to truly asymptomatic patients is not known, so consideration of ablation in asymptomatic patients should be individualized. Given the high success rate and low risk with catheter ablation of typical right sided atrial flutter, ablation to eliminate atrial flutter is recommended when TICMP is suspected, whereas decisions for atypical atrial flutter should be individualized.

### Symptomatic improvement after radiofrequency catheter ablation for typical atrial flutter [^79e0e1ba]. Heart (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the changes in quality of life, arrhythmia symptoms, and hospital resource utilisation following catheter ablation of typical atrial flutter.

Design

Patient questionnaire to compare the time interval following ablation with a similar time interval before ablation.

Setting

Tertiary referral centre.

Patients

63 consecutive patients were studied. Four patients subsequently underwent an ablate and pace procedure, two died of co-morbid illnesses, and two were lost to follow up. The remaining 55 patients form the basis of the report.

Results

Patients were followed for a mean (SD) of 12 (9.5) months. Atrial flutter ablation resulted in an improvement in quality of life (3.8 v 2.5, p < 0.001) and reductions in symptom frequency score (2.0 v 3.5, p < 0.001) and symptom severity score (2.0 v 3.8, p < 0.001) compared with preablation values. There was a reduction in the number of patients visiting accident and emergency departments (11% v 53%, p < 0.001), requiring cardioversion (7% v 51%, p < 0.001), or being admitted to hospital for a rhythm problem (11% v 56%, p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis confirmed that patients with atrial flutter and concomitant atrial fibrillation before ablation and those with atrial flutter alone both derived significant benefit from atrial flutter ablation. Patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation had an improvement in quality of life (3.5 v 2.5, p < 0.001) and reductions in symptom frequency score (2.3 v 3.5, p < 0.001) and symptom severity score (2.2 v 3.7, p < 0.001) compared with preablation values.

Conclusions

Ablation of atrial flutter is recommended both in patients with atrial flutter alone and in those with concomitant atrial fibrillation.

### The current landscape of atrial Fibrillation and atrial flutter clinical Trials: a report of 348 studies registered with clinicalTrials.gov [^67645d9a]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

This analysis sought to systematically characterize trial-level patterns in atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFL) by using the ClinicalTrials.gov database.

Background

Despite an abundance of clinical trials in this field, there is a lack of high-level evidence guiding management of AF/AFL.

Methods

We queried all closed, phase II to IV interventional trials registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov database through October 2016 that enrolled patients known to have AF/AFL. Published trials were evaluated for methodological quality, using the 3-item Jadad scale (range: 0 to 5, where 5 = highest quality).

Results

The initial search yielded 465 uniquely registered studies, of which 348 directly studied AF/AFL. Of those studies, 173 (50%) were published, enrolling a median of 190 patients from a median of 15 sites. The volume of published trials increased over time (7% prior to 2008 vs. 41% from 2014 to 2016; p < 0.001 for trend). Of the completed trials, 29% remain unpublished. Industry sources accounted for most funding (54%). Recurrence of AF/AFL was the most common endpoint (45%), whereas rates of primary clinical endpoints were low (13%). The mean Jadad score of published trials of pharmacological approaches (n = 112) was 4.0 ± 1.4. Of the 61 AF/AFL trials involving ablation or device therapies, 69% were randomized, 28% were single-arm studies, and patient, proceduralist, and event-ascertainment blinding was used in 16%, 4%, and 44%, respectively.

Conclusions

Contemporary trials of AF/AFL are often multicenter and modest in size. The primary study endpoint is commonly recurrence of arrhythmia, even in high-quality and late-phase trials. Although methodological quality is high in trials of pharmacologic approaches, trials of AF/AFL ablation and device therapies variably employ randomization and blinding.

### What is the optimal approach for ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation? [^787c4fc8]. Heart Rhythm (2009). Low credibility.

The optimal approach for catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is the subject of some controversy. Recent guidelines define PAF as recurrent AF that terminates spontaneously within seven days. For patients with PAF, the three most commonly employed approaches for ablation include, (1) segmental ostial or antral pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), (2) circumferential pulmonary vein ablation (CPVA) alone or in combination with additional left atrial linear ablation (LALA), and (3) complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) ablation alone or in combination with segmental PVI or CPVA (with or without additional LALA). Each of these approaches will be described in detail in this article. Overall evidence suggests that segmental antral PVI may be as effective as CPVA with or without LALA in prevention of AF recurrence, but that CPVA with or without LALA may be associated with a higher incidence of atypical atrial flutter recurrence.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Catheter ablation strategies for left atrial flutter: The document notes that "the macro-reentrant circuits that are dependent on the roof line or mitral isthmus line are easy to diagnose but may be difficult to ablate (see below)". For roof-dependent circuits, "roof linear ablation is recommended at the roof of the LA rather than on the posterior left atrial wall because the former is associated with an increased risk of atrial oesophageal fistula". Confirmation of block uses pacing maneuvers, as "after restoration of sinus rhythm, demonstration of an ascending activation from the posterior LA during pacing from the LA lateral roof or LAA ascertains complete linear roof block". Localized centrifugal arrhythmias "can be accomplished with focal RF energy delivery", and "non reentrant focal atrial arrhythmias often originate at lesion edges".

Non–isthmus-dependent atrial flutters (atypical macroreentrant atrial tachycardias) — Catheter ablation of non–CTI-dependent flutter requires more extensive mapping than CTI-dependent flutter and success rates are lower, and the location of the circuit determines ablation approach and risks. After AF ablation, microreentrant or macroreentrant left atrial tachycardia occurs in approximately 5% of patients and is less frequent if ablation is limited to pulmonary vein isolation; these arrhythmias are more common with longer-duration persistent AF, more dilated left atria, or when linear ablation lesions are used. Detailed activation and entrainment mapping during a second procedure result in effective ablation in approximately 90% of patients.

### Typical atrial flutter: a practical review [^df2d4277]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Typical atrial flutter (AFL), defined as cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent macro-re-entrant atrial tachycardia, often causes debilitating symptoms, and is associated with increased incidence of atrial fibrillation, stroke, heart failure, and death. Typical AFL occurs in patients with atrial remodeling and shares risk factors with atrial fibrillation. It is also common in patients with a history of prior heart surgery or catheter ablation. It is characterized by a recognizable ECG pattern that is highly predictive of CTI-dependent re-entry in patients without iatrogenic atrial scars. Typical AFL is difficult to manage medically due to poor efficacy of rate-controlling and antiarrhythmic drugs. Catheter ablation has been established in randomized trials to be superior to medical management in terms of safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes including hospitalization and quality of life. Catheter ablation aims at achieving bidirectional conduction block across the CTI, which can be efficiently assessed by well-established techniques such as differential pacing. Long-term ablation success requires creating a stable transmural and continuous lesion, which can be optimized by systematic assessment of ablation parameters and lesion contiguity. The present review discusses the epidemiology, mechanisms, ECG characteristics, medical management, and catheter ablation of typical AFL.

### A randomized clinical trial of early invasive intervention for atrial fibrillation (EARLY-AF)-methods and rationale [^bc078536]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The ideal management of patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) remains unknown. Current practice guidelines recommend a trial of antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) prior to considering an invasive ablation procedure. However, earlier ablation offers an opportunity to halt the progressive patho-anatomical changes associated with AF, as well as impart other important clinical benefits.

Objective

The aim of this study is to determine the optimal initial management strategy for patients with newly diagnosed, symptomatic atrial fibrillation.

Methods/Design

The EARLY-AF study (ClinicalTrials.govNCT02825979) is a prospective, open label, multicenter, randomized trial with a blinded assessment of outcomes. A total of 298 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to first-line AAD therapy, or first-line cryoballoon-based pulmonary vein isolation. Patients with symptomatic treatment naïve AF will be included. Arrhythmia outcomes will be assessed by implantable cardiac monitor (ICM). The primary outcome is time to first recurrence of AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia (AF/AFL/AT) between days 91 and 365 following AAD initiation or AF ablation. Secondary outcomes include arrhythmia burden, quality of life, and healthcare utilization.

Discussion

The EARLY-AF study is a randomized trial designed to evaluate the optimal first management approach for patients with AF. We hypothesize that catheter ablation will be superior to drug therapy in prevention of AF recurrence.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic mapping of left atrial flutter: Surface electrocardiography (ECG) contributes to diagnosis, as "evaluation of the 12-lead ECG is of some value in the diagnosis of an LAFL". Findings that "should suggest the presence of a LAFL" include "a positive or biphasic but dominantly positive deflection in V1 accompanied by deflections in other leads inconsistent with typical counter clockwise atrial flutter". Importantly, "the demonstration of P waves on the 12-lead ECG separated by long isoelectric intervals should not lead to exclusion of a re-entrant AT but rather may indicate microreentry involving low conducting isthmus often near one of the prior AF ablation lesions". For invasive mapping, "the most widely used strategy during mapping these flutters relies on 3D electro-anatomic mapping systems using signals obtained either by a point-by-point roving catheter or a multipolar catheter", and "entrainment maps can be constructed using the return cycle length values obtained during flutter from pacing at multiple sites".

### Should we perform catheter ablation for asymptomatic atrial fibrillation? [^0431adac]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Since the original description of atrial fibrillation ablation, numerous studies have demonstrated the superiority of catheter ablation over pharmacological therapy for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with both paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation. However, to date, no randomized studies have been powered to demonstrate a mortality or stroke reduction benefit of rhythm control with catheter ablation over a rate control strategy. The results of such ongoing studies are not expected until 2018 or 2019. Thus, the only indication for atrial fibrillation ablation in recent guidelines has been the presence of symptoms. However, up to 40% of an atrial fibrillation population may be asymptomatic. In 2017, in the absence of randomized studies, are there nevertheless data that support atrial fibrillation ablation in asymptomatic patients?

### Catheter ablation of atrial arrhythmias: state of the art [^7e61cec2]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Catheter ablation is at the forefront of the management of a range of atrial arrhythmias. In this Series paper, we discuss the underlying mechanisms and the current role of catheter ablation for the three most common atrial arrhythmias encountered in clinical practice: focal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation. The mechanisms of focal atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter are well understood, and these arrhythmias are amenable to curative catheter ablation with high success rates. In most cases, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is initiated by triggers located within pulmonary vein musculature. Circumferential ablation to isolate this musculature is associated with high success rates for elimination of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in selected populations. Because of the problem of recurrent pulmonary vein connection, more than one procedure will be needed in about 30% of patients, and new technologies are being developed to reduce this occurrence. The mechanisms that sustain persistent atrial fibrillation are not well understood and are the subject of continuing investigation. As such, ablation approaches and technologies for this arrhythmia are still evolving.

### Efficacy and safety of dronedarone in patients with a prior ablation for atrial fibrillation / flutter: insights from the ATHENA study [^234c61d1]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Baseline and demographic characteristics of patients having prior ablation were broadly similar across the dronedarone and placebo groups. As expected, patients who had undergone ablation before randomization appeared more likely to be receiving an oral anticoagulant (77% vs 59%) and to have more extensive CV disease, including clinical tachycardia (52% vs 33%), a pacemaker implantation (28% vs 9%), cardiac valve surgery (13% vs 3%) or an implanted cardioverter defibrillator (8% vs 2%) at baseline than patients without ablation. Despite these differences, safety observations in patients with prior ablation were largely consistent with those in the overall ATHENA study. 12 Relative risk analysis suggested no interaction between ablation status and treatment for either TEAEs or serious TEAEs.

With the increasing use of ablation to achieve rhythm control in patients with AF, 3, 4 positioning of AADs and ablation in specific patient populations is of considerable practical importance. In current AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines, AADs remain a first‐line treatment recommendation for patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF, with choice of AAD depending on underlying heart disease and comorbidities. 1, 2 Both AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines 1, 2 and an expert consensus from HRS/EHRA/ECAS/APHRS/SOLEACE 5 consider catheter ablation as a class IA recommendation in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF who are refractory or intolerant to at least one class I or III AAD, and as a IIaB recommendation as first‐line treatment in patients with paroxysmal AF, prior to initiation of an AAD.

In real‐world evaluations, fewer than 50% of patients achieve treatment success at 1 year following catheter ablation, based on freedom from AF recurrence without the use of AADs. 15, 16 Data from the ESC‐EHRA AF ablation long‐term registry show that for patients receiving ablation, 90% had received AAD treatment before ablation, 68% received AADs shortly after ablation and 46% were on AADs at 1‐year follow‐up. 17 In the CABANA study, a high incidence of crossovers between the ablation and medical therapy arms highlights the difficulty in separating ablation and medical therapies for AF rhythm management. 7 Furthermore, almost 50% of patients in the ablation arm of the CABANA study had AF recurrences at 4 years, emphasizing the need to explore efficacy and safety of AAD treatment as complementary rather than competing approaches to rhythm management.

Atrial flutter and stroke/atrial fibrillation (AF) risk: Atrial flutter is described as a more organized macro-reentrant arrhythmia, is less common than AF, and is associated with a risk of stroke similar to AF; in a single-center ablation cohort of 1121 patients followed up for 2.1 ± 2.7 years, 31.7% had AF before ablation and 23.2% experienced AF after ablation for atrial flutter.
