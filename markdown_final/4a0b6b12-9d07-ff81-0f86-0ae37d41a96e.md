## Question

Moya moya disease pathogens is

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are identifiable pathogens that cause moyamoya disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between moyamoya disease and moyamoya syndrome. Then, I should verify what high-credibility sources say about infectious etiologies. Next, I will examine specific pathogens that have been reported in association with moyamoya vasculopathy. After that, I need to assess the strength and direction of evidence for causality versus association. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion and note any exceptions or modifiers that might change practice or counseling.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate entities. Moyamoya disease is an idiopathic, progressive steno-occlusive vasculopathy of the terminal internal carotid arteries with characteristic moyamoya collaterals, whereas moyamoya syndrome refers to the same angiographic phenotype occurring secondary to other conditions such as sickle cell disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, Down syndrome, radiation, or autoimmune disease. Importantly, the most recent diagnostic criteria allow unilateral disease and still require exclusion of other causes, which frames how we interpret infectious associations [^53323b28] [^7b73090b].

> Wait, let me verify the infectious angle from authoritative statements. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association scientific statements explicitly list infections as nongenetic factors associated with moyamoya vasculopathy, but they do not assert that infections are established causes of primary moyamoya disease; rather, they are recognized triggers or associations, particularly in the context of moyamoya syndrome rather than idiopathic moyamoya disease [^66e3b864] [^7b73090b].

> I will now examine specific pathogens that have been reported. Leptospirosis and HIV have been described as infection triggers in moyamoya vasculopathy, and herpesviruses such as HSV and CMV, as well as EBV and toxoplasma, have been implicated in studies measuring infectious burden. However, these links are largely observational and often in the setting of moyamoya syndrome rather than isolated moyamoya disease, so I need to be careful not to overstate causality [^66e3b864] [^5967fc5a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check the strength of evidence. Most infectious associations come from case reports, small series, or cohorts without robust causal inference, and some studies show conflicting results regarding viral infections in moyamoya disease. This pattern argues against a single-pathogen etiology for primary moyamoya disease and supports a model where infections may act as environmental triggers in genetically susceptible hosts or contribute to secondary moyamoya syndromes rather than cause the idiopathic disease itself [^5967fc5a] [^66e3b864].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility. RNF213, the major susceptibility gene in East Asian populations, encodes a protein with antimicrobial functions, which provides a biologically plausible bridge between immune responses to infection and vascular pathology. However, low penetrance of RNF213 variants means infections alone are insufficient to explain disease, reinforcing a multifactorial model rather than a direct infectious cause in most cases [^66e3b864] [^af6a91e8].

> But wait, what if the question is about clinical implications rather than causality. I should confirm that current guidelines do not recommend routine infectious screening for moyamoya disease itself; instead, clinicians evaluate for associated conditions and exposures when clinically indicated, and they avoid systematic RNF213 screening outside of research or specific contexts, underscoring that infectious workups are not part of standard moyamoya disease diagnostics [^ad1d8a64] [^067d983f].

> Synthesis: I need to ensure my conclusion matches the weight of evidence. There is no established single pathogen that causes moyamoya disease. Infections such as leptospirosis, HIV, HSV, CMV, EBV, and toxoplasma have been associated with moyamoya vasculopathy, particularly in moyamoya syndrome, but these associations are not sufficient to establish causation for primary moyamoya disease, which remains idiopathic with strong genetic contributors and likely multifactorial pathogenesis [^66e3b864] [^af6a91e8].

Moyamoya disease is **not caused by a specific pathogen**. It is a rare, progressive cerebrovascular disorder characterized by stenosis or occlusion of the terminal internal carotid arteries and their proximal branches, with compensatory collateral vessel formation [^21d5f0b8]. The etiology is **multifactorial**, involving genetic predisposition (notably RNF213 variants) [^af6a91e8] and possible autoimmune or inflammatory mechanisms [^a61e8341]; no infectious agent has been proven to cause the disease [^notfound]. While infections such as leptospirosis or HIV have been reported in association with moyamoya vasculopathy, these are considered triggers or contributors rather than primary causes [^66e3b864]. Management focuses on surgical revascularization and medical risk-factor control, not antimicrobial therapy [^2608c643] [^37057163].

---

## Pathophysiology and etiology

Moyamoya disease is defined by progressive stenosis or occlusion of the terminal portions of the internal carotid arteries and their proximal branches, with the development of fragile collateral vessels at the base of the brain [^53323b28]. The exact cause remains unknown, but current evidence supports a **multifactorial etiology** involving genetic, autoimmune, and inflammatory factors [^47911264].

---

### Genetic factors

- **RNF213 gene**: Variants in RNF213, particularly the p.R4810K variant, are strongly associated with moyamoya disease, especially in East Asian populations [^af6a91e8]. RNF213 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in vascular development and angiogenesis [^4a5f82cd].
- **Other genes**: Additional genes such as ANO1, HLA-DRB1, and PHACTR1 have been implicated in moyamoya disease, suggesting a polygenic inheritance pattern [^7db090cc] [^af9a1160].
- **Familial cases**: Approximately 10–15% of moyamoya disease cases are familial, indicating a genetic predisposition [^9d43ffee].

---

### Autoimmune and inflammatory factors

Autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Graves' disease, and type 1 diabetes mellitus have been reported more frequently in moyamoya patients, suggesting an autoimmune component [^a61e8341]. Inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, including VEGF, bFGF, and TGF-β1, are elevated in moyamoya disease, indicating chronic inflammation and abnormal angiogenesis [^18d1b665].

---

## Infectious associations

While no specific pathogen has been definitively identified as a cause of moyamoya disease, several infectious agents have been reported in association with moyamoya vasculopathy, particularly in the context of moyamoya syndrome (secondary moyamoya) [^7b73090b]:

| **Infectious agent** | **Association with moyamoya disease** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Leptospirosis | Documented cases of moyamoya vasculopathy following leptospiral infection | Low (case reports) |
| HIV | Reported cases of moyamoya vasculopathy in HIV-positive patients | Low (case reports) |
| Tuberculosis | Rare associations with moyamoya vasculopathy | Low (case reports) |
| Herpesviruses (HSV, CMV, EBV) | Serological studies suggest possible association with intracranial artery stenosis | Moderate (serological studies) |

---

These associations suggest that infections may act as **triggers or contributors** in genetically predisposed individuals, but they do not establish a direct causal relationship [^5967fc5a].

---

## Clinical implications

The absence of a proven infectious etiology means that antimicrobial therapy is **not indicated** for moyamoya disease. Management focuses on:

- **Surgical revascularization**: Direct or indirect bypass surgery to improve cerebral blood flow and reduce the risk of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke [^2608c643].
- **Medical management**: Control of vascular risk factors, antiplatelet therapy, and management of associated conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia [^37057163] [^cf677c37].
- **Genetic counseling**: Considered for patients with a family history of moyamoya disease, particularly in East Asian populations [^a4d90539].

---

## Conclusion

Moyamoya disease is **not caused by a specific pathogen**. The etiology is multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition and autoimmune or inflammatory mechanisms. Infectious agents may be associated with moyamoya vasculopathy in some cases, but they are not considered primary causes. Therefore, management does not include antimicrobial therapy, and treatment focuses on surgical revascularization and medical risk-factor control.

### Moyamoya disease: current concepts and future perspectives [^21d5f0b8]. The Lancet: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Moyamoya disease is an uncommon cerebrovascular disease that is characterised by progressive stenosis of the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and its main branches. The disease is associated with the development of dilated, fragile collateral vessels at the base of the brain, which are termed moyamoya vessels. The incidence of moyamoya disease is high in east Asia, and familial forms account for about 15% of patients with this disease. Moyamoya disease has several unique clinical features, which include two peaks of age distribution at 5 years and at about 40 years. Most paediatric patients have ischaemic attacks, whereas adult patients can have ischaemic attacks, intracranial bleeding, or both. Extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass, including anastomosis of the superficial temporal artery to the middle cerebral artery and indirect bypass, can help prevent further ischaemic attacks, although the beneficial effect on haemorrhagic stroke is still not clear. In this Review, we summarise the epidemiology, aetiology, clinical features, diagnosis, surgical treatment, and outcomes of moyamoya disease. Recent updates and future perspectives for moyamoya disease will also be discussed.

### Pathophysiology and genetic factors in moyamoya disease [^1eb887a7]. Neurosurgical Focus (2009). Low credibility.

Moyamoya disease is an uncommon cerebrovascular condition characterized by progressive stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries with compensatory formation of an abnormal network of perforating blood vessels providing collateral circulation. The etiology and pathogenesis of moyamoya disease remain unclear. Evidence from histological studies, proteomics, and endothelial progenitor cell analyses suggests new theories underlying the cause of vascular anomalies, including moyamoya disease. Familial moyamoya disease has been noted in as many as 15% of patients, indicating an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance. Genetic analyses in familial moyamoya disease and genome-wide association studies represent promising strategies for elucidating the pathophysiology of this condition. In this review, the authors discuss recent studies that have investigated possible mechanisms underlying the etiology of moyamoya disease, including stem cell involvement and genetic factors. They also discuss future research directions that promise not only to offer new insights into the origin of moyamoya disease but to enhance our understanding of new vessel formation in the CNS as it relates to stroke, vascular anomalies, and tumor growth.

Since its initial description in 1957 as an idiopathic disease, moyamoya disease has proved challenging to treat. Although the basic pathophysiology of this disease involves narrowing of the terminal carotid artery with compensatory angiogenesis, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these changes are far more complex. In this article, the authors review the literature on the molecular and cellular pathophysiology of moyamoya disease with an emphasis on potential therapeutic targets.

### The progression of pathophysiology of moyamoya disease [^37d0abaa]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a chronic steno-occlusive cerebrovascular disease that often leads to hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes; however, its etiology remains elusive. Surgical revascularization by either direct or indirect bypass techniques to restore cerebral hypoperfusion is the treatment of choice to date. This review aims to provide an overview of the current advances in the pathophysiology of MMD, including the genetic, angiogenic, and inflammatory factors related to disease progression. These factors may cause MMD-related vascular stenosis and aberrant angiogenesis in complex manners. With a better understanding of the pathophysiology of MMD, nonsurgical approaches that target the pathogenesis of MMD may be able to halt or slow the progression of this disease.

### Progress in moyamoya disease [^6a40e687]. Neurosurgical Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Moyamoya disease is characterized by progressive stenosis or occlusion of the intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery and their proximal branches, resulting in ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke with high rate of disability and even death. So far, available treatment strategies are quite limited, and novel intervention method is being explored. This review encapsulates current advances of moyamoya disease on the aspects of epidemiology, etiology, clinical features, imaging diagnosis and treatment. In addition, we also bring forward our conjecture, which needs to be testified by future research.

### Genetics of moyamoya disease [^a807db97]. Journal of Human Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a disease pattern consisting of bilateral stenosis of the intracranial internal carotid arteries (ICA) accompanied by a network of abnormal collateral vessels that bypass the stenosis. Once symptomatic, insufficient cerebral blood flow or rupture of the fragile collaterals may cause stroke or hemorrhage, resulting in severe neurological dysfunction or death. The etiology of MMD is still unknown, although few associations with other diseases and environmental factors have been described. Strong regional differences in epidemiological data, as well as known familial cases, turned the focus to genetics for the insight into the disease's pathogenesis. Thus far, several reports have suggested specific genetic loci and individual genes as predisposing to MMD, but none have demonstrated reproducible results in independent cohorts. Small sample sizes, as well as a likely multifactorial origin, seem to be the most challenging tasks in identifying the disease-causing mechanisms. Once identified, susceptibility genes may allow preventive screening and a possible development of novel therapeutic options.

### Advances and surgical considerations in the treatment of moyamoya disease [^4c4d6c6c]. Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Moyamoya is a rare disorder that involves steno-occlusive arterial changes of the anterior circulation, along with proliferative development of basal arterial collaterals. It is either idiopathic (called moyamoya disease) or the result of a specific underlying condition such as atherosclerosis, radiation therapy, or sickle cell disease (called moyamoya syndrome or phenomenon). In recent years, numerous insights into and advances in the understanding, evaluation, and management of moyamoya patients have occurred. This article briefly reviews the spectrum of moyamoya conditions and then provides a synopsis of numerous recent investigations that shed light on various aspects of the disease, including its clinical characteristics, natural history, underlying pathology, imaging, surgical techniques, and long-term patient outcome.

### Moyamoya disease: diagnosis and interventions [^af6a91e8]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Moyamoya disease is a rare cause of stroke, radiologically characterised by progressive stenosis of the terminal portion of the internal carotid arteries and compensatory capillary collaterals. The discovery that RNF213, which encodes an unconventional E3 ubiquitin ligase, is the major susceptibility gene for moyamoya disease in people from east Asia has opened new avenues for investigation into the mechanisms of disease and potential treatment targets. The Arg4810Lys variant of the gene is most strongly associated with moyamoya disease, but the penetrance is lower than 1%, suggesting a synergistic relationship with additional environmental and genetic risk factors. White people carry less common non-Arg4810Lys variants of RNF213, which partly explains the lower prevalence of moyamoya disease in European countries and in the USA than in east Asian countries. Several monogenic moyamoya syndromes possess the radiological characteristics of moyamoya disease and have been associated with multiple genes and pathways involved in moyamoya angiopathy pathogenesis. Further clarification of the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the emergence of moyamoya angiopathy could enable development of new treatment strategies for moyamoya disease.

### Understanding and treating moyamoya disease in children [^36edb2e4]. Neurosurgical Focus (2009). Low credibility.

Moyamoya disease, a known cause of pediatric stroke, is an unremitting cerebrovascular occlusive disorder of unknown etiology that can lead to devastating, permanent neurological disability if left untreated. It is characterized by progressive stenosis of the intracranial internal carotid arteries and their distal branches and the nearly simultaneous appearance of basal arterial collateral vessels that vascularize hypoperfused brain distal to the occluded vessels. Moyamoya disease may be idiopathic or may occur in association with other syndromes. Most children with moyamoya disease present with recurrent transient ischemic attacks or strokes. Although there is no definitive medical treatment, numerous direct and indirect revascularization procedures have been used to improve the compromised cerebral circulation, with outcomes varying according to procedure type. Such techniques improve the long-term outcome of patients with both idiopathic and syndrome-associated moyamoya disease. This review provides a comprehensive discussion of moyamoya disease in children, with an emphasis on the most effective surgical treatment options.

Moyamoya disease is a chronic, progressive intracranial arteriopathy. It is characterised by progressive stenosis/occlusion of distal intracranial carotid and cerebral arteries. It is associated with a high risk of ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke. Hereditary, infectious and inflammatory factors have been found to be associated with this condition; however, its aetiology is still unclear. The estimation of disease prevalence is approximately 1.6 to 16.1 in 100000 live births. This article presents the case of a 5-year-old girl child diagnosed with moyamoya disease, placing emphasis on the clinical and radiographic orofacial characteristics of the case and its dental management.

### Childhood moyamoya: looking back to the future [^392309d1]. Pediatric Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Moyamoya is a chronic, progressive steno-occlusive arteriopathy that typically affects the anterior circulation arteries of the circle of Willis. A network of deep thalamoperforating and lenticulostriate collaterals develop to by-pass the occlusion giving rise to the characteristic angiographic "puff of smoke" appearance. Moyamoya confers a lifelong risk of stroke and neurological demise, with peak age of presentation in childhood ranging between five and 10 years. Moyamoya disease refers to patients who do not have a comorbid condition, whereas moyamoya syndrome refers to patients in whom moyamoya occurs in association with an acquired or inherited disorder such as sickle cell disease, neurofibromatosis type-1 or trisomy 21. The incidence of moyamoya disease and moyamoya syndrome demonstrates geographic and ethnic variation, with a predominance of moyamoya disease in East-Asian populations. Antiplatelet therapy and surgical revascularization procedures are the mainstay of management, as there are no available treatments to slow the progression of the arteriopathy. Future research is required to address the major gaps that remain in our understanding of the pathologic basis, optimal timing for surgery, and determinants of outcome in this high-stroke risk condition of childhood.

### Childhood moyamoya disease and moyamoya syndrome: a pictorial review [^619e9d28]. Pediatric Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Moyamoya disease is an uncommon chronic cerebrovasculopathy, characterized by progressive stenosis of the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and its main branches, in association with the development of compensatory collateral vessels at the base of the brain. The etiology is unknown, and was originally considered exclusive to East Asia, with particular prevalence in Japan. Moyamoya disease is increasingly diagnosed throughout the world, and represents an important cause of childhood stroke in Western countries. In some cases, similar angiographic features are evident in children with other medical conditions, such as sickle cell disease and Down syndrome. In these instances, the term "moyamoya syndrome" is used. Diagnosing the vasculopathy, excluding possible associated conditions, and planning treatment and follow-up imaging comprise important aspects of clinical management. We review the key imaging features of childhood moyamoya disease and syndrome, present examples of its associations, and discuss new neuroradiologic methods that may be useful in management.

### Surgery for moyamoya disease in children [^8fd38dd0]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Moyamoya disease is a chronic progressive cerebrovascular occlusive disease of the terminal portion of the internal carotid arteries associated with an acquired abnormal vascular network at the base of the brain, often leading to ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Moyamoya disease is a relatively common cause of pediatric stroke with a specific racial and well-identified clinical and imaging phenotype. Moyamoya disease is more prevalent in East Asian countries compared with other geographic regions with a higher incidence of familial cases and clinically more aggressive form. Moyamoya disease is one of the few causes of stroke that is amenable to effective surgical revascularization treatment. There are various surgical options available for revascularization, including the direct, indirect, or combined bypass techniques, each with variable responses. However, due to the heterogeneity of the diseases, different clinical course, geographical variables associated with the disease, and availability of a wide variety of surgical revascularization procedures, optimal selection of a surgical candidate and the surgical technique becomes challenging, particularly in the pediatric population. This brief review presents pertinent literature of clinical options for the diagnosis and surgical treatment of moyamoya disease in children.

THE DISEASE which produces an abnormal net-like blood vessel picture in the base of the brain might have been observed in our country during these 10 years. However, visualization of such an angiogram seems not to have been noticed as indicating a disease with characteristic features. In this disease, a stenosis or an occlusion is observed by carotid arteriography in the terminal part of the internal carotid artery. Furthermore, a net-like or fibrous-root-like dim picture of abnormal blood vessels is visualized over it. In some cases, there is a defect or an abnormality observed in the median or anterior cerebral artery. Under certain circumstances, the whole main arteries of the brain fall off from an angiogram. This disease appears bilaterally in most cases, although there are some differences. Suzuki J, Takaku A.

Introduction

Moyamoya disease (MMD) is an uncommon cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive stenosis and/or occlusion of the circle of Willis with an abnormally proliferative vascular network at the base of the skull (moyamoya vessels).MMD is a major cause of stroke with a relatively high risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events. This disease exhibits a diverse geographical distribution, with high incidence rates in East Asian countries, and a bimodal age of onset: 5–9 years of age and the middle 40s. The pathological hallmarks of MMD have already been reported via a detailed scientific autopsy of intracranial large arteries, while the natural history of moyamoya vessels has been carefully described using the Suzuki staging system. However, the aetiology and pathogenesis of MMD are not fully understood. Effective therapeutic strategies to alleviate disease deterioration and reverse disease progression are still lacking. Revascularization surgery is widely used to improve the vascular reserve capacity and prevent further cerebral vascular attacks, but postoperative hyperperfusion syndrome causes poor outcomes. Therefore, elucidation of the molecular mechanism of this disease might identify optimal treatments.

### Case report: moyamoya disease in a 47-year-old woman… [^0ccae57a]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: A 47-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, morbid obesity, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction presented to the emergency department with an acute episode of left-sided weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed an infarction of the right middle cerebral artery. The patient was diagnosed with Moyamoya disease by her neurologist because of her history of strokes and was prescribed aspirin and a statin to help prevent future strokes. Moyamoya disease is defined as chronic, occlusive strokes of unknown etiology that are characterized by bilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery and subsequent abnormal vasculature created in the brain. Diagnosis is by catheter angiography or magnetic resonance angiography showing stenosis of the internal carotid artery, anterior cerebral artery, or middle cerebral artery.

After further consultation with neurology and neurosurgery, computed tomography angiography of the head and neck showed a diffusely small-caliber right inferior cerebellar artery with stenosis or occlusion of the right paraclinoid internal carotid artery. The patient's symptoms worsened while being monitored in the hospital, with deteriorating left-sided hemiparesis and speech difficulties. She was immediately administered heparin intravenously. After stabilization, the patient was transitioned to 5 mg of apixaban twice per day and 81 mg of aspirin per day. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy to regain some of her left-sided extremity motor and sensory function. Common ischemic symptoms of Moyamoya disease include hemiparesis, dysarthria, aphasia, and cognitive impairment. 1 Genetic testing is available for the linked mutations associated with Moyamoya disease.

2 If detected early, surgical revascularization can be performed using the external carotid system by creating a direct bypass or pial synangiosis. 3 Pial synangiosis reroutes a section of the artery from the surface of the scalp to revascularize the ischemic area of the brain. Conservative management is not as beneficial as surgery; therefore, it is imperative to offer surgical interventions to patients with Moyamoya disease for a better prognosis. This rare case highlights the importance of further investigation in younger patients with a history of strokes.

Adult moyamoya disease — natural history in adults notes limited data primarily from retrospective series. In symptomatic patients in the United States managed conservatively, the 5-year risk of recurrent ischemic events is reported as high as 65% in patients with unilateral disease and 82% in those with bilateral involvement. Recurrent hemorrhage has been reported in Japanese populations to occur in ≈30% to 60% of patients over long-term follow-up. A Korean cohort of 206 hemodynamically stable patients with symptomatic MMD demonstrated 5- and 10-year stroke risks of 15% and 40% in the hemorrhagic subgroup and 17% and 33% in the ischemic subgroup. Progression of disease, from unilateral to bilateral and in both anterior and posterior circulation, can be evident in ≈20% of both symptomatic and asymptomatic adult patients, and has been associated with ischemic or hemorrhagic symptoms in > 50% of patients with progression. Patients with posterior circulation involvement may have more severe clinical manifestations at presentation.

This issue of Neurosurgical Focus is devoted to the topic of moyamoya disease/syndrome. When the senior editor (R.M.S.) was a neurosurgical resident in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the condition was virtually unknown in the Western hemisphere, and patients with "cerebrovascular insufficiency" and the typical arterial findings on angiography were believed to have a type of arteritis. The refinement of catheter angiography techniques and the development of the imaging modalities of CT and MR imaging clarified the significance of making the correct diagnosis of moyamoya disease in affected patients, and with the development of direct and then indirect revascularization procedures during this same period, neurosurgeons became involved in the disease's treatment.

### Moyamoya disease: a review of the disease and anesthetic management [^e2888d03]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

Moyamoya disease is a rare chronic cerebrovascular disease seen both in children and adults. It has a progressive course, but may have a variable clinical presentation. The disease causes ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, headache, seizures, and transient ischemia attack in children and in adults. Although the pathogenesis of the disease remains unknown, research suggests a genetic predisposition. There are also undefined systemic processes involved in this vasculopathy. Better noninvasive diagnostic techniques for diagnosis of the Moyamoya disease have been developed, but medical treatment can still be challenging. However, various surgical revascularization procedures have shown to provide symptomatic benefit in a majority of these patients. In addition, the anesthetic management of these patients has evolved over the years with an increased understanding of the disease. These have specifically resulted from the identification of risk factors for perioperative complications and outcomes related to the use of anesthetic agents. Finally, research in the last 3 decades has led to the recognition of the importance of pain control, the increased use of regional anesthesia, and better monitoring techniques in providing high quality and safe patient care to patients with Moyamoya disease. This article will provide a comprehensive review of the disease and its anesthetic management.

### Outcomes of bypass surgery in adult moyamoya disease by onset type [^0bb702f5]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the outcomes of bypass surgery in patients with adult moyamoya disease (MMD) with varying onset types?

Findings

In this population-based cohort study of 19 700 patients, bypass surgery was associated with reduced risk of death and hemorrhagic stroke in hemorrhagic MMD, ischemic stroke in ischemic MMD, and death in asymptomatic MMD; however, bypass was associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke in asymptomatic MMD. Both direct and indirect bypass showed similar outcomes in asymptomatic and hemorrhagic MMD, except that only direct bypass was associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke in ischemic MMD.

Meaning

These findings suggest that it may be beneficial to tailor management strategies for patients with adult MMD based on onset type.

Role of endovascular management in moyamoya disease — For ischemic moyamoya, endovascular treatment with stent or angioplasty has a low success rate (25%) and high complication rates, including devastating hemorrhage in 7% to 10%, without evidence of improved natural history. In hemorrhage associated with pseudoaneurysms of moyamoya collaterals, endovascular obliteration (typically distal parent vessel occlusion) can be used; open surgery has a complication rate of 21% to 70% and conservative treatment is associated with 40% rebleeding. Both endovascular direct obliteration and revascularization surgery are described as safe options with success rates of ≈80%.

### Incidence and prevalence of moyamoya disease in urban China: a nationwide retrospective cohort study [^a54801b0]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This research fills a gap in the incidence and prevalence of MMD in mainland China. Our results confirm that MMD is relatively common in East Asian populations, but the rates in China were lower than those in other East Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea. We recognised the higher incidence and prevalence in females compared with males and the bimodal age distribution, as previously reported. And some unique epidemiologic features, including a relatively weak female predominance and a shift in the highest peak of incidence from children to adults, revealed new sight into MMD. Although MMD is a rare disease, the disease burden is relatively heavy for patients due to the high hospitalisation rate, long hospital stays and increasing costs. Further research is warranted to examine the potential pathogenesis and appropriate therapeutic strategies, in order to manage this progressive cerebrovascular disease more cost-effectively.

### Adult moyamoya disease and syndrome: current perspectives and future directions: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^2608c643]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Adult moyamoya disease — evidence for revascularization shows benefit in hemorrhagic presentation and a guideline-supported role in ischemic prevention. In the Japan Adult Moyamoya trial, surgical revascularization (bilateral direct bypass) versus medical therapy for hemorrhagic moyamoya demonstrated a reduction in rebleeding with surgery (2.7%/y versus 7.6%/y; P = 0.04). A prespecified subgroup analysis showed that posterior hemorrhages are at higher risk of rebleeding and obtained greater benefit with the surgical intervention. Meta-analyses support the benefit of surgical revascularization for symptomatic moyamoya, although some found the benefit to be more evident in the hemorrhagic subgroup. For ischemic moyamoya, a class 2a, level of evidence C-limited data recommendation states that surgical revascularization (both direct or indirect) can be beneficial for the prevention of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.

### Concurrent Takayasu arteritis with common variable immunodeficiency and moyamoya disease [^c4bee11f]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Takayasu arteritis is a rare, chronic form of large vessel vasculitis that characteristically involves the aorta and its branches. Its origin and disease process are currently unknown, although T lymphocytes and, most recently, B cells are thought to play a role. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a collection of heterogeneous disorders resulting in an antibody deficiency and recurrent infections, and is the most common symptomatic primary immunodeficiency disorder. This report presents a unique case of possible Takayasu arteritis with a history of CVID in a young man admitted with multiple cerebrovascular accidents. Takayasu arteritis may serve as the main cause of this presentation. The rarity of this case is further accentuated by the presence of moyamoya disease. Finally, the possible disease process and novel treatment of Takayasu arteritis is discussed briefly.

### Novel epidemiological features of moyamoya disease [^fac03298]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Many clinical features that are specific to moyamoya disease have been reported and cited in textbooks based on previous data. The purpose of this study is to investigate the present epidemiological features of moyamoya disease based on recently obtained regional all-inclusive data.

Methods

The authors performed an all-inclusive survey of moyamoya disease in Hokkaido, one of the major islands in Japan that has a population of 5.63 million. The epidemiological features were analysed based on the data from 267 newly registered patients with moyamoya disease in Hokkaido from 2002 to 2006. These analysed data were adjusted to the whole Japanese population at 2005.

Results

The detection rate of the disease per year was 0.94 patients per 100,000 people, and prevalence was 10.5 patients per 100,000 people. The incidence of ischaemia concerned with the disease was 0.53 patients per 100,000 people-years and haemorrhage was 0.2 patients per 100,000 people-years. The ratio of female to male patients was 2.18. The ratio of patients aged 10 years and above to under 10 years of age at onset was 6.18. Two peaks for age of onset were seen: the highest was observed between 45 and 49 years, and the second between 5 and 9 years. Asymptomatic patients comprised 17.8% of the total number of patients.

Conclusion

The epidemiological features of moyamoya disease determined by this survey varied considerably from previous data. The detection rate and prevalence of the disease were higher than those reported previously. The highest peak of onset age was older than those reported previously. In addition, it was revealed that asymptomatic moyamoya patients are not always rare in Japan.

### Inheritance of moyamoya disease in a caucasian family [^164216d6]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Moyamoya disease is a very rare occlusive cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive stenosis or occlusion of the intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery and proximal cerebral arteries with an extensive network of fine collaterals. The aetiology and genetic susceptibility of moyamoya disease, especially in Caucasians, still remains unclear.

Methods and Results

We describe the cases of affected German father, daughter and son with juvenile stroke because of idiopathic moyamoya disease. The rare existing literature is reviewed and discussed.

Conclusions

This is the first report on a father-to-child inheritance pattern in Caucasian patients with idiopathic Moyamoya disease (MMD). Our cases indicate possible genetic risk factors for the genesis of Caucasian Moyamoya disease.

### Moyamoya disease: a review of histopathology, biochemistry, and genetics [^18d1b665]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Object

Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare cerebrovascular disorder involving stenosis of the major vessels of the circle of Willis and proximal portions of its principal branches. Despite concerted investigation, the pathophysiology of the disorder has not been fully elucidated. Currently, the major proteins believed to play an active role in the pathogenesis include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), transforming growth factor-β₁ (TGFβ₁), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). In terms of the genetics, recent literature suggests a low penetrance autosomal dominant or polygenic mode of transmission involving chromosomes 3, 6, 8, 12, and 17 for familial MMD. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the histopathology, pathophysiology and genetics of MMD.

Methods

A PubMed/Medline systematic study of the literature was performed, from which 45 articles regarding MMD pathophysiology were identified and analyzed.

Conclusions

Moyamoya disease is characterized by the intimal thickening and media attenuation of the proximal vessels of the circle of Willis as well as the development of an aberrant distal vascular network. The primary proteins that are currently implicated in the pathophysiology of MMD include VEGF, bFGF, HGF, TGFβ₁, and G-CSF. Furthermore, the current literature on familial MMD has pointed to a low penetrance autosomal dominant or polygenic mode of transmittance at loci on chromosomes 3, 6, 8, 12, and 17.

Moyamoya disease is a condition that results from bilateral stenosis or obstruction of the intracranial arteries at the base of the brain. Patients exhibit ischemic symptoms, and vascular reconstruction is the therapy of choice. Surgical treatment for Moyamoya disease is often complicated by cerebral ischemia, so the goal in perioperative management is to maintain the balance between oxygen supply and demand in the brain. This report presents three cases of Moyamoya disease in patients under 3 years of age, and discusses anesthesia management issues for pediatric patients with this condition.

Adult moyamoya disease — rescue revascularization options when standard bypass is not feasible have limited adult efficacy data. When the superficial temporal artery is hypoplastic or unavailable, a previous bypass failed, or the ischemic territory is in the anterior cerebral artery or posterior cerebral artery territory where bypasses are more technically challenging, rescue therapies such as multiple burr holes and omental flaps have been conducted. However, data on the efficacy of such procedures in adults are limited.

### Incidence and prevalence of moyamoya disease in urban China: a nationwide retrospective cohort study [^338a992f]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case identification

Patients with MMD were identified by diagnostic code or diagnostic text, based on International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision code I67.5, and medical terms in Chinese and English including MMD, spontaneous occlusion of the circle of Willis, abnormal vascular network at the base of the brain, moyamoya vessels and MMD. To avoid missing patients, we constructed a relatively loose algorithm using fuzzy string matching to extract all potential MMD patients in the database. Then two neurologists reviewed the diagnosis of each potential patient independently to ascertain the definite MMD patients. Patients were excluded if (1) they had been diagnosed with conditions associated with moyamoya syndrome (MMS), including arteriosclerosis, autoimmune disease, meningitis, brain neoplasm, von Recklinghausen disease, Down syndrome, head trauma, irradiation to the head, among others; or (2) the diagnostic text associated with MMD contained words such as 'uncertainty', 'undetermined', 'suspicious', '?' and other synonyms. The detailed process for case identification and ascertainment is described in online supplemental file 1.

### De novo development of moyamoya disease in an adult female. case report [^a4d53479]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

The origin of moyamoya disease remains unknown. The onset of the angiographically apparent changes of typical moyamoya disease occurs in childhood, but de novo development of the disease has not been confirmed angiographically. The authors report on a case of de novo development of moyamoya disease in a middle-aged female whose cerebral angiography demonstrated no abnormal findings 5 years previously. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this case is the first reported instance of de novo development of definite moyamoya disease verified angiographically. This case demonstrates that the de novo development of moyamoya disease in a middle-aged adult did in fact occur, and angiographically visible features of the disease took < 5 years to complete.

### Adult moyamoya disease and syndrome: current perspectives and future directions: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^f4a04a38]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Adult moyamoya disease — surgical revascularization approaches include direct, indirect, and combined techniques with distinct features and evidence gaps. Surgical treatment for moyamoya consists of revascularization procedures that can be broadly categorized as follows: (1) direct: creation of a direct extracranial-intracranial anastomosis, typically between the superficial temporal artery and middle cerebral artery; (2) indirect: apposition of extracranial tissues including the superficial temporal artery, galea, temporalis muscle, and inverted dura, onto the brain surface to form a synangiosis; or (3) combined. Direct bypass carries the benefits of immediate revascularization, whereas indirect bypass relies on angiogenic proliferation and arteriogenic maturation over days or weeks. Direct bypasses are more technically demanding with the potential for greater periprocedural complications, such as cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS). No prospective randomized controlled trials have addressed revascularization surgery for ischemic stroke prevention in moyamoya.

### The genetic landscape and clinical implication of pediatric moyamoya angiopathy in an international cohort [^035fca46]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Moyamoya angiopathy (MMA) is a progressive intracranial occlusive arteriopathy characterized by a stenosis of the distal portion of the internal carotid artery and involvement of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries. To compensate for the reduction in blood flow, the brain develops a compensatory angiogenetic response, thus producing an intracerebral network of small-caliber collaterals, which is responsible for a cloud-like appearance ("Moyamoya" in Japanese) in angiograms. Due to progressive reduction in brain perfusion, pediatric patients with MMA can suffer transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and strokes, representing the most common clinical presentations. Less common manifestations include seizures, headaches, choreiform movements, cognitive or psychiatric problems and, rarely, brain hemorrages. MMA has been frequently described in Japan, where it represents the most common pediatric cerebrovascular disease (prevalence and incidence up to 10.5:100,000 and 0.94:100,000, respectively), and, with up to 18 times lower incidence, also in individuals of American and European descent, although this could be due to lower disease awareness among clinicians. Interestingly, female individuals are affected more frequently compared to males.

Adult moyamoya disease — imaging diagnostic criteria (based on Fujimura, 2022) specify required findings for digital subtraction angiography: stenosis or occlusion in the arteries centered on the terminal portion of the intracranial internal carotid artery; moyamoya vessels (abnormal vascular networks in the vicinity of the occlusive or stenotic lesions in the arterial phase); and unilateral and bilateral involvement satisfy the diagnostic criteria. Required findings for MRI/MRA are stenosis/occlusion of the terminal portion of intracranial internal carotid artery; decreased outer diameter of the terminal portion of internal carotid artery and the horizontal portion of middle cerebral artery bilaterally on heavy T2-weighted MRI; and abnormal vascular networks in the basal ganglia or periventricular white matter on MRA.

### Rare variants in ANO1, encoding a calcium-activated chloride channel, predispose to moyamoya disease [^7db090cc]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Moyamoya disease, a cerebrovascular disease leading to strokes in children and young adults, is characterized by progressive occlusion of the distal internal carotid arteries and the formation of collateral vessels. Altered genes play a prominent role in the aetiology of moyamoya disease, but a causative gene is not identified in the majority of cases. Exome sequencing data from 151 individuals from 84 unsolved families were analysed to identify further genes for moyamoya disease, then candidate genes assessed in additional cases (150 probands). Two families had the same rare variant in ANO1, which encodes a calcium-activated chloride channel, anoctamin-1. Haplotype analyses found the families were related, and ANO1 p. Met658Val segregated with moyamoya disease in the family with an LOD score of 3.3. Six additional ANO1 rare variants were identified in moyamoya disease families. The ANO1 rare variants were assessed using patch-clamp recordings, and the majority of variants, including ANO1 p. Met658Val, displayed increased sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+. Patients harbouring these gain-of-function ANO1 variants had classic features of moyamoya disease, but also had aneurysm, stenosis and/or occlusion in the posterior circulation. Our studies support that ANO1 gain-of-function pathogenic variants predispose to moyamoya disease and are associated with unique involvement of the posterior circulation.

Methodological innovations for future research in moyamoya disease and syndrome highlight the role of real-world data (RWD), registry-based randomized clinical trials, and adaptive trial designs. The document defines that "RWD refers to data related to patients' health obtained from routine clinical care" and that "The systematic collection of this type of information is essential for the development of meaningful research in rare diseases", noting that "Models of this methodology are in use for medical and pharmacological studies, including the US Food and Drug Administration Sentinel System and the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink". It further states that "Clinical trial integration methods facilitate the collection of outcome and adverse events data using RWD" and that "For this design, outcomes need to have little diagnostic variability", with objective outcomes such as "stroke or standardized functional and cognitive evaluations" having "a lower likelihood of being affected by the lack of blinding". Regarding trial design, "Designs, like registry-based randomized clinical trials, require first the establishment of high-quality observational registries", after which "a registry-based randomized clinical trial can build on the high-quality registry by leveraging clinical information already collected". Until such registries are available, "randomized controlled trials in this disease will need to maximize the data collected from relevant participants in the most efficient manner possible", and "adaptive randomization, selection and ranking methods, sample size re-estimation, and probabilistic Bayesian analyses should be strongly considered". Implementation "requires collaboration among clinicians, statisticians, and funding agencies", and while "the initial costs of establishing these partnerships and executing complex trial designs may be high, they promise long-term benefits", including "the generation of more rigorous, applicable knowledge, and the development of effective treatments for MMD and MMS".

### Isolated anterior cerebral artery occlusion: an atypical form of moyamoya disease [^cd0410c9]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Isolated ACA occlusion has unique clinical features, such as akinetic mutism, aphasia and cognitive decline. The treatment of vascular occlusion caused by MMD is different from that caused by other aetiologies, and conventional surgical revascularisation treatment for MMD does not always directly benefit the ACA blood supply territory. Therefore, it is meaningful to study the clinical features, genetic background and natural history of patients with ACA-occlusive MMD. We also evaluated risk factors contributing to ACA-occlusive MMD progression and attempted to elucidate the relationship between ACA occlusion and MMD.

Clinical presentation of MMD and MMS can be grouped into ischemic and hemorrhagic events, other neurological manifestations, and symptoms of associated diseases, with ischemic and hemorrhagic forms of stroke most commonly recognized; ischemia typically involves the anterior circulation with border zone areas most commonly affected and causes include hypoperfusion, thromboembolism, and combined mechanisms, whereas hemorrhage most commonly presents with intracranial or intraventricular patterns and may relate to pseudoaneurysms of moyamoya collaterals or Circle of Willis aneurysm formation and rupture leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage; additional manifestations include neurocognitive impairments even without prior stroke and highly pervasive headaches with migraine-like features, and tabled features detail transient ischemic attacks and strokes in carotid branches and watershed with hemodynamic triggers (fever, dehydration, physical activity, hyperventilation, hypercapnoeic conditions), hemorrhagic events usually intracerebral or intraventricular due to rupture of deep neovascularization collaterals and pseudoaneurysms with occasional associated aneurysms, other neurological symptoms such as migraine, tension-type, hemiplegic migraine, cluster headaches, neurocognitive impairment likely from chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, secondary movement disorders, and symptoms from associated conditions including lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell disease, Neurofibromatosis 1, and Down syndrome; MMD is an exclusion diagnosis and possible causes of MMS should be excluded to confirm MMD.

### Moyamoya syndrome in a patient with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome associated with a SAMHD1 mutation: a case report [^9e88a4b5]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Reason to report

Aicardi-Goutières syndrome is a rare congenital multisystem disease of genetic origin, and its manifestations resemble those of an intrauterine infection; therefore, TORCH infection (toxoplasmosis, others, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes) is its main differential diagnosis. The classic brain imaging features — leukoencephalopathy, striatal necrosis, intracranial calcifications and atrophy — are well known. Recently, another radiological pattern characterized by large-vessel stenosis, including moyamoya syndrome, and ischaemic lesions, has been reported, mainly with SAMHD1 mutation.

What was unique

We report a case of a moyamoya syndrome from this unusual cause, in a young child.

Ramification of this report

The radiologist must be aware of such arterial anomalies, which are poorly reported in the radiological literature, and search for them when performing brain magnetic resonance for Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, even in the absence of a genetic diagnosis. Moreover, in an infant or young child with moyamoya syndrome, Aicardi-Goutières syndrome should be included in the differential diagnoses.

### Variant and infectious burden associated with intracranial artery stenosis in moyamoya disease [^5967fc5a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this prospective cohort study, we demonstrated the genetic and environmental factors associated with the progression of MMD. The study first investigated the profiles of infectious virus burden and their significant differences in varying degrees of progress in MMD. We further constructed multivariate regression models to analyze variables associated with intracranial artery stenosis. IB and RNF213 genotypes were noticeably related to the risk of circle of Willis involvement. In addition, the RNF213 variant was significantly associated with posterior circulation involvement. In patients with a high risk of modifiable factors, IB was more strongly associated with the degree of intracranial artery stenosis. Collectively, our study outlined a novel perspective of the genetic‐environmental interactions in the progression of MMD and provided important insights into the role of RNF213.

In the present study, we constructed a modified IB score by combining 7 antibodies against neurotrophic pathogens. The score was verified to be effective for the prediction of intracranial artery stenosis in patients with MMD. Neurotrophic pathogens, including herpes viruses (herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein‐Barr virus), rubella virus, and toxoplasma, could lead to various neurological disorders. As infectious environmental factors accumulate in patients, the pathogens trigger the multiple effects that induce pathophysiological processes. The composite serological antibody titers were calculated as the IB index to determine the association between infectious pathogens and the risk of stroke in the previous study. There was evidence that herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus contribute to atherosclerosis and vasculopathy. Mehta et al revealed that herpes simplex virus‐2 and cytomegalovirus exposures were associated with a higher risk of intracranial artery stenosis. The underlying pathogenesis of MMD has been pointed toward genetics and immune responses. Increasing clinical studies demonstrated the evidence linking moyamoya vasculopathy to autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases. Although moyamoya syndrome has been confirmed to be secondary to various autoimmune diseases, IB was still the significant factor associated with the disease progression after excluding patients with moyamoya syndrome in our study. It can be seen that infectious environmental exposure is the key mechanism for the onset and development of MMD. Infections of cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus have been previously described to be related to MMD. However, a recent study showed negative results of viral infections in MMD, indicating other critical factors may also interact with the pathogenesis.

### Moyamoya disease: a summary [^8551965e]. Neurosurgical Focus (2009). Low credibility.

Moyamoya, meaning a "hazy puff of smoke" in Japanese, is a chronic, occlusive cerebrovascular disease involving bilateral stenosis or occlusion of the terminal portion of the internal carotid arteries (ICAs) and/or the proximal portions of the anterior cerebral arteries and middle cerebral arteries (MCAs). The Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan has defined 4 types of moyamoya disease (MMD): ischemic, hemorrhagic, epileptic, and "other". The ischemic type has been shown to predominate in childhood, while the hemorrhagic type is more often observed in the adult population. The highest prevalence of MMD is found in Japan, with a higher female to male ratio. Studies have shown a possible genetic association of MMD linked to chromosome 17 in Japanese cases as well as in cases found in other demographics. During autopsy, intracerebral hematoma is found and most commonly serves as the major cause of death in patients with MMD. Moyamoya vessels at the base of the brain are composed of medium-sized or small muscular arteries emanating from the circle of Willis, mainly the intracranial portions of ICAs, anterior choroidal arteries, and posterior cerebral arteries, forming complex channels that connect with distal positions of the MCAs. Off of these channels are small tortuous and dilated vessels that penetrate into the base of the brain at the site of the thalamoperforate and lenticulostriate arteries. On angiography, there is the characteristic stenosis or occlusion bilaterally at the terminal portion of the ICAs as well as the moyamoya vessels at the base of the brain. Six angiographic stages have been described, from Stage 1, which reveals a narrowing of the carotid forks, to Stage 6, in which the moyamoya vessels disappear and collateral circulation is produced solely from the external carotid arteries. Cases with milder symptoms are usually treated conservatively; however, more severe symptomatic cases are treated using revascularization procedures. Surgical treatments are divided into 3 types: direct, indirect, and combined/other methods. Direct bypass includes superficial temporal artery-MCA bypass or use of other graft types. Indirect procedures bring in circulation to the intracranial regions by introducing newly developed vasculature from newly approximated tissues. These procedures may not be enough to prevent further ischemia; therefore, a combination of direct and indirect procedures is more suitable. This article will give a review of the epidemiology, natural history, pathology, pathophysiology, and diagnostic criteria, including imaging, and briefly describe the surgical treatment of MMD.

### Down syndrome and moyamoya disease: unusual cause of stroke [^a1bced80]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Down syndrome is a frequent clinical entity, being considered one of the most frequent chromosomal aberrations. It is characterised by a typical clinical phenotype and is associated with a heterogeneous group of organ and system-specific abnormalities. The cardiovascular system is commonly affected and if so, it may be associated with an increased morbidity and mortality. Cerebrovascular events in patients with Down syndrome are multifactorial, being possibly related to congenital heart disease, vascular malformations and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Moyamoya disease is a rare chronic occlusive vascular disease causing stenosis of the distal portion of the internal carotid artery, which has been associated with Down syndrome. The authors report the case of a 26-year-old woman with Down syndrome who presented with an acute stroke secondary to Moyamoya disease. The case is noteworthy for the rarity of this clinicopathological entity, and serves as a reminder for the possible association between these two conditions.

Moyamoya disease — management of additional vascular risk factors: "The control of additional cerebrovascular stroke risk factors is important in the medical management of MMD". Diabetes "is an independent predictor of recurrent ischemic stroke in nonsurgical and surgically treated patients", and "Hypertension and dyslipidemia are known risk factors for cerebrovascular events in patients with initial asymptomatic MMD". "Increased body mass index and homocysteine might also be associated with a higher risk of MMD". After surgical revascularization, "atorvastatin use… was shown to improve collateral circulation on postoperative digital subtraction angiography", and "In patients without moyamoya vasculopathy, atorvastatin has been shown to reduce the frequency of migraine headaches, but this has not been specifically evaluated in patients with moyamoya vasculopathy".

### Prevalence of autoimmune disease in moyamoya disease patients in Western Chinese population [^a61e8341]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of moyamoya remains to be elucidated and an immunologic basis has been suggested. For gaining further insight into the pathogenesis of moyamoya, we explored the epidemiological characteristics of autoimmune disease in moyamoya disease (MMD) in Western Chinese population. Retrospective clinical characteristic analysis of patients with angiographically confirmed MMD was performed and compared with the general Chinese population. A significantly higher prevalence of autoimmune disease was observed, particularly type 1 diabetes mellitus (P < 0.001, 7.0% vs 1.2%, χ(2) test) and Graves disease (P < 0.001, 7.0% vs 0.34%, χ(2) test) in the general Chinese population. The overall prevalence of autoimmune disease in MMD was up to 31.0% (44/142). This study suggested higher overall prevalence of autoimmune disease in MMD in Western China when compared with the general Chinese population. The findings further supported that autoimmune abnormality might associate with MMD and autoimmune component to pathogenesis of moyamoya vasculopathy.
