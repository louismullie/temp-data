## Question

Germline genetic testing in pancreatic cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about germline genetic testing in pancreatic cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength and scope of current guideline recommendations. Then, I should verify the prevalence and clinical significance of pathogenic germline variants. Next, I will examine therapeutic implications that justify universal testing. After that, I need to assess family implications and cascade testing. I will then review which genes to test and how to test, including timing and logistics. I should also consider surveillance for high-risk relatives and the role of tumor profiling. Finally, I will address implementation barriers and propose practical solutions, before summarizing the clinical bottom line with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the guideline stance, because I need to ensure I am not overstating the recommendation. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on universal germline testing for all patients with exocrine pancreatic cancer: NCCN explicitly recommends germline testing for any patient with confirmed pancreatic cancer using comprehensive panels, and ASCO's provisional clinical opinion supports germline assessment for all patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma irrespective of family history, while ESMO recommends BRCA testing in all metastatic cases and broader germline evaluation in appropriate contexts, and ACMG/ASCO 2024 guidance affirms that testing criteria can be straightforward for some cancers, including exocrine pancreatic cancer, supporting universal germline testing in this setting [^1149xJcF] [^1118TtnX] [^111tHcTX] [^114uWZgA].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for universality rather than family-history–based testing, because that is often where clinicians hesitate. The prevalence of clinically significant germline variants in pancreatic cancer is approximately 4–10% overall, and importantly, a substantial proportion of carriers lack a suggestive family history; for example, 5.2% of patients without a family history harbored pathogenic germline variants in a large series, and across cohorts, roughly half of carriers would be missed by family-history–only criteria, which explains why guidelines moved to universal testing rather than selective testing based on pedigree alone [^115S6BEw] [^116sJYt2] [^112aC6GT].

> I will now examine the therapeutic implications, since this is the crux of why testing should be done early. Germline BRCA1/2 and other homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathogenic variants confer sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy and eligibility for PARP inhibitor maintenance after platinum response; the POLO trial established olaparib maintenance after ≥ 16 weeks of platinum without progression in BRCA-mutated metastatic PDAC, and observational data show markedly higher objective response rates to platinum in BRCA/PALB2 carriers, supporting early identification to guide first-line regimen selection and maintenance planning [^114onNqQ] [^116BFgFz]. Hold on, I should verify broader DNA repair implications: beyond BRCA, ATM and PALB2 carriers also demonstrate benefit from platinum backbones, and MSI-high/MMR-deficient tumors respond to pembrolizumab, underscoring the need to test for both germline and somatic alterations that are therapeutically actionable [^113wVser] [^114jottR].

> Next, I should review family implications and cascade testing, because this is frequently underappreciated. Identification of a pathogenic germline variant in a patient with PDAC enables predictive testing of first-degree relatives, who have a 50% chance of carrying the same variant; for BRCA2, ATM, and other moderate-penetrance genes, pancreatic cancer surveillance may be appropriate depending on family history and gene-specific risk, and professional societies recommend offering genetic counseling to at-risk relatives and considering enrollment in surveillance programs at experienced centers [^1149xJcF] [^111uFsLf] [^111YKr5n]. Let me double-check surveillance thresholds: CAPS and ASGE endorse surveillance for individuals with specific germline variants or strong family history, typically starting at age 50 or 10 years younger than the youngest affected family member, using annual EUS and/or MRI in expert centers, while acknowledging that evidence quality varies and decisions should be individualized [^111uFsLf] [^111HNU77].

> I need to ensure I am precise about which genes to include and why. The most frequent clinically significant germline findings in PDAC include BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, CDKN2A, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, STK11, and TP53, with additional consideration of genes like BARD1, BRIP1, and CHEK2 in broader hereditary panels; comprehensive multigene testing via CLIA/CAP-certified laboratories is preferred over limited or direct-to-consumer testing to maximize yield and clinical interpretability [^1149xJcF] [^112aC6GT] [^116sJYt2]. Hold on, I should verify ATM-specific guidance: ACMG notes moderate pancreatic cancer risk for ATM carriers and supports consideration of surveillance in the presence of family history, ideally in trials or expert centers, reflecting evolving but still consensus-based recommendations [^112w8f8N].

> Let me consider timing and logistics, because delays can cost therapeutic opportunities. Early germline testing at diagnosis ensures results are available before first-line treatment decisions, and multiple implementation studies show that mainstreamed, clinician-led ordering with selective post-test counseling dramatically increases uptake and timeliness without compromising detection rates. Automated referrals and standardized workflows can raise testing rates from the teens to 38–71% in real-world settings, addressing common barriers like forgetting to order, time constraints, and limited genetic counseling capacity [^116BSGyU] [^111EW59N] [^117G4GaA]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "all patients must see a genetic counselor before testing", but that traditional model creates bottlenecks; the newer mainstreaming approach uses pre-test education and consents in clinic with post-test counseling for positives, which is acceptable and effective in many programs [^111EW59N].

> I should confirm the complementary role of tumor profiling, since germline testing alone can miss somatic-only targets. Tumor molecular profiling via NGS increases actionable findings approximately fivefold beyond germline testing alone, identifying fusions like NTRK and actionable alterations in KRAS, BRAF, HER2, MSI/dMMR, and TMB; RNA-based assays improve fusion detection, and cell-free DNA is reasonable when tissue is insufficient, so combining germline and tumor testing provides the most complete therapeutic roadmap [^114UL8C1] [^117Sv56o]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines align with this dual approach: NCCN and ASCO explicitly recommend both germline testing for all and tumor profiling for advanced disease to guide therapy and trials, which matches this practice pattern [^117Sv56o] [^114hkvCi].

> Next, I should review surveillance for high-risk individuals, and I need to be careful not to overgeneralize. Surveillance is not for the general population due to low incidence and potential harms; it is reserved for those with substantially elevated risk, typically defined as > 5% lifetime risk, such as those with familial pancreatic cancer, specific pathogenic variants, or strong family history, with modalities of EUS and MRI/MRCP in experienced centers and enrollment in registries or trials when possible [^111uFsLf] [^111ZXVJm]. Let me reconsider BRCA1-specific screening: while some guidelines suggest screening for BRCA1 carriers, the magnitude of pancreatic risk is lower and evidence quality is limited, so shared decision-making is essential to balance potential benefits against false positives and overtreatment risks [^115ub9dd].

> I will now examine implementation barriers and practical solutions, because poor uptake undermines guideline intent. Real-world studies consistently show suboptimal testing rates despite universal recommendations, with barriers including provider forgetfulness, time constraints, limited counseling resources, insurance issues, and patient factors like distance and disease severity; system-level fixes such as EMR prompts, automated referrals, mainstreamed ordering, and telemedicine-based counseling have measurably improved uptake and timeliness, and should be prioritized to close the gap [^117AQSuY] [^115C4H7j] [^116BSGyU]. But wait, what if disparities persist? Equity-focused outreach and simplified logistics are necessary to ensure access across racial, geographic, and socioeconomic strata, as highlighted by implementation science reports and health equity analyses in pancreatic cancer care [^115C4H7j].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical bottom line is clear and actionable. Universal germline genetic testing is now standard of care for all patients with exocrine pancreatic cancer because it identifies actionable variants in roughly 4–10% of patients, informs selection of platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitor maintenance, enables cascade testing and risk management for relatives, and integrates with tumor profiling to optimize targeted therapy and trial options; early, streamlined implementation workflows are essential to realize these benefits in routine practice [^1149xJcF] [^1118TtnX] [^114onNqQ] [^114UL8C1].

Germline genetic testing is **recommended for all patients with pancreatic cancer** [^1149xJcF] [^1118TtnX] because ~10% harbor pathogenic germline variants [^112aC6GT] [^115S6BEw] that guide therapy and inform family risk [^116sJYt2]. The most common are BRCA1/2, ATM, PALB2, and mismatch repair genes [^112aC6GT]; **BRCA1/2 and PALB2** predict benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors [^114onNqQ] [^116BFgFz], while **MMR defects** enable immunotherapy [^114jottR]. Testing should be offered at diagnosis with pre-test counseling [^116sJYt2] [^114Ui6xX], ideally using multigene panels [^114uWZgA], and results guide treatment and cascade testing for relatives [^116sJYt2] [^116BSGyU]. Early testing ensures timely access to targeted therapies and improves outcomes [^116BSGyU] [^116sJYt2].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **NCCN guidelines**: Recommend germline testing for all patients with confirmed pancreatic cancer, using comprehensive gene panels for hereditary cancer syndromes [^1149xJcF] [^112Vcwfo].

- **ASCO guidelines**: Recommend early germline and somatic testing for actionable genomic alterations, including BRCA mutations and MSI/MMR deficiency [^114hkvCi] [^116ZJzP1].

- **ESMO guidelines**: Recommend BRCA testing in all metastatic pancreatic cancer patients to determine eligibility for platinum-based chemotherapy followed by maintenance olaparib [^111tHcTX] [^111wJomg].

---

## Frequency and clinical significance of germline mutations

Approximately 10% of pancreatic cancer patients harbor **pathogenic germline mutations** [^112aC6GT] [^115S6BEw], including:

| **Gene** | **Clinical significance** | **Therapeutic implications** |
|-|-|-|
| BRCA1/2 | DNA repair defects | - Platinum sensitivity <br/> - PARP inhibitors [^114onNqQ] [^113y3cxH] |
| ATM | DNA repair defects | - Platinum sensitivity <br/> - PARP inhibitors [^notfound] |
| PALB2 | DNA repair defects | - Platinum sensitivity <br/> - PARP inhibitors [^113wVser] |
| MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 | Mismatch repair defects | Immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) [^114jottR] |

---

## Impact on treatment decisions

Germline testing **directly informs therapy**:

- **Platinum-based chemotherapy**: Recommended for patients with BRCA mutations [^111wJomg] [^113b3Bik].

- **PARP inhibitors**: Olaparib is approved as maintenance therapy for BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer after platinum-based chemotherapy [^114onNqQ] [^111tHcTX].

- **Immunotherapy**: Pembrolizumab is recommended for MSI-high/MMR-deficient tumors [^114jottR] [^113y3cxH].

---

## Benefits for family members

Germline testing enables **cascade testing**, allowing relatives to learn their risk and pursue surveillance or preventive measures [^114Ui6xX]. Relatives of carriers have a higher risk of pancreatic and other cancers, and targeted surveillance can improve early detection [^111ZXVJm] [^111uFsLf].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Genetic counseling**: Essential for informed consent and result interpretation, but access can be limited [^114Ui6xX] [^117AQSuY].

- **Variants of uncertain significance (VUS)**: Can complicate management and cause anxiety [^notfound].

- **Insurance coverage**: Variable and may limit access for some patients [^115NzU8o].

---

## Clinical outcomes and survival

Patients with germline BRCA mutations have improved responses to platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors, translating into **better survival** [^116BFgFz] [^111T1kGa]. Early identification of actionable mutations enables timely targeted therapy, improving outcomes [^116BSGyU] [^116sJYt2].

---

## Current barriers to implementation

- **Low uptake**: Despite guidelines, uptake remains suboptimal due to logistical and educational barriers [^117AQSuY] [^115C4H7j].

- **Provider awareness**: Limited knowledge and time constraints hinder consistent testing [^117AQSuY].

- **Patient factors**: Anxiety, lack of awareness, and logistical challenges limit participation [^115NzU8o] [^117AQSuY].

---

## Strategies to improve uptake

- **Mainstreaming**: Oncologist-led testing with genetic counselor support increases uptake [^111EW59N] [^117AQSuY].

- **Education**: Provider and patient education improves awareness and acceptance [^111EW59N] [^1153uW5a].

- **Workflow integration**: Systematic approaches and EMR prompts facilitate testing [^117G4GaA] [^111akoKE].

---

Germline genetic testing is **recommended for all pancreatic cancer patients** [^1149xJcF] because it identifies actionable mutations that guide therapy and inform family risk [^116sJYt2]. Early, systematic testing with genetic counseling improves access to targeted therapies and enhances outcomes [^116BSGyU] [^116sJYt2].

Familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) risk and screening threshold: Epidemiologic data suggest that up to 10% of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients will have a first- or second-degree relative with PC, and segregation analyses of families with multiple PC cases report an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern with a 32% lifetime risk for PC development at age 85 years. Within FPC kindreds, individuals with one or two PC-affected first-degree relatives have a risk ranging from 4- to 7-fold, whereas those with ≥ 3 affected first-degree relatives have a risk ranging from 17 to 32-fold. Given population incidence, it is not feasible to screen for PC because of its low incidence in the general population with an estimated lifetime risk in the United States of 1.4% in 2013; expert opinion has recommended that individuals with a relative risk of more than fivefold when compared with the general population warrant consideration for PC surveillance, and candidates for PC surveillance are limited at this time to unaffected individuals from pancreatic cancer–prone families who are candidates for pancreatic surgery.

### Adherence to NCCN genetic testing guidelines in pancreatic cancer and impact on treatment [^1158FyjY]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study supports the results of previous studies and underscores the challenges of universal germline testing and somatic testing in metastatic disease. Early results of genetic testing can have a significant impact on treatment decisions and patient outcomes. With a growing number of targeted drugs being investigated in clinical trials, the need for genetic testing will only become more critical. However, progression or intolerance to first-line treatment remains a barrier for existing approved targeted treatments and clinical trial candidacy. Initiatives to increase testing are needed but must be feasible in real-world clinic settings. While we did not identify differences in germline testing by race additional efforts must be undertaken to identify and unravel the barriers to germline testing for minority populations generally.

Mutation carriers

Germline mutations in the BRCA2, PALB2, p16, STK11, ATM, PRSS1 genes and the hereditary colon cancer (Lynch syndrome) genes, are associated with significantly increased risk of PC. Mutations in these genes explain only ∼10% of the familial susceptibility to PC. Individuals with PC susceptibility gene mutations may not have many affected family members. Patients with apparently sporadic pancreatic cancer can have mutations in BRCA2, as can those without a family history of breast, ovarian cancer. Incomplete or low penetrance is a common feature of familial PC susceptibility gene mutations.

Patients with Peutz–Jeghers syndrome, regardless of family history, should be considered for screening (agree 96%, grade moderate, 'do it').

Patients with Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (who generally carry germline STK11 gene mutations) have a very high (132-fold) risk of PC. Lifetime cumulative risk to age 65–70 for PC in patients with Peutz–Jeghers syndrome is 11–36%.

BRCA2 mutation carriers with one or more affected FDR with PC (agree 85.7%, grade low, 'probably do it') and those with two or more affected family members (even without a FDR) (agree 89.8%, grade low, 'probably do it') should be considered for screening.

Germline BRCA2 gene mutations account for the highest percentage of known causes of inherited PC. These have been identified in 5–17% of familial PC kindreds. The RR of PC in BRCA2 gene mutation carriers is 3.5 (95% CI 1.87 to 6.58). Individuals with Jewish ancestry and a family history of PC should be considered for genetic counselling and testing for the founder BRCA2 gene mutation, 6174delT, present in 1% of Ashkenazi Jewish individualsand 4% of patients with PC. It has not been established that the risk of PC in BRCA1 gene mutation carriers is increased. One cohort study found a modest increased risk of pancreatic cancer (RR = 2.3). No agreement was reached on the question of screening BRCA2 mutation carriers with no family history of PC (agree 51.1%), or for BRCA1 mutation carriers with one affected FDR or two affective relatives but no FDR (agree 69.4%).

### Development of a novel protocol for germline testing in pancreatic cancer [^111akoKE]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines now recommend universal germline genetic testing (GGT) for all pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. Testing provides information on actionable pathogenic variants and guides management of patients and family. Since traditional genetic counseling (GC) models are time-intensive and GC resources are sparse, new approaches are needed to comply with guidelines without overwhelming available resources.

Methods

A novel protocol was developed for physician-led GGT. Completed test kits were delivered to the GC team, who maintained a prospective database and mailed all orders. If results revealed pathogenic variants for PDAC, patients were offered comprehensive GC, whereas negative and variant of uncertain significance (VUS) test results were reported to patients via brief calls.

Results

During protocol implementation between January 2020 and December 2022, 310 (81.5%) patients underwent GGT, with a physician compliance rate of 82.6% and patient compliance rate of 98.7%. Of 310 patients tested, 44 (14.2%) patients had detection of pathogenic variants, while 83 (26.8%) patients had VUS. Pathogenic variants included BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2 (n = 18, 5.8%), ATM (n = 9, 2.9%), CFTR (n = 4, 1.3%), EPCAM/MLH1/MSH2/MSH6/PMS2 (n = 3, 1.0%), and CDKN2A (n = 2, 0.7%). The GC team successfully contacted all patients with pathogenic variants to discuss results and offer comprehensive GC.

Conclusion

Our novel protocol facilitated GGT with excellent compliance despite limited GC resources. This framework for GGT allocates GC resources to those patients who would benefit most from GC. As we continue to expand the program, we seek to implement methods to ensure compliance with cascade testing of high-risk family members.

### ACG clinical guideline: genetic testing and management of hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes [^116Lixjg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Hereditary pancreatic cancer — genetic evaluation guidance indicates that referral for genetic assessment for familial atypical multiple melanoma and mole syndrome (FAMMM) should be considered in a pancreatic cancer (PC) patient with a personal or family history of melanoma or multiple dysplastic nevi; consideration for genetic counseling for testing for hereditary pancreatitis is based on expert opinion and warranted for PC patients with a personal history of at least 2 attacks of acute pancreatitis of unknown etiology, a family history of pancreatitis, or early-age onset chronic pancreatitis; familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) is defined by consensus as families with ≥ 2 FDRs relatives who do not meet criteria for a known PC-associated hereditary syndrome.

### Endoscopic innovations in diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer: a narrative review and future directions [^112esdrC]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cancer serves as the third leading cause of cancer-associated morbidity and mortality in the United States, with a 5-year survival rate of only 12% with an expected increase in incidence and mortality in the coming years. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas constitute most pancreatic malignancies. Certain genetic syndromes, including Lynch syndrome, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, hereditary pancreatitis, familial adenomatous polyposis, Peutz–Jeghers syndrome, familial pancreatic cancer mutation, and ataxia telangiectasia, confer a significantly higher risk. Screening for pancreatic malignancies currently targets patients with germline mutations or those with significant family history. Screening the general population is not currently viable owing to overall low incidence and lack of specific tests. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and its applied advances are increasingly being used for surveillance, diagnosis, and management of pancreatic malignancies and have now become an indispensable tool in their management. For patients with risk factors, EUS in combination with magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is used for screening. The role of endoscopic modalities has been expanding with the increased utilization of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, EUS-directed therapies include EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration and EUS-fine-needle biopsy (FNB). EUS combined with FNB has the highest specificity and sensitivity for detecting pancreatic cancer amongst available modalities. Studies also recognize that artificial intelligence assisted EUS in the early detection of pancreatic cancer. At the same time, surgical resection has been historically considered the only curative treatment for pancreatic cancer, over 80% of patients present with unresectable disease. We also discuss EUS-guided therapies of physicochemicals (radiofrequency ablation, brachytherapy, and intratumor chemotherapy), biological agents (gene therapies and oncolytic viruses), and immunotherapy. We aim to perform a detailed review of the current burden, risk factors, role of screening, diagnosis, and endoscopic advances in the treatment modalities available for pancreatic cancer.

### Mainstreaming germline genetic testing for patients with pancreatic cancer increases uptake [^111EW59N]. Familial Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Germline genetic testing is recommended for all patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) but uptake rates are low. We implemented a mainstreaming program in oncology clinics to increase testing for PC patients. Genetic counselors trained oncology providers to offer a standardized multigene panel and obtain informed consent using an educational video. Pre-test genetic counseling was available upon request. Otherwise, patients with identified pathogenic variants, strong family history, or questions regarding their results were referred for post-test genetic counseling. We measured rates of testing and genetic counseling visits. From September 2019 to April 2021, 245 patients with PC underwent genetic testing. This represents a 6.5-fold increase in germline testing volume (95% confidence interval 5.2–8.1) compared to previous years. At least one pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant (PV/LPV) was found in 34 (13.9%) patients, including 17 (6.9%) PV/LPVs in high or moderate risk genes and 18 (7.3%) in low risk or recessive genes. Five (2.0%) PVs had implications on treatment selection. 22 of the positive patients (64.7%) and an additional 8 PC patients (1 negative, 3 VUS, and 4 pre-test) underwent genetic counseling during the study period. Genetic counselors saw 2.0 PC patients/month prior to this project, 1.6 PC patients/month during this project, and would have seen 2.2 PC patients/month if all patients with pathogenic variants attended post-test counseling. Conclusions Mainstreaming genetic testing expands access for PC patients without overwhelming genetic counseling resources.

### ASGE guideline on screening for pancreatic cancer in individuals with genetic susceptibility: summary and recommendations [^115ub9dd]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2022). High credibility.

ASGE guideline — BRCA1 pathogenic variant screening: Recommendation 3b states, In individuals with BRCA1 pathogenic variant, we suggest screening for pancreatic cancer compared with no screening (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Evidence summarized for BRCA1 showed a pooled relative risk of pancreatic cancer of 1.9 (95% CI, 1.0–2.8; p = 0.28, I² = 21.0) with a cumulative lifetime risk to age 80 of 3.5%, and a pooled standardized incidence ratio of 3.7 (95% CI, 2.5–4.8; p = 0.45, I² = .0) with a cumulative lifetime risk to age 80 of 3.8%; the magnitude of association did not appear to cross our threshold of 5% lifetime risk. Given this, clinicians should initiate screening with caution, and screening may not be warranted in patients who place a high value on avoiding harms from medical interventions. Additional context notes that BRCA1/2 germline pathogenic variants affect up to 7% of all patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and in a study of 71 patients with pancreatic cancer and BRCA1 (n = 21), BRCA2 (n = 49), or both (n = 1), a family history of pancreatic cancer (first- or second-degree relative) was noted in only 33%.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115SXVgQ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — clinical classification and recommended presurgical testing: For clinical purposes, however, most NCCN Member Institutions use a clinical classification system based mainly on results of presurgical imaging studies. For individuals with no evidence of metastatic disease, the Panel recommends chest and pelvis CT (and endoscopic ultrasound [EUS], and/or MRI if clinically indicated for indeterminate liver lesions, and/or PET/CT or MRI for patients with high risk to detect extra-pancreatic metastases), with additional testing that can include endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to stent when indicated, liver function tests and baseline CA 19–9 in a decompressed patient, genetic counseling, and germline testing. For patients with confirmed tumors on imaging, disease is classified as: 1) resectable; 2) borderline resectable (ie, tumors that are involved with nearby structures so as to be neither clearly resectable nor clearly unresectable with a high chance of an R1 resection); 3) locally advanced (ie, tumors that are involved with nearby structures to an extent that renders them unresectable despite the absence of evidence of metastatic disease); 4) unresectable at surgery; or 5) metastatic. For patients with evidence of metastatic disease, the Panel recommends a biopsy confirmation preferably from a metastatic site followed by genetic testing for inherited mutations, molecular profiling of tumor tissues, and complete staging with chest and pelvis CT.

### Metastatic pancreatic cancer: ASCO guideline update [^116ZJzP1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pancreatic cancer, more specifically with respect to genetic testing, ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain early testing for actionable genomic alterations in patients being potential candidates for additional treatment after first-line therapy. Obtain both germline and tumor (somatic) testing, including for MSI/MMR deficiency, BRCA mutations (excluding variants of unknown significance), and NTRK gene fusions, the results of which can lead to therapies, such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy, TRK fusion inhibitors, and clinical trials of targeted therapies. Obtain genomic testing as part of the initial assessment to ensure that the results of testing are available at the time of treatment decision where applicable after first-line therapy.

This study estimates the PDAC risk associated with PVs in hereditary cancer genes based on data from multigene panel testing of 676 667 individuals, 2445 of whom had a personal diagnosis of PDAC. Multivariable logistic regression models (MLRM) were used to estimate risk within a clinical testing population adjusted for variables that influence ascertainment and/or eligibility for hereditary cancer testing. It has been shown previously that this methodology generates risk estimates similar to those from population-based studies, representing the magnitude of risk attributable to the genetic findings independent of other risk factors that impact ascertainment. This is especially important considering that PVs associated with an increased risk for PDAC are frequently identified in individuals tested for reasons other than a personal or family history of PDAC, such as a personal and/or family history of other cancers, or as incidental findings from testing performed for other reasons. These improved PDAC risk estimates will hopefully contribute to the development of management recommendations better tailored to genetic findings. We also present data supporting current recommendations for germline testing in all PDAC patients based on a high prevalence of clinically significant PVs regardless of additional personal and/or family history variables.

### Whole genome sequencing defines the genetic heterogeneity of familial pancreatic cancer [^117Bm1it]. Cancer Discovery (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States by 2020. A familial aggregation of pancreatic cancer has been established, but the cause of this aggregation in most families is unknown. To determine the genetic basis of susceptibility in these families, we sequenced the germline genomes of 638 patients with familial pancreatic cancer and the tumor exomes of 39 familial pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Our analyses support the role of previously identified familial pancreatic cancer susceptibility genes such as BRCA2, CDKN2A, and ATM, and identify novel candidate genes harboring rare, deleterious germline variants for further characterization. We also show how somatic point mutations that occur during hematopoiesis can affect the interpretation of genome-wide studies of hereditary traits. Our observations have important implications for the etiology of pancreatic cancer and for the identification of susceptibility genes in other common cancer types.

Significance

The genetic basis of disease susceptibility in the majority of patients with familial pancreatic cancer is unknown. We whole genome sequenced 638 patients with familial pancreatic cancer and demonstrate that the genetic underpinning of inherited pancreatic cancer is highly heterogeneous. This has significant implications for the management of patients with familial pancreatic cancer.

### Familial predisposition and genetic risk factors associated with pancreatic cancer [^1141h2Ch]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal cancer and projected to be the second leading cause of cancer death by 2030. Multigene panel testing has facilitated the identification of germline variants associated with an increased risk of PC. Precision treatment has led to improved outcomes for patients with these findings. Because of these improved outcomes as well as the implications for at-risk family members who may benefit from additional cancer screening, the NCCN recommends universal genetic testing for newly diagnosed PC patients. This review describes the most common heritable conditions associated with PC and those who may benefit from screening.

Recommendation statements

Each statement includes its grade of evidence, the voting results (table 2) and a brief discussion.

Table 2
Summary of consensus statements for the management of high risk individuals

Who should be screened?

Since the incidence of PC in the general population is low (lifetime risk 1.3%), screening is not recommended for the general population, but instead for individuals considered to be at high risk of developing the disease (ie, > 5% lifetime risk, or fivefold increased RR). The main tool used to quantify PC risk is still the family history; risk stratification is determined from the number of affected family members and the relationships among at-risk individuals. Gene testing can identify a family's underlying genetic susceptibility, but it has a limited role because the genetic basis of much of the inherited susceptibility to PC remains unexplained. Additional PC susceptibility genes may be discovered in the near future that should improve our ability to identify individuals who would benefit most from pancreatic screening.

Patients with a family history of PC

Individuals with three or more blood relatives with PC, with at least one affected first-degree relative (FDR,) should be considered for screening (agree 91.9%, grade moderate, 'probably do it'). Those with at least two affected FDRs should be considered for screening (agree 91.9%, grade moderate, 'probably do it'). Individuals with two affected blood relatives with PC, with at least one FDR, should be considered for screening (agree 77.5%, grade low, 'probably do it').

These recommendations for screening are primarily based on evidence of increased risk, rather than a proven efficacy of screening. Prospective studies demonstrate an increased risk of developing PC in unaffected FDRs that depends on the number of relatives with PC. This risk has been estimated to be 6.4-fold greater in individuals with two FDRs with PC (lifetime risk 8–12%) and 32-fold greater in individuals with three or more FDRs with PC (lifetime risk 40%). Among kindreds with familial PC, risk is higher in kindreds with a young-onset PC (age < 50 years, RR = 9.3) compared with kindreds without. No consensus was reached on whether to screen individuals without an affected FDR, including individuals with a young-onset PC relative, or patients with new-onset diabetes (Appendix).

Prostate cancer — germline testing pre-test and testing considerations state that the Panel recommends inquiring about family and personal history of cancer, and known germline variants at time of initial diagnosis, and that criteria for germline testing should be reviewed at time of initial diagnosis and, if relevant, at recurrence (see CRIT-6 and HRS-3 in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment). Germline testing is also recommended for patients with metastatic, regional (node positive), very-high-risk localized, or high-risk localized prostate cancer, and should be considered in appropriate individuals where it is likely to impact the prostate cancer treatment and clinical trial options, management of risk of other cancers, and/or potential risk of cancer in family members. If criteria are met, multigene testing is recommended, and for details regarding the nuances of genetic counseling and testing, see Principles of Cancer Risk Assessment and Counseling (EVAL-A) in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic and Prostate; all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### ACG clinical guideline: genetic testing and management of hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes [^114Ui6xX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the management of patients with hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes. The initial assessment is the collection of a family history of cancers and premalignant gastrointestinal conditions and should provide enough information to develop a preliminary determination of the risk of a familial predisposition to cancer. Age at diagnosis and lineage (maternal and/or paternal) should be documented for all diagnoses, especially in first- and second-degree relatives. When indicated, genetic testing for a germline mutation should be done on the most informative candidate(s) identified through the family history evaluation and/or tumor analysis to confirm a diagnosis and allow for predictive testing of at-risk relatives. Genetic testing should be conducted in the context of pre- and post-test genetic counseling to ensure the patient's informed decision making. Patients who meet clinical criteria for a syndrome as well as those with identified pathogenic germline mutations should receive appropriate surveillance measures in order to minimize their overall risk of developing syndrome-specific cancers. This guideline specifically discusses genetic testing and management of Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP), MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, juvenile polyposis syndrome, Cowden syndrome, serrated (hyperplastic) polyposis syndrome, hereditary pancreatic cancer, and hereditary gastric cancer.

### Advances in hereditary colorectal and pancreatic cancers [^115DTnJS]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Innovations in genetic medicine have led to improvements in the early detection, prevention, and treatment of cancer for patients with inherited risks of gastrointestinal cancer, particularly hereditary colorectal cancer and hereditary pancreatic cancer.

Methods

This review provides an update on recent data and key advances that have improved the identification, understanding, and management of patients with hereditary colorectal cancer and hereditary pancreatic cancer.

Findings

This review details recent and emerging data that highlight the developing landscape of genetics in hereditary colorectal and pancreatic cancer risk. A summary is provided of the current state-of-the-art practices for identifying, evaluating, and managing patients with suspected hereditary colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer risk. The impact of next-generation sequencing technologies in the clinical diagnosis of hereditary gastrointestinal cancer and also in discovery efforts of new genes linked to familial cancer risk are discussed. Emerging targeted therapies that may play a particularly important role in the treatment of patients with hereditary forms of colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer are also reviewed. Current approaches for pancreatic cancer screening and the psychosocial impact of such procedures are also detailed.

Implications

Given the availability of new diagnostic, risk-reducing, and therapeutic strategies that exist for patients with hereditary risk of colorectal or pancreatic cancer, it is imperative that clinicians be vigilant about evaluating patients for hereditary cancer syndromes. Continuing to advance genetics research in hereditary gastrointestinal cancers will allow for more progress to be made in personalized medicine and prevention.

Right Tests

Genetic (Germline) and Biomarker Testing and Precision Medicine

Patients treated with matched therapies selected through biomarker or genetic testing can live longer. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to follow guideline recommendations that all patients undergo genetic testing for inherited mutations at diagnosis and for patients to undergo biomarker testing of their tumor tissue unless clinically contraindicated.

Genetic Testing for Inherited Mutations

Routine genetic (germline) testing for all patients with pancreatic cancer is now recommended in both the pancreatic adenocarcinoma and the genetic/familial high-risk assessment sections of the NCCN guidelines. These guidelines recommend genetic counseling and germline testing for all individuals diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic cancer, and first-degree relatives of individuals diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic cancer in the event that the individual who had pancreatic cancer cannot be tested. Because the disease is highly aggressive and the option to test the affected relative may not be available in the future, there may be significant benefit to family members in testing patients near the time of diagnosis.

For genetic testing, guidelines indicate the advantage of multigene testing through CLIA/CAP-certified laboratories, and the avoidance of direct-to-consumer or ancestry testing that is not approved for clinical use. An ASCO provisional clinical opinion lists 13 genes associated with increased risk for pancreatic cancer (Table 2). Evidence has shown a similar rate of germline alterations in patients who do and do not have a known family history of pancreatic cancer or other cancer types, contributing to the recommendation for all patients to undergo this testing. Note that, in a case study of 3030 patients with pancreatic cancer, 5.2% of patients without a known family history of pancreatic cancer were found to have a germline mutation, emphasizing the importance of germline genetic testing of patients even in the absence of a family history of the disease. The value of germline genetic testing for patients extends beyond personalized treatment options and can also provide valuable information for their family members. "Cascade testing" of family members, if applicable, can then inform them of potential risk for pancreatic cancer and other cancers and suggest consideration of participation in surveillance studies or other screening methodologies, which now includes imaging tests or blood-based detection tests.

### Personalizing medicine with germline and somatic sequencing in advanced pancreatic cancer: current treatments and novel opportunities… [^113wVser]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

Germline Sequencing Several studies have shown that 3. 8% to
9. 7% of patients with pancreatic cancer carry a deleterious germline mutation. 8, 10The most commonly found germline mutation is BRCA2, although additional commonly mutated genes include BRCA1, PALB2, ATM, CDKN2A, and TP53, and mismatch repair genes. BRCA1/2mutations and deficient mismatch repair have effective therapies that are currently standard of care, and several other germline mutations have a strong rationale for novel targeted therapies that are under investigation. BRCA1/2 Germline Mutations.

Indeed, a recent phase II trial demonstrated a response rate of 70% with a gemcitabine plus cisplatin backbone regimen among patients with germline HRD mutations, 11and retrospective studies demonstrate that patients with HRD pancreatic cancers have significantly better progression-free survival when treated with first-line platinum-based therapies. 19–21In pancreatic cancer, many of the trials enrolling BRCA1/2germline-mutated cancers also enrolled a small number of patients whose tumors had PALB2germline mutations, with similar results suggesting PALB2mutations also are predictive of response to platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors. For example, in a phase II study of maintenance rucaparib after induction platinum-based chemotherapy with 24 evaluable patients with germline HRD mutations, two out of two tumors with PALB2germline mutation had response to rucaparib.
22.

Deficient Mismatch Repair and Lynch Syndrome Germline mutations in the mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2cause Lynch syndrome, with an increased risk of developing multiple cancer types, particularly colorectal and endometrial cancers, but also pancreatic cancer. A registry study from 147 families with Lynch syndrome revealed a 3. 7% cumulative risk of pancreatic cancer up to age 70, which is an
8. 6-fold increase compared with the broader population.

### Management of individuals with heterozygous germline pathogenic variants in ATM: a clinical practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^115uxik8]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

ATM germline pathogenic variants (GPVs) are associated with a moderately increased risk of female breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer. Resources for managing ATM heterozygotes in clinical practice are limited.

Methods

An international workgroup developed a clinical practice resource to guide management of ATM heterozygotes using peer-reviewed publications and expert opinion.

Results

Although ATM is a moderate (intermediate) penetrance gene, cancer risks may be considered as a continuous variable, influenced by family history and other modifiers. ATM GPV heterozygotes should generally be offered enhanced breast surveillance according to their personalized risk estimate and country-specific guidelines and, generally, risk-reducing mastectomy is not recommended. Prostate cancer surveillance should be considered. Pancreatic cancer surveillance should be considered based on assessment of family history, ideally as part of a clinical trial, with existence of country-specific guidelines. For ATM GPV heterozygotes who develop cancer, radiation therapy decisions should not be influenced by the genetic result. Although poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase inhibitors are licensed for use in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and ATM GPVs, the evidence-base is currently weak.

Conclusion

Systematic prospective data collection is needed to establish the spectrum of ATM-associated cancer and determine the outlines of surveillance, response to cancer treatment, and survival.

### Guidelines for genetic testing in prostate cancer: a scoping review [^115nKyBL]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

c. Who should be considered for genetic testing?

All guidelines and consensus statements recommend genetic testing (germline and/or somatic) for men with metastatic prostate cancer. The NCCN guidelines offer the most detailed guidance across the three prostate cancer relevant guidelines included (Prostate Cancer; Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian and Pancreatic Cancer; and Colon Cancer). Essentially, germline testing is recommended for men with high- or very high-risk prostate cancer, regional or metastatic prostate cancer, regardless of family history. Germline testing is also recommended for men with a personal history of breast cancer or a positive family history of early onset breast, colorectal or endometrial cancer (age ≤ 50 years); ovarian, exocrine or pancreatic cancer (any age); prostate cancer ≤ 60 years or prostate cancer death; Lynch-syndrome related cancer, especially if diagnosed < 50 years; or Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.

Somatic testing is recommended for men with hormone sensitive metastatic prostate cancer or castrate resistant metastatic prostate cancer. While many of the major guidelines offer less specific and/or less comprehensive criteria for genetic testing than NCCN, all recommend germline and somatic testing for men with metastatic prostate cancer, particularly for men with personal or family history or Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry and early onset disease.

For men with early stage or localised prostate cancer, germline genetic testing is recommended only where it is likely to impact treatment, clinical trial options, risk management of other cancers and/or potential risk for family members. Testing criteria tend to focus on personal history of metastatic or high-risk prostate cancer, particularly early onset, and family history of prostate cancer, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, colorectal or endometrial cancer and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Some guidelines recommend germline testing for men who have confirmed DNA MMR deficiency or a pathogenic variant in a listed gene after tumour testing. For this population, one guideline makes no recommendations, while others suggest genetic testing be considered only for men with personal or family history of high-risk germline mutations and/or early onset prostate cancer.

### ASCO recommends germline testing for all patients with pancreatic cancer… [^115vJgvT]. ASCO Daily News (2018). Low credibility.

The recently released ASCO Clinical Practice Provisional Clinical Opinion on Evaluating Susceptibility to Pancreatic Cancer highlights the importance of emerging data indicating a relatively high rate of germline mutations in pancreatic cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated that up to one in 10 people with pancreatic cancer carry genetic alterations specific with cancer predisposition, a higher rate than previously assumed. Expert Panel Co-Chair Elena M. Stoffel, MD, of the University of Michigan, said that for 10% of patients with pancreatic cancer there is a genetic factor associated with risk not only for pancreatic cancer but for other cancer types as well. "The finding that genetic predisposition syndromes are much more common than previously expected in pancreatic cancer led to recommend genetic testing for all individuals with pancreatic cancer, " Dr. Stoffel said.

"The truth is probably somewhere in the middle, but it is certainly higher than the 1% that we originally thought, " Dr. Khorana said. Another surprising finding from recent studies is that half of the patients who have germline susceptibility would not have met genetic testing criteria otherwise. "If you looked at their family history, you would not have suspected that they had a germline variant in genes associated with pancreatic cancer, " Dr. Stoffel said. Germline Testing a Priority The PCO recommends germline testing for all patients with pancreatic cancer and assessing risk for hereditary syndromes known to be associated with an increased risk for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Additionally, the PCO recommends a comprehensive review of family history of cancer. Those with a family history of pancreatic cancer affecting two first-degree relatives meet the criteria for familial pancreatic cancer.

Individuals who have a family history, those with three or more diagnoses of pancreatic cancer in the same side of the family, and people who meet the criteria for other genetic syndromes associated with increased risk for pancreatic cancer, are candidates for germline testing. The PCO notes that many of the germline mutations associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer are also associated with increased risk of breast and colorectal cancers. The most common germline findings in patients with pancreatic cancer are pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2, now associated with an estimated 3% and 5% lifetime risk for pancreatic cancer, respectively. CDKN2A germline variants are associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer, as are germline variants in STK11, which are associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.

### Implementing systematic genetic counseling and multigene germline testing for individuals with pancreatic cancer [^116BSGyU]. JCO Oncology Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

National guidelines recommend genetic counseling and multigene germline testing (GC/MGT) for all patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This study's aim was to assess real-world effectiveness of implementing systematic GC/MGT for all patients with PDAC at a high-volume academic institution.

Methods

An iterative process for systematizing GC/MGT was developed in which gastrointestinal oncology providers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute were recommended to refer all patients with PDAC for GC/MGT (clinician-directed referral). Workflows were subsequently changed such that patients with PDAC were automatically offered GC/MGT when scheduling their initial oncology consultation (automated referral). Clinical and germline data were collected on a consecutive cohort of patients with PDAC undergoing GC/MGT during a 25-month enrollment period (19-month clinician-directed referrals; 6-month automated referrals).

Results

One thousand two hundred fourteen patients with PDAC were seen for initial oncologic evaluation, 266 (21.9%) of whom underwent GC/MGT. Compared with baseline clinician-directed referrals, implementation of automated referrals led to a significant increase in patients with PDAC undergoing GC/MGT (16.5% v 38.0%, P < .001), including those undergoing multigene germline testing (MGT) ≤ 7 days of initial oncology evaluation (14.7% v 60.3%, P < .001), with preserved pathogenic variant detection rates (10.0% v 11.2%, P = 0.84). 16 of 28 (57.1%) pathogenic variant carriers had relatives who pursued cascade germline testing, and 13 of 26 (50.0%) carriers with incurable disease received targeted therapy based on MGT results.

Conclusion

Implementation of systematic GC/MGT in patients with PDAC is feasible and leads to management changes for patients with PDAC and their families. GC/MGT workflows that bypass the need for clinician referral result in superior uptake and time to testing. Further investigation is needed to identify other barriers and facilitators of universal GC/MGT.

### Adherence to NCCN genetic testing guidelines in pancreatic cancer and impact on treatment [^111P69iA]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

Cases of pancreatic cancer continue to rise, with treatments lagging behind. This article highlights why genetic testing is so important in patients with pancreatic cancer. It was found that genetic testing done at provider discretion results in low rates of testing. These results highlight the missed treatment opportunities and missed opportunities for cascade testing of family members that occur when testing is not done. This study tries to determine why providers decide to test some patients and not others. The present study includes the genetic testing experience of a diverse patient population that has not been included in other studies on this topic. The authors hope this study will serve as a reminder of the importance of genetic testing in pancreas cancer.

### Improved germline screening for patients with pancreatic cancer through provider driven testing… [^1153uW5a]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract e16366 Background: National guidelines recommend germline genetic screening for all pancreatic cancer patients. Results provide meaningful insights into pathogenic variants and impacts both treatment selection and family screening recommendations. We previously reported on current state and the need to improve germline screening rates. Since implementing a provider-driven approach, we have seen a significant increase in testing. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility and ongoing need for novel approaches to germline screening. Methods: This is a retrospective review of 223 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma evaluated at the University of Virginia Health System within the calendar year of 2022 compared to the 2021 calendar year. Primary endpoints include the rate of genetic counseling referral placement, the rate of attendance of outpatient genetic counseling, and the rate of individuals who completed germline screening.

Our primary data points will be compared with outcomes obtained from a prior study evaluating 210 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the calendar year of 2021 at the same academic medical center. Results: Of the 223 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, only 30% had genetic counseling referrals present in the electronic health record system. This was an improvement from the 2021 calendar year, where 19% had referrals present in the EHR. Of those with referrals present, an improvement in the rate of genetic counseling attendance was found, from 51% in 2021 to 58% in 2022. There was also an improvement in the rate of germline screening completion rates; 38% of patients evaluated in 2022 completed testing, compared to 21% in
2021. Six percent of tested patients in 2022 had pathogenic findings, consistent with historical incidence rates. The main provider barriers were time and testing logistics.

Conclusions: Our data shows an improvement in the rates of genetic counseling referrals, the rates of genetic counseling attendance, and the rates of germline screening completion. This modest improvement is primarily related to increased awareness by our providers. We acknowledge the need for further improvements and are developing a prospective clinical trial to better educate and empower patients to understand the need and results of germline testing.

### Adherence to NCCN genetic testing guidelines in pancreatic cancer and impact on treatment [^117AQSuY]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Additional effective treatment options remain an unmet need for pancreas cancer patients. Our study reinforces the results of previous studies and highlights that despite the change in NCCN guidelines three years ago, the implementation of universal germline testing and somatic testing in metastatic disease remains a challenge.

We found that rates of germline testing increased every year without implementation of an automated referral system yet still remained sub-optimal at 61%. Two studies investigating methods to increase rates of germline testing reported improved rates of testing when systematic workflows were introduced (from 19% to 71%and from 16.5% to 38.0%). In health-care systems where resources are scarce, staffing is limited and there is a worldwide shortage of geneticists it is difficult to envision how workflows that require dedicated staff and designated genetic counselors would be practical in real-world clinics. It has also been found that genetic counsellor models which necessitate genetic counselor input prior to testing create barriers to testing especially for those with lower incomes". Mainstreaming" genetic testing is an approach that has been studied in a number of different cancer types. This involves pre-test informed consent in the oncology clinic with a member of the oncology team with post-test genetic counseling for those found to have a pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variant in a cancer susceptibility gene. A recent study by Ramsey et al. evaluated the implementation of mainstreaming in the pancreatic cancer cohort. They found that this program increased genetic testing among patients 6.5-fold. Even with this program, the rate of germline testing during the study period was 66.4%. Hamilton et al. examined the implementation of a mainstreaming model in prostate, pancreas, and ovarian cancer. In this study, 9.9% of patients refused germline testing. Although we are limited by information recorded in the medical record, we only had one documented refusal in our cohort. Bokkers et al. evaluated the experience of healthcare professionals with a mainstreaming approach to germline genetic testing in ovarian cancer. This article highlights some potential barriers to offering genetic testing in the clinic including concerns about the process being time consuming and the healthcare workers' insecurity about their knowledge of genetic testing. The most common reason why genetic testing was not discussed was that the provider forgot to discuss it. Other reasons included: DNA test already being discussed, provider feeling it was not his/her role, patient had no family history of cancer, patient being too emotional, patient being too ill, and lack of time during the consultation. These insights highlight the real-world limitations to universal testing in the clinic: a lack of education around who should be tested, lack of time during consultations, cancer patients having emotional and medical needs which take priority (especially during initial consultations) with genetic testing likely forgotten as a result. At our institution, we plan to educate our oncology clinic staff again on the importance of germline testing in pancreatic cancer as well as work with our IT colleagues to establish best practice reminders for genetic testing in the electronic medical record which must be addressed before clinic encounters can be closed.

### Genetics of pancreatic neoplasms and role of screening [^117NoAm7]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

There is a wide spectrum of pancreatic neoplasms with characteristic genetic abnormalities, tumor pathways, and histopathology that primarily determine tumor biology, treatment response, and prognosis. Although most pancreatic tumors are sporadic, 10% of neoplasms occur in the setting of distinct hereditary syndromes. Detailed studies of these rare syndromes have allowed researchers to identify a myriad of specific genetic signatures of pancreatic tumors. A better understanding of tumor genomics may have significant clinical implications in the diagnosis and management of patients with pancreatic tumors. Evolving knowledge has paved the way to screening paradigms and protocols in individuals at higher risk of developing pancreatic tumors.

### Adherence to NCCN genetic testing guidelines in pancreatic cancer and impact on treatment [^116vfZBM]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

The accessibility of genetic testing has improved in recent years. As a result, extensive somatic and germline testing in pancreatic cancer has provided an abundance of information about the genetic landscape of the disease. Mutations in KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4 are the somatic mutations found most frequently in pancreas cancer, with mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, and CHEK2 being the most common pathogenic germline variants. Up to 15% of PDAC arise in the setting of an underlying pathogenic germline mutation. Germline mutations in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes occur most often and patients harboring such changes benefit from a personalized treatment approach. Improved outcomes have been demonstrated with first-line platinum chemotherapy in those with mutations in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes and with maintenance PARP inhibitors in the case of BRCA mutations. Other findings may inform clinical trial candidacy. One study of 854 patients with PDAC, reported that only 3 (9%) of 33 patients with a deleterious germline mutation had a significant family history of cancer. This suggests that family history is a poor predictor to determine which patients may harbor germline mutations. As a result, in 2019 the NCCN recommended that clinicians consider germline testing in any patient diagnosed with pancreas cancer and consider molecular analysis of tumors in those with metastatic disease. Despite this recommendation, implementing universal germline testing and somatic setting in metastatic disease remains an ongoing challenge.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112fRDsS]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — genetic predisposition guidance emphasizes germline testing, family history, and counseling. The Panel recommends germline testing in any patient with confirmed pancreatic cancer and in those in whom there is a clinical suspicion for inherited susceptibility, and recommends using comprehensive gene panels for hereditary cancer syndromes to test for inherited mutations for any patient with confirmed pancreatic cancer. Patients with pancreatic cancer for whom a hereditary cancer syndrome is suspected should be considered for genetic counseling, and the Panel emphasizes the importance of taking a thorough family history, noting pancreatitis, melanoma, and cancers of the pancreas, colorectum, breast, and ovaries. A free online pancreatic cancer risk prediction tool, called PancPRO, is available and may help determine risk, and referral to genetic counseling may be considered for patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, especially those who have a family history of cancer or who are young, as well as those of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.

### Implementation of universal germline genetic testing into standard of care for patients with prostate cancer: the time is now [^1111kiKt]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Indications for and implications of germline genetic testing (GGT) in patients with prostate cancer have expanded over the past decade, particularly related to precision therapies and management. GGT has become the standard of care for many cancers such as breast, ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic, and metastatic prostate cancer, and it is imperative that patients be offered timely and equitable access to testing as it can inform patient-physician shared decision making for management of the current cancer as well as anticipatory guidance for disease progression. Additionally, GGT guides screening for and prevention of secondary malignancies for the patient and cascade testing for at-risk family members. Here, we present data supporting the notion that clinicians should offer all patients with prostate cancer the opportunity to undergo comprehensive GGT for pathogenic germline variants known to be associated with familial cancer and/or known to have implications for treatment and management.

### An emerging paradigm for germline testing in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and immediate implications for clinical practice: a review [^112aC6GT]. JAMA Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a malignant neoplasm with a rising incidence and is a leading public health challenge. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has been well characterized genomically, with findings of therapeutic actionability that have substantive implications for clinical practice based on recent high-level evidence.

Observations

Pathogenic germline alterations (PGAs) are relatively common in individuals with PDAC, as evidenced in multiple recent data sets, with a frequency of approximately 10%. The most common PGAs are in BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM and more rarely in PALB2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, CDKN2A, and TP53, among others, with an aggregate frequency of 3.8% to 9.7%. These PGAs are of key interest owing to therapeutic actionability and the downstream identification of at-risk family members and possible hereditary cancer syndromes. Approximately 3% to 7% of individuals with PDAC harbor a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, which are among the most frequently mutated genes in PDAC. Recent updates to the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend risk assessment for all individuals with PDAC irrespective of personal or family history or ethnicity. Treatment implications include the use of checkpoint inhibitor therapy for mismatch repair-deficient PDAC and the validation of poly-ADP (adenosine diphosphate)-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) therapy as a maintenance strategy in platinum-sensitive PDAC.

Conclusions and Relevance

With increasing evidence and slow improvement of outcomes, PDAC has entered the era of precision medicine. Germline mutations have been identified in key genes with an aggregate frequency of 3.8% to 9.7%, several of which are therapeutically actionable with platinum, PARPi, and checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Potential therapeutic targets need to be actively sought and identified.

### Germline testing for individuals with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and novel genetic risk factors [^115S6BEw]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Germline genetic variants implicated in increasing lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer (PDAC) have been identified in ∼4% to 10% of cases. Clinical features such as family history have poor sensitivity in identifying carriers of these risk variants. Genetic testing for these germline variants has potential to guide risk assessment and surveillance recommendations in high-risk individuals to promote prevention and early detection measures. Furthermore, identification of novel germline variants can offer important insights into pathogenesis that may inform precision medicine approaches. This article reviews current understanding of germline mutations associated with PDAC risk and implications of genetic testing.

Metastatic pancreatic cancer — germline and somatic genomic testing: "Early testing for actionable genomic alterations is recommended for patients who are likely to be potential candidates for additional treatment after first-line therapy", and "Both germline and tumor (somatic) testing are recommended". Testing "includes testing for microsatellite instability/mismatch repair deficiency, BRCA mutations (excluding variants of unknown significance), and NTRK gene fusions", and results "can lead to therapies, such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, programmed death-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy, TRK fusion inhibitors, and clinical trials of targeted therapies". "Genomic testing is recommended as part of an initial assessment to ensure that the results of testing are available at the time of treatment decision where applicable after first-line therapy" (Type: informal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong). The qualifying statement specifies that "The decision to test for actionable genomic alterations should involve a discussion between the patient and physician regarding the frequency of actionable findings, treatment implications of testing results, and genetic counseling related to germline testing".

### Management of individuals with heterozygous germline pathogenic variants in ATM: a clinical practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^112w8f8N]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). High credibility.

ACMG practice resource — management of heterozygous ATM germline pathogenic variants outlines that ATM germline pathogenic variants (GPVs) are associated with a moderately increased risk of female breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer. Although ATM is a moderate (intermediate) penetrance gene, cancer risks may be considered as a continuous variable, influenced by family history and other modifiers. For management, ATM GPV heterozygotes should generally be offered enhanced breast surveillance according to their personalized risk estimate and country-specific guidelines and, generally, risk-reducing mastectomy is not recommended. Prostate cancer surveillance should be considered. Pancreatic cancer surveillance should be considered based on assessment of family history, ideally as part of a clinical trial, with existence of country-specific guidelines.

### ACG clinical guideline: genetic testing and management of hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes [^115Dd6sy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — genetic evaluation and management principles for hereditary gastrointestinal (GI) cancer syndromes state that the initial assessment is the collection of a family history of cancers and premalignant gastrointestinal conditions and should provide enough information to develop a preliminary determination of the risk of a familial predisposition to cancer, and that age at diagnosis and lineage (maternal and/or paternal) should be documented for all diagnoses, especially in first- and second-degree relatives. When indicated, genetic testing for a germline mutation should be done on the most informative candidate(s) identified through the family history evaluation and/or tumor analysis to confirm a diagnosis and allow for predictive testing of at-risk relatives, and genetic testing should be conducted in the context of pre- and post-test genetic counseling to ensure the patient's informed decision making. Patients who meet clinical criteria for a syndrome as well as those with identified pathogenic germline mutations should receive appropriate surveillance measures in order to minimize their overall risk of developing syndrome-specific cancers, and for each of these syndromes the guideline outlines diagnostic criteria and indications for genetic evaluation, describes the currently known associated underlying genes, and makes recommendations for surveillance and management of at-risk individuals and those found to carry a definitive disease-causing mutation across Lynch syndrome (LS), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP), MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (PJS), juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS), Cowden syndrome (CS), serrated (hyperplastic) polyposis syndrome, hereditary pancreatic cancer, and hereditary gastric cancer.

### Adherence to NCCN genetic testing guidelines in pancreatic cancer and impact on treatment [^111T1kGa]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Both germline and somatic testing are essential as we try to advance and personalize the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Currently, there are targeted treatment options for a handful of mutations in this disease, but identifying eligible patients relies on universal testing. It is well established that patients with both germline and somatic mutations in HRR genes benefit from first-line platinum chemotherapy with stark differences (23.8 vs 8.3 months) in survival between those with HRR mutations treated with platinum and those who are not. While many patients may not be able to tolerate first-line FOLFIRONOX, gemcitabine/cisplatin has been shown to be an effective regimen in advanced germline BRCA/PALB2 + pancreas cancer and may be a good alternative to FOLFIRNOX. Seventy-five percent of our patients with germline mutations had germline testing at diagnosis. If testing is done later in treatment and a patient is treated with a non-platinum regimen, this may represent a missed opportunity to maximize survival with first-line platinum treatment. PARP inhibitors are approved as maintenance treatment for patients with germline BRCA mutations. Our one potentially eligible patient progressed on FOLFIRNOX and therefore did not receive a PARP inhibitor. Four of our patients with somatic DDR mutations had corresponding germline mutations. Two patients with somatic BRCA mutations did not have germline testing, both with high VAF. The decision not to do germline testing in these patients may have represented a missed therapeutic opportunity for treatment with a maintenance PARP inhibitor. It may also have been a missed opportunity for cascade testing for families. Somatic testing is important for the small percentage of patients with NTRK fusions, KRAS G12C mutations, or KRAS wild-type patients who may have other targetable activating pathways.

### Screening for pancreatic cancer [^1164UD7Q]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly fatal disease that can only be cured by complete surgical resection. However, most patients with PC have unresectable disease at the time of diagnosis, highlighting the need to detect PC and its precursor lesions earlier in asymptomatic patients. Screening is not cost-effective for population-based screening of PC. Individuals with genetic risk factors for PC based on family history or known PC-associated genetic syndromes, however, can be a potential target for PC screening programs. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology and genetic background of familial PC and discusses diagnostic and management approaches.

### Inherited pancreatic cancer syndromes and high-risk screening [^115v1Xb8]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with a 5-year survival rate of 9%. Individuals with inherited pancreatic cancer syndromes are at an increased risk for developing pancreatic cancer and may benefit from pancreatic cancer surveillance with the goal to detect and intervene on early-stage cancer or high-risk precursor lesions. Given the screening implications for family members and therapeutic implications for probands, all patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are recommended to undergo germline genetic testing.

### BRCA1, BRCA2, and associated cancer risks and management for male patients: a review [^1117pK4N]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Half of all carriers of inherited cancer-predisposing variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are male, but the implications for their health are underrecognized compared to female individuals. Germline variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (also known as pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, referred to here as BRCA1/2 PVs) are well known to significantly increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers in female carriers, and knowledge of BRCA1/2 PVs informs established cancer screening and options for risk reduction. While risks to male carriers of BRCA1/2 PVs are less characterized, there is convincing evidence of increased risk for prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer in males. There has also been a rapid expansion of US Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted cancer therapies, including poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, for breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers associated with BRCA1/2 PVs.

Observations

This narrative review summarized the data that inform cancer risks, targeted cancer therapy options, and guidelines for early cancer detection. It also highlighted areas of emerging research and clinical trial opportunities for male BRCA1/2 PV carriers. These developments, along with the continued relevance to family cancer risk and reproductive options, have informed changes to guideline recommendations for genetic testing and strengthened the case for increased genetic testing for males.

Conclusions and Relevance

Despite increasing clinical actionability for male carriers of BRCA1/2 PVs, far fewer males than female individuals undergo cancer genetic testing. Oncologists, internists, and primary care clinicians should be vigilant about offering appropriate genetic testing to males. Identifying more male carriers of BRCA1/2 PVs will maximize opportunities for cancer early detection, targeted risk management, and cancer treatment for males, along with facilitating opportunities for risk reduction and prevention in their family members, thereby decreasing the burden of hereditary cancer.

### Genetics and genetic testing in pancreatic cancer [^112fiQ2V]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Genetic testing of germline DNA is used in patients suspected of being at risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to better define the individual's risk and to determine the mechanism of risk. A high genetic risk increases the pretest probability that a biomarker of early cancer is a true positive and warrants further investigation. The highest PDAC risk is generally associated with a hereditary predisposition. However, the majority of PDAC results from complex, progressive gene-environment interactions that currently fall outside the traditional risk models. Over many years, the combination of inflammation, exposure to DNA-damaging toxins, and failed DNA repair promote the accumulation of somatic mutations in pancreatic cells; PDAC risk is further increased by already present oncogenic germline mutations. Predictive models and new technologies are needed to classify patients into more accurate and mechanistic PDAC risk categories that can be linked to improved surveillance and preventative strategies.

### Germline genetic testing in patients with solid malignant tumors [^111H5Pvf]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Current guidelines recommend germline genetic testing (GT) in patients with metastatic ERBB2-negative breast cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, all stages of epithelial ovarian cancer, and exocrine pancreatic cancer. With the arrival of targeted therapies such as poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, results of GT now directly influence treatment decisions. The increasing demand for germline GT has led to the transition from genetic counselor–led GT to oncologist-led GT. However, access to GT services has lagged behind for individuals from racial and ethnic minoritized and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. In this study, we analyzed clinical and demographic factors associated with GT uptake in patients with cancer types for which there are guideline-based recommendations.

### Point / counterpoint: is It time for universal germline genetic testing for all GI cancers? [^115qDCAb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Use of germline genetic testing among patients with cancer is increasing because of (1) the availability of multigene panel tests that include multiple cancer susceptibility genes in a single test, (2) decreased costs of these tests and improvements in insurance coverage, and (3) US Food and Drug Administration-approval of genotype-directed therapies such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for individuals with certain cancers and pathogenic germline variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (with possible benefits with other genes in the homologous repair deficiency pathway). In addition, National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines have already endorsed germline genetic testing for all patients with certain cancer types (epithelial ovarian cancer, exocrine pancreatic cancer, and high-grade/metastatic prostate cancer), regardless of age or personal/family history of cancer. Herein, we debate the pros and cons of offering germline multigene panel testing to all patients diagnosed with any GI cancer. The authors agree that it may just be a matter of time before germline multigene panel testing is offered to all patients with cancer; however, this article will highlight some of the benefits, risks, and limitations of this approach so that research can help fill some of the gaps to ensure that genetic medicine continues to be implemented in ways that improve real-world patient care and outcomes.

### Compliance with the current NCCN guidelines and its critical role in pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^114tNB7d]. Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Since 2019, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has recommended genetic testing for patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma that includes universal germline testing and tumor gene profiling for metastatic, locally advanced, or recurrent disease. However, testing compliance with this guideline has not yet been published in the English literature.

Methods

A quality assurance/quality improvement retrospective review was done to identify patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma from January 2019 to February 2021 to include the patient's clinical status and genetic test results.

Results

There were 20 patient cases identified with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A total of 11 cases had molecular tumor gene profiling and microsatellite instability/mismatch repair (MSI/MMR) testing performed and 1 case had only MSI/MMR testing by immunohistochemistry performed. Only 3 patients of the 20 in total received germline testing.

Conclusion

There was a significant number of patients for whom tumor gene profiling or germline testing had never been attempted as per recommended NCCN guidelines.

### Evaluating susceptibility to pancreatic cancer: ASCO provisional clinical opinion [^1118TtnX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

An ASCO provisional clinical opinion (PCO) offers timely clinical direction to ASCO's membership and other health care providers. This PCO addresses identification and management of patients and family members with possible predisposition to pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Methods

ASCO convened an Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of the literature published from January 1998 to June 2018. Results of the databases searched were supplemented with hand searching of the bibliographies of systematic reviews and selected seminal articles and contributions from Expert Panel members' curated files.

Provisional Clinical Opinion

All patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma should undergo assessment of risk for hereditary syndromes known to be associated with an increased risk for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Assessment of risk should include a comprehensive review of family history of cancer. Individuals with a family history of pancreatic cancer affecting two first-degree relatives meet criteria for familial pancreatic cancer (FPC). Individuals (cancer affected or unaffected) with a family history of pancreatic cancer meeting criteria for FPC, those with three or more diagnoses of pancreatic cancer in same side of the family, and individuals meeting criteria for other genetic syndromes associated with increased risk for pancreatic cancer have an increased risk for pancreatic cancer and are candidates for genetic testing. Germline genetic testing for cancer susceptibility may be discussed with individuals diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, even if family history is unremarkable. Benefits and limitations of pancreatic cancer screening should be discussed with individuals whose family history meets criteria for FPC and/or genetic susceptibility to pancreatic cancer.

Medical records and genetic test reports were reviewed for all patients who underwent germline testing and TMP at the University of California San Francisco during January 2016-January 2020. The detection rate of actionable alterations with germline testing alone was compared to that with both germline testing and TMP.

Results

Among 738 eligible patients, 144 (20%) met study criteria. Germline testing detected 10 actionable alterations in 10 patients. Tumor molecular profiling identified 3 new therapeutic targets among these 10 patients and 45 targets in 41 additional patients, increasing the number of patients with actionable findings from 10 (7%) to 51 (35%). Most actionable alterations (35/58, 60%) involved genes associated with the Homologous Recombination DNA Damage Repair pathway.

Conclusions

Tumor molecular profiling after germline testing increased the detection of actionable alterations by 5-fold. Tumor molecular profiling is a necessary complement to germline genetic testing to fully inform therapeutic decision making for all patients with pancreatic cancer.

### Management of individuals with germline variants in PALB2: a clinical practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^113QUVgp]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

PALB2 germline pathogenic variants are associated with increased breast cancer risk and smaller increased risk of pancreatic and likely ovarian cancer. Resources for health-care professionals managing PALB2 heterozygotes are currently limited.

Methods

A workgroup of experts sought to outline management of PALB2 heterozygotes based on current evidence. Peer-reviewed publications from PubMed were identified to guide recommendations, which arose by consensus and the collective expertise of the authors.

Results

PALB2 heterozygotes should be offered BRCA1/2-equivalent breast surveillance. Risk-reducing mastectomy can be considered guided by personalized risk estimates. Pancreatic cancer surveillance should be considered, but ideally as part of a clinical trial. Typically, ovarian cancer surveillance is not recommended, and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy should only rarely be considered before the age of 50. Given the mechanistic similarities, PALB2 heterozygotes should be considered for therapeutic regimens and trials as those for BRCA1/2.

Conclusion

This guidance is similar to those for BRCA1/2. While the range of the cancer risk estimates overlap with BRCA1/2, point estimates are lower in PALB2 so individualized estimates are important for management decisions. Systematic prospective data collection is needed to determine as yet unanswered questions such as the risk of contralateral breast cancer and survival after cancer diagnosis.

### Platinum response characteristics of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and a germline BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2 mutation [^116BFgFz]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Our findings have several clinical implications. The high ORR of 58% to platinum therapy in mut-positive patients suggests that platinum therapy may be particularly desirable for this subset of patients in clinical scenarios marked by high disease burden, symptomatic disease and for patients with locally advanced or borderline resectable tumours. As responses were seen regardless of the platinum backbone, our findings also suggest that for mut-positive patients unable to tolerate FOLFIRINOX, alternative platinum-based therapies should be considered.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines now include recommendations for germline testing in all patients with newly diagnosed PDAC, given the treatment implications for this group. We found that patients with BRCA or PALB2 mutant-associated pancreatic cancer may derive greater benefit from initiation of platinum-based chemotherapy in the first-line setting. Taken together, our findings support the need for upfront testing in all patients in order to select the optimal treatment.

Additionally, our findings may help inform future clinical trial design for patients with pancreatic cancer. The ORR and rwPFS reported in this study may provide guidance as a benchmark in future studies evaluating patients with germline BRCA or PALB2 mutation-associated PDAC. Additionally, for clinical trials evaluating platinum-based chemotherapy in all-comers with pancreatic cancer, special attention should be given to patients with germline mutations in BRCA or PALB2 given the impact of these genetic changes on response to chemotherapy.

The therapeutic implications of BRCA mutations in the palliative management of pancreatic cancer have recently been demonstrated to extend beyond platinum-based chemotherapy. PARP inhibitors have previously shown exciting clinical efficacy in the treatment of BRCA mutant-associated breast, ovarian and prostate cancers. Golan et al. recently reported the POLO trial, which evaluated olaparib therapy as maintenance treatment for patients with a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and metastatic pancreatic cancer without progressive disease after at least 16 weeks of platinum-based chemotherapy. Of 3315 patients screened 247 (7.5%) were found to have a germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 and 154 patients were ultimately randomised. Olaparib maintenance was associated with a significantly longer progression free survival as compared to placebo (7.4 months vs. 3.8 months; p = 0.004). Of patients included in the trial who underwent randomisation, nearly 50% were found to have achieved a partial or complete response to platinum-based chemotherapy, consistent with our findings.

### Italian registry of families at risk of pancreatic cancer: AISP familial pancreatic cancer study group [^1126BE9e]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the main causes of cancer-related death worldwide, with a survival rate around 9%. In Italy 13,500 new cases of pancreatic cancer occurred in 2019. It is estimated that at least 5% have a hereditary background. Surveillance is advisable for healthy individuals with specific genetic syndromes with or without family history of pancreatic cancer or members of families with multiple cases of pancreatic cancer, irrespective of genetic syndromes. In 2010 the Italian Association for the Study of the Pancreas (AISP) defined criteria to include individuals in such surveillance programs with the first-round results published in 2019. In order to include other categories at high-risk and increase the diagnostic yield of surveillance, these criteria have recently been modified. The present position paper presents the updated criteria of the Italian Registry of Families at Risk of Pancreatic Cancer (IRFARPC) with their diagnostic yield calculation. Also, AISP priority projects concerning: (a) increasing awareness of citizens and primary care physicians through a dedicated App; (b) increasing access to germline testing to personalize surveillance; (c) measuring psychological impact of surveillance; (d) investigating the role of risk-modifiers and (e) evaluating the cost-effectiveness and ability to save lives of the program are briefly presented.

### Germline screening rates and patterns for patients with pancreatic cancer at an academic medical center… [^117Qk7aM]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract 10590 Background: Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend germline genetic testing for all pancreatic cancer patients irrespective of family history. Germline testing provides insight on inherited pathogenic variants that may influence care. Approximately 10% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients have pathogenic mutations which may have treatment implications and warrant the introduction of targeted therapy approaches. Patients with germline BRCA1/2 or PALB2 mutations have increased sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy and PARP-inhibitor therapies. Germline testing results may have important implications for patients' family members for earlier targeted screening. A better understanding of the current state of testing is needed to develop systems to improve screening rates. We conducted a retrospective review of clinical practice patterns at an academic cancer center to assess the current uptake.

Methods: Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma seen at the University of Virginia Health System within the 2021 calendar year were identified. Retrospective review of genetic counseling referral and germline genomic screening for individual patients was performed. Results: 210 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma were identified. 39 PDAC patients had a referral to genetic counseling placed in the electronic medical record and 44 completed germline screening. Of the patients referred to genetics, 17/39 patients met with a genetic counselor which led to germline screening, 3/39 patients were referred and saw genetics after receiving germline testing results. Among patients who completed germline screening, 27/44 had testing initially ordered by their oncologist with referral to genetic counseling based on testing results 3/27. Conclusions: Despite guideline recommendations, germline testing rates are low among this PDAC population.

Genetic counselors are essential members of a multidisciplinary team and guide patient discussions and decision making with regards to germline testing. Typical practice has involved referral to meet with a genetics counselor prior to testing; however many patients elect not to schedule a visit and consequently do not obtain germline screening. Barriers may include costs associated with genetic counseling/testing, time constraints, and patient understanding of the relevance of testing for their cancer care. We observed that offering germline testing to PDAC patients with referral to genetic counseling based on results and patient preference is a viable practice pattern. Upfront clinician driven germline testing may offer an opportunity to improve access to germline screening. Prospective clinical trials are needed to increase rates of germline testing and genetic counseling for PDAC patients.

### Management of patients with increased risk for familial pancreatic cancer: updated recommendations from the international cancer of the pancreas screening (CAPS) consortium [^111uFsLf]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aim

The International Cancer of the Pancreas Screening Consortium met in 2018 to update its consensus recommendations for the management of individuals with increased risk of pancreatic cancer based on family history or germline mutation status (high-risk individuals).

Methods

A modified Delphi approach was employed to reach consensus among a multidisciplinary group of experts who voted on consensus statements. Consensus was considered reached if ≥ 75% agreed or disagreed.

Results

Consensus was reached on 55 statements. The main goals of surveillance (to identify high-grade dysplastic precursor lesions and T1N0M0 pancreatic cancer) remained unchanged. Experts agreed that for those with familial risk, surveillance should start no earlier than age 50 or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative with pancreatic cancer, but were split on whether to start at age 50 or 55. Germline ATM mutation carriers with one affected first-degree relative are now considered eligible for surveillance. Experts agreed that preferred surveillance tests are endoscopic ultrasound and MRI/magnetic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, but no consensus was reached on how to alternate these modalities. Annual surveillance is recommended in the absence of concerning lesions. Main areas of disagreement included if and how surveillance should be performed for hereditary pancreatitis, and the management of indeterminate lesions.

Conclusions

Pancreatic surveillance is recommended for selected high-risk individuals to detect early pancreatic cancer and its high-grade precursors, but should be performed in a research setting by multidisciplinary teams in centres with appropriate expertise. Until more evidence supporting these recommendations is available, the benefits, risks and costs of surveillance of pancreatic surveillance need additional evaluation.

### The pivotal role of germline BRCA2 pathogenic variants in "Apparently sporadic" pancreatic cancer [^115ofqC9]. Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

In 1996, Goggins and colleagues demonstrated the importance of germline BRCA2 pathogenic variants in the development of apparently sporadic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Previously, the group identified homozygous deletion of the 13q region in PDACs, enabling the identification of the BRCA2 gene. This 1996 article first revealed loss of BRCA2, both germline and somatic, as a key driver of PDAC at a time when there was still doubt if PDAC even had an inherited component. Contrary to the prevailing wisdom, not all individuals with inherited pathogenic BRCA2 variants had a family history of cancer. The innovative bedside-to-bench nature of this work revealed that individuals with these variants would be missed if genetic testing was limited only to those meeting the family history criteria. Therefore, Goggins and colleagues advocated that universal genetic testing may be indicated for pancreatic cancer at a time when genetic testing was in its infancy. Twenty-three years later, in 2019, universal testing for pancreatic cancer became standard of care in the United States. Additionally, this work and future-related publications by the Kern Laboratory set the stage for targeting BRCA2 and related DNA repair mutations in pancreatic cancer via a synthetic lethal therapeutic approach. The provocative discussion initiated by this team in this publication is still inspiring the field today. In this seminal publication, Goggins and colleagues profoundly impacted the direction of pancreatic cancer research, leading to a more sophisticated approach to designing earlier detection and precision treatment strategies for pancreatic cancer. See related article by Goggins and colleagues, Cancer Res 1996;56:5360–4.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — germline risk evaluation states that "Genetic testing for inherited mutations is recommended for any patient with confirmed pancreatic cancer, using comprehensive gene panels for hereditary cancer syndromes". It further specifies that "Genetic counseling is recommended for patients who test positive for a pathogenic mutation (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PALB2, PMS2, STK11, and TP53) or for patients with a positive family history of cancer, especially pancreatic cancer, regardless of mutation status", with referral to "NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic, and Prostate".

### Bridging the divide: from universal germline testing guidance to real-world implementation in pancreatic cancer care | JCO oncology practice… [^115C4H7j]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Klatte et al 25examined changes in rates of GT in 533 patients with PDAC seen in the Mayo Clinic system in the year preceding and following publication of the NCCN recommendation for universal GT. Overall, the study found no significant differences in the rates of documented discussion recommending GT or actual testing performed in the pre- and post-NCCN recommendation periods evaluated. Roughly, a third of patients had a GT discussion documented, and nearly 80% of them proceeded with testing. PGVs were identified in 17. 1% of patients, and in approximately 11%, these PGVs were associated with PDAC. The authors then analyzed factors associated with GT and found that receipt of treatment and survival > 12 months were positively associated with GT, whereas living farther from the treatment center, older age, and non-Hispanic White race were negatively associated with the receipt of GT.

These findings could inform future efforts to overcome potential barriers and address this disparity to enhance rates of GT for all patients with PDAC. Third, findings from this work suggest that a broader patient pool was offered GT following the NCCN guideline update, as evidenced by numerically lower rates of identification of PGVs and lower rates of patients with a family history of cancer being tested in the post-NCCN recommendation period. Finally, this study consistently found that over a tenth of patients tested had PGVs identified, which aligns with previous research and further underscores the importance of universal GT for individuals with PDAC. Moreover, findings from this study by Klatte et al. To make universal testing for all patients with PDAC a reality, GT needs to be offered early in disease course and ideally at the time of initial consultation.

Ultimately, health care systems must personalize their efforts to enhance GT according to the needs of the community they serve, as foundational work, such as the accompanying manuscript by Klatte et al.

### Selection of germline genetic testing panels in patients with cancer: ASCO guideline [^112489by]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Germline genetic testing indications and distinction from tumor profiling state that genetic testing for an inherited pathogenic variant (germline genetic testing) is increasingly recommended to identify an inherited etiology; BRCA1/2 testing is advised for those with epithelial ovarian cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, metastatic prostate cancer, or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative breast cancer, for whom poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor use is appropriate. Germline genetic testing should be distinguished from biomarker testing (tumor genomic profiling) that identifies genetic variants in a tumor, which can be acquired (somatic) or inherited (germline), and to establish whether gene variants identified in a tumor are germline, germline genetic testing must be performed. Awareness that germline pathogenic variants may affect the use of targeted cancer therapies, such as PARP inhibitors for BRCA pathogenic variant carriers or immune therapy for tumors with microsatellite instability or mismatch repair deficiency, has heightened oncologists' recognition of the significance of genetic testing.

### The recognition and surgical management of heritable lesions of the pancreas [^112mnDyT]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Our knowledge regarding the inherited factors that lead to the development of lesions within the pancreas is clearly incomplete. This article addresses clinical issues in patients at moderate-to-high risk for pancreatic malignancy, with special emphasis on the recognition and diagnosis of known genetic syndromes. Using the current available information, the authors attempt to equip the practicing surgeon with critical information to increase clinical suspicion for heritable syndromes and inform specific surgical management. Additionally, this article is meant to encourage the practicing surgeon to participate in the genetic testing/screening, cancer surveillance, and prevention activities of patients who have heritable cancer syndromes and associated pancreatic lesions that require surgery.

ASCO metastatic pancreatic cancer guideline update — The aim was to update recommendations for therapy options after first-line treatment, and ASCO convened an Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review to update second-line therapy recommendations. New or updated recommendations for germline and somatic testing for microsatellite instability high/mismatch repair deficiency, BRCA mutations, and TRK alterations are provided for all treatment-eligible patients to select patients for recommended therapies, including pembrolizumab, olaparib, larotrectinib, or entrectinib, or potential clinical trials, and the Expert Panel continues to endorse remaining recommendations for second-line chemotherapy and related treatment, follow-up, and palliative care from the 2018 guideline.

### Metastatic pancreatic cancer: ASCO guideline update [^114WRYPh]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Patient and clinician communication — goals, testing, and shared decision-making emphasizes that patients should fully understand the goals of care before making decisions about somatic and germline testing, treatment, and care, and that the importance of both somatic and germline testing and the implications of testing on treatment options is a conversation that should be had soon after the patient's diagnosis is confirmed. For patients to make informed decisions, providers should describe the potential impact of the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer on the patient and his or her family, and providers should ask patients about their personal goals and preferences. Providers should also describe the potential impact (both medical and emotional aspects) of genetic testing on both the patient with pancreatic cancer and their family. Clinicians should clearly explain all potential treatment options, the specific somatic and germline testing needed to determine the appropriateness of those treatment options, the potential outcomes of each, and possible adverse events so that patients understand the benefits and drawbacks of each option and can make an informed decision, and treatment discussions should include relevant clinical trials at every stage of treatment. Patients should have the opportunity to participate in trials for their own treatment and be given the opportunity to contribute to research.

### Management of individuals with heterozygous germline pathogenic variants in ATM: a clinical practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^115rBrCy]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Pancreatic cancer surveillance in ATM GPV heterozygotes — evidence is limited, and recommendations are largely consensus-based with eligibility and modality details specified. The benefits of surveillance for pancreatic cancer remain unclear. A multicenter study using annual surveillance with endoscopic ultrasound and/or MRI/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in 1461 individuals at increased risk identified 9 cancers during the study period, which equates to 2 cancers per 1000 individuals per year. None of the cancers occurred in the 93 ATM heterozygotes, and of the 9 cancers, 7 were stage 1 and 8 were resectable. During the study period, 8 participants had pancreatic resections for concerning cystic lesions, 3 of which were high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, whereas 5 were low-grade dysplasia and therefore represent overdiagnosis. Another study of 336 high-risk individuals (including 1 ATM heterozygote) identified 10 cancers of which only 4 were resectable. Given the elevated risk for pancreatic cancer, ATM heterozygotes with a family history in a first- or second-degree relative on the GPV side may consider surveillance per the current international Cancer of the Pancreas Screening guidelines, and other guidelines included screening among individuals with heterozygous pathogenic variants in ATM who do not have a family history of pancreatic cancer, acknowledging that the quality of evidence is low. Pancreatic cancer screening regardless of family history was also included in NCCN guidance, and per current NCCN guidelines those eligible should initiate surveillance at age 50 or 10 years younger than the initial familial exocrine pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Surveillance tests may include annual endoscopic ultrasound and/or MRI/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and surveillance should be done in centers with appropriate expertise; recommendations are mainly based on consensus, and in the United Kingdom pancreatic cancer surveillance is not recommended outside of a research study because of the lack of data supporting efficacy.

### Adherence to NCCN genetic testing guidelines in pancreatic cancer and impact on treatment [^117G4GaA]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Some studies have examined methods to increase rates of germline genetic testing. Walker et al. found that implementation of a systematic patient intake workflow and in-clinic genetic testing station resulted in an increased rate of germline testing for patients with pancreatic cancer (from 19% to 71%). They also found that the rate of pathogenic variant detection increased from 20% to 33%. Chittenden et al. compared the rate of genetic counseling(GC)/multi-gene germline testing (MGT) before and after the implementation of automated referrals. Compared with baseline ­clinician-­directed referrals, implementation of automated referrals led to a significant increase in patients with pancreas cancer undergoing GC/MGT (16.5% vs. 38.0%, P < .001), including those undergoing MGT ≤ 7 days of initial oncology evaluation (14.7% vs. 60.3%, P < .001), with preserved pathogenic variant detection rates (10.0% vs. 11.2%, P = 0.84). Furthermore, 16 of 28 (57.1%) pathogenic variant carriers had relatives who pursued cascade germline testing, and 13 of 26 (50.0%) carriers with the incurable disease received targeted therapy based on MGT results.

Referral for germline and somatic testing at our institution is currently made at the provider discretion. We aimed to determine rates of genetic testing, factors associated with testing, and outcomes of those tested.

### Referral frequency, attrition rate, and outcomes of germline testing in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^115NzU8o]. Familial Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Hereditary predisposition is estimated to account for 10% of all pancreatic cancer cases. However, referral patterns and clinical workflow for germline testing in this disease differ significantly by institution, and many at-risk patients may not undergo appropriate counseling and testing. We undertook an analysis of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (PDAC) who were referred to the Clinical Genetics program of a high-volume academic center over a 3-year period to assess referral frequency, evaluate the yield of germline testing in this selected patient cohort, and elucidate the reasons individuals did not undergo recommended germline testing. Medical records of patients with PDAC referred for genetic counseling between January 2015 and October 2017 were reviewed for demographic, medical/family history, and disease-specific data. If testing did not occur, reasons were documented. Genetic test results were categorized as negative, variants of unknown significance, or established pathogenic mutations. Descriptive statistics included means with standard deviations; associations were analyzed with t test and Fisher's exact test. 32% (137 of 432) of PDAC patients were referred for genetic counseling, but only 64% attended their appointment and 60% ultimately underwent germline testing. Common reasons for attrition included worsening disease severity, lack of patient follow-up, insurance concerns, and logistic/travel challenges. Pathogenic germline mutations were detected in 20% (16 of 82) of patients tested, distributed across races/ethnicities, and significantly associated with younger age and positive family history of breast cancer. PDAC patients frequently do not undergo genetic counseling/germline testing despite appropriate referrals, highlighting a need to develop streamlined processes to engage more patients in testing, especially those with high-risk features.

### Genetic / familial high-risk assessment: breast and ovarian, version 2.2015 [^113ahYz7]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). Low credibility.

The NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast and Ovarian provide recommendations for genetic testing and counseling and risk assessment and management for hereditary cancer syndromes. Guidelines focus on syndromes associated with an increased risk of breast and/or ovarian cancer and are intended to assist with clinical and shared decision-making. These NCCN Guidelines Insights summarize major discussion points of the 2015 NCCN Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast and Ovarian panel meeting. Major discussion topics this year included multigene testing, risk management recommendations for less common genetic mutations, and salpingectomy for ovarian cancer risk reduction. The panel also discussed revisions to genetic testing criteria that take into account ovarian cancer histology and personal history of pancreatic cancer.
