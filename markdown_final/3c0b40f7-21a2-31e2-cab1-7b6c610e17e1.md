## Question

Patient is complaining of rapid weight gain after recently terminating the use of SSRIs. There have been no changes in behavior or habits. What is the cause of this weight gain, and what could we do to help?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why a patient might experience rapid weight gain after stopping an SSRI, despite no changes in behavior or habits, and what can be done to help. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of SSRIs and their typical weight effects during treatment. Then, I should verify whether there is credible evidence for weight changes after discontinuation. Next, I will examine plausible mechanisms that could explain post-discontinuation weight gain. After that, I need to check for alternative explanations and confounders. Finally, I will outline a practical, evidence-informed management plan and monitoring strategy, making sure I align with guidelines and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the baseline pharmacology. SSRIs acutely tend to reduce appetite and can cause modest weight loss early in treatment, but over longer horizons many patients gain weight, with paroxetine showing the clearest signal among SSRIs and fluoxetine often weight-neutral after the acute phase, which sets the context for delayed or paradoxical weight effects after discontinuation [^21cbea1c] [^37dcc518].

> Wait, let me verify the specific claim about post-discontinuation weight gain. I initially thought there were no human data, but hold on, I should double-check. A large, high-quality cohort study found that antidepressant initiation is temporally associated with weight gain, with the highest risk in years 2–3, and importantly, the association persists even after stopping treatment in some analyses, suggesting possible long-term or lagged effects of exposure rather than an immediate rebound phenomenon [^41265c48] [^a5b9a0b4]. I should also note that preclinical work shows that brief antidepressant exposure combined with stress and high-fat feeding can lead to markedly increased weight long after the drug is stopped, which supports a biologically plausible, delayed effect, though translational caution is warranted [^39cff53d] [^1afbd62a].

> I will now examine mechanisms that could plausibly explain weight gain after SSRI cessation. Let me consider neurotransmitter adaptations: chronic SSRI use alters serotonergic tone and downstream appetite circuits, and abrupt withdrawal may dysregulate 5-HT2C–POMC pathways that suppress feeding, while also unmasking histaminergic or orexigenic drives that were previously modulated, leading to hyperphagia and weight gain even without overt behavioral change [^4a27a125] [^b8a412af]. But wait, what if the effect is indirect via mood or sleep? Discontinuation syndromes can include anxiety, insomnia, and dysregulation of stress axes, which in turn can increase caloric intake and alter metabolism, so I need to ensure we screen for subtle neuropsychiatric symptoms that the patient may not volunteer [^a8cf14be] [^b0b2e446].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review alternative explanations. Hypothyroidism, Cushingoid states, insulin resistance, and medications like glucocorticoids or antipsychotics can cause rapid weight gain, and I need to check for these systematically. Also, recall bias about intake and activity is common, so I should confirm with structured history and, when feasible, objective measures or logs before attributing causality to SSRI withdrawal alone [^notfound]. I should confirm the timing relative to taper completion, because abrupt cessation increases the risk of discontinuation symptoms that could confound appetite and weight trajectories [^a8cf14be].

> Next, I should review what to do clinically. Let me first confirm the basics: obtain a precise timeline of the taper and stop date, document weight and BMI trajectory, screen for discontinuation symptoms, review all concurrent medications, and order targeted labs if indicated (TSH, fasting glucose, HbA1c, lipids) to exclude endocrine or metabolic contributors. Then, I should implement a structured weight-management plan now rather than wait, because early intervention improves outcomes and the weight gain may persist if unchecked [^6ee321cc] [^a94ff02b].

> For management, I need to ensure the plan is both safe and evidence-aligned. Lifestyle therapy remains foundational: a modest caloric deficit of about 500–750 kcal/day, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity, and behavioral strategies such as self-monitoring and stimulus control. If adherence is limited, referral to a structured program or dietitian can improve results [^notfound]. If pharmacotherapy is needed, I should consider agents with favorable weight profiles or weight-loss effects, recognizing that bupropion is the only antidepressant with consistent weight-loss effects and is not an anti-obesity drug per se, while topiramate has small RCT evidence for reversing SSRI-associated weight gain, though data are limited and adverse effects must be weighed carefully [^1e4b1507] [^e34ffa04]. If obesity criteria are met and lifestyle fails, I should discuss FDA-approved anti-obesity medications such as semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly, phentermine/topiramate ER, or naltrexone/bupropion, with shared decision-making about risks, benefits, and the need for chronic therapy to maintain weight loss, as stopping these agents typically leads to regain [^1e11c0fb] [^c024016a].

> I should confirm monitoring cadence and stop criteria. Reassess weight and vitals every 2–4 weeks initially, then monthly; if using weight-loss pharmacotherapy, continue only if there is at least 5% weight loss by 3 months and no significant adverse effects, otherwise adjust or switch therapy. Given the possibility of persistent effects after SSRI exposure, I need to counsel that weight management may be long term and that relapse risk exists if interventions are withdrawn prematurely [^e64a63ab] [^c024016a].

> Let me reconsider the original premise to ensure internal consistency. The most defensible synthesis is that SSRI exposure can produce delayed or lagged effects on weight regulation, and in some patients, discontinuation unmasks dysregulated appetite circuits or interacts with stress and environment to promote weight gain, even without overt behavioral change. While the highest-quality human evidence is observational and the mechanism is multifactorial, the signal is clinically meaningful and justifies proactive screening and early intervention rather than watchful waiting [^41265c48] [^39cff53d].

> In summary, I should confirm the diagnosis as probable SSRI discontinuation–associated weight gain after excluding other causes, initiate structured lifestyle therapy, consider bupropion if depression recurs and weight loss is desired, and escalate to anti-obesity pharmacotherapy if obesity criteria are met and lifestyle fails. Throughout, I will monitor closely, educate about the possibility of persistent effects, and adjust the plan based on response and tolerability, aligning with endocrine and obesity guidelines for long-term weight management [^6ee321cc] [^1e11c0fb] [^a94ff02b].

Rapid weight gain after SSRI discontinuation is most often due to **rebound appetite and metabolism** [^notfound] as serotonin signaling normalizes, with **no clear evidence of a distinct withdrawal-related weight gain syndrome**. Management should focus on **structured lifestyle therapy** (diet, activity, behavior) [^6ee321cc] and, if needed, switching to or adding bupropion [^1e4b1507] or topiramate [^e34ffa04] to counter weight gain. If obesity is present, consider anti-obesity medications such as semaglutide or phentermine/topiramate [^b0015a12] [^df23797a]. Monitor weight, appetite, and mood closely, and address any discontinuation symptoms with a gradual taper [^a8cf14be] and supportive care [^74548e55].

## Mechanisms of weight gain after SSRI discontinuation

Several mechanisms may explain **weight gain after SSRI discontinuation**:

- **Rebound appetite and metabolism**: SSRIs suppress appetite and increase satiety via serotonin; stopping them can reverse this, increasing hunger and caloric intake [^4a27a125].

- **Neurotransmitter imbalance**: Chronic SSRI use alters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine; abrupt cessation can dysregulate appetite and metabolism [^a4d44185].

- **Discontinuation syndrome**: Anxiety, insomnia, and agitation from SSRI withdrawal may increase stress-related eating and weight gain [^notfound].

- **Delayed pharmacologic effects**: Some SSRIs (e.g. fluoxetine) have long half-lives; weight effects may emerge after clearance, mimicking post-discontinuation gain [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence on weight gain after SSRI discontinuation

Direct evidence is limited; most data come from observational studies and clinical experience. Key findings include:

- **Observational studies**: SSRI use is associated with modest long-term weight gain (mean ~2–5 kg over 1–2 years) [^41265c48], with risk varying by agent (paroxetine> sertraline> fluoxetine) [^37dcc518].

- **Discontinuation reports**: Case series and clinical experience describe weight gain after stopping SSRIs, often with increased appetite and carbohydrate craving [^notfound].

- **Lack of controlled trials**: No randomized trials specifically isolate post-discontinuation weight gain, limiting causal inference.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized management** and **shared decision-making**:

- **Lifestyle interventions**: First-line for medication-induced weight gain; structured programs targeting diet, activity, and behavior are recommended [^6ee321cc].

- **Medication adjustments**: Consider switching to weight-neutral or weight-loss agents (e.g. bupropion) [^1e4b1507] or adding topiramate for SSRI-associated weight gain [^e34ffa04].

- **Anti-obesity pharmacotherapy**: For BMI≥ 30 kg/m² or≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities, consider semaglutide, phentermine/topiramate, or naltrexone/bupropion after lifestyle therapy [^b0015a12] [^df23797a].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly track weight, appetite, and mood; taper SSRIs gradually to minimize withdrawal and metabolic effects [^a8cf14be].

---

## Practical management strategies

A **stepwise approach** is recommended:

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Details** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Lifestyle therapy | - Caloric restriction<br/> - Increased physical activity<br/> - Behavioral counseling [^6ee321cc] |
| 2 | Medication adjustment | - Switch to bupropion or add topiramate [^1e4b1507] [^e34ffa04] |
| 3 | Anti-obesity pharmacotherapy | - Semaglutide<br/> - Phentermine/topiramate<br/> - Naltrexone/bupropion [^b0015a12] [^df23797a] |
| 4 | Monitoring and follow-up | - Regular weight checks<br/> - Appetite and mood assessment<br/> - Gradual SSRI taper [^a8cf14be] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Rapid weight gain after SSRI discontinuation likely reflects **rebound appetite and metabolism** [^notfound] rather than a distinct withdrawal syndrome. Management should prioritize **lifestyle therapy** and consider medication adjustments or anti-obesity pharmacotherapy if needed [^6ee321cc]. Close monitoring and patient education are essential to optimize outcomes.

### Association between CYP metabolizer phenotypes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced weight gain: a retrospective cohort study [^63f00292]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple drugs with indications for chronic weight management have been authorized with improved safety profiles. However, in a patient-centered care model, it is important to recognize barriers that may decrease to less effective and efficient weight management and that negatively impact weight loss outcomes. One of these barriers is weight gain as a medications’ side effect, i.e. obesogenic drugs. According to the findings of a patient survey, the most common reason for discontinuing antidepressant medication is a lack of effectiveness. However, up to 27% of patients who reported noncompliance discontinued the drug due to weight increase. Previous research has looked at the link between metabolizer status and medicine discontinuation; however, no convincing relationship has been identified due to study design and sample collection. More research is needed to determine the true impact of metabolizer status on drug discontinuation, particularly in individuals who are overweight and using SSRIs.

Limitations of current findings

Although these previous studies described the effects of antidepressants on body weight, there are multiple problems in clinical observations because of the methods used. Most previous data on antidepressant-induced weight gain were extracted from drug trials of antidepressant medications or larger cross-sectional observational studies investigating the broad spectrum of MDD research. Confounding effects such as physicians specifically selecting antidepressant medication taking into consideration the risk of weight gain could not be eliminated.Moreover, as described previously, weight gain is one of the most undesired effects of treatment, and one of the major reasons for discontinuing treatment within the first 2 months of treatment initiation.In most cases there was no long-term follow-up reported that would allow us to ascertain the impact of antidepressant treatment or exposure over the lifetime.

Purpose Of Review

We review evidence for assessing and monitoring psychotropic medications in metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) patients. We describe weight gain side effects, potential perioperative risks, pharmacokinetic changes that occur after MBS, and conclude with clinical recommendations.

Recent Findings

Research on psychiatric medication use and post-MBS weight outcomes is lacking and inconsistent; however, there is consistent evidence that, though variable, psychiatric medication use is associated with weight gain. Several meta-analyses and reviews provide guidance on lowering risk when appropriate. Perioperative lithium toxicity and SSRI discontinuation syndrome also warrant consideration, as do potential post-operative pharmacokinetic changes. In the absence of data for each psychiatric drug classification, close symptom monitoring and, where appropriate, serum concentration monitoring are recommended. MBS patients are a psychiatrically vulnerable population, and many are on psychiatric medications. Given potential weight/metabolic side effects, perioperative complications, and post-operative pharmacokinetic changes that occur with psychotropic medication use, providers should stay well informed on psychiatric medication management considerations.

Weight Gain

Potential consequences of weight gain should be considered prior to starting olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. Patients receiving olanzapine and fluoxetine should receive regular monitoring of weight.

Adults - In an analysis of 7 controlled clinical studies, 2 of which were placebo-controlled, the mean weight increase for olanzapine and fluoxetine-treated patients was greater than placebo-treated patients [4 kg (8.8 lb) vs -0.3 kg (-0.7 lb)]. Twenty-two percent of olanzapine and fluoxetine-treated patients gained at least 7% of their baseline weight, with a median exposure to event of 6 weeks. This was greater than in placebo-treated patients (1.8%). Approximately 3% of olanzapine and fluoxetine-treated patients gained at least 15% of their baseline weight, with a median exposure to event of 8 weeks. This was greater than in placebo-treated patients (0%). Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) categories. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 2.5% of olanzapine and fluoxetine-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients.

In long-term olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination studies (at least 48 weeks), the mean weight gain was 6.7 kg (14.7 lb) (median exposure of 448 days, N=431). The percentages of patients who gained at least 7%, 15% or 25% of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were 66%, 33%, and 10%, respectively. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 1.2% of patients treated with olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination following at least 48 weeks of exposure.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline—antidepressant selection and weight effects recommends a shared decision-making process that provides patients with quantitative estimates of the expected weight effect when antidepressant therapy is indicated (1|⊕⊕⊕○), noting that the expected length of treatment should also be considered. Evidence indicates heterogeneous weight effects: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine and sertraline have been associated with weight loss during acute treatment (4–12 wk) and weight neutrality in the maintenance (>4 mo) phase, with no significant effect observed for citalopram or escitalopram; paroxetine has the greatest long-term increase in body weight among SSRIs, amitriptyline is the most potent tricyclic inducer of weight gain, and mirtazapine is associated with long-term weight gain; among serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine and duloxetine have been reported to slightly increase body weight; bupropion is the only antidepressant that consistently causes weight loss and significantly decreased body weight in clinical trials; the commissioned systematic review found weight gain with amitriptyline (1.8 kg) and weight loss with bupropion (−1.3 kg) and fluoxetine (−1.3 kg).

### Long-term body weight outcomes of antidepressant-environment interactions [^39cff53d]. Molecular Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

We show here that during the course of a stress paradigm (restraint), short-term exposure to antidepressants decreases the depressive and anxiety behavioral correlates of stress. However, that short exposure to antidepressants is associated with significant body size and weight gain 122 days after discontinuation of antidepressant treatment in the context of a high-fat diet. We also show that a high-fat diet leads to correction of stress-induced weight loss in the absence of antidepressant treatment. These data suggest that exposure to antidepressants is a long-term risk factor for weight gain and obesity, even after antidepressant treatment is discontinued for a long time.

The relationship of antidepressant treatment and weight gain needs to be carefully examined. Clinically, weight gain is a common occurrence during both acute and long-term treatment with antidepressants,and it is a major problem for two reasons: (1) depressed patients are already at increased risk of cardiovascular disease,and weight gain could worsen that risk; and (2) weight gain is a cause of decreased antidepressant treatment compliance, resulting in treatment dropout.In adults, pooled analyses showed that SSRI treatment induces short-term weight loss, but long-term weight gain.There is still controversy of whether weight gain is mechanistically related to clinical improvement or if it is merely an undesirable side effect of antidepressant medication.Weight data have been derived primarily from re-analysis of drug trials or cross-sectional observation data. Moreover, it appears that specific types of antidepressants, such as tricyclic antidepressants and mirtazapine, are more likely to induce weight gain.

### Management of medication-induced weight gain [^a47a025b]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Several medications can contribute to weight gain. Medication-induced weight gain can have severe health consequences leading to overweight or obesity, or exacerbation of preexisting obesity and the plethora of obesity-related comorbidities. Weight gain due to medications is potentially avoidable by prescribing medications that are either weight neutral or that lead to weight loss, when appropriate. This article reviews the common classes of medications that contribute to weight gain and discusses alternatives to consider.

### Association between CYP metabolizer phenotypes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced weight gain: a retrospective cohort study [^fe5de537]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity is a chronic and complex multifactorial disease associated with multiple metabolic comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, and psychiatric diagnoses such as major depressive and anxiety disorders. There is a bidirectional relation between depression and obesity; thus, patients with obesity have a 55% increased risk of being diagnosed with depression over time, and patients with depression have a 58% increased risk of developing obesity.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line treatment for depression. One side effect of their use is body weight gain during short- and long-term management. In fact, it is reported that patients prescribed an SSRI gain 4.2 kg more than non-users after a three-month treatment period, and that after 2.5 years of SSRI treatment, there is an increment of 2.5% of the initial body weight. The risk factors associated with weight gain while receiving antidepressant medications are lower BMI at baseline, age under 65, and female gender. However, the mechanisms of weight gain related to antidepressant use are not well known. Possible mechanisms include remission of major depression and increased neurotransmitters such as serotonin, which regulates feeding behaviors, energy expenditure, and decreased brown adipose tissue thermogenesis.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^fceb55b4]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric obesity—history and risk context emphasizes structured history taking to guide evaluation and management. The history of the present illness provides a more comprehensive picture of the trajectory of overweight and obesity, starting with maternal pregnancy factors and then childhood and adolescent factors that predispose to obesity, and information about the onset of excess weight gain and consistency of weight status over time (including a review of the growth curve and previous weight control attempts) can clarify what weight status represents for the patient and offer clues to root causes, necessary diagnostic evaluation, and potential therapeutic targets. The family history focuses on obesity-related comorbidities and potential genetic causes of obesity, which may influence both evaluation and treatment, and can provide a clue to genetic susceptibility to obesity—especially if the family history includes severe obesity resulting in metabolic and bariatric surgery or severe obesity present in multiple family members and generations. The medication history should be complete and should include medications associated with weight gain, such as antipsychotics, especially atypical antipsychotics; antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors;

SSRIs and SNRIs

Initially, when patients were treated acutely with SSRIs weight loss was observed.Currently, SSRIs are useful for the treatment of obese patients with binge eating disorder, given their anti-impulsive action. However, their clinical relevance for weight loss in these patients remains unclear. In the recently published Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline on the Pharmacological Management of Obesity, the use of SSRIs is not listed as a therapeutic tool.Despite the fact that SSRI use has been associated with weight loss when acutely treated, a number of studies have shown SSRIs to be associated with long-term risk of weight gain., However, the number of long-term studies over the period of 1 year is limited, and there is a need for studies specifically investigating the long-term effects of SSRIs on body weight.

Cascade et al. reported that 6% of patients using SSRIs gained weight.The Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS) is a longitudinal study that has found that SSRIs and the SNRI venlafaxine use are associated with significant weight gain.A long-term comparison study investigated the effects of different types of SSRI on weight gain in patients with panic disorder. It showed that paroxetine, fluoxetine, citalopram and fluvoxamine induced weight gain of, respectively, 8.2±5.4, 5.2±4.4, 6.9±5.7 and 6.3±4.2 kg in a 1-year period.Michelson et al. observed changes in body weight during a 1-year trial period of fluoxetine treatment. The initial 12-week period was associated with weight loss of 0.35 kg, and 50 weeks of treatment resulted in weight gain of 3 kg.

### Epidemiology, implications and mechanisms underlying drug-induced weight gain in psychiatric patients [^b807cb83]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2003). Low credibility.

Body weight gain frequently occurs during drug treatment of psychiatric disorders and is often accompanied by increased appetite or food craving. While occurrence and time course of this side effect are difficult to predict, it ultimately results in obesity and the morbidity associated therewith in a substantial part of patients, often causing them to discontinue treatment even if it is effective. This paper reviews the available epidemiological data on the frequency and extent of weight gain associated with antidepressant, mood-stabilizing, and antipsychotic treatment. Possible underlying pathomechanisms are discussed with special attention to central nervous control of appetite including the role of leptin and the tumor necrosis factor system. Metabolic alterations induced by drug treatment such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome are also considered. Weight gain appears to be most prominent in patients treated with some of the second generation antipsychotic drugs and with some mood stabilizers. Marked weight gain also frequently occurs during treatment with most tricyclic antidepressants, while conventional antipsychotics typically induce only slight to moderate weight gain. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors may induce weight loss during the first few weeks, but some of them induce weight gain during long-term treatment. Several antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs are identified which reliably do not cause weight gain or even reduce weight. Based on these insights, countermeasures to manage drug-induced weight gain are suggested.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^999cd671]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

In a prospective 4-year follow-up study, SSRI-treated patients had weight gain of 4.6%.In the study conducted by Sussman et al. 17.9% of SSRI users experienced significant weight gain ⩾7%.Escitalopram (SSRI) treatment resulted in an increase of 0.05 in BMI scores during the first 12 weeks, and there was an increase of 0.12 in BMI scores after 6 months of treatment initiation.

In addition to the clinical studies described above, case studies have reported extreme weight gain in patients with SSRI treatment. In the study conducted by Bouwer et al. treatment with citalopram led to weight gain and carbohydrate craving in eight out of eighteen patients. In a 4-week period, one female patient gained 8 kg, whereas in a 5-week period one male patient gained 9 kg.In another case study, a 33-year-old schizophrenic female patient was treated with fluoxetine (40 mg per day) for a 9-month period following antipsychotic treatment with risperidone (6 mg per day) and clorazepate (15 mg per day).The patient was discontinued from fluoxetine because she underwent excessive weight gain (52 kg) accompanied with carbohydrate craving.Therefore, some individuals may be more sensitive to weight gain induced by SSRIs than others.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline—criteria to continue or discontinue weight loss medication—If a patient’s response to a weight loss medication is deemed effective (weight loss ≥ 5% of body weight at 3 mo) and safe, we recommend that the medication be continued; if deemed ineffective (weight loss < 5% at 3 mo) or if there are safety or tolerability issues at any time, we recommend that the medication be discontinued and alternatives or referral be considered. (1|⊕⊕⊕○) Supporting evidence states that weight loss medications do not change the underlying physiology of weight regulation in any permanent way, their effects are only sustained as long as they are taken, and gradual weight gain typically occurs when medications are stopped.

### Long-term side effects of SSRIs: sexual dysfunction and weight gain [^c0d3f09f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are associated with a variety of side effects, many of which are resolved during the first couple of weeks of treatment. Side effects that emerge or persist after 1 month of treatment include sexual dysfunction and weight gain. Although these adverse events are serious, they can be managed successfully if recognized early.

### Evidence-based somatic treatment of depression in adults [^87c05936]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The efficacy of antidepressants has become a contentious topic over the last decade, and yet a review of the literature shows that they are consistently more effective than placebo. Although the average magnitude of this effect is unclear, many individual patients respond well to a course of antidepressants, and relapse when the medication is discontinued. Choosing the right antidepressant for a given patient remains more art than science, but the studies reviewed here provide some helpful guidance. Table 4 lists the second-generation antidepressants along with potential reasons for choosing one over the other (based on side effects, costs, or possible therapeutic advantages.) Based on these data, the following conclusions can be drawn: • For an all-around first-line antidepressant, sertraline is hard to beat, given its combination of efficacy, tolerability, and low expense. Once escitalopram becomes generic, it will join sertraline in this category. • Bupropion is often a first-line alternative to sertraline, because of its lack of sexual side effects; although it has less efficacy for anxiety disorders, it is helpful for other comorbidities, such as tobacco dependence and attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder. • Both paroxetine and mirtazepine are often maligned because of side effects of sedation and weight gain; however, these side effects may be advantageous for those whose depressive symptoms include insomnia and excessive weight loss. • Although not specifically reviewed in this article, certain antidepressants are liable to cause more drug–drug interactions than others; the most prominent of these are fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^b0b2e446]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) and obesity are both common heterogeneous disorders with complex aetiology, with a major impact on public health. Antidepressant prescribing has risen nearly 400% since 1988, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In parallel, adult obesity rates have doubled since 1980, from 15 to 30 percent, while childhood obesity rates have more than tripled. Rising obesity rates have significant health consequences, contributing to increased rates of more than thirty serious diseases. Despite the concomitant rise of antidepressant use and of the obesity rates in Western societies, the association between the two, as well as the mechanisms underlying antidepressant-induced weight gain, remain under explored. In this review, we highlight the complex relationship between antidepressant use, MDD and weight gain. Clinical findings have suggested that obesity may increase the risk of developing MDD, and vice versa. Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activation occurs in the state of stress; concurrently, the HPA axis is also dysregulated in obesity and metabolic syndrome, making it the most well-understood shared common pathophysiological pathway with MDD. Numerous studies have investigated the effects of different classes of antidepressants on body weight. Previous clinical studies suggest that the tricyclics amitriptyline, nortriptyline and imipramine, and the serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor mirtazapine are associated with weight gain. Despite the fact that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use has been associated with weight loss during acute treatment, a number of studies have shown that SSRIs may be associated with long-term risk of weight gain; however, because of high variability and multiple confounds in clinical studies, the long-term effect of SSRI treatment and SSRI exposure on body weight remains unclear. A recently developed animal paradigm shows that the combination of stress and antidepressants followed by long-term high-fat diet results, long after discontinuation of antidepressant treatment, in markedly increased weight, in excess of what is caused by high-fat diet alone. On the basis of existing epidemiological, clinical and preclinical data, we have generated the testable hypothesis that escalating use of antidepressants, resulting in high rates of antidepressant exposure, might be a contributory factor to the obesity epidemic.

### Antidepressant medications and weight change: a narrative review [^4a27a125]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Antidepressant medications are the first-line treatment option for moderate to severe major depressive disorder. However, most antidepressants have numerous documented adverse events, including cardiometabolic effects and weight gain, which are major public health concerns. Antidepressant agents provide varying risk of associated weight gain, including significant within-class differences. Some agents, such as mirtazapine, show significant levels of weight gain, while others, such as bupropion, demonstrate weight-loss effects. Current findings suggest the role of histamine and serotonin off-target appetite-promoting pathways in adverse weight-gain effects. Therefore, controlling for undesired weight effects is an important consideration for the selection of antidepressants.

Clinical findings on the effects of antidepressant use on body weight

TCA

In the study conducted by Berken et al. low to moderate doses of the TCAs amitriptyline (150 mg per day), nortriptyline (50 mg per day) and imipramine (80 mg per day) were associated with a mean weight gain of 1.3–2.9 lbs per month, and the trend of weight gain remained linear overtime.Furthermore, it was suggested that the main reason for patients discontinuing treatment was excessive weight gain.In more recent studies, TCA antidepressants have been shown to increase the OR for MetS to 2.30 (95% CI 1.21–4.36), and this was independent of depression severity.In a 4-year follow-up study, the mean weight gain in patients treated with unspecific antidepressants was 4.3%, whereas in control subjects it was 2.5%. Moreover, weight gain for the TCA antidepressant users was 4.7% (Table 1).

Sussman et al. observed that during acute treatment with imipramine, 4.9% patients significantly gained weight; this rate increased to 24.5% in long-term treatment.Nortriptyline (TCA) was associated with an increase in BMI of 0.44  kg/m 2 over a 12-week period.Furthermore, 6 months of nortriptyline treatment was associated with an increase of 0.64 kg/m 2 in BMI.

### Reasons for discontinuation or change of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in online drug reviews [^245d26da]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What reasons for changes in the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are reported on a popular health website?

Findings

This qualitative study of 667 online drug reviews found that the most common reason for discontinuing SSRI use or switching to another SSRI was adverse events experienced, and the most common reason for dose change was titration. Adverse events categorized under psychiatric disorders (mostly apathy, anxiety, insomnia, and loss of libido), investigation results (mostly weight gain), and reproductive system and breast disorders (mostly sexual dysfunction) appeared disproportionately more often in online drug reviews than in US and UK regulatory adverse event reporting data.

Meaning

These results suggest that reasons for changes in SSRI use can be identified in online drug reviews and that adverse events mentioned may reflect those more salient to patients for discontinuing their medication.

### Understanding antidepressant mechanism of action and its effect on efficacy and safety [^17b4b50a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Common side effects of antidepressants, such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and fatigue and sleepiness, may be attributable to their mechanisms of action. Antidepressants are neurotransmitter uptake blockers, enzyme inhibitors, and neurotransmitter receptor blockers. Various mechanisms of action can determine how quickly therapeutic benefit becomes apparent and whether certain acute and persistent side effects occur. Understanding mechanism of action can help clinicians select appropriate antidepressants for individual patients and manage adherence problems due to intolerability. Although more research is needed to further elucidate specific antidepressant mechanisms of action, clinicians can use current knowledge to tailor treatment decisions, such as switching patients to a medication with a different mechanism of action when intolerable adverse events are experienced.

### Drug-induced hyperphagia: what can we learn from psychiatric medications? [^b8a412af]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

This brief review examines hyperphagia and associated weight gain as undesirable side effects of psychiatric medications; exploring the scope of the problem, proposed mechanisms, and potential interventions. Mechanisms of action appear to include drug-mediated effects on hypothalamic appetite pathways that have been implicated in other etiologies of obesity. There is great individual variation in response to these medications as well as variation in the degree of weight gain within drug classes. Gene polymorphisms may be a key factor in determining individual variations in response. Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms can guide useful interventions. Medication selection and dosing appear to be important strategies to minimize adverse weight gain.

### Synopsis of the 2020 U.S. VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of adult overweight and obesity [^6ee321cc]. Military Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Medications and potential for weight gain—adult overweight and obesity management emphasizes that it is critical to consider the impact of prescribed medications on the potential for weight gain and whether alternate medications may be a more appropriate option; providers should review the patient’s current medications for any medications that may be contributing to increased weight, and the side effects of weight gain should be considered when prescribing a medication for a patient in whom weight gain may be of concern. If an alternate medication is not an option, participation in a weight management program may benefit the patient whose only option is a medication associated with weight gain, and optimal medication management should take into account the potential effect on weight, as well as other patient factors, efficacy, safety, and available long-term outcome data.

### Antidepressants and body weight: a comprehensive review and meta-analysis [^37dcc518]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Psychotropic drugs often induce weight gain, leading to discomfort and discontinuation of treatment and, more importantly, increasing the risk of obesity-related illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. There is evidence that antidepressant drugs may induce a variable amount of weight gain, but results are sparse and often contradictory.

Data Sources

We performed a literature search using the MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane research databases for all publications available to January 2009. We used the following keywords: antidepressant, psychotropic drugs, body weight, weight gain, obesity, overweight, adverse event, side effects, SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and the name of each antidepressant active compound together with body weight or other keywords. Studies reporting body weight changes during treatment with different antidepressants were selected for eligibility. Finally, 116 studies were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction

Weight change mean and standard deviation and size of each group were recorded. Missing means and standard deviations were directly calculated by using information available in the article when possible. Non-placebo-controlled studies were compared to a virtual placebo sample, whose mean and standard deviation were derived by the weighted mean of means and standard deviations of all placebo samples. Methodological quality of studies, heterogeneity, publication bias, and effect of treatment duration were systematically controlled.

Data Synthesis

Quantitative results evidenced that amitriptyline, mirtazapine, and paroxetine were associated with a greater risk of weight gain. In contrast, some weight loss occurs with fluoxetine and bupropion, although the effect of fluoxetine appears to be limited to the acute phase of treatment. Other compounds have no transient or negligible effect on body weight in the short term. However, the effect of each antidepressant may vary greatly depending on an individual's characteristics and generally became more evident in the long term to a variable degree across compounds.

Conclusions

Despite the fact that some analyses were done on only a few studies due to the difficulty of finding reliable information in literature, to our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive meta-analysis to allow comparison of different antidepressants as regards their impact on body weight. Data presented may be helpful for a more accurate treatment selection in patients at risk of obesity or related medical illness.

### Long-term body weight outcomes of antidepressant-environment interactions [^dc40a839]. Molecular Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious public health problem. Currently, the point prevalence of MDD is ∼4–7%, and the lifetime prevalence estimate ranges from 15 to 20%. MDD is the leading cause of disability measured in years lost because of disability, and the largest single cause of nonfatal disease burden in Australia.It will become the second leading contributor to global burden of disease by the year 2020 (disability-adjusted life year).Approximately 59% of individuals with MDD seek help for their condition, and 35% receive medication or psychological treatment.According to the Canadian Community Health Survey, the prevalence of antidepressant use over a period of 12 months between 2001 and 2002 was estimated at 5.8%.

MDD is a common complex disorder that affects ∼121 million people worldwide. In the United States, the economic burden of MDD is in the order of $100 billions per year, with workplace costs being the largest component.Antidepressant dispensing has increased substantially during the last two decades in Western countries. In the United States, antidepressants are prescribed to 27 million people and they are the most frequently prescribed class of medication. In the United Kingdom, France and Australia, antidepressant prescriptions have increased substantially since the early 1990s with the entry of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the marketplace.

Studies examining weight gain during long-term SSRI treatment have reported inconsistent results. The results of a large, cross-sectional study based on the General Electric Medical Records Database of MDD patients treated with antidepressant monotherapy for at least 1 year suggested differences in the proportion of patients who gained at least 7% of their body weight (BW) during treatment. The highest percentage of patients with weight gain was associated with mirtazapine (26%), followed by the SSRIs (16–19%).Antidepressant treatment can be effective in MDD, but compliance is low: in a large European study of 7525 patients, 56% abandoned treatment within 4 months.

It is generally accepted that the side effects such as weight gain can adversely affect adherence to therapy, but according to Bulloch and Patten,the main reason for non-adherence was forgetting (74.5% of responders), followed by ‘felt better' (10.7%); side effects were reported as the fourth reason (5.9%). It is commonly stated that patients return to their previous weight after they stop taking antidepressants, but this assumption is not evidence based.

Weight gain associated with antipsychotic medication can be a barrier to the overall improvement of mental health patients due to a discontinuation of treatment. The goal of this article is to establish a better understanding regarding the mechanisms of antipsychotic medications and their associated risk of weight gain, obesity, and subsequent mortality and morbidity. Additionally, the need to closely monitor patients' lifestyles and homeostatic components in order to prevent weight gain or facilitate weight loss is emphasized.

### Weight gain in the treatment of mood disorders [^6eefd48a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Overweight and obesity have become an urgent public health problem in the United States: approximately 61% of the adult population (97 million adults) are overweight or obese, where overweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI) >/= 25 and obesity is defined as a BMI >/= 30. Overweight and obesity increase the risk for developing many serious chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and certain cancers. Increased morbidity due to obesity-related disorders begins within the normal weight range. Weight gain in adulthood per se, even in individuals who are normal weight, has deleterious health effects. Medications, particularly those commonly used in psychiatry and neurology, are a significant iatrogenic source of overweight and obesity. The weight gain potential of prescription medications should be considered in order to enhance patient compliance and reduce the risk of metabolic sequelae of weight gain. This article provides an overview of the weight-gain potential of several classes of drugs commonly used in psychiatric practice and considerations for clinicians in prescribing these medications.

### Antidepressant utilisation and incidence of weight gain during 10 years' follow-up: population based cohort study [^41265c48]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

A systematic review analysed short term studies and estimated weight increases over eight months’ follow-up.Another study evaluated weight gain up to two years using electronic health records,with estimates consistent with a 2.1 kg weight gain with fluoxetine treatment and about a 4.8 kg increase with setraline. These figures suggest that increases of ≥5% body weight are plausible. Our study adds to previous data by providing longer follow-up (up to 10 years) of antidepressant treatment, showing that the risk of weight gain is increased for at least the first five years of treatment. Our study also adds a comparison with a general population sample that was not treated with antidepressant drugs, showing an association between antidepressant use and transitions to overweight and obesity. Weight gain is a well recognised side effect of antipsychotic treatment,but prescribing guidelines generally devote less attention to weight management in the context of antidepressant treatment.Obesity and depression are common, often coexist, and are associated with physical comorbidity and worse health outcomes.Researchers have observed that the negative perceptions associated with either a depression diagnosis or an obesity diagnosis may be potentiated when the conditions overlap.This makes weight management and obesity prevention particularly important in this population. The relation between depression symptoms and health behaviours that might contribute to weight gain is also a relevant concern.

From a population perspective, these results suggest that the widespread use of antidepressants might be an important factor contributing to increasing body weight. These results should be set in the context of increasing BMI in the general population. Data from the health survey for England show that between 2004 and 2014 the prevalence of obesity in adults increased from 23% to 26%, and mean BMI increased from 26.9 to 27.2.From a clinical perspective, these observations reinforce the need for active body weight management to accompany antidepressant treatment,although this might often be met with limited success. The potential for weight gain may also be a consideration in the selection of individual antidepressant drugs.

Conclusions and policy implications

Initiation of antidepressant drugs shows a strong temporal association with weight gain, which is greatest during the second and third years of treatment. During the second year of treatment, the risk of ≥5% weight gain is 46.3% higher than in a general population comparison group. These associations are consistent across a wide range of clinical, social, and demographic characteristics. The increasingly widespread use of antidepressants is of concern in the context of the increasing prevalence of obesity.

### Topiramate treatment for SSRI-induced weight gain in anxiety disorders [^e34ffa04]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have been associated with significant weight gain, a problem that frequently leads to noncompliance and premature discontinuation of treatment. Topiramate is a novel anticonvulsant that has also been used as a mood stabilizer and augmentation agent in mood disorders. Topiramate has been observed to have an interesting side effect of weight loss in some individuals. In this study, topiramate was added to the treatment regimen of patients with a primary DSM-IV anxiety disorder who had experienced substantial SSRI-induced weight gain, in an attempt to induce weight loss.

Method

Topiramate was added to SSRI treatment in 15 anxiety disorder patients, starting at a dose of 50 mg/day and titrating up to a target daily dose of 100 mg/day, with a maximum dose of 250 mg/day. Subjects' weight was measured at baseline and after 5 and 10 weeks of treatment.

Results

Before topiramate treatment, SSRI-treated subjects in this sample had gained a mean of 13.0 +/- 8.4 kg (28.6 +/- 18.5 lb). After the addition of a mean dose of 135.0 +/- 44.1 mg/day of topiramate for approximately 10 weeks, subjects lost a mean of 4.2 +/- 6.0 kg (9.3 +/- 13.3 lb).

Conclusion

Topiramate may have a role in managing SSRI-induced weight gain in anxiety disorder patients.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^85e17f0e]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Since the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of fluoxetine (Prozac) in 1988, SSRIs have been the most prescribed antidepressants on the market.They act by inhibiting serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) uptake. Since then, other SSRIs have emerged in the market, and these include citalopram (Celexa), fluvoxamine (Floxyfral), paroxetine (Aropax) and sertraline (Zoloft).Although SSRIs have been well tolerated by patients because of fewer side effects than previous drug, there is still a substantial profile of adverse drug reactions, such as sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, weight gain, dry mouth, insomnia, fatigue, nausea, dizziness and tremors. The tolerability of a drug can be assessed by discontinuation rates in clinical trials. The discontinuation rate within 2 months for fluvoxamine was ~70%, followed by fluoxetine (45%) and sertraline (40%).

After the successful development of SSRIs, it was proposed that the simultaneous action of selective noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake could provide better efficacy. Thus, antidepressant SNRIs are as effective as TCAs, but side effects such as cardiac arrhythmias and seizures are significantly reduced. SNRIs available on the market include duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq) and milnacipran (Savella).

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^a4d44185]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Mechanism proposed of antidepressant-induced weight gain

Central and peripheral mechanisms of appetite and feeding behaviour regulation are complex; regulatory factors such as neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and hormone-like peptides have a role in orchestrating appetite, feeding behaviours and metabolic pathways.In previous studies, it has been suggested that weight gain associated with antidepressants reflects the action of monoamine pathways, which include serotonergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic receptors. The specific mechanisms of action of different antidepressants on weight are described below (Figure 1).

### Long-term changes in adiposity markers during and after antidepressant therapy in a community cohort [^90363708]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by a complex co-morbidity profile including obesity. Aside from poor health behavior, the effects of antidepressants (ADs) have been suggested to mediate the association between MDD and subsequent weight gain. Considering the concomitant rise of prescriptions of ADs in the last decades, the potentially weight increasing effect of ADs has become a challenging public health issue.

Numerous randomized and open clinical trials as well as epidemiological studies have addressed this topic and suggest that the classical tricyclics (TCA) are associated with weight gain. A meta-analysis of clinical trials, which could only identify 30 placebo-controlled randomized studies also providing information on weight gain during acute or maintenance treatment, has evidenced that among the assessed compounds only few were associated with weight changes. The classical TCA amitriptyline, the noradrenergic and specific serotoninergic AD (NaSSA) mirtazapine and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) paroxetine were associated with greater risk of weight gain, whereas the SSRI fluoxetine and the norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) bupropion were associated with weight loss, although this effect of fluoxetine was limited to the 4–12 week’s acute treatment phase. A more recent meta-analysis confirmed weight gain associated with the use of amitriptyline and mirtazapine and weight loss associated with the use of fluoxetine and bupropion. However, although some of these studies did not only include acute but also maintenance treatment, they could not inform on associations between AD use of more than 12 months and weight changes. Indeed, the longest placebo-controlled clinical trial included in these metanalyses did not exceed a period of more than 12 months. Accordingly, available information on weight changes associated with sustained AD use beyond this period relies entirely on prospective cohort studies. A systematic review of seven cohort studies involving follow-up periods between 2 and 18 years has documented at least 5% weight gain in individuals with AD use in most of the studies. However, besides the risk of indication bias, which is inherent in all observational research, existing long-term studies are subject to several limitations including not systematically recording data on weight in primary care databases, using self-reported weight, and lack of assessment of depressive episodes or symptoms impeding distinction between the effects of ADs and those of depressive episodes. Moreover, none of the previous observational studies could identify episodes with atypical characteristics, which have been shown to be most strongly associated with weight gain. Finally, most studies only assessed changes in weight or body mass index (BMI), although recent data have suggested that waist circumference is more strongly associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease than BMI and that body fat percentage could be an independent risk factor for mortality.

### Medication associated with weight gain may influence outcome in a weight management program [^161b6e28]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Weight gain is a commonly overlooked adverse effect of some medications that potentially confounds weight loss efforts in individuals who are overweight and obese.

Objective

To determine the frequency of use of drugs associated with weight gain by participants and the effect on outcome in a weight management program.

Methods

Adult patients > 18 years of age were recruited from an outpatient, university-based setting to participate in a 20-week structured weight management program.

Results

Ninety patients (74 women) were recruited (mean [+/- SD] age 48 +/- 10 y, mean body mass index 37 +/- 6 kg/m2). Patients had multiple diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 23), hypertension (n = 48), depression (n = 18), and dyslipidemia (n = 9). The median number of drugs per patient was 4.0 (range 0-15). The median number of drugs associated with weight gain was zero (range 0-3). Forty-three (48%) patients were taking at least one of these agents, including beta-blockers (n = 18), selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (n = 18), sulfonylureas (n = 7), insulin (n = 9), and thiazolidinediones (n = 6). Seven patients completed < or = 6 weeks of the program and were excluded from further analysis, and 83 patients completed 10 weeks. Of these 83 patients, 39 had lost < or = 2% of their initial weight; 23 (59%) of those 39 were taking drugs associated with weight gain. Fifty-nine patients completed the full 20 weeks. The mean overall weight loss of completers was 4.8 +/- 5.0% (range-5.9 [gain] to 17.1% [loss]) at 20 weeks.

Conclusions

Patients taking WGDs weighed more at baseline and were less likely to lose weight in this program. Attention should be given when prescribing such medications to obese patients, as this may negatively influence their weight management.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^41b00fe4]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder acute phase—choosing specific pharmacological treatment: Clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline, which are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of OCD, are recommended pharmacological agents. Although meta-analyses and head-to-head trials suggest greater efficacy for clomipramine than for fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline, the results of head-to-head trials comparing clomipramine and SSRIs directly do not support this impression. Because SSRIs have a less troublesome side-effect profile than clomipramine, an SSRI is preferred for a first medication trial. Although all SSRIs (including citalopram and escitalopram) appear to be equally effective, individual patients may respond well to one and not to another, and reasons for this patient-specific response are unknown; no demographic or clinical variables are sufficiently accurate predictors of treatment outcome to guide selection. In choosing among SSRIs, the psychiatrist should consider safety and acceptability of particular side effects, applicable FDA warnings, potential drug interactions, past treatment response, and co-occurring general medical conditions; for example, paroxetine, the SSRI most associated with weight gain and the most anticholinergic SSRI, would not be the first choice for patients with obesity, diabetes mellitus, constipation, or urinary hesitancy.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^c613aacc]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)—adverse effects and initiation—are generally well tolerated, with most adverse effects emerging within the first few weeks and including dry mouth, nausea, diarrhea, heartburn, headache, somnolence, insomnia, dizziness, vivid dreams, changes in appetite, weight loss or gain, fatigue, nervousness, tremor, bruxism, and diaphoresis; potentially serious adverse effects include suicidal thinking and behavior, behavioral activation/agitation, hypomania, mania, sexual dysfunction, seizures, abnormal bleeding, and serotonin syndrome; it may be helpful when starting a new SSRI to begin with a sub-therapeutic dose to minimize adverse effects, and because early adverse effects and delayed efficacy can prompt discontinuation, it is important to provide education about the time-course of improvement and adverse effects; although SSRIs have a greater margin of safety in overdose than other antidepressants, deaths have been reported after very large ingestions.

### Interventions for preventing weight gain after smoking cessation [^88fe0869]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Most people who stop smoking gain weight, on average about 7 kg in the long term. There are some interventions that have been specifically designed to tackle smoking cessation whilst also limiting weight gain. Many smoking cessation pharmacotherapies and other interventions may also limit weight gain.

Objectives

This review is divided into two parts. (1) Interventions designed specifically to aid smoking cessation and limit post-cessation weight gain (2) Interventions designed to aid smoking cessation that may also plausibly have an effect on weight

Search Strategy

Part 1: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register which includes trials indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch and PsycINFO, and other reviews and conference abstracts. Part 2: We searched the included studies of Cochrane smoking cessation reviews of nicotine replacement therapy, antidepressants, nicotine receptor partial agonists, cannabinoid type 1 receptor antagonists (rimonabant), and exercise interventions, published in Issue 4, 2008 of The Cochrane Library.

Selection Criteria

Part 1: We included trials of interventions designed specifically to address both smoking cessation and post-cessation weight gain that had measured weight at any follow-up point and/or smoking six months or more after quitting.Part 2: We included trials from the selected Cochrane reviews that could plausibly modify post-cessation weight gain if they had reported weight gain by trial arm at end of treatment or later.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on smoking and weight for part 1 trials, and on weight only for part 2. Abstinence from smoking is expressed as a risk ratio (RR), using the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. The outcome is expressed as the difference in weight change between trial arms from baseline. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel method for smoking and inverse variance for weight using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We found evidence that pharmacological interventions aimed at reducing post-cessation weight gain resulted in a significant reduction in weight gain at the end of treatment (dexfenfluramine (-2.50kg [-2.98kg to -2.02kg], fluoxetine (-0.80kg [-1.27kg to -0.33kg], phenylpropanolamine (PPA) (-0.50kg [-0.80kg to -0.20kg], naltrexone (-0.76kg [-1.51kg to -0.01kg])). No evidence of maintenance of the treatment effect was found at six or 12 months.Among the behavioural interventions, only weight control advice was associated with no reduction in weight gain and with a possible reduction in abstinence. Individualized programmes were associated with reduced weight gain at end of treatment and at 12 months (-2.58kg [-5.11kg to -0.05kg]), and with no effect on abstinence (RR 0.74 [0.39 to 1.43]). Very low calorie diets (-1.30kg (-3.49kg to 0.89kg] at 12 months) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (-5.20kg (-9.28kg to -1.12kg] at 12 months) were both associated with improved abstinence and reduced weight gain at end of treatment and at long-term follow up.Both bupropion (300mg/day) and fluoxetine (30mg and 60mg/day combined) were found to limit post-cessation weight gain at the end of treatment (-0.76kg [-1.17kg to -0.35kg] I(2)=48%) and -1.30kg [-1.91kg to -0.69kg]) respectively. There was no evidence that the weight reducing effect of bupropion was dose-dependent. The effect of bupropion at one year was smaller and confidence intervals included no effect (-0.38kg [-2.001kg to 1.24kg]).We found no evidence that exercise interventions significantly reduced post-cessation weight gain at end of treatment but evidence for an effect at 12 months (-2.07kg [-3.78kg, -0.36kg]).Treatment with NRT resulted in attenuation of post-cessation weight gain (-0.45kg [-0.70kg, -0.20kg]) at the end of treatment, with no evidence that the effect differed for different forms of NRT. The estimated weight gain reduction was similar at 12 months (-0.42kg [-0.92kg, 0.08kg]) but the confidence intervals included no effect.There were no relevant data on the effect of rimonabant on weight gain.We found no evidence that varenicline significantly reduced post-cessation weight gain at end of treatment and no follow-up data are currently available. One study randomizing successful quitters to 12 more weeks of active treatment showed weight to be reduced by 0.71kg (-1.04kg to -0.38kg). In three studies, participants taking bupropion gained significantly less weight at the end of treatment than those on varenicline (-0.51kg [-0.93kg to -0.09kg]).

Authors' Conclusions

Behavioural interventions of general advice only are not effective and may reduce abstinence. Individualized interventions, very low calorie diets, and CBT may be effective and not reduce abstinence. Exercise interventions are not associated with reduced weight gain at end of treatment, but may be associated with worthwhile reductions in weight gain in the long term, Bupropion, fluoxetine, nicotine replacement therapy, and probably varenicline all reduced weight gain while being used. Although this effect was not maintained one year after quitting for bupropion, fluoxetine, and nicotine replacement, the evidence is insufficient to exclude a modest long-term effect. The data are not sufficient to make strong clinical recommendations for effective programmes.

Antidepressants

In 1950s, the antidepressant effects of MAOIs were first discovered when tuberculosis patients were treated with iproniazid. Shortly after iproniazid treatment initiation, patients experienced an antidepressant-like effect with elevated mood. Subsequently, it was shown that iproniazid is a MAOI, with the ability to inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase to catabolise monoamines, preventing monoamine depletion in the brain.Since then, it has been hypothesised that a depletion in other neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin contributes to cause MDD.There are different classes of antidepressant drugs, and, primarily, they have been known to work by modulating neurotransmitter levels in the brain.Older generation antidepressants include MAOIs and tricyclics (TCAs),whereas newer types of antidepressants have greater specificity and include selective reuptake inhibitors (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, SSRI), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors.Other antidepressants include tetracyclics and serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors.

Currently, non-selective MAOIs on the market include phenelzine (Nardil), isocarboxazid (Marplan) and tranylcypromine (Parnate).Selective MAOIs include selegiline (Emsam) and clorgyline.However, the use of such drugs declined because of their serious side effects, such as those related to food and drug interactions. MAOIs are used as a third or fourth line of the therapy when other types of therapy have failed.

The therapeutic action of TCAs is known to occur via inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.These include imipramine (Tofranil), amitriptyline (Elavil), nortiptyline (Allegron), trimipramine (Surmontil), protriptyline (Concordin) and iprindole (Prondol).However, TCAs have multiple nonspecific actions that are associated with side effects.These nonspecific actions include anticholinergic–antimuscarinic (M1), α-1 adrenergic antagonistic and antihistaminergic activities (H1).Furthermore, large doses of TCAs inhibit sodium channels, leading to lethal cardiac arrhythmias and seizures.For this reason, TCA antidepressants are used with caution in patients with high risk of CVD. Moreover, TCA-induced weight gain is one of the main reasons for the discontinuation of treatment within 1 month.

Strengths and limitations of this study

This study used data from a large nationally representative primary care database in the United Kingdom. Use of electronic health records enabled us to comprehensively ascertain whether participants had received prescriptions for antidepressants. We used clinical records of weight, height, and BMI. These measures are not always systematically recorded in primary care.Infrequent recording of BMI could lead to underestimation of associations if weight gain occurred but no measurement was taken; conversely, confounding of measurement by indication might occur if family doctors are more likely to record body weight when there has been weight gain. The direction of any possible bias from incomplete recording of body weight is difficult to anticipate. We initially selected participants who had at least three BMI measurements recorded, leading to over-representation of those with comorbidity; participants with no comorbidities being less likely to have BMI recorded than those with concurrent illnesses. Patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus or coronary heart disease may be more likely to be enrolled in self management interventions that focus on diet, exercise, and weight control and this could modify estimated associations. Also, in this non-randomised study, residual confounding might lead to bias. Confounding by indication might occur if the propensity to be prescribed antidepressants is also associated with the propensity to gain weight. The present data show that 94% of treated patients had a diagnosis of depression. However, antidepressant drugs can be prescribed for several disorders, and depression might not always have been the sole indication for prescription. We cannot exclude the possibility that depressive symptoms rather than antidepressant treatment were the reason for changes in body weight. Analyses were based on antidepressant prescription, but non-adherence might be common and could diminish estimated associations.However, clinical trials in depressed patients show that antidepressant treatment is associated with weight gain.The strong temporal association between initiation of antidepressant treatment and weight gain also suggests a causal association. This dataset reflects prescribing habits over a decade. During this time a switch occurred from older tricyclic antidepressants to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. Older generation drugs, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, are generally more associated with weight gain than are the newer SSRIs, but the older generation drugs are only infrequently prescribed. Associations with weight gain might depend on drug dose, but it was not possible to reconstruct dosage information for this study.

Introduction

The World Health Organisation predicts that depression will become the leading cause of disability globally by 2030. The symptomatology, longitudinal course, response to treatment and functional impact of depressive disorders are highly variable. Antidepressant medicines are widely prescribed across the spectrum of depression severity and subtypes, alone or in combination with psychological therapies.

Effective pharmacotherapies for depression were first developed in the 1960s, following the identification of antipsychotic therapies. A clear focus was on the regulation of brain monoamine systems (dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline). These agents, including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), were limited in the extent of their use by considerable side effect burdens and potential toxicity. From the 1980s onwards, further pharmacological developments have been dominated by the establishment of second-generation antidepressant classes, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Although second-generation antidepressants have been shown to alleviate depression, treatment response is heterogeneous, and new side effect profiles have emerged (gastrointestinal, weight gain, sexual dysfunction). The degree of individual variation in the incidence and severity of these difficulties is high.

Treatment failure is commonly caused by the discontinuation of antidepressants from adverse side effects. Over half of individuals have been recorded to cease medication within the first six months of initial prescription. Previously reported antidepressant adverse effects include sexual dysfunction –, weight changes –, insomnia –, and suicidality –. However, these ‘side effects’ may also reflect ongoing symptoms of the depressive illness. For example, anhedonia is a cardinal symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD) which could explain lower levels of sexual interest and arousal leading to sexual function impairments,. Weight changes, sleep disturbances, and suicidality are also symptoms of depressionand its various phenotypic subtypes. Finally, other comorbid mental health disorders may amplify or trigger suicidal behaviours. Whether these side effects stem from adverse reactions to antidepressants or whether they are extensions or exacerbations of characteristics of an individual’s depression or a consequence of comorbidity with another disorder remains unclear.

Side effects of antidepressants

Despite all the aforementioned benefits of antidepressants, the treatment is not free from risks and side effects. In a study to assess self-discontinuation of antidepressants, 313 patients were interviewed to investigate the reason for stopping the treatment. Side effects were reported by 20% of the patients as the main cause of discontinuation. Premature self-discontinuation is associated with relapse and incomplete response to the treatment. The key side effects associated with antidepressant use vary by class of the antidepressant and might vary also by medication within each class. Even though TCAs are very effective in treating depression, they also act on other receptor systems, including histaminic, cholinergic, adrenergic and postsynaptic serotonin receptors, leading to significant and sometimes intolerable side effects. Moreover, TCAs have a narrow therapeutic index and at higher doses, they might cause seizures and death due to slowing of intraventricular conduction, leading to complete heart block or ventricular re-entry arrhythmias. SSRIs, on the other hand, are better tolerated and significantly less toxic in an overdose than TCAs. The most common side effects related to SSRIs are gastrointestinal like nausea, activation syndrome, sexual dysfunction, body weight gain, insomnia and serotonin syndrome. Antidepressants that also act on the noradrenergic system (i.e. SNRIs) are associated with significantly greater increase in blood pressure and heart rate than SSRIs and also with gastrointestinal effects, activation syndrome, insomnia and sexual dysfunction. In order to decrease self-discontinuation, it is important to choose an efficient antidepressant with the profile of side effects that will not hamper the quality of life of the patient.

Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)—for all SNRIs, medical monitoring should include height, weight, pulse, and blood pressure, and no specific laboratory tests are recommended. As with SSRIs, a discontinuation syndrome has been reported following missed doses or acute discontinuation of SNRIs, and SNRIs also warrant a slow discontinuation taper.

For decongestants, use for shortest duration possible and avoid in severe or uncontrolled hypertension, with consideration of alternative therapies (nasal saline, intranasal corticosteroids, antihistamines) as appropriate. For NSAIDs and acetaminophen, avoid systemic NSAIDs when possible, limit acetaminophen to less than 4 g/d, and consider alternative analgesics (e.g., topical NSAIDs) depending on indication and risk. For sudden withdrawal of central-acting sympathetic drugs such as clonidine and tizanidine, recommend avoiding oral clonidine for treatment of hypertension whenever possible and tapering upon discontinuation; use cyclobenzaprine or other muscle relaxants instead of tizanidine. For amphetamines, discontinue or decrease dose and consider behavioral therapies or nonstimulants (such as guanfacine) for ADHD. For antidepressants, consider alternative agents (e.g., SSRIs) depending on indication and avoid tyramine-containing foods with MAOIs. For atypical antipsychotics, discontinue or limit use when possible, consider behavior therapy where appropriate, recommend lifestyle modification (Section 5.1 “Lifestyle and Psychosocial Approaches”), and consider alternative agents associated with lower risk of weight gain, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. For immunosuppressants, consider converting to tacrolimus, which may be associated with fewer effects on BP. For oral contraceptives, use low-dose agents (e.g., 20-30 mcg ethinyl estradiol) or a progestin-only form, or consider alternative forms of birth control (barrier, abstinence, nonhormonal IUD), and avoid use in women with uncontrolled hypertension. For androgen deprivation therapy, avoid or limit use when possible and consider alternative chemotherapy.

Discussion

Current interventions against antipsychotic-induced weight gain

Current interventions against antipsychotic-induced weight gain fall into three categories. The first category involves changing antipsychotic medication to a compound less prone to result in weight gain. This strategy is recommended in clinical guidelines and results in a modest slowing of antipsychotic-induced weight gain to approximately 1.9 kg. Change of medication, however, may increase the risk of exacerbating psychotic symptoms. The second category involves lifestyle intervention and/or cognitive therapy and appears to slowdown the SGA-induced weight gain by 2.6 kg after 3 to 4 months; 4.2 kg after 6 months; and 3.1 kg after 12 to 18 months of treatment. Finally, adjuvant medical treatment, the third category, has been attempted with numerous drugs, including ephedrine, sibutramine, orlistat, nizatidine, cimetidine, naltrexone, amantadine, reboxetine, fluoxetine, topiramate, dextroamphetamine, d-fenfluramine, famotidine, fluvoxamine, phenylpropanolamine, rosiglitazone, metformin and the combination of metformin and sibutramine. Metformin is by far the most investigated of these drugs and is associated with the most pronounced deceleration of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: 2.9 kg over 13 weeks compared with placebo. Metformin, however, is considered a weight neutral intervention in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Notably, all current interventions are weight neutral at best. This is the case because a weight reducing intervention may mask a net weight gain (for example, a reported weight loss of 4 kg may be based on a 2 kg weight gain in the intervention group compared with a 6 kg weight gain in the placebo group). Absolute, placebo-controlled weight loss has only been achieved by means of resource-demanding interventions comprising strict diets and intensive physical training among hospitalized patients or during short treatment periods (≤12 weeks).

In the general population, treatment of obesity often comprises a combination of diet, exercise, modification of daily routines and medication. Currently, orlistat (a lipase inhibitor), sibutramine (a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) and sympathomimetics are the only approved drugs with the indication obesity. Bariatric surgery (for example, gastric bypass surgery) is the single most efficient way to achieve lasting weight loss. However, this intervention is not without risk and, therefore, only indicated in selected patients (for example, morbid obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m 2)).

### First-line antidepressants tied to minor differences in weight gain (...) [^5b7e7017]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Weight gain is a common adverse effect of antidepressants and might contribute to some patients stopping the medications. Now, a new observational study focused on the effects of 8 first-line antidepressants found that some types were associated with a greater chance of weight gain in patients than others. People who began taking the antidepressants escitalopram, paroxetine, and duloxetine tended to gain slightly more weight—up to about 0. 4 kg —after 6 months of using the medications compared with those who used sertraline, the researchers reported in Annals of Internal Medicine. They were also at a 10% to 15% higher risk of gaining at least 5% of their baseline weight, according to data involving more than 183 100 participants. Sertraline was the most commonly prescribed antidepressant in the database the researchers used and was linked with an average increase of more than 1. 5 kg after 2 years. Harris E.

### Medication-induced weight change across common antidepressant treatments: a target trial emulation study [^b25861e7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Antidepressants are among the most commonly prescribed medications, but evidence on comparative weight change for specific first-line treatments is limited.

Objective

To compare weight change across common first-line antidepressant treatments by emulating a target trial.

Design

Observational cohort study over 24 months.

Setting

Electronic health record (EHR) data from 2010 to 2019 across 8 U.S. health systems.

Participants

183118 patients.

Measurements

Prescription data determined initiation of treatment with sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, duloxetine, or venlafaxine. The investigators estimated the population-level effects of initiating each treatment, relative to sertraline, on mean weight change (primary) and the probability of gaining at least 5% of baseline weight (secondary) 6 months after initiation. Inverse probability weighting of repeated outcome marginal structural models was used to account for baseline confounding and informative outcome measurement. In secondary analyses, the effects of initiating and adhering to each treatment protocol were estimated.

Results

Compared with that for sertraline, estimated 6-month weight gain was higher for escitalopram (difference, 0.41 kg [95% CI, 0.31 to 0.52 kg]), paroxetine (difference, 0.37 kg [CI, 0.20 to 0.54 kg]), duloxetine (difference, 0.34 kg [CI, 0.22 to 0.44 kg]), venlafaxine (difference, 0.17 kg [CI, 0.03 to 0.31 kg]), and citalopram (difference, 0.12 kg [CI, 0.02 to 0.23 kg]); similar for fluoxetine (difference, -0.07 kg [CI, -0.19 to 0.04 kg]); and lower for bupropion (difference, -0.22 kg [CI, -0.33 to -0.12 kg]). Escitalopram, paroxetine, and duloxetine were associated with 10% to 15% higher risk for gaining at least 5% of baseline weight, whereas bupropion was associated with 15% reduced risk. When the effects of initiation and adherence were estimated, associations were stronger but had wider CIs. Six-month adherence ranged from 28% (duloxetine) to 41% (bupropion).

Limitation

No data on medication dispensing, low medication adherence, incomplete data on adherence, and incomplete data on weight measures across time points.

Conclusion

Small differences in mean weight change were found between 8 first-line antidepressants, with bupropion consistently showing the least weight gain, although adherence to medications over follow-up was low. Clinicians could consider potential weight gain when initiating antidepressant treatment.

### Long-term body weight outcomes of antidepressant-environment interactions [^1afbd62a]. Molecular Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

This study suggests that the ‘paradoxical' effect of antidepressant treatment in BW in humans when compared with rodents may be explained by the simplified experimental paradigm generally used in rodents, which has not accounted for environmental factors, such as stress and diet, or a meaningfully long follow-up period. We show here that the inclusion of environmental factors after antidepressant treatment may induce long-term weight gain in rodents; therefore, the default explanation that differences in metabolic and neuroendocrine pathways regulating appetite and energy metabolism are required to explain the discrepancy of antidepressant effects in BW between human and rodentsneeds to be revisited, and as such differences may in reality be small or non-existent.

Given that noncompliance to antidepressant treatment seems to be high in the general population (>50%),our data emphasize the need to examine whether these drugs have effects on BW regulation that persist on a long-term basis after their discontinuation. Alarmingly, SSRI drugs have become so popular that they are already been called ‘lifestyle' drugs. In the United States, obesity rates started to increase markedly in the late 1980s, which coincides temporally with the introduction of SSRIs. Yearly increases in the rates of antidepressant dispensingseem to parallel increases in obesity rates;however, detailed analyses of those trends at the population level are required to establish a clinical association.

In conclusion, we propose here that antidepressant treatment, occurring in the context of conditions of high stress and high-fat intake, might be a covert, insidious and long-lasting contributor to weight gain, even after antidepressant drugs are discontinued for a long time, which is compatible with the phenomenon of TDS. Further research is needed to understand the pathways and pathophysiological mechanisms involved in pharmacological–environment interactions underlying the protracted effects of antidepressant drugs on caloric intake and body size and weight. Future studies should also address the role of stress and high-fat diets on long-term BW outcomes during and following antidepressant treatment in clinical settings. It would be particularly important to understand whether long-term BW gain also occurs in animals fed with a variety of different diets, following exposure to stress and time-limited antidepressant treatment.

### Long-term changes in adiposity markers during and after antidepressant therapy in a community cohort [^923b2b32]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

In contrast to two previous studies, which suggested higher weight gain in women using ADs than men, our results did not provide evidence for such sex-specific differences. However, given large methodological differences across these studies results are difficult to compare. Indeed, one of the two previous studies used a clinical sample and self-reported weight data, whereas the other included a 20 year older cohort from the community.

Several mechanistic hypotheses have been posed regarding the potential weight-inducing effects of sustained AD use. TCAs enfold a very wide and non-selective activity against different molecular targets, which comprises inhibition of serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine reuptake, and antagonistic effects against histamine H1 and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Antihistaminic and anticholinergic effects have been associated with increased carbohydrate craving and increased appetite. Likewise, prolonged inhibition of serotonin reuptake has been associated with carbohydrate craving, while acute binding to serotonin reuptake receptors such as 5-HT2C by SSRIs such as fluoxetine has been shown to reduce appetite. This may explain the partially heterogeneous effects on weight seen with SSRIs dependent on the length of the observational time frame and treatment.

Our results need to be viewed in the light of several limitations. First, given that our data are observational, our results could be affected by confounding effects such as the physician’s selection of a specific AD compound (e.g. fluoxetine) in consideration of potential weight gain. However, by adjusting our analyses for multiple depression severity markers we have minimized the risk of indication bias due to more frequent prescription of ADs in more severe forms of MDD, which may be associated with elevated weight gain. Second, our treatment data mainly relied on self-reports. Inaccurate reporting could have induced non-differential bias resulting in an underestimation of the size of the measured associations. Third, additional bias could have been introduced by the non-participation of 23.2% of the initial cohort. Fourth, the number of treated participants is low for specific compounds in some of the given periods, which involves the risk of false negative findings.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^b0b828ea]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders—SSRI dosing and monitoring are described with a conservative medication trial that may increase doses within the therapeutic range at approximately 1- to 2-week intervals for shorter half-life SSRIs and at approximately 3- to 4-week intervals for longer half-life SSRIs until the benefit-to-harm ratio is optimized and remission is achieved, and because an initial adverse effect of SSRIs can be anxiety or agitation, it may be advisable to start with a subtherapeutic dose as a “test” dose. Systematic assessment of treatment response using standardized symptom rating scales can be considered as a supplement to the clinical interview, and for all SSRIs, medical monitoring can include height and weight; no specific laboratory tests are recommended. The optimal duration is unclear, but a generally accepted approach would be to continue an effective, tolerated dose for approximately 12 months after remission, monitoring for several months after discontinuation for re-emergence of symptoms, and discontinuation generally should occur during a relatively stress-free period.

### Practical use of pharmacotherapy for obesity [^d0e32e35]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Obesity management requires a multidisciplinary approach, as there are many factors that contribute to the development of obesity, as well as the preservation of excess weight once it has been gained. Diet, exercise, and behavior modification are key components of treatment. In addition to lifestyle changes, weight gain secondary to medications is an important modifiable risk factor. Even after appropriate lifestyle modification, and medication adjustments (where possible) to avoid agents that can contribute to weight gain, many patients are still unable to achieve clinically meaningful weight loss. Pharmacotherapy for obesity management can fill an important role for these patients. This article will review medications that can lead to weight gain and potential alternatives, currently approved anti-obesity medications and best practices to individualize the selection process, and the use of testosterone in men with hypogonadism and obesity.

### Obesity and weight management for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^a94ff02b]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacotherapy recommendations—When choosing glucose-lowering medications for people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, prioritize medications with beneficial effect on weight. Whenever possible, minimize medications for comorbid conditions that are associated with weight gain. Weight management pharmacotherapy should be considered for people with diabetes and overweight or obesity along with lifestyle changes, and potential benefits and risks must be considered. Weight management pharmacotherapy indicated for chronic therapy should be continued beyond reaching weight loss goals to maintain the health benefits. Sudden discontinuation of weight management pharmacotherapy often results in weight gain and worsening of cardiometabolic risk factors. For those not reaching treatment goals, reevaluate weight management therapies and intensify treatment with additional approaches (e.g., metabolic surgery, additional pharmacologic agents, and structured lifestyle management programs).

MDD

The diagnosis of MDD is made in the presence of five or more of the following symptoms for a continuous 2-week period or longer, as described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5): (i) depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day; (ii) significant weight loss/gain or decrease/increase in appetite; (iii) markedly diminished interest or pleasure in almost all activities; (iv) insomnia or hypersomnia; (v) fatigue or loss of energy; (vi) psychomotor retardation or agitation; (vii) feelings of worthlessness; (viii) diminished ability to concentrate or make decisions; and (ix) recurrent thoughts of death.MDD is a complex disorder; its exact pathophysiology remains elusive, as does the mechanism of action of antidepressants. Over many decades, the pathophysiology of MDD was thought to be based on the hypothesis of monoamine depletion, supported by the fact that the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), a class of antidepressants, restored physiological levels of monoamine in the brain.Although monoamine levels can be restored acutely, within a few hours after treatment, full antidepressant action is achieved only after 3–4 weeks of treatment initiation. This gap between immediate biochemical effects and delayed clinical response fostered the development of new theories for the pathophysiological mechanism of MDD that go beyond the monoamine hypothesis.

Adjunct Therapies to Manage Side Effects

It is firstly relevant (see subsequent sections) that there is a dose association between lithium and its adverse effects. For most, frequency/severity increases notably above serum lithium 0.7/0.8mmol/L. For some (e.g. diarrhoea, tremor, weight gain) complaints are most frequent in early treatment stages and do not tend to worsen with longer term treatment. Others (see below) can decline with longer durations of lithium use.

In a large examination of reasons for lithium discontinuation, the most common was adverse effects and the most common adverse effects noted as reasons for discontinuing were diarrhoea (13%), tremor (11%), polyuria and/or polydipsia (9%), increases in creatinine (9%) and weight gain (7%). Of these, management strategies for common side effects align with those recommended in general (not specifically for lithium) e.g. taking medication alongside a meal for gastrointestinal effects, recommendations for managing weight gain. This section does not comprehensively cover these or many other adverse effects including in cardiovascular, CNS, dermatological and endocrinological domains, though assessment and management guidance is available and recommended for consultation.

Before focusing more on three particular areas of adverse effect (tremor, renal, thyroid), we briefly mention that patients should be informed about the importance of water and salt intake: due to lithium’s effects on their metabolism, changes in intake can lead to medical complications in those at risk e.g. in people with a history of normal pressure hydrocephalus, this may increase the risks of raised intracranial blood pressure or a complication leading to lithium toxicity. While this risk primarily applies to those who are prone to circulatory difficulties (e.g. heart failure), it can also affect others exposed to dehydration or sunstroke.

### Label: ACTOS-pioglitazone hydrochloride tablet (...) [^9a52c192]. FDA (DailyMed) (2010). Low credibility.

Thiazolidinediones, including ACTOS, cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure in some patients. After initiation of ACTOS, and after dose increases, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If these signs and symptoms develop, the heart failure should be managed according to the current standards of care. Furthermore, discontinuation or dose reduction of ACTOS must be considered. In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Clinical studies demonstrate that ACTOS improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients.

ACTOS enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal, improves hepatic sensitivity to insulin, and improves dysfunctional glucose homeostasis. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the decreased insulin resistance produced by ACTOS results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin levels, and lower HbA1c values. Based on results from an open-label extension study, the glucose lowering effects of ACTOS appear to persist for at least one year. In controlled clinical trials, ACTOS in combination with sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin had an additive effect on glycemic control. Patients with lipid abnormalities were included in clinical trials with ACTOS. Overall, patients treated with ACTOS had mean decreases in triglycerides, mean increases in HDL cholesterol, and no consistent mean changes in LDL and total cholesterol.

In a 26-week, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study, mean triglyceride levels decreased in the 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg ACTOS dose groups compared to a mean increase in the placebo group. Mean HDL levels increased to a greater extent in patients treated with ACTOS than in the placebo-treated patients. There were no consistent differences for LDL and total cholesterol in patients treated with ACTOS compared to placebo. In the two other monotherapy studies and in combination therapy studies with sulfonylurea and metformin, the results were generally consistent with the data above. In placebo-controlled trials, the placebo-corrected mean changes from baseline decreased 5% to 26% for triglycerides and increased 6% to 13% for HDL in patients treated with ACTOS. A similar pattern of results was seen in 24-week combination therapy studies of ACTOS with sulfonylurea or metformin.

In a combination therapy study with insulin, the placebo-corrected mean percent change from baseline in triglyceride values for patients treated with ACTOS was also decreased. A placebo-corrected mean change from baseline in LDL cholesterol of 7% was observed for the 15 mg dose group. Similar results to those noted above for HDL and total cholesterol were observed. A similar pattern of results was seen in a 24-week combination therapy study with ACTOS with insulin. In a 26-week, dose-ranging study, 408 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive 7. 5 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg, or 45 mg of ACTOS, or placebo once daily. Therapy with any previous antidiabetic agent was discontinued 8 weeks prior to the double-blind period. Treatment with 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg of ACTOS produced statistically significant improvements in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose at endpoint compared to placebo.

Pharmacological management of obesity—patients who have a history of being unable to successfully lose and maintain weight and who meet label indications are candidates for weight loss medications. Weight loss medications reinforce behavioral strategies to create negative energy balance, and most weight loss medications affect appetite and, as a result, promote adherence. Weight loss categories are described as less weight loss 2–3%, greater weight loss >3–5%, robust weight loss >5%, and long term is 1–2 years.

### An electronic health records study of long-term weight gain following antidepressant use [^47e20a5a]. JAMA Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Short-term studies suggest antidepressants are associated with modest weight gain but little is known about longer-term effects and differences between individual medications in general clinical populations.

Objective

To estimate weight gain associated with specific antidepressants over the 12 months following initial prescription in a large and diverse clinical population.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We identified 22,610 adult patients who began receiving a medication of interest with available weight data in a large New England health care system, including 2 academic medical centers and affiliated outpatient primary and specialty care clinics. We used electronic health records to extract prescribing data and recorded weights for any patient with an index antidepressant prescription including amitriptyline hydrochloride, bupropion hydrochloride, citalopram hydrobromide, duloxetine hydrochloride, escitalopram oxalate, fluoxetine hydrochloride, mirtazapine, nortriptyline hydrochloride, paroxetine hydrochloride, venlafaxine hydrochloride, and sertraline hydrochloride. As measures of assay sensitivity, additional index prescriptions examined included the antiasthma medication albuterol sulfate and the antiobesity medications orlistat, phentermine hydrochloride, and sibutramine hydrochloride. Mixed-effects models were used to estimate rate of weight change over 12 months in comparison with the reference antidepressant, citalopram.

Main Outcome and Measure

Clinician-recorded weight at 3-month intervals up to 12 months.

Results

Compared with citalopram, in models adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical features, significantly decreased rate of weight gain was observed among individuals treated with bupropion (β [SE]: -0.063 [0.027]; P=.02), amitriptyline (β [SE]: -0.081 [0.025]; P=.001), and nortriptyline (β [SE]: -0.147 [0.034]; P<.001). As anticipated, differences were less pronounced among individuals discontinuing treatment prior to 12 months.

Conclusions and Relevance

Antidepressants differ modestly in their propensity to contribute to weight gain. Short-term investigations may be insufficient to characterize and differentiate this risk.

### Antipsychotic-induced weight gain and metabolic effects show diurnal dependence and are reversible with time restricted feeding [^39d69eef]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antipsychotic drugs (AP) are highly efficacious treatments for serious mental illnesses (SMI) such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression, but frequently cause weight gain and metabolic disease. The metabolic side-effects of APs exacerbate medical comorbidities and worsen health outcomes in SMI patients, a population already at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders and early mortality. Moreover, AP-induced metabolic side-effects lead to treatment discontinuation and non-compliance that destabilize SMI and worsen outcomes such as social/occupational impairment and suicide. Both neurobehavioral and peripheral metabolic factors have been implicated as key factors driving adverse effects of AP but the specific molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Previous studies have identified potential adjuvant drugs that can mitigate some of the weight gain effects of APs – but these interventions have yet to make a significant impact on the problem associated with APs. Additional strategies are needed to further reduce the metabolic burden of AP in patients with SMI to make these drugs safer, more tolerable and effective.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^a0f3aa52]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

In United States of America, over the past two decades, the rate of antidepressant use has increased nearly 400%, where antidepressant drugs were the third most prescribed class of drugs for persons aged 18-44 years in 2005–2008.In 2010, it was reported that 52.3 daily doses were prescribed for every 1000 inhabitants in European countries.In Australia, 34 million prescriptions were issued for mental health-related diseases in 2013–2014, and 67% (23 million) of those were for antidepressants.In 2012–2013, mental health-related prescriptions cost the Australian Government over $788 million.With a rapid rise of individuals taking antidepressants, numerous studies have investigated the effects of different classes of antidepressants on body weight. Despite the concomitant occurrence of the frequent use of antidepressants and the high incidence of obesity in Western societies, the pathways and mechanisms by which antidepressants can induced weight gain remain unclear.

In this review, we examine the pathophysiology of MDD and obesity, and their complex interactions. More specifically, we discuss the role of antidepressant use in weight gain, and the role of interactions with environmental factors, such as stress.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)—antidepressant and anxiolytic treatment notes that psychological therapy could be considered first-line management, and antidepressant medications considered in adults where mental health disorders are clearly documented and persistent, or if suicidal symptoms are present, based on general population guidelines. Lifestyle intervention and other therapies (e.g., COCP, metformin, laser hair removal) that target PCOS features should be considered, given their potential to improve psychological symptoms. Where pharmacological treatment for anxiety and depression is offered in PCOS, healthcare professionals should apply caution to avoid inappropriate treatment with antidepressants or anxiolytics and to limit use of agents that exacerbate PCOS symptoms, including weight gain, and healthcare professionals should be aware that not managing anxiety and depression may impact adherence to PCOS treatment / management.

Q13 What therapeutic strategies are useful for headache in IIH?

Migrainous phenotype is noted in 68% of IIH patients with headache.Despite the lack of clinical trials, the use of migraine therapies in IIH patients with migraine headaches may be useful. Headaches with migrainous features include moderate to severe pain that maybe throbbing with photophobia, phonophobia, nausea and movement intolerance.
Migraine attacks may benefit from triptan acute therapy used in combination with either a NSAID or paracetamol and an antiemetic with prokinetic properties.Their use should be limited to 2 days per week or a maximum of 10 days per month.
Migraine preventative strategies could also be tried. These are most likely to be effective in those in whom the ICP is settling and also in those whom the papilloedema has resolved (IIH in ocular remission).
National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for migraine prevention therapy is useful.
Caution must be observed before selecting drugs that could increase weight (beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, sodium valproate, pizotifen and flunarizine) or those that could exacerbate depression, a frequent comorbidity in IIH (beta blockers, topiramate and flunarizine).
Topiramate (see 10. Are there other drugs that are helpful in IIH? in table 3) may help with weight loss by suppressing appetite and have an effect on reducing ICP through carbonic anhydrase inhibition. Patients need to be cautioned about potential side effects of depression, cognitive slowing, reduction of the efficacy of the contraceptive pill/oral contraceptives and potential of teratogenic effects.
Where topiramate has excessive side effects, zonisamide may be an alternative.
In patients with migraine, candesartan can be a useful alternative to a beta blocker due to its lack of weight gain and depressive side effects.Alternatively, venlafaxine is weight neutral and helpful with depression symptoms.
Botulinum toxin A may be useful in those with coexisting chronic migraine; there are no studies of botulinum toxin A in IIH.
As with treatment of migraine, preventative drugs need to be started slowly and increased to a therapeutic tolerated dose for 3 months to enable a therapeutic trial.
Similar to the treatment of migraine, many of these drugs are used off label in IIH.
Lifestyle advice should be given with all headache disorders, as these can have considerable impact on the disease course. Strategies should be implemented to limit caffeine intake. Ensure regular meals and adequate hydration, exercise programme and sleep hygiene. Behavioural and stress management techniques can be implemented such as yoga, cognitive–behavioural therapy and mindfulness.

### Obesity consults – comprehensive obesity management in 2013: understanding the shifting paradigm [^1961a7aa]. Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

Although serious health concerns are associated with obesity, losing even 5% of body weight can produce clinically relevant effects. The initial goal of obesity management is usually a 5% to 10% weight reduction. Some people will sustain weight loss with changes in diet and exercise alone; however, these patients represent the minority, and a large percentage are unable to maintain weight loss over time. Patients and providers often wish to intensify obesity treatment, and therefore interest in new medications has been considerable. Until recently, only two antiobesity medications have received Food and Drug Administration approval for long-term use. In June and July of 2012, respectively, lorcaserin and combination phentermine/topiramate extended-release were approved for obesity therapy. The first section of this article reviews mechanisms, clinical trials, benefits and risks of available medications for treating obesity. Bariatric surgery is the next step for patients with a body mass index of ≥40 kg/m(2) or ≥35 kg/m(2) with comorbidities, based on National Institutes of Health Clinical Guidelines. These procedures and their risks and benefits are reviewed in the second section. The final section presents common clinical scenarios with guidance for choosing among evidence-based recommendations for developing optimal, individualized, long-term strategies for patients with obesity.

### The interface of depression and diabetes: treatment considerations [^2a85efdd]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment strategies for comorbid diabetes and depression

Pharmacological interventions

Antidepressant medications in patients with diabetes

The management of depression in patients with diabetes requires a comprehensive approach, including pharmacological and psychological treatment strategies. Collaborative strategies and integrated care plans, including regular screening, routine follow-up, rational drug use and medication adherence management, should be applied in both depression and diabetes management.

The antidepressant classes, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), and atypical antidepressants that increase neurotransmitters serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine are in the guideline-based treatment strategies of depression. A new study from Scotland has shown that the prevalence of antidepressant and antipsychotic prescribing in patients with T2DM has been increasing in recent years between 2004 and 2021. It has been proposed that this may be due to the longer duration of use of these drugs, and another reason may be the widespread use of SNRIs such as duloxetine in conditions other than MDD, including chronic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy.

While prescribing antidepressants in patients with diabetes, monitoring and minimizing the metabolic adverse effects is important. Potential adverse effects such as weight gain, dyslipidemia, and increased risk of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular morbidity are significant concerns. The association of vascular problems creates a bidirectional negative impact with depression. Certain atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive treatment in MDD, such as olanzapine and quetiapine, are also associated with metabolic adverse effects and drug-induced weight gain ; however, as in the case of brexpiprazole, which is a partial dopaminergic agonist, this increase in weight might not be clinically important.

Several studies reported that SSRIs may increase the risk of T2DM in adults, particularly in long-term use, likely attributable to a modest weight gain associated with certain agents in this class. In a nationwide US cohort with 1,582,914 patients, it was found that there may be a small increase in the risk of developing T2DM in children and adolescents who started SSRI treatment. On the other hand, in a UK cohort, it was shown that there was no difference between fluoxetine-citalopram-escitalopram and paroxetine-fluvoxamine-sertraline in youth, and SSRIs did not increase significantly the risk of T2DM. Overall, in any case, the risk/benefit ratio should be carefully weighed, especially in pediatric patients.

### The best drug supplement for obesity treatment: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^df23797a]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Today, obesity is a growing public health issue worldwide, with an increased risk for chronic and aggressive conditions such as respiratory complications, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity is seen in all age groups. According to the WHO, in 2016, 39% of adults (≥ 18 years, 39% men, and 40% women) were overweight. According to the report, the global prevalence of obesity has almost tripled from 1975 to 2016.

With the impact of obesity on health, quality of life, and social function, its management interventions are of great value. Different management approaches are used to control and treat obesity, which are determined based on age, sex, puberty status, the severity of obesity, underlying causes, obesity-related complications, psychosocial factors, and patient and family preferences. Due to fewer side effects, behavioral and dietary modifications and more exercise are considered the first-line treatment for weight loss in obese patients. In addition, drug therapy is recommended for those whose lifestyle interventions alone are not responsive, especially if there is no possibility of bariatric surgery in these individuals. The role of drugs in weight loss is controversial, and their effectiveness seems limited. It may be very effective for some people and not effective for others and may even have side effects for some.

Phentermine is one of the oldest sympathomimetic drugs that contain diethylpropion. It is the most commonly used drug in the United States, accounting for 70% of prescriptions. The combination of phentermine and topiramate causes more weight loss than each of them separately. Phentermine and topiramate extended-release (long-acting) capsules are used to help adults who are obese or who are overweight and have weight-related medical problems to lose weight and to keep from gaining back that weight.

Orlistat is a potent inhibitor of pancreatic lipase that reduces intestinal fat digestion. Lorcaserin is a US food and drug administration (FDA)-approved selective agonist of the serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)]—2C receptor that is effective in weight loss by reducing appetite and increasing satiety. This medication is used with a doctor-approved exercise, behavior change, and reduced-calorie diet program to help you lose weight, and taking orlistat can also help keep you from gaining back the weight you have lost.

### Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome: consensus panel recommendations for clinical management and additional research [^a8cf14be]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Currently, no evidence-based guidelines exist for the management of serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) discontinuation syndrome. This article summarizes recommendations with respect to future research as well as clinical management recommendations for SRI discontinuation syndrome.

Participants

In April 2004, a panel of physicians convened in New York City to discuss recommendations for clinical management of and additional research on SRI discontinuation syndrome.

Evidence

Previous guidance for management of SRI discontinuation syndrome was proposed in 1997 in a consensus meeting also chaired by Alan F. Schatzberg. A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted to identify articles on SRI discontinuation syndrome that have been published since 1997.

Consensus Process

The 2004 panel reviewed important preclinical and clinical studies, discussed prospective investigation of this syndrome in clinical trials, and suggested the establishment of a research network to collect data in naturalistic settings. The panel also reviewed the management recommendations published in 1997 and subsequently updated the recommendations, taking into account the latest clinical data as well as the personal experience of its members with patients.

Conclusions

Additional preclinical and clinical studies are necessary to further elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms of SRI discontinuation syndrome and to identify the patient populations and agents that are most affected by this phenomenon. Management strategies include gradual tapering of doses and should emphasize clinical monitoring and patient education.

5.7 Changes in Weight

Adult Patients: A loss of 5% or more of body weight occurred in 7% of patients treated with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules and 2% of placebo-treated patients in the short-term placebo-controlled major depressive disorder trials. The discontinuation rate for weight loss associated with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules was 0.1% in major depressive disorder studies. In other placebo-controlled trials, 4% of the patients treated with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules and 1% of the placebo-treated patients sustained a loss of 7% or more of body weight during up to 6 months of treatment. None of the patients receiving venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in other studies discontinued for weight loss.

The safety and efficacy of venlafaxine therapy in combination with weight loss agents, including phentermine, have not been established. Co-administration of venlafaxine extended-release tablets and weight loss agents is not recommended. Venlafaxine extended-release tablets are not indicated for weight loss alone or in combination with other products.

Pediatric Patients: Weight loss has been observed in pediatric patients (ages 6 -17) receiving venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules. In a pooled analysis of four eight-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose outpatient trials for major depressive disorder (MDD) and another disorder, patients treated with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules lost an average of 0.45 kg (n=333), while placebo-treated patients gained an average of 0.77 kg (n=333). More patients treated with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules than with placebo experienced a weight loss of at least 3.5% in the studies (18% of patients treated with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules vs. 3.6% of placebo-treated patients; p<0.001). In a 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose outpatient study for another disorder, venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsule-treated patients lost an average of 0.75 kg (n=137), while placebo-treated patients gained an average of 0.76 kg (n=148). More patients treated with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules than with placebo experienced a weight loss of at least 3.5% in the study (47% of patients treated with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules vs. 14% of placebo-treated patients; p<0.001). Weight loss was not limited to patients with treatment-emergent anorexia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] .

### Reasons for discontinuation or change of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in online drug reviews [^e19ac836]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Table 1. 
Selective Serotonin Receptor Inhibitors With Reviews on a Health-Related Website

Abbreviation: SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

For each of the 1000 reviews, 2 of us (S.G. and D.M.) checked whether the review was a true mention of a medication change. Changes were further classified as a medication switch (if the patient discussed taking a different SSRI or another antidepressant after stopping the reviewed drug), a change in medication dose (which included increases and decreases in dose, such as titrations), or a discontinuation (if the patient did not mention taking a new antidepressant after stopping the reviewed drug). We extracted data on the stated reasons for a dose change, medication switch or discontinuation. When adverse events were reported as the reason for medication change, the adverse event terms were standardized using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred term codes. To facilitate comparison with other sources, the preferred term codes were assigned to 1 of 27 MedDRA broader categories of primary system organ class (SOC) codes (eg, psychiatric disorders; reproductive system and breast disorders; and injury, poisoning, and procedural complications). For those with multiple paths, the primary SOC code was selected. Many SOC code categories contain the term “disorders,” although we acknowledge that adverse events are rarely disorders. In addition, the SOC code “investigations” is used for test results and includes weight, hormone, and lipid analyses. We collected data on the days from starting the medication until an adverse event occurrence, whether the adverse event stopped after drug discontinuation, whether the patient restarted the drug and, if so, whether the adverse event recurred. We categorized withdrawal symptoms separately from adverse events.

### Pharmacological management of obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^0d19ca56]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To formulate clinical practice guidelines for the pharmacological management of obesity.

Participants

An Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. This guideline was co-sponsored by the European Society of Endocrinology and The Obesity Society.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of the Endocrine Society, the European Society of Endocrinology, and The Obesity Society reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines. Two systematic reviews were conducted to summarize some of the supporting evidence.

Conclusions

Weight loss is a pathway to health improvement for patients with obesity-associated risk factors and comorbidities. Medications approved for chronic weight management can be useful adjuncts to lifestyle change for patients who have been unsuccessful with diet and exercise alone. Many medications commonly prescribed for diabetes, depression, and other chronic diseases have weight effects, either to promote weight gain or produce weight loss. Knowledgeable prescribing of medications, choosing whenever possible those with favorable weight profiles, can aid in the prevention and management of obesity and thus improve health.

### Clinical risk factors for weight gain during psychopharmacologic treatment of depression: results from 2 large German observational studies [^e6d2edda]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Weight gain during psychopharmacologic treatment has considerable impact on the clinical management of depression, treatment continuation, and risk for metabolic disorders. As no profound clinical risk factors have been identified so far, the aim of our analyses was to determine clinical risk factors associated with short-term weight development in 2 large observational psychopharmacologic treatment studies for major depression.

Method

Clinical variables at baseline (age, gender, depression psychopathology, anthropometry, disease history, and disease entity) were analyzed for association with percent change in body mass index (BMI; normal range, 18.5 to 25 kg/m(2)) during 5 weeks of naturalistic psychopharmacologic treatment in patients who had a depressive episode as single depressive episode, in the course of recurrent unipolar depression or bipolar disorder according to DSM-IV criteria. 703 patients participated in the Munich Antidepressant Response Signature (MARS) project, an ongoing study since 2002, and 214 patients participated in a study conducted at the University of Muenster from 2004 to 2006 in Germany.

Results

Lower BMI, weight-increasing side effects of medication, severity of depression, and psychotic symptoms could be identified as clinical risk factors associated with elevated weight gain during the initial treatment phase of 5 weeks in both studies. Based on these results, a composite risk score for weight gain consisting of BMI ≤ 25 kg/m(2), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17-item) score > 20, presence of psychotic symptoms, and administration of psychopharmacologic medication with potential weight-gaining side effects was highly discriminative for mean weight gain (F4,909 = 26.77, P = 5.14E-21) during short-term psychopharmacologic treatment.

Conclusions

On the basis of our results, depressed patients with low to normal BMI, severe depression, or psychotic symptoms should be considered at higher risk for weight gain during acute antidepressant treatment. We introduce a new risk score that might be considered in psychopharmacologic decisions for the prevention of weight gain and resulting metabolic disorders.

### Lorcaserin in obese and overweight patients taking prohibited serotonergic agents: a retrospective analysis [^92249282]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Lorcaserin is a selective serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2C) agonist approved in the United States for use in chronic weight management as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. Its pharmacologic activity is limited to 5-HT subtype 2 receptors. The potency of lorcaserin for the 5-HT2C receptor is 14-fold greater than its potency for the 5-HT2A receptor and 61-fold greater than its potency for the 5-HT2B receptor. Although 5-HT receptors have been implicated in serotonin syndrome, the precise pathogenesis is unknown. Given a theoretic risk for this syndrome in patients administered lorcaserin either alone or in combination with certain serotonergic agents (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs]), patients taking prohibited serotonergic agents were excluded from the Phase III clinical trials. This retrospective analysis evaluated the tolerability of lorcaserin in patients who took protocol-allowed or proscribed serotonergic agents for varying durations of up to 1 year during the BLOOM, BLOSSOM, and BLOOM-DM studies.

Methods

Patients randomly assigned to receive either lorcaserin 10 mg QD, lorcaserin 10 mg BID, or placebo and who took a spectrum of serotonergic agents were evaluated at week 52 of treatment (814 and 624 patients receiving lorcaserin and placebo, respectively, were found to have taken allowed or prohibited serotonergic agents during these trials). After the use of a proscribed serotonergic agent was discovered, these patients were discontinued from the trial and followed.

Findings

None of the patients in the serotonergic agent subpopulation or in the overall safety population met the clinical criteria of serotonin syndrome. The proportions of patients experiencing any adverse event (AE) were balanced in the lorcaserin and placebo groups in the prohibited serotonergic agent subpopulation. The prevalences of the most common AEs were similar between the serotonergic agent subpopulation and the overall safety population.

Implications

The concurrent use of lorcaserin and prohibited or allowed serotonergic agents did not appear to have increased the spectrum or intensity of AEs potentially associated with serotonin excess in this limited dataset. However, the sample population was too small to rule out an effect on a rare event such as serotonin syndrome. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00395135, NCT00603902, and NCT00603291.

### Weight outcomes among antidepressant users in nursing facilities [^26439262]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Depression is a common and treatable condition among nursing facility residents, with low body weight being a frequent concomitant concern. A common prescribing dictum is that older tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) enhance appetite and may facilitate weight gain, while newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) cause anorexia and resultant weight loss in older adults. Evidence is lacking on whether the small weight changes noted during short-term antidepressant efficacy trials translate into larger weight changes during prolonged treatment periods. Our main objective was to compare weight outcomes at 6 months among users of three different antidepressant groups with a control group of non-antidepressant users. A secondary objective was to determine whether antidepressant selection was associated with weight pattern before drug initiation, to capture possible prescribing bias that would affect study inferences.

Design

Retrospective cohort design using the Minimum Data Set--Plus (MDS+).

Setting

Kansas nursing facilities.

Participants

1,157 antidepressant users age 65 and older who started an antidepressant after admission and remained on the same single agent for at least 6 months, and 4,852 persons meeting the same inclusion/exclusion criteria but not receiving an antidepressant.

Measurements

Antidepressant use was identified by drug code data and divided into four groups for analysis: TCAs, SSRIs, others, and none. (Amitriptyline and trazodone were excluded because of frequent use for nondepression purposes.) Rates of clinically important loss and gain (assigned for a 10% change from baseline weight or presence of the significant loss or gain markers on the 6-month MDS assessment) and mean weight changes were compared across the four groups. Regression models were used to control for age, gender, baseline weight, confounding comorbidity, and functional variables related to eating. Previous weight patterns (loss, gain, neither, or unknown) before antidepressant initiation were compared across drug groups.

Results

Clinically important weight loss and gain occurred at 6 months in 14.8% and 14.4% of the sample, respectively. In unadjusted analyses, an increased likelihood of loss was found for users of SSRIs (Odds Ratio 1.57; CI 1.30, 1.90) and others (OR 1.89; CI 1.18, 3.03), compared with none. In logistic models accounting for potential confounding factors, however, SSRI use showed a modest association with gain (OR 1.31, CI 1.01, 1.70) and a trend toward a similarly modest association with loss (OR 1.28; CI 0.995, 1.64). TCA use was not associated with weight gain. When weight was examined as a continuous variable, all groups demonstrated a broad range of both loss and gain with mean-unadjusted weight changes < 3 pounds. Pairwise comparisons of adjusted differences in weight change at 6 months for SSRIs (mean loss of 1.6 pounds) and TCAs (mean gain of 0.4 pounds) were of marginal importance (P = .046) given the large sample size. No evidence was found for prescribing bias based on prior weight pattern.

Conclusions

TCAs do not facilitate weight gain more than other antidepressant groups and SSRIs are not associated disproportionately with weight loss when other important clinical variables are accounted for. Small but statistically significant differences in mean weight changes between groups are largely a reflection of large sample size rather than clinically important differences. Clinicians may wish to reconsider the widely held notions that TCAs facilitate weight gain and that SSRIs place depressed older nursing facility residents at disproportionate risk for weight loss.
