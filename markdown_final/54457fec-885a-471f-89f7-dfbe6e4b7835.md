## Question

Mastitis management in breastfeeding patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about mastitis management in breastfeeding patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing an accurate clinical diagnosis and distinguishing mimics like a blocked duct or abscess. Then, I should verify initial conservative management and precisely what to encourage or avoid in the first 24–48 hours. Next, I will check the 48-hour reassessment pivot for adding antibiotics and how to select and dose them. After that, I will examine abscess management and source control. Finally, I should review recurrence prevention, special scenarios (MRSA, granulomatous mastitis, inflammatory breast cancer), and patient education and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis criteria and differentiate mastitis from similar conditions: lactational mastitis typically presents with focal breast pain, warmth, erythema, induration or swelling, and may include systemic symptoms such as fever and malaise, whereas a "blocked duct" usually has localized tenderness or a lump without systemic illness, so I need to ensure we document systemic features, examine the breast thoroughly, and correlate with vitals to avoid over- or under-treating inflammation versus infection [^114S5XTN] [^113H1epL] [^116nXfmv].

> I should double-check for abscess at baseline and during follow-up if symptoms persist or a fluctuant mass is noted; if suspected, ultrasound is the modality of choice and often shows a complex hypoechoic collection, and this imaging step both confirms the diagnosis and guides drainage planning, so I need to arrange prompt ultrasound if clinical findings are equivocal or not improving as expected [^116oUaB2] [^112Drvzq].

> Next, I should review psychosocial contributors because stress and perinatal mood/anxiety disorders can exacerbate pain and impede breastfeeding success, so I will screen for PMADs and offer lactation and mental health support early rather than waiting until after treatment failure [^111cxzqo].

> I need to check indications for milk culture because routine cultures are not required initially; I should obtain breast milk cultures when there is no improvement after 48 hours of appropriate first-line therapy, in recurrent mastitis, with high local MRSA risk (e.g., healthcare exposure, NICU infant), or when the infant is immunocompromised, and I should align empiric choices with local antibiograms while awaiting results [^113HAQcj] [^116d529F] [^115BaQDt].

> Hold on, let me ensure the conservative management message is precise for the first 24–48 hours: encourage continued direct breastfeeding from the affected breast because milk remains safe, prioritize on-demand feeding over scheduled pumping to maintain physiologic flow, and explicitly reassure that breastfeeding need not stop during mastitis, which reduces anxiety-driven weaning [^111q9yLk] [^116dEPeb] [^113hG1ev] [^116uRszH].

> At first glance I might suggest warm compresses and frequent feeding to shorten symptom duration, but wait, let me verify best practice here; earlier radiology-pathology narratives sometimes mention warmth, yet current breastfeeding medicine guidance emphasizes anti-inflammatory strategies and specifically recommends ice rather than heat, so I should correct myself and advise cold therapy rather than warmth to minimize edema and inflammatory signaling [^112Drvzq] [^115TCGQV] [^111c41tY].

> I should confirm analgesic and anti-inflammatory regimens: offer NSAIDs and acetaminophen for pain and inflammation, with ABM suggesting ibuprofen 800 mg TID or acetaminophen 1,000 mg TID as practical dosing anchors, while reinforcing rest and supportive measures to reduce nociception and swelling [^116jffmR] [^116d529F].

> Let me think about breast rest and mechanics because over-intervention can worsen hyperlactation and edema; I should counsel to avoid deep or aggressive breast massage, avoid attempts to "fully empty" the breast or excessive pumping, and encourage a supportive, well-fitting bra that avoids constrictive compression while reducing dependent lymphedema and discomfort [^111bFrFW] [^11598Lqa] [^113hG1ev] [^116c3oAT].

> I need to ensure we address engorgement and latch support methodically: consider reverse pressure softening or brief pre-latch hand expression to facilitate latch, consider gentle lymphatic drainage for interstitial edema, and, upstream, minimize intrapartum IV fluids and promote rooming-in to reduce postpartum edema and pumping reliance, reserving ice for symptomatic relief when needed [^113jSQHo] [^114AjrLE] [^117FGgPY] [^111Nozrj] [^116mC52G].

> Let me first confirm the 48-hour reassessment pivot: if the patient is improving, continue conservative therapy to full resolution; if there is no improvement or clinical worsening, that's my threshold to obtain a milk culture (if not already done) and start antibiotics targeted to common pathogens, keeping close follow-up to ensure the trajectory turns favorable [^notfound] [^113HAQcj] [^116d529F] [^111c41tY].

> I will now examine antibiotic selection and stewardship; for likely MSSA and streptococci, first-line oral options include dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cephalexin, reserving clindamycin or TMP/SMX when beta-lactams are unsuitable or when MRSA risk or culture results justify them, prescribing typically for 10–14 days with the option to shorten if cellulitis resolves rapidly, and I should avoid IV therapy and admission unless severe sepsis, intolerance of orals, or multidrug resistance is suspected [^111e2HYH] [^1123XHo6] [^112QBDHp] [^notfound].

> But wait, what if an abscess forms; I should prioritize source control with ultrasound-guided needle aspiration and culture as first-line, anticipate that repeated aspirations may be required, consider drain placement to gravity (not suction) if aspirations fail, continue breastfeeding from the affected side after aspiration or drain placement, and reserve surgical incision and drainage for refractory or complex multiloculated collections, adding antibiotics per culture results [^116oUaB2] [^115Lie1h] [^1155ARCA] [^1153Qk97].

> Next, I should review recurrence prevention because modifiable factors drive many repeat episodes; address hyperlactation and minimize pumping, optimize latch and positioning while avoiding unnecessary early pacifiers or bottles, prohibit deep massage or other tissue trauma and avoid tight bras, and consider probiotics with specific strains (Limosilactobacillus fermentum or preferably Ligilactobacillus salivarius) acknowledging that evidence is strain-specific and mixed, with some guidelines supportive and others noting insufficient benefit [^117XLGCf] [^116ejoDh] [^113hG1ev] [^114PitVY] [^111bFrFW] [^116c3oAT] [^115Phwj9] [^117TEvqa] [^116d529F] [^113mCBUh].

> Hold on, I should verify steps for recurrent or atypical cases: before empiric retreatment, obtain milk culture and susceptibilities to identify resistant or uncommon organisms, arrange targeted breast imaging (ultrasound ± mammography) when recurrences localize to the same quadrant to exclude granulomatous mastitis or occult abscess, maintain a high index of suspicion for inflammatory breast cancer with progressive erythema, peau d'orange, or retraction and refer urgently, consider local MRSA epidemiology in antibiotic choices, and remember that invasive S. pyogenes mastitis is rare but severe, particularly with concurrent scarlet fever exposure in the household [^115BantR] [^112DHhbp] [^113HAQcj] [^115DR2Y9] [^11523iMX] [^114HhvZ7].

> I should double-check that patient education and follow-up close the loop: reassure that mastitis is common and often resolves with conservative care, correct misconceptions that breastfeeding must stop or be scheduled, emphasize that the milk is safe, provide lactation and psychosocial support, and arrange reassessment within 48–72 hours after starting conservative care or antibiotics to confirm resolution and prevent complications or premature weaning [^1153uCKX] [^116uRszH] [^116dEPeb] [^111q9yLk] [^111cxzqo] [^1139ekpF] [^113HAQcj].

Mastitis management in breastfeeding patients focuses on **continued breastfeeding or milk removal** to relieve milk stasis and prevent complications [^116d529F] [^1153uCKX] [^111q9yLk]. First-line antibiotics are **dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cephalexin**; use **clindamycin or TMP/SMX** if MRSA is suspected or in penicillin-allergic patients [^111e2HYH]. Supportive care includes **NSAIDs and ice**; avoid heat and deep massage [^116jffmR] [^111c41tY] [^115TCGQV] [^111bFrFW].

If no improvement in **48 hours**, obtain milk culture and consider ultrasound to evaluate for abscess [^113HAQcj] [^116d529F] [^112Drvzq]. For a confirmed abscess, perform **ultrasound-guided needle aspiration** with fluid culture and continue breastfeeding; surgical drainage is reserved for refractory cases [^116oUaB2] [^1153Qk97] [^1155ARCA] [^1111q63U]. Educate patients on proper latch, avoid excessive pumping, and use a well-fitting bra to reduce recurrence [^113hG1ev] [^116ejoDh] [^11598Lqa] [^116c3oAT].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

- **Clinical features**: Localized breast pain, tenderness, erythema, warmth, swelling, and systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, malaise, and flu-like symptoms [^113H1epL] [^114S5XTN].

- **Diagnosis**: Primarily clinical; consider milk culture if no improvement after 48 hours of antibiotics or in recurrent cases [^113H1epL] [^113HAQcj] [^116d529F].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound if abscess is suspected or symptoms persist despite treatment [^112Drvzq] [^116d529F].

---

## Initial management and supportive care

- **Continued breastfeeding**: Encourage continued breastfeeding or milk removal to relieve milk stasis and prevent complications [^1153uCKX] [^116d529F] [^111q9yLk].

- **Supportive care**: NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen 800 mg TID or acetaminophen 1,000 mg TID) and ice application for symptomatic relief [^116jffmR] [^111c41tY].

- **Avoidance**: Avoid heat application and deep breast massage, as they can exacerbate inflammation [^115TCGQV] [^111bFrFW] [^116d529F].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

- **First-line antibiotics**: Dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cephalexin [^111e2HYH] [^115LMj11] [^116d529F].

- **Second-line antibiotics**: Clindamycin or TMP/SMX if MRSA is suspected or in penicillin-allergic patients [^111e2HYH] [^114LWq2Z].

- **Duration**: Typically 10–14 days, but shorter courses may be considered if rapid resolution occurs [^1123XHo6].

---

## Management of complications

### Breast abscess

First-line management of a breast abscess is **ultrasound-guided needle aspiration** with fluid culture and sensitivity; repeated aspirations may be necessary [^116oUaB2] [^1153Qk97]. Continued breastfeeding from the affected breast is encouraged after aspiration or drain placement [^1155ARCA]. Surgical drainage is reserved for refractory cases or when needle aspiration is not feasible [^1111q63U].

---

### Recurrent mastitis

Recurrent mastitis warrants **assessment of breastfeeding technique**, pumping practices, and underlying risk factors [^115RPRbs] [^113H1epL]. Daily probiotics containing Lactobacillus fermentum or Lactobacillus salivarius may be considered for prevention [^117TEvqa] [^115Phwj9]. Arrange follow-up to ensure resolution and consider radiologic evaluation for multiple recurrences [^113Caion] [^112DHhbp].

---

## Patient education and prevention

Patient education and prevention focus on **correct breastfeeding technique**, including proper latch and positioning to prevent nipple trauma and milk stasis. Advise breastfeeding on demand and avoiding excessive pumping or routine breast emptying [^113hG1ev] [^116dEPeb] [^11598Lqa] [^116ejoDh]. Recommend well-fitting supportive bras to prevent engorgement and discomfort [^116c3oAT]. Provide reassurance and psychosocial support to prevent early weaning and address perinatal mood disorders [^1153uCKX] [^111cxzqo].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Indications for specialist referral include a **suspected or confirmed abscess** requiring surgical or interventional radiology evaluation [^112DHhbp]. Referral is also warranted for multiple recurrences of mastitis. Severe systemic symptoms, immunocompromised status, or atypical presentations should also prompt specialist evaluation [^116d529F] [^114HhvZ7].

### Breast disease in the pregnant and lactating patient: Radiological-pathological correlation [^112Drvzq]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial mastitis will either resolve with antibiotic therapy or evolve into an abscess if treatment is delayed or inadequate. Approximately 4.8–11% of lactation-related mastitis is complicated by breast abscesses. Infection is most commonly due to S. aureus, including increasing cases of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and Streptococcus. The patient presents with fever, chills, tenderness, and breast erythema.

Imaging with ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis, provide a means to drain the collection to tailor antibiotic therapy, and can be safely used for regular follow-up of the abscess. Ultrasound is the modality of choice and typically reveals a complex hypoechoic cystic mass of varied shape, commonly multiloculated with indistinct margins, peripheral vascularity, and posterior acoustic enhancement. However, there should be no vascularity within the fluid collection. Mammography is performed only when the diagnosis is unclear and may show signs such as mass, distortion, asymmetric density, and skin thickening, which are not specific to cancer. The presence of suspicious calcifications is more specific for cancer.

Percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic therapy provides effective treatment. In some cases, multiple drainages are required. Warm compresses and frequent breastfeeding also help to shorten the duration of symptoms. The presence of mastitis and/or abscess poses no risk to the breastfeeding infant. Cessation of breastfeeding is necessary only when treatment with an antibiotic contraindicated for the newborn is prescribed (e.g. tetracycline).

Regarding medical management for lactational mastitis, particularly concerning antibiotic therapy, the ABM 2022 guidelines recommend considering obtaining a milk culture to evaluate for resistant and/or less common pathogens, such as MRSA, if there is no symptomatic improvement after 48 hours of first-line therapy. It is advisable to consider obtaining local susceptibility testing and resistance patterns and proceed to empiric therapy. An early milk culture should be considered in mothers expressing breast milk for an immunocompromised infant in the NICU, healthcare workers in areas with a high prevalence of MRSA, and patients with recurrent infections.

### Interventions for preventing mastitis after childbirth [^116C1QNy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Despite the health benefits of breastfeeding, initiation and duration rates continue to fall short of international guidelines. Many factors influence a woman's decision to wean; the main reason cited for weaning is associated with lactation complications, such as mastitis.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of preventive strategies for mastitis and the subsequent effect on breastfeeding duration.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (November 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2009), EMBASE (1974 to November 2009), CINAHL (1981 to November 2009), MIDIRS (1971 to November 2009), IPA (1970 to November 2009), AMED (1985 to November 2009), and LILACS (1982 to November 2009).

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials of interventions for preventing mastitis in postpartum breastfeeding women.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We independently identified relevant studies and assessed the trial quality. We contacted trial authors for missing data and information as appropriate.

- **Main results**: We included five trials (involving 960 women). In three trials of 471 women, we found no significant differences in the incidence of mastitis between the use of antibiotics and no antibiotics (risk ratio (RR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 1.61) or in one trial of 99 women comparing two doses (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.02 to 9.18). We found no significant differences for mastitis in three trials of specialist breastfeeding education compared with usual care.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^112rVAWz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Relevant factors related to an increased risk of infectious mastitis have been identified in this study. This knowledge will allow practitioners to provide appropriate management advice about modifiable risk factors, such as the use of pumps or inappropriate medication. They could also identify those women at an increased risk of developing mastitis, such as those having a familial history of mastitis before delivery, and thus develop strategies to prevent this condition. There are still many questions to answer about infectious mastitis, but work is in progress to broaden our knowledge on this relevant public health issue.

Regarding medical management for lactational mastitis, particularly in the management of abscesses, the ABM 2022 guidelines recommend considering drain placement as the initial intervention for definitive management at the time of the index procedure. It is advisable to refer patients to interventional radiology for drain placement if necessary. Drains or skin stents should be placed to gravity rather than suction. Adaptations with supplies such as Foley catheters or glove fingers can be used based on local resources if a formal drain is not available. Vacuum-assisted wound devices should be avoided on a lactating breast.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^114PitVY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Traditionally, interferences with suckling, such as pacifiers, bottle-feeding, or nipple shields, have been associated with breastfeeding problems, and their use should be avoided, at least while the infant is learning to suckle properly. In our study, these practices were reported more frequently by women with mastitis when the initial bivariate analysis of possible risk factors was performed. A higher prevalence of tongue-tie (ankyloglossia) was found among infants from women with mastitis. However, this condition is not usually considered in infants without breastfeeding difficulties, and consequently, it could be underrated in the control group.

The relationship between ankyloglossia and breastfeeding problems has been largely debated. Controversies in this area have arisen from attempts to find an absolute relationship between tongue-tie and breastfeeding difficulties instead of a relative one, where the first increases the risk for the latter. Additionally, the existence of various classification systems for the diagnosis of ankyloglossia is confusing for clinicians.

### Maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis [^116nXfmv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

In this study, mastitis was defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM) clinical protocols. Mastitis was identified as an inflammatory condition of the breast characterized by localized tenderness, redness, swelling, and heat, accompanied by fever (≥ 38.3 °C), chills, flu-like aching, and systemic illness. Participants' history of mastitis was self-reported based on this clinical definition that was clearly explained in the questionnaire, distinguishing it from blocked ducts which present with localized tenderness and redness without systemic symptoms. This definition helps differentiate true mastitis from blocked or clogged milk ducts, which are characterized by the presence of a tender lump without systemic symptoms.

- **Quality control and distribution process**: Questionnaires were distributed to participants through various means, including WeChat groups, face-to-face interactions, and QQ groups. An electronic questionnaire was meticulously designed using the online platform Sojump, and participants were provided with a QR code for convenient access. To ensure the integrity and completeness of the collected data, measures were put in place: each IP address was restricted to a single submission, and all questionnaire items were made obligatory. Participants were guaranteed anonymity during the survey process. A dedicated research team, comprising three doctors who were trained as research assistants, assumed responsibility for the dissemination and promotion of the questionnaires.

### Study protocol: Evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: A randomised controlled trial [^115auMSv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). High credibility.

The underlying biological pathogenesis of mastitis is important when considering management options. Mastitis is characterized by the presence of the main etiological agents of infection, staphylococci and streptococcal organisms. The strains causing mastitis, mainly Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus epidermidis, usually display two common properties: resistance to antibiotics and a high ability to form biofilms. This may explain their resistance to a wide range of antibiotic therapies and the resultant recurrence of the disease. A recent WHO report outlines the growing public health concern related to antimicrobial resistance, stressing that the resistance of common bacteria to antimicrobial drugs has reached alarming levels, making available options for treating infections increasingly ineffective.

Probiotics, with their increasing recognition and use in recent years, may provide one such alternative. Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, are thought to confer a beneficial effect to the host. Research indicates that specific probiotic bacteria possess significant anti-inflammatory properties comparable to a therapeutic pharmaceutical agent and supports their potential use as immunomodulatory agents. Given the gut microbiota is a critical stimulus for adequate maturation and function of the immune system, oral administration of probiotics to women during the early postnatal period to modulate microbiota composition is of particular interest.

Regarding the medical management of lactational mastitis, particularly in cases of recurrent mastitis, the ABM 2022 guidelines recommend examining patients and obtaining a milk culture to establish a diagnosis rather than treating empirically. It is advised to obtain a breast milk culture to identify uncommon pathogens and resistant bacteria and provide sensitivity information.

### Maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis [^112BZZZF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Mothers had inadequate knowledge, suboptimal attitude, and proactive practice towards breastfeeding and mastitis. Clinical practice may be enhanced by targeting interventions to improve breastfeeding knowledge in urban areas, fostering positive attitudes among higher-educated individuals and those with a history of breast surgery, and emphasizing the importance of maternity insurance to support better breastfeeding practices and mastitis prevention.

The main findings of our study revealed significant associations between demographic factors and breastfeeding KAP. Key results include: (1) urban residents demonstrated higher breastfeeding knowledge compared to rural residents; (2) participants with higher education levels (Junior college/Bachelor's degree) exhibited more positive attitudes toward breastfeeding; (3) history of breast surgery negatively impacted both knowledge and attitudes; and (4) maternity insurance was positively associated with breastfeeding practices. These findings align with previous research by Zaikman, who emphasized the importance of education in shaping breastfeeding attitudes. Similarly, Ahmad et al. reported that education level significantly influenced breastfeeding practices among working mothers. However, our finding regarding the negative impact of breast surgery on breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes differs from Taha et al, who found no significant association between surgical history and breastfeeding outcomes in their United Arab Emirates study. The positive association between maternity insurance and breastfeeding practices.

The practice dimension showed that 61.73% of patients reported the ability to find necessary breastfeeding information (P1), while 61.85% committed to maintaining nipple cleanliness during breastfeeding (P2). Additionally, 60.56% can discuss breastfeeding's importance with their spouse (P3), and 60.95% feel confident discussing breastfeeding-related issues with healthcare professionals (P4). Moreover, 59.97% can schedule breastfeeding even during busy times (P5), and 58.92% prepare breast milk for others to feed their baby (P8). Furthermore, 61.29% are committed to breastfeeding despite mild discomfort (P9), and 65.1% promptly address breast engorgement by allowing the baby to suckle (P13). In addition, 47.93% relax and remain comfortable while breastfeeding, even with family present (P14). Lastly, 62.76% accept the temporary limitations on their freedom due to breastfeeding (P15), 62.61% choose to breastfeed even if their spouse is unwilling (P16), and 60.85% wear appropriate nursing bras during the breastfeeding period (P18).

- **Practice on breastfeeding and mastitis**: Correlation analysis showed that significant positive correlations were found between breastfeeding-related knowledge and mastitis-related knowledge, breastfeeding-related attitude, mastitis-related attitude, and practice (r = 0.601, P < 0.001; r = 0.168, P < 0.001; r = 0.237, P < 0.001; and r = 0.084, p = 0.028, separately). Meanwhile, mastitis-related knowledge was positively correlated with breastfeeding-related attitude and mastitis-related practices.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: Cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: A randomized treatment trial [^1142cVXb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Mastitis is a common problem for breastfeeding women. Before planning a trial to reduce the number of lactating women who develop mastitis, we reviewed the literature to identify factors that may be associated with mastitis and to examine previous trials. A relatively small number of trials were identified, which included mastitis as one of the outcome measures (see Table). Using historical controls, prophylactic topical penicillin ointment was found to be ineffective, while hand disinfectant at the mother's bedside appeared to reduce mastitis. A Finnish study examined "breast massage" (which appears to be a variation of "nipple toughening") and found no impact of this practice on mastitis.

The authors of one trial were convinced that their intervention was effective, despite methodological difficulties. Livingstone and Stringer conducted a randomized trial for women with cracked nipples with positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), in Canada. They compared topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, and "optimal breastfeeding advice" and found better improvement in nipple healing in the women given oral antibiotics. Additionally, they found 16 women out of 65 (25%) given non-systemic treatment developed mastitis within 7 days, compared to 1 of 19 women (5%) given systemic antibiotics (chi-square, p = 0.065), not 0.005 as stated in their abstract. The authors concluded that cracked nipples colonized with S. aureus should be "treated aggressively with systemic antibiotics".

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^111J24zt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Lactational mastitis constitutes one of the main medical causes of premature weaning due to pain and discomfort or as a result of inappropriate advice from a health professional. Since breastfeeding provides a wide range of health benefits for the mother-infant pair, mastitis constitutes a relevant public health issue. Some epidemiologic studies have been carried out to investigate the incidence and the potential risk factors that could be involved in infectious lactational mastitis. Risk factors that have been suggested to be strongly associated with mastitis include, among others, mastitis with a previous child, cracked or sore nipples, use of ointments, inappropriate breastfeeding practices, and peripartum antibiotherapy.

In Spain, the most recent National Survey of Health available (2011–2012) showed that the estimated prevalence of exclusive (mixed) breastfeeding was 66.2% (72.4%), 53.6% (66.6%), and 28.5% (46.9%) at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively, after birth. On the other hand, Spain ranks regularly (24 out of 36) in the Breastfeeding Policy Scorecard for Developed Countries published recently, according to maternity leave laws and the right to daily nursing breaks, among other indicators. Furthermore, the number of centers that hold the Baby Friendly Hospital designation as institutions that promote breastfeeding, as well as the Breastfeeding Support Groups, has increased during the last decade. However, in contrast to this renewed interest that breastfeeding and human milk are receiving nowadays, lactational mastitis still remains widely unknown.

### Descriptive study of mastitis in postpartum women in Taiwan: Incidence and related factors [^111jvL5P]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). Low credibility.

Mastitis is a common disorder among postpartum women, and the discomfort and pain it causes may lead to the discontinuation of breastfeeding. Large-scale epidemiological studies examining mastitis are limited. Accordingly, this study utilized a nationwide population-based database to collect information about all postpartum women in Taiwan, aiming to determine the incidence and related factors of mastitis.

- **Materials and methods**: This retrospective population-based study used the National Health Insurance Research Database to collect records of patients with mastitis from 2008 to 2017. These records were then linked to the Taiwan Birth Registry. Women diagnosed with lactational mastitis within six months of delivery were included. A multivariable logistic regression model compared the risk of mastitis between multiparous women.

- **Results**: We identified 1,686,167 deliveries in 1,204,544 women, of which 19,794 women with 20,163 deliveries had a medical claim for mastitis. The incidence proportion of mastitis within six months postpartum was approximately 1.19%, peaking in the first month after delivery. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that multiparous women with a history of mastitis were more likely to experience mastitis again after subsequent deliveries (adjusted odds ratio = 5.86; 95% confidence interval = 5.21–6.58). The Kaplan-Meier curve indicated that primiparous women had a higher risk of mastitis than multiparous women (log-rank test, p < 0.001). Mastitis generally occurred during the first month postpartum, and primiparous women had…

### Treatments for breast abscesses in breastfeeding women [^1153Qk97]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

The benefits of breastfeeding are well known, and the World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life and continuing breastfeeding until age two. However, many women stop breastfeeding due to lactational breast abscesses. A breast abscess is a localized accumulation of infected fluid in breast tissue. Abscesses are commonly treated with antibiotics, incision and drainage (I&D), or ultrasound-guided needle aspiration, but there is no consensus on the optimal treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of different treatments for the management of breast abscesses in breastfeeding women.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trial Register (27 February 2015). In addition, we searched African Journals Online (27 February 2015), Google Scholar (27 February 2015), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Databases (27 February 2015), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal (27 February 2015). We also checked reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field as well as relevant pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating any intervention for treating lactational breast abscesses compared with any other intervention. Studies published in abstract form, quasi-RCTs, and cluster-RCTs were not eligible for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

### Mastitis: Rapid evidence review [^116d529F]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Mastitis represents a spectrum of inflammatory conditions. Lactational mastitis is the most common, with an approximate incidence of 10% in the United States, usually occurring in the first 3 months postpartum. Diagnosis is made clinically based on the presence of symptoms such as fever, malaise, focal breast tenderness, and overlying skin erythema or hyperpigmentation, without the need for laboratory tests or imaging. However, obtaining milk cultures should be considered to guide antibiotic therapy, and ultrasonography should be performed to identify abscesses in immunocompromised patients or those with worsening symptoms.

Most cases of mastitis are caused by inflammation and not a true infection. Thus, a 1- to 2-day trial of conservative measures (i.e. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ice application, feeding the infant directly from the breast, and minimizing pumping) is often sufficient for treatment. If there is no improvement in symptoms, narrow-spectrum antibiotics may be prescribed to cover common skin flora (e.g. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus). Most patients can be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics; however, if the condition worsens or there is concern for sepsis, intravenous antibiotics and hospital admission may be required.

Use of probiotics for treatment or prevention is not supported by good evidence. Factors that increase the risk of mastitis include overstimulation of milk production and tissue trauma from aggressive breast massage. Therefore, frequent overfeeding, excessive pumping to empty the breast, and heat application should be avoided.

### Study protocol: Evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: A randomised controlled trial [^112xTUXN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). High credibility.

Mastitis and accompanying pain have been associated with the cessation of breastfeeding. This condition is an inflammatory issue of the breast, potentially resulting from decreased immunity and a lowered resistance to infection. Mastitis affects up to one in five breastfeeding women, with most episodes occurring in the first 6–8 weeks postpartum. Antibiotics are often used in the treatment of mastitis; however, they have not become a popular or proven effective preventative agent. The World Health Organization has highlighted significant concerns related to the adverse effects of antibiotic use, including the production of antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens.

Increasing research suggests that specific probiotic bacteria possess significant anti-inflammatory properties, supporting their potential use as immunomodulatory agents. While animal studies have shown promising results in using probiotics for preventing mastitis, their use in human trials has seen limited investigation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of oral probiotics for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women.

- **Methods**: APProve (Can Probiotics Improve Breastfeeding Outcomes?) is a double-blind randomized controlled trial designed to assess outcomes between breastfeeding women ingesting a probiotic versus a placebo daily for 8 weeks following birth. A total of 600 women (300 in each arm) who intend to breastfeed will be randomized after the birth of a term, healthy infant. Daily and weekly surveys for 8 weeks and follow-up surveys at 2, 6, and 12 months after birth will assess the primary outcome.

### Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women [^115LMj11]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Mastitis can be caused by ineffective positioning of the baby at the breast or restricted feeding. Infective mastitis is commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The prevalence of mastitis in breastfeeding women may reach 33%. Effective milk removal, pain medication, and antibiotic therapy have been the mainstays of treatment.

- **Objectives**: This review aims to examine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in relieving symptoms for breastfeeding women with mastitis with or without laboratory investigation.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2012), contacted investigators and other content experts known to us for unpublished trials, and scanned the reference lists of retrieved articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing the effectiveness of various types of antibiotic therapies or antibiotic therapy versus alternative therapies for the treatment of mastitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third author.

- **Main results**: Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One small trial (n = 25) compared amoxicillin with cephradine and found no significant difference between the two antibiotics in terms of symptom relief and abscess formation. Another, older study compared breast emptying alone as 'supportive therapy' versus antibiotic therapy plus supportive therapy, and no therapy. The findings of the latter study suggested faster clearance.

### Study protocol: Evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: A randomised controlled trial [^116Prq7q]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Optimal management for the prevention of mastitis is not known. A Cochrane review specifically aimed to assess the effects of preventative strategies for mastitis and the subsequent effect on breastfeeding duration also showed insufficient evidence regarding the effectiveness of various interventions. These interventions included education on breastfeeding, changes in breastfeeding habits, hot/cold packs, relaxation techniques, and the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent recurrence.

Only three trials examining the effect of antibiotics were included. Although no significant difference in the incidence of mastitis was found, a trend towards a reduced effect was reported (risk ratio (RR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 1.61). When one of the trials among HIV-infected women was excluded, the two remaining studies reported a 67% and 76% reduction in mastitis with antibiotic prophylaxis, respectively.

However, all trials were inadequately powered or prematurely stopped due to concerns related to the adverse harms of antibiotic use, issues related to side effects, patient compliance, and attitudes. The review concluded that the use of antibiotics without clear indications resulted in no benefit and could lead to harm, not only for the participants but also in the production of antibiotic-resistant strains of the organisms.

Authors of the Cochrane review recommended future studies should consider implementing strategies to improve adherence, such as extended consultation time with participants to explain and reinforce instructions when recruiting participants.

### Maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis [^116omCUo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Regarding attitudes, 55.72% of respondents believed that the benefits of breastfeeding are only present in the infant being breastfed, while 56.01% agreed that exclusive breastfeeding is achievable regardless of nipple conditions. Additionally, 54.55% recognized the positive impact of longer breastfeeding duration on a child's growth and development, and 54.84% acknowledged that formula-fed babies are more prone to overfeeding than breastfed babies. Notably, 52.78% supported formula feeding as a practical choice for working mothers. Furthermore, respondents emphasized the emotional significance of breastfeeding, with 58.5% considering it very important and 57.19% feeling emotionally close to their babies through breastfeeding. A strong consensus of 57.92% affirmed that breastmilk is the ideal food for infants, and 58.23% expressed agreement that breastfed babies are healthier than formula-fed babies. However, 28.89% thought that breastfeeding was a burden for them.

- **Importance of preventing lactational mastitis**: 58.51% highlighted the importance, 58.65% believed that most cases can be avoided, and 59.09% expressed a willingness to acquire knowledge about prevention. Finally, 57.18% agreed to recognize early symptoms of mastitis, and 58.13% recognized the necessity of providing training to pregnant and postpartum women on preventing lactational mastitis.

### Maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis [^115c82Ng]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a comprehensive approach to infant feeding, advocating for exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for the initial six months, followed by the introduction of complementary feeding at six months, while continuing breastfeeding up to two years and beyond. This practice, when adhered to during the first half-year of a child's life, has demonstrated a substantial reduction in infant morbidity and mortality, with well-documented positive impacts on child growth and maternal well-being. WHO research underscores the protective nature of breastfeeding, being twice as effective in ensuring child health during the first year compared to non-breastfeeding practices.

Despite these recommendations, global statistics indicate suboptimal compliance, with only 39% of infants in developing countries exclusively breastfed for the initial six months, while 6% were never breastfed. Furthermore, 86% and 68% of infants and children continued breastfeeding at 6–11 months and 12–23 months, respectively. The practice of breastfeeding is influenced not only by socio-demographic factors but also by maternal knowledge and attitudes toward optimal breastfeeding practices.

Regarding lactational mastitis, it can be categorized into various types, with acute mastitis (AM) and sub-acute mastitis (SAM) being the most prevalent among breastfeeding women. Recognizing the factors associated with mastitis is imperative, as it can hinder optimal breastfeeding practices, potentially prompting premature supplementary feeding and leading to breastfeeding cessation.

### Initial management of breastfeeding [^115KEPC2]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Breast milk is widely accepted as the ideal source of nutrition for infants. To ensure success in breastfeeding, it is important that it be initiated as early as possible during the neonatal period. This is facilitated by skin-to-skin contact between the mother and infant immediately following birth. When possible, the infant should be allowed to root and latch on spontaneously within the first hour of life.

Many common nursery routines, such as weighing the infant, administration of vitamin K, and application of ocular antibiotics, can be safely delayed until after the initial breastfeeding. Postpartum care practices that improve breastfeeding rates include rooming-in, anticipatory guidance about breastfeeding problems, and the avoidance of formula supplementation and pacifiers.

### Mastitis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): The calm before the storm [^114LWq2Z]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Post-partum mastitis is a common infection in breastfeeding women, with an incidence of 9.5–16% in recent literature. Over the past decade, community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as a significant pathogen in soft-tissue infections presenting to the emergency department. The incidence of mastitis caused by MRSA is unknown at this time but is likely increasing.

- **Objectives**: We review the data on the prevention and treatment of mastitis and address recent literature demonstrating increases in MRSA infections in the post-partum population. Additionally, we explore how practices should change in light of this emerging pathogen.

- **Case report**: We present a case of simple mastitis in a healthcare worker who failed to improve until treated with antibiotics appropriate for an MRSA infection.

- **Conclusion**: Recent evidence suggests that just as MRSA has become the prominent pathogen in other soft-tissue infections, mastitis is now increasingly caused by this pathogen. Physicians caring for patients with mastitis need to be aware of this bacteriologic shift to treat appropriately.

### Study protocol: Evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: A randomised controlled trial [^114zQVK4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). High credibility.

Breastfeeding has been consistently shown to be protective against a broad range of immediate and long-term infant and maternal health outcomes. International guidelines recommend exclusive breastfeeding for all babies in the first six months of life, as it provides the best nutritional start for infants and promotes their healthy growth and development. Given the positive benefits of breastfeeding, it is concerning that the 2010 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Health Survey reported less than 15% of women exclusively breastfeeding at five months of age, despite a 96% initiation rate at birth. These findings suggest that more resources and research are required to identify and treat the underlying causes of breastfeeding cessation to extend the overall duration and improve long-term maternal and child health outcomes.

Mastitis and the pain associated with the condition have been shown to be linked to the cessation of breastfeeding. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mastitis as an inflammatory condition of the breast, which may or may not be accompanied by infection. It occurs in 15–21% of breastfeeding mothers in Australia. Most episodes occur in the first 6–8 weeks postpartum but can occur at any time during breastfeeding. Almost one-third of women experience a re-episode, and up to 3% of women with mastitis develop a breast abscess, often necessitating hospitalization.

Little is known about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this common condition. Although not well described, the risk factors appear to be…

### Neonatal mastitis: Clinical presentation and approach to evaluation and management [^111y3fjS]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Low credibility.

Mastitis is an uncommon but potentially serious infection in neonates. Characteristic findings include erythema, induration, and tenderness around the breast bud. Fluctuance and purulent drainage may be present with abscess formation. Fever and signs of systemic illness may occur, or there may only be signs of localized soft tissue infection. Until recently, there have been very few cohort studies of neonatal mastitis in high-income countries, and no literature available regarding the incidence of concurrent serious bacterial infections, such as meningitis or urinary tract infection.

A recent large, multicenter study suggests that most neonatal mastitis presents as localized soft tissue infection, with very low rates of concurrent serious bacterial infection or adverse outcomes. Treatment of neonatal mastitis consists primarily of antibiotic administration. Surgical intervention, such as incision and drainage or intraoperative debridement, may be needed for frank abscesses. While antibiotics are typically administered intravenously, there may be a role for oral antibiotics in some lower risk infants with mastitis.

### Experimental autoimmune breast failure: A model for lactation insufficiency, postnatal nutritional deprivation, and prophylactic breast cancer vaccination [^111akNcZ]. The American Journal of Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Mastitis is a substantial clinical problem in lactating women that may result in severe pain and abrupt termination of breastfeeding, thereby predisposing infants to long-term health risks. Many cases of mastitis involve no known infectious agent and may fundamentally be due to autoimmune-mediated inflammation of the breast. Herein, we develop a murine model of autoimmune mastitis and provide a detailed characterization of its resulting phenotype of breast failure and lactation insufficiency.

To generate breast-specific autoimmunity, we immunized SWXJ mice with recombinant mouse α-lactalbumin, a lactation-dependent, breast-specific differentiation protein critical for the production of lactose. Mice immunized with α-lactalbumin showed extensive T-cell-mediated inflammation in lactating normal breast parenchyma but none in nonlactating normal breast parenchyma. This targeted autoimmune attack resulted in breast failure characterized by lactation insufficiency and a decreased ability to nurture offspring.

Although immunization with α-lactalbumin had no effect on fertility and birth numbers, pups nursed by α-lactalbumin-immunized mice showed significantly disrupted growth often accompanied by kwashiorkor-like nutritional abnormalities, including alopecia, liver toxicity, and runting.

This experimental model of autoimmune breast failure has useful applications for prophylactic breast cancer vaccination and for addressing inflammatory complications during breastfeeding. In addition, this model is suited for investigating nutritionally based "failure-to-thrive" issues.

### Maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis [^116uRszH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

The distribution of knowledge dimensions regarding breastfeeding and mastitis revealed both areas of strength and potential misconceptions among the participants. Notably, a substantial percentage of respondents correctly recognized the benefits of breastfeeding for infant intellectual and growth development, the association between low mood and mastitis risk, and the role of breastfeeding in enhancing infants' immunity to infections and diseases like childhood asthma. These findings are consistent with existing literature, highlighting the awareness of these crucial aspects of breastfeeding.

However, it is concerning that a significant number of participants incorrectly believed that mothers with other related diseases during pregnancy cannot breastfeed, that breastfeeding should cease when mastitis occurs, and that babies need to be breastfed on a strict schedule. These misconceptions can have negative implications for breastfeeding initiation and duration.

In light of these results, clinical practice can be improved by addressing and correcting these misconceptions through targeted educational programs. Healthcare providers should emphasize the safety and importance of breastfeeding for mothers with certain medical conditions during pregnancy, provide guidance on managing mastitis while continuing to breastfeed, and promote responsive feeding rather than rigid schedules to encourage successful breastfeeding experiences. These efforts may contribute to a more informed and confident breastfeeding population, ultimately leading to improved maternal and infant health outcomes.

### Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis: A diagnostic dilemma for the breast radiologist [^115DR2Y9]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

The exact aetiology of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is unknown and controversial. However, the response to steroids suggests an autoimmune origin, which is the most widely accepted theory. The association with lactation, occurring up to 9 months after delivery, is explained by extravasated lactational secretions — due to local trauma or infection — damaging the ductal epithelium and leading to a granulomatous inflammatory response. Additionally, oral contraceptives can induce a chemically induced granulomatous reaction.

- **Duct ectasia, periductal mastitis complex**: Non-puerperal mastitis may be seen in patients with underlying duct ectasia or cysts where chemical inflammation is produced due to cyst or duct rupture. Later, bacterial infection may supervene. In duct ectasia, weakening of the duct wall results from the stasis of fatty inflammatory secretions, ductal dilatation, and duct wall rupture, leading to periductal chemical mastitis. Further necrosis and infection may result in abscess formation, especially in the peri-areolar region.

- **Inflammation and rupture of cysts**: This can also cause focal chemical mastitis and abscess formation.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the following independent associations with knowledge: urban area (OR = 2.031, 95% CI: 1.194–3.454, P = 0.009), high school or vocational school education (OR = 0.355, 95% CI: 0.153–0.825, P = 0.016), non-working status (OR = 0.484, 95% CI: 0.31–0.756, P = 0.001), and history of breast surgery (OR = 0.572, 95% CI: 0.361–0.906, P = 0.017). For attitude, the independent associations included junior college or bachelor's degree (OR = 2.288, 95% CI: 1.365–3.836, P = 0.002), monthly household income more than 10,000 CNY (OR = 1.538, 95% CI: 1.013–2.336, P = 0.044), and history of breast surgery (OR = 0.595, 95% CI: 0.428–0.829, P = 0.002). Attitude (OR = 1.016, 95% CI: 1.001–1.03, P = 0.032) and maternity insurance (OR = 1.435, 95% CI: 1.02–2.019, P = 0.038) were independently associated with practice.

- **Conclusion**: Mothers had inadequate knowledge, suboptimal attitude, and proactive practice towards breastfeeding and mastitis. It's recommended to target interventions for breastfeeding knowledge in urban areas and enhance attitudes among high-risk groups.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome will be defined as the incidence of mastitis up to 8 weeks following birth as measured by: Clinical diagnosis of mastitis OR
At least two of the following breast symptoms: pain, redness/inflammation, lump/swelling AND at least one of the following systemic symptoms: flu-like symptoms (body aches, headaches and chills) or fever ≥ 38°C. These symptoms must be present for at least 24 h.

Secondary maternal outcomes will include breastfeeding duration (total/partial), recurrence of mastitis, development of breast abscess, cracked nipples, use of antibiotics, overall maternal health and well-being, breastfeeding support, number of doctor's visits for probable mastitis, overall doctor's visits, adverse effects of treatment, and incidence of primary mastitis between 2 and 6 months postpartum. Maternal lifestyle factors which may affect breastfeeding outcomes will also be assessed. Acceptability and compliance of the trial product and the APProve-Lite system will also be examined as well as preference for method of postnatal questionnaires.

Secondary infant outcomes will include growth (height and weight) and well-being in the first year of life (measured at 2, 6 and 12 months as assessed via self-report of health conditions including infections (gastrointestinal, respiratory), doctor's visits, admission to hospital, allergic reactions and/or use of antibiotics.

### Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis diagnosed during pregnancy associated with successful breastfeeding experience [^114eoV6x]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is a rare, benign breast condition characterized by a rapidly progressive course and slow resolution. Consensus on management, particularly during pregnancy and lactation, is lacking. A 30-year-old woman at 33 weeks of gestation presented with mastalgia, induration, and galactorrhea in the left breast. Antibiotic treatment yielded no improvement. The initial workup was negative, and a core needle biopsy confirmed a diagnosis consistent with IGM. Antepartum treatment involved steroids. She received postpartum care co-managed by rheumatology and her obstetrician/breastfeeding medicine specialist. Postpartum treatment included azathioprine, and she successfully breastfed exclusively for six months, continuing through the first year. A multidisciplinary team approach is crucial in diagnosing, treating, and facilitating successful breastfeeding in patients with IGM.

Inpatient treatment

Advice to continue breastfeeding was given to 296 (80.7 per cent) lactating women. Over three-quarters of patients were treated in the outpatient setting (1,015 patients, 77.4 per cent); 295 patients (22.5 per cent) were admitted to the hospital for a median of 2 days (i.q.r. 2–4). The likelihood of being admitted depended on the diagnosis. Reasons for admission are listed below. The decision to admit was made predominantly by specialist registrars (174 patients, 59.0 per cent) regardless of the time or day of presentation. The odds of admission were significantly higher at the weekend compared with on Monday and Friday (OR 2.68, 95 per cent c.i. 1.89 to 3.80; χ² = 32.6; P < 0.001). There was significant variation between individual centers regarding the rate of inpatient treatment (χ² = 291.8; P < 0.001). Certain regions admitted about one-third of presenting patients for inpatient treatment.

Significant variation in inpatient treatment rates between centers (χ² = 291.8; P < 0.001). Certain regions admitted about one-third of presenting patients.

Antibiotics

Before presenting to secondary care, 882 (67.2 per cent) patients were treated with antibiotics, of which the majority (679 patients, 77.0 per cent) had one antibiotic course. Oral antibiotics administered in primary care significantly reduced the need for intravenous antibiotics in secondary care (OR = 0.71, 95 per cent c.i. 0.54 to 0.94; χ² = 5.6; P = 0.018).

### Study protocol: Evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: A randomised controlled trial [^115EsyEB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). High credibility.

Interventions that support prolonging breastfeeding duration have the potential to improve human health. Mastitis is a painful and debilitating complication of breastfeeding, affecting 1 in 5 breastfeeding mothers. It is associated with early cessation of breastfeeding and, if severe, may result in unwarranted hospital admissions for treatment of abscesses, often requiring antibiotics. At a time when we are experiencing the negative effects of antibiotic overuse, there is an urgent need to explore safe and effective alternatives for preventing infections such as mastitis in lactating women. This trial seeks to provide evidence for such an alternative in the form of probiotics, which may increase breastfeeding duration and potentially provide long-term health, cognitive, and developmental benefits for children, as well as decrease antibiotic usage, benefiting the community and health system.

Regarding the medical management for lactational mastitis, particularly in the management of recurrent mastitis, the ABM 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining radiology evaluation for multiple recurrences in the same location to rule out an underlying mass or other abnormalities such as granulomatous mastitis. It is important to recognize that inflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive malignancy, presenting with progressive erythema, breast retraction, and a peau d'orange appearance of the breast. Patients should be referred to breast surgery and oncology urgently if there is a concern for inflammatory breast cancer.

### Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis: Imaging update and review [^11523iMX]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is a rare, benign inflammatory condition of the breast first reported by Kessler and Wolloch in 1972. It occurs primarily in women of childbearing age, often in postpartum or breastfeeding mothers. The etiology of IGM remains elusive; reports have suggested an association with autoimmune disease or as a result of a directed response to trauma, metabolic, or hormonal processes. An association with Corynebacterium species has also been proposed, though diagnosis necessitates exclusion of bacteria from microbiology and histology specimens. Histologically, IGM is characterized by non-necrotizing granuloma formation with a localized infiltrate of multinucleated giant cells, plasma cells, epithelioid histiocytes, and lymphocytes. A neutrophilic infiltrate may also occur with the formation of organized microabscesses.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^1134GvRW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Infectious mastitis is a common condition that affects up to 33% of women during lactation, although its incidence may be underestimated because of differences in case definition and reporting. However, as it has recently been addressed, most studies have not reported the true mastitis incidence at the time of writing. It is necessary to define a time limit for the collection of data and to understand the size of the population at risk, namely, breastfeeding mothers in the area of study.

The term "infectious mastitis" has been applied only to acute cases, characterized by both local (breast redness, engorgement, and pain) and systemic symptoms. However, subacute mastitis, which includes only local symptoms and is often characterized by reduced milk secretion, has been systematically underreported. Furthermore, human milk cultures are rarely performed, resulting in a lack of standardized sampling and analysis procedures.

### Risk factors, symptoms, and treatment of lactational mastitis [^113H1epL]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on lactational mastitis:

- **Definition**: Lactational mastitis is a spectrum of inflammatory conditions of the breast in breastfeeding women, characterized by milk stasis, hyperlactation, and/or mammary dysbiosis, which can lead to infection.

- **Pathophysiology**: The primary factor in the pathophysiology of lactational mastitis is milk stasis due to poor milk drainage or ductal obstruction, which triggers an inflammatory response. Disruption of the milk microbiome is another contributing factor. Acute bacterial mastitis is often caused by Staphylococcus and Streptococcus strains.

- **Epidemiology**: Lactational mastitis is estimated to occur in 2–33% of breastfeeding women.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for lactational mastitis include nipple trauma or fissures, plugged milk ducts, wearing a tight bra, deep breast massage, hyperlactation, frequent breast pumping, abrupt weaning, history of mastitis in previous pregnancies, as well as maternal obesity and smoking.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of lactational mastitis typically begins with localized breast pain, tenderness, erythema, and warmth, progressing to systemic symptoms if untreated.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for lactational mastitis is generally good with appropriate management. Most cases resolve within 48–72 hours of initiating treatment. However, recurrence is possible, particularly in the presence of underlying risk factors.

### Interventions for preventing mastitis after childbirth [^111cXe1o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the health benefits of breastfeeding, initiation and duration rates continue to fall short of international guidelines. Many factors influence a woman's decision to wean, with the main reason cited being lactation complications, such as mastitis.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of preventive strategies for mastitis and the subsequent effect on breastfeeding duration.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register as of 8 August 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of interventions for preventing mastitis in postpartum breastfeeding women.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We independently identified relevant studies and assessed the trial quality. We contacted trial authors for missing data and information as appropriate.

- **Main results**: We included five trials involving 960 women. In three trials with 471 women, we found no significant differences in the incidence of mastitis between the use of antibiotics and no antibiotics (risk ratio (RR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 1.61), or in one trial of 99 women comparing two doses (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.02 to 9.18). We found no significant differences for mastitis in three trials: one involving specialist breastfeeding education with usual care, one involving anti-secretory factor cereal, and one involving mupirocin, fusidic acid ointment, or breastfeeding advice. Generally, we found no differences in any of the trials regarding breastfeeding initiation or duration, nor in symptoms of mastitis.

### Mastitis and mammary abscess management audit (MAMMA) [^1111q63U]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Benign breast inflammation and infection account for 5 percent of all breast-related hospital admissions, costing €3584 per admission. Mastitis, defined as inflammation of breast tissue, can be broadly classified as either lactational or non-lactational. Complications, such as severe sepsis resulting in hospital admission and/or the need for surgical incision and drainage, can occur when treatment is delayed, incorrect, or ineffective. Breast abscess, characterized by a localized collection of purulent material within the breast, is a known complication of mastitis and occurs in up to 11 percent of cases. The Mastitis and Mammary Abscess Management Audit (MAMMA) aims to review practices and improve outcomes in the treatment of mastitis and breast abscesses in the UK and Ireland through the national adoption of a best-practice protocol.

The accepted standard management of breast abscesses includes antibiotics and minimally invasive ultrasound-guided needle aspiration on an outpatient basis for patients who are clinically well. Surgical incision and drainage represent an archetypal treatment that should be reserved for selected patients only because it can lead to cosmetic disfigurement and, in lactational mastitis, involve an unnecessary hospital admission, separating the breastfeeding mother from her baby.

The acute nature of this presentation means that patients are more likely to present to the emergency department and/or general practitioners and subsequently be managed by non-breast specialist general surgeons.

### Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women [^114G9zxW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Mastitis can be caused by ineffective positioning of the baby at the breast or restricted feeding. Infective mastitis is commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Incidence of mastitis in breastfeeding women may reach 33%. Effective milk removal, pain medication, and antibiotic therapy have been the mainstays of treatment.

- **Objectives**: This review aims to examine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in relieving symptoms for breastfeeding women with mastitis, with or without laboratory investigation.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (December 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1996 to 2007), and EMBASE (January 1985 to 2007). We contacted investigators and other content experts known to us for unpublished trials and scanned the reference lists of retrieved articles.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of various types of antibiotic therapies or antibiotic therapy versus alternative therapies for the treatment of mastitis were selected.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third author.

- **Main results**: Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One small trial (n = 25) compared amoxicillin with cephradine and found no significant difference between the two antibiotics in terms of symptom relief and abscess formation. Another, older study compared breast emptying alone as supportive therapy.

### Maternal mastitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome risk from breastfeeding children with scarlet fever: Case report and literature review [^114HhvZ7]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Lactational mastitis is a common condition during breastfeeding, which, in rare cases, can progress to life-threatening necrotising mastitis, particularly in cases where Streptococcus pyogenes is involved. The development of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is associated with a fatality rate of approximately 50%.

In this Grand Round, we present the case of a healthy mother, aged 35 years, breastfeeding a child diagnosed with scarlet fever. The mother subsequently developed lactational mastitis, with a high load of S. pyogenes, culminating in skin necrosis and STSS. This case, along with six more case reports identified in a thorough literature search, underscores the severity of lactational S. pyogenes mastitis. In all cases, the only identifiable risk factor for invasive S. pyogenes disease was close contact with individuals exhibiting symptoms of scarlet fever.

During breastfeeding, the direct contact of the nipple to the child's pharynx, containing S. pyogenes in the case of scarlet fever, presents a probable route of transmission, especially when considering the pathogenicity of the bacterium. Although breastfeeding is generally encouraged, the literature lacks sufficient guidance regarding breastfeeding practices in children with scarlet fever.

This Grand Round proposes a simple strategy to minimize maternal risks, offering valuable insights into clinical management and prevention.

### Interventions for preventing mastitis after childbirth [^113mCBUh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Despite the health benefits of breastfeeding, initiation and duration rates continue to fall short of international guidelines. Many factors influence a woman's decision to wean; the main reason cited for weaning is associated with lactation complications, such as mastitis. Mastitis is an inflammation of the breast, with or without infection. It can be viewed as a continuum of disease, from non-infective inflammation of the breast to infection that may lead to abscess formation.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of preventive strategies (for example, breastfeeding education, pharmacological treatments, and alternative therapies) on the occurrence or recurrence of non-infective or infective mastitis in breastfeeding women post-childbirth.

- **Search methods**: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (3 October 2019), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of interventions for preventing mastitis in postpartum breastfeeding women. Quasi-randomized controlled trials and trials reported only in abstract form were eligible. We attempted to contact the authors to obtain any unpublished results, wherever possible. Interventions for preventing mastitis may include probiotics, specialist breastfeeding advice, and holistic approaches.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and assessed the certainty of the evidence.
