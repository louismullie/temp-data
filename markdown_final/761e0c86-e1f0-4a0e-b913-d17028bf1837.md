## Question

What is the first-line therapy for bipolar depression?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the first-line therapy is for bipolar depression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether we are dealing with acute treatment versus maintenance. Then, I should verify the most authoritative, recent guideline recommendations and how they prioritize monotherapy versus combination therapy. Next, I will cross-check international guidelines for concordance, review the evidence levels for key agents, and consider patient-centered nuances like tolerability. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, prioritized recommendation with caveats and alternatives based on the strength of evidence and guidelines convergence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and evidence hierarchy, because I need to ensure I am answering for acute bipolar depression, not maintenance, and that I am privileging high-credibility sources and monotherapy-first strategies when appropriate; the VA/DoD 2023 guideline is the most recent high-credibility source, CANMAT/ISBD 2018 provides a detailed hierarchy, and AAFP 2021 offers a concise, primary-care–oriented synthesis, all of which emphasize staged, measurement-informed care for bipolar disorder management [^1173MmEE] [^1138i4WV] [^117V3BQe].

> I will now examine the VA/DoD 2023 recommendations because they are both current and directive; they recommend offering quetiapine as monotherapy for acute bipolar depression, and if quetiapine is not used, they advise considering cariprazine, lumateperone, lurasidone, or olanzapine as monotherapy options, with selection tailored to patient preference and characteristics, so quetiapine is clearly positioned as the primary first-line choice in this guideline [^1173MmEE] [^111Pwhqp].

> Next, I should review the CANMAT/ISBD 2018 hierarchy to ensure cross-guideline alignment; they list monotherapy with quetiapine as a level 1 first-line option and monotherapy with lithium and lamotrigine as level 2 first-line options for acute bipolar depression, including both BD-I and BD-II presentations, which reinforces quetiapine's primacy while acknowledging lithium and lamotrigine as first-line with less robust acute-phase evidence [^115m8nwC].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought CANMAT might also prioritize lurasidone as first-line monotherapy, but I should double-check that; on closer inspection, CANMAT's strongest role for lurasidone is as a first-line adjunctive option with lithium or divalproex, whereas VA/DoD 2023 explicitly allows lurasidone as monotherapy if quetiapine is not used, so I need to be careful to attribute monotherapy endorsement for lurasidone primarily to VA/DoD rather than to CANMAT's monotherapy first-line list [^116vFeoZ] [^111Pwhqp].

> I need to confirm corroborating summaries in primary care guidance; the AAFP 2021 review recommends offering quetiapine or cariprazine as monotherapy for acute bipolar depression, and it also supports lurasidone in combination with lithium or valproate, which aligns well with VA/DoD's monotherapy stance on quetiapine and cariprazine and CANMAT's emphasis on lurasidone as an adjunctive option [^1171DHch] [^117HSYZq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before appraising evidence levels and important caveats; quetiapine has consistent level 1 efficacy for acute bipolar depression and robust maintenance data reducing depressive relapse risk, cariprazine has level 1 acute evidence, lurasidone has strong acute data but is emphasized as adjunctive in CANMAT while permitted as monotherapy by VA/DoD, and lithium and lamotrigine are first-line with level 2 acute evidence per CANMAT but VA/DoD notes insufficient evidence for lamotrigine as monotherapy in the acute phase, which I should keep in mind when ranking choices [^116vFeoZ] [^1173MmEE] [^111Pwhqp] [^117V3BQe].

> Let me consider patient-centered modifiers because they often determine sequencing among first-line options; prior response or non-response, predominant side-effect vulnerabilities such as metabolic risk and sedation, comorbidities, and patient preference frequently drive the choice among quetiapine, cariprazine, lurasidone, lithium, and lamotrigine, and managing common adverse effects like weight gain, metabolic dysregulation, and somnolence is critical for adherence and outcomes, which argues for tailoring within the first-line set [^112rsK5c] [^114gzrCd].

> I should confirm the stance on antidepressants to avoid inadvertently recommending monotherapy that may destabilize bipolar illness; VA/DoD 2023 finds insufficient evidence for antidepressants as monotherapy in acute bipolar depression, and CANMAT advises against long-term maintenance antidepressant use because of limited evidence and switch risk, while FDA antidepressant labeling urges screening for bipolar disorder prior to initiating antidepressants, underscoring that antidepressant monotherapy should not be the initial approach in bipolar depression [^117V3BQe] [^112Sg7Jd] [^113KyurB].

> Let me think about combination therapy versus monotherapy at initiation; across these sources, monotherapy is generally prioritized as the first step when feasible, with lurasidone plus lithium or valproate as a well-supported combination and quetiapine monotherapy often favored as the initial move unless prior non-response or tolerability issues suggest an alternative starting point, which keeps the approach simple and evidence-consistent at onset [^117HSYZq] [^1173MmEE] [^1171DHch].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with severe, psychotic, or highly suicidal depression where a rapid, robust response is needed; in such high-risk or treatment-resistant scenarios, electroconvulsive therapy should be considered per BAP 2016 recommendations, which serves as an important contingency beyond pharmacologic first-line strategies [^115ZfPpz] [^116bJuMj].

> Synthesis-wise, I should now state the hierarchy clearly and verify internal consistency; primary first-line is quetiapine monotherapy based on the most recent and convergent guidance, acceptable alternative first-line monotherapies when quetiapine is unsuitable include cariprazine and lurasidone, VA/DoD additionally lists lumateperone and olanzapine as monotherapy options, and lithium and lamotrigine can be considered first-line per CANMAT with level 2 acute evidence, with the caveat that VA/DoD cites insufficient evidence for lamotrigine monotherapy in the acute phase, so the sequencing should reflect both efficacy strength and patient-specific factors [^1173MmEE] [^111Pwhqp] [^116vFeoZ] [^1171DHch].

> Final recommendation, keeping the above verification in mind: start with quetiapine monotherapy for acute bipolar depression when not contraindicated, consider cariprazine or lurasidone monotherapy if quetiapine is not preferred or tolerated, recognize VA/DoD's inclusion of lumateperone and olanzapine as additional monotherapy options, and reserve lithium or lamotrigine as first-line per CANMAT when clinical factors favor them despite weaker acute-phase evidence, all while avoiding antidepressant monotherapy and considering ECT when illness severity or urgency warrants it [^1173MmEE] [^111Pwhqp] [^116vFeoZ] [^115ZfPpz].

The first-line pharmacological treatments for acute bipolar depression are **quetiapine monotherapy** [^1173MmEE] and **lurasidone with lithium or valproate** [^117HSYZq]. If quetiapine is not suitable, consider cariprazine, lumateperone, lurasidone, or olanzapine as monotherapy [^111Pwhqp]. Lithium or lamotrigine may be used as **first-line options**, especially for maintenance or when antipsychotics are not tolerated [^116vFeoZ] [^112rsK5c]. Antidepressant monotherapy is **not recommended** due to the risk of mood switching [^111Vz1W6]; if used, they should be combined with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic and monitored closely [^111JdfoQ]. Electroconvulsive therapy is reserved for **severe, treatment-resistant cases** or when **rapid response** is needed [^111v14sJ] [^115ZfPpz].

---

## First-line pharmacological treatments

### Quetiapine monotherapy

The **recommendation** is strong: quetiapine is first-line monotherapy for acute bipolar depression [^1173MmEE]. The **evidence** includes multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrating efficacy and safety [^111TiTnU].

---

### Lurasidone with lithium or valproate

The **recommendation** is first-line combination therapy [^117HSYZq] for acute bipolar depression. The **evidence** is based on clinical trials demonstrating efficacy in combination with mood stabilizers [^115m8nwC].

---

### Alternative first-line monotherapies

If quetiapine is unsuitable because of patient preference or clinical characteristics, the following medications are recommended as **alternative first-line monotherapies**:

| **Medication** | **Evidence level** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Cariprazine | High | Effective in acute bipolar depression [^111Pwhqp] [^111TiTnU] |
| Lumateperone | High | Effective in acute bipolar depression [^111Pwhqp] |
| Lurasidone | High | Effective as monotherapy [^111Pwhqp] [^115m8nwC] |
| Olanzapine | High | Effective as monotherapy [^111Pwhqp] [^111TiTnU] |

---

### Lithium and lamotrigine

Lithium is a **first-line option**, particularly effective in preventing relapse and reducing suicide risk [^115m8nwC] [^116UMpX8]. Lamotrigine is also a **first-line option**, particularly effective in preventing depressive relapses [^115m8nwC] [^111TiTnU].

---

## Antidepressant use in bipolar depression

Antidepressant monotherapy is **not recommended** due to the risk of inducing mania or rapid cycling [^111JdfoQ]. For **combination therapy**, if antidepressants are used, they should be combined with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic and monitored closely for mood switching [^111Vz1W6].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) [^115ZfPpz] is recommended for **severe, treatment-resistant cases** or when a **rapid response** is required [^111v14sJ]. Psychotherapy options such as **cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)** and **interpersonal therapy** may be considered as adjunctive treatments, although evidence is limited [^115fTBje].

---

## Clinical considerations and patient-specific factors

- **Patient preference**: Treatment choice should consider patient preference, previous treatment response, and tolerability [^1138i4WV].
- **Comorbidities**: Presence of comorbid conditions may influence medication selection and dosing [^111tLRp5].
- **Side effects**: Common side effects include weight gain, metabolic dysregulation, sedation, and akathisia [^114gzrCd], which may affect adherence and treatment outcomes [^1127zhQT].

## Summary of first-line treatment recommendations

| **Treatment** | **Recommendation level** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Quetiapine monotherapy | First-line | Strong evidence, effective, well-tolerated [^1173MmEE] [^111TiTnU] |
| Lurasidone + lithium or valproate | First-line | Effective combination therapy [^117HSYZq] [^115m8nwC] |
| Cariprazine | Alternative first-line | Effective monotherapy [^111Pwhqp] [^1171DHch] |
| Lumateperone | Alternative first-line | Effective monotherapy [^111Pwhqp] |
| Olanzapine | Alternative first-line | Effective monotherapy [^111Pwhqp] [^111TiTnU] |
| Lithium | First-line | Effective, prevents relapse, reduces suicide risk [^115m8nwC] [^116UMpX8] |
| Lamotrigine | First-line | Effective, prevents depressive relapses [^115m8nwC] [^111TiTnU] |

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^117FAZD7]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). High credibility.

First-line therapies for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder include monotherapies such as lithium (level 1), quetiapine (level 1), divalproex (level 1), and lamotrigine (level 1). These treatments have the best combination of clinical trials, administrative data, and clinical experience supporting their use. Recent data suggest that asenapine (level 2) is effective in preventing both manic and depressive episodes, making it a recommended first-line treatment. Aripiprazole, both oral (level 2) and once monthly (level 2), is also recommended as a first-line monotherapy for its efficacy in preventing mood or manic episodes and its safety/tolerability profile. However, it has not been shown to be effective in preventing depression.

- **Combination therapies**: Additional first-line combination therapies include quetiapine adjunctive therapy with lithium/divalproex (level 1), which has demonstrated efficacy in preventing mood, manic, or depressive episodes. Aripiprazole plus lithium/divalproex (level 2) is also recommended as a first-line option.

Patients who experience a recurrence or remain symptomatic while on a first-line agent or combination should have their dosing optimized and address issues of non-adherence before proceeding to additional therapeutic steps.

- **First-line**: Quetiapine is the only recommended first-line treatment for BDII depression (level 1). Pooled analyses of five identically designed trials demonstrated that quetiapine was superior to placebo, and moreover was equally effective for acute depression in BDI and BDII. The latter finding must be reconciled with the fact that quetiapine beat placebo in only three of the five individual trials in patients with BDII, compared to all five in patients with BDI. This is probably because the smaller sample of BDII patients — only about half as many patients with BDII as BDI were enrolled in each of the trials — provided less statistical power for BDII. Finally, open-label studies also suggest efficacy for adjunctive quetiapine (level 4).

- **Second-line**: Second-line treatments include lithium, ideally at a serum level of 0.8–1.2 mEq/L (level 2), and the antidepressants sertraline (level 2) and venlafaxine (level 2), mainly for patients with pure (non-mixed) depression. Lamotrigine (level 2) is also recommended as a second-line agent despite conflicting evidence. ECT (level 3) can also be considered second-line and is a good option, particularly for treatment refractory patients and those in need of rapid response.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111Vz1W6]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

In patients who are inadequately responsive to first-line agents, monotherapy with divalproex (level 2) is included as a second-line option.

- **Adjunctive use of antidepressant therapy**: Antidepressant therapy such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or bupropion can be used in conjunction with lithium, divalproex, or an atypical antipsychotic as a second-line add-on treatment. While some individual studies have failed to show the efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant therapy, a recent meta-analysis (level 1) supports its efficacy, albeit with a small effect size. This highlights the importance of decision-making regarding antidepressants, which have traditionally focused on the risk of manic switch or rapid cycling, rather than the relatively weak efficacy data.

- **Change in guidelines**: The new appreciation of the small benefits seen in the meta-analysis led to the change from the last CANMAT guidelines, which previously recommended add-on SSRI/bupropion antidepressants as a first-line treatment. According to the ISBD Antidepressant Task Force recommendations, antidepressants should ideally be avoided or used cautiously in patients with a history of antidepressant-induced mania or hypomania, predominant mixed features, or recent rapid cycling.

- **Patient education**: Patients and caregivers should be educated about early warning symptoms of mood switching or cycle acceleration. Antidepressants should be discontinued if these symptoms emerge. Antidepressant monotherapy should not be used for the treatment of bipolar I (BDI) depression.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (level 3) is another treatment option to consider.

### Abilify [^115yb38F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Screening patients for bipolar disorder: A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed, though not established in controlled trials, that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder. Such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.

It should be noted that Abilify is not approved for use in treating depression in the pediatric population.

- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)**: A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) may occur with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify. Rare cases of NMS occurred during Abilify treatment in the worldwide clinical database. Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability such as irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia. Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated.

### Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder: Japanese expert consensus [^112Czntb]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

For the treatment of BP-I, lithium monotherapy was categorized as a first-line treatment for manic episodes, depressive episodes, and the maintenance phase. Combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic is recommended for manic episodes, depressive episodes with and without mixed features, and the maintenance phase. While lithium is considered to be the most effective in preventing relapse and hospitalizations during the maintenance treatment of BP-I, the evidence supporting lithium for acute mania and depression in BP-I is weak. However, in the recently published Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) guideline, lithium monotherapy and combination therapy were listed as first-line treatments for acute mania and depression in BP-I. This recommendation is based on the notion that medications used for bipolar disorder should be multifunctional, as they not only treat acute mania or depressive symptoms but also prevent relapse.

In addition, monotherapy with a mood stabilizer and combination therapy with lithium or valproate were categorized as the first-line strategies for acute mania, acute bipolar disorder, and relapse prevention in the Korean expert consensus guideline. The experts who participated in the present study also endorsed lithium for the treatment of BP-I in almost all situations, possibly in light of its efficacy during different phases of this illness. According to a systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD/IGSLI Task Force, an optimal lithium strategy is…

- **Acute management of bipolar depression**:

- **Presentations of bipolar depression**: The DSM‐5 criteria for bipolar depression remain unchanged from DSM‐IV. Depression is characterized by a minimum of two weeks of depressed mood and/or anhedonia, along with at least four other symptoms. These symptoms include changes in sleep, appetite/weight, energy, psychomotor activity, concentration, thought content (guilt and worthlessness), and suicidal intent.

	- For many patients with bipolar disorder, the depressive polarity is often more pervasive and debilitating than manic states. Depressed mood accounts for up to two-thirds of the time spent unwell, even with treatment. Subsyndromal depressive symptoms, which persist despite treatment, are particularly common and a major source of functional impairment in these patients. They should be treated aggressively. DSM‐5 includes several specifiers that may accompany depressive episodes: anxious distress, mixed features, rapid cycling, melancholic features, atypical features, mood‐congruent or mood‐incongruent psychotic features, peripartum onset, and seasonal pattern. The utility of several of these specifiers in selecting treatment options for depression is discussed later in this section.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^116gW6b1]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Step 1: Review general principles and assess medication status**: Examination of a patient presenting in a manic state should include an immediate assessment for risk of aggressive behavior, violence, and safety threats to others, suicide risk especially in those with mixed features, degree of insight and the ability to adhere to treatment, comorbidity (including substance use that may be aggravating or contributing to the clinical presentation), and availability of a psychosocial support network. A physical examination with laboratory investigations (described in Section 8) should be conducted but may be deferred for patients who are uncooperative. Results of the overall assessment should be used to establish the most appropriate treatment setting (e.g. ambulatory or inpatient).

Before initiating pharmacological treatment for a manic episode, it is imperative to rule out symptoms secondary to drugs of abuse, medications, other treatments, or a general medical or neurological condition (although, even in these cases, symptomatic treatment may be applied on a short-term basis). Steps should be taken to rule out any other factors that may be perpetuating symptoms such as prescribed medication, illicit drug use/abuse, or an endocrine disorder. Any patients presenting with mania who have been taking antidepressants should have these medications discontinued. If there is a previous diagnosis of BD, it is appropriate to immediately commence antimanic agents. If this is the first emergence of manic symptoms, clinicians are advised to confirm the diagnosis of BD by monitoring patients.

### Acute and maintenance treatments for bipolar depression [^116y4x86]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with bipolar disorder are symptomatic about half of the time, experiencing depression more often than mania or hypomania. Because patients usually seek treatment during a depressive episode rather than a manic episode, bipolar depression is commonly misdiagnosed as unipolar depression. Providing an accurate and timely bipolar depression diagnosis is critical for the proper treatment of the patient.

Some FDA-approved treatments are helpful during acute and maintenance phases of therapy, but there is a significant unmet need for effective bipolar depression treatments with favorable side-effect profiles. Newer agents offer the promise of improvements in tolerability, but additional research is needed to actualize this promise into better treatments for patients struggling with bipolar depression.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^112rsK5c]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The choice of agent or agents used in maintenance treatment should be discussed with the patient and their caregivers (as appropriate) and based on knowledge of prior medication use and response, safety and tolerability of each agent, predominant episode polarity, and clinical features that may influence prognosis (see "Clinical features that help direct treatment choices"). As with treatment for mania and acute depression, we recommend that treatment choices for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder should follow the hierarchy listed in Table 17 unless patient preference or other considerations such as previous response/non-response, tolerability, or predominant polarity justify other choices. For example, if a patient has been treated for an acute mood episode and responded to a first-line maintenance treatment, we recommend continuing that treatment for maintenance even if lower in the hierarchy. An illustrative case is when a patient responded to asenapine in an acute manic episode; asenapine should be continued, even if it is lower in the hierarchy for maintenance treatment. It may be necessary to lower the dose once in maintenance treatment, as patients often experience greater side effects once out of the acute episode.

There is evidence that the risk of recurrence is reduced when an antipsychotic is combined with lithium or divalproex. When combination therapy of an atypical antipsychotic with lithium or divalproex was used to treat acute mania, continuing the atypical antipsychotic demonstrated consistent results in reducing recurrence risk.

### Medicating mood with maintenance in mind: Bipolar depression pharmacotherapy [^116UMpX8]. Bipolar Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression is a core feature of bipolar disorder, a phase in which many patients spend the majority of their time and one that confers a significant degree of burden and risk. The purpose of this paper is to briefly review the evidence base for the pharmacotherapy of bipolar depression and to discuss the recommendations for its optimal management.

A detailed literature review was undertaken with a particular emphasis on pharmacological treatment strategies for bipolar depression across the acute and maintenance phases of the illness. Electronic library and web-based searches were performed using recognized tools (MEDLINE, PubMED, EMBASE, and PsychINFO) to identify the pertinent literature. A summary of the evidence base is outlined and then distilled into broad clinical recommendations to guide the pharmacological management of bipolar depression.

Partitioning treatment into acute and maintenance therapy is difficult based on the paucity of evidence. The evidence from treatment trials favors the use of lithium and lamotrigine as first-line treatments in preference to valproate, and indicates that, for acute episodes, quetiapine and olanzapine have perhaps achieved equivalence at least in terms of efficacy. However, the effectiveness of the atypical antipsychotics in maintenance therapy is constrained by the potential for significant side effects of individual agents and the lack of both long-term research data and clinical experience in treating bipolar disorder as compared to other agents. Conversely, lithium and the anticonvulsants.

### Bipolar depression: Criteria for treatment selection, definition of refractoriness, and treatment options [^116hJeP9]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

This paper reviews controlled studies of bipolar depression, outlines criteria for choosing treatment, defines refractoriness in bipolar depression, and provides options for treatment of refractory bipolar depression.

- **Methods**: Controlled studies that examined the efficacy of treatments for acute and long-term management of bipolar depression were located through electronic searches of several databases and by manual cross-referencing of studies and proceedings of international meetings.

- **Results**: Lithium nearly fulfills the proposed criteria for first-line treatment for bipolar depression. Patients not responding to lithium should be considered as having refractory bipolar depression. Options for such patients include the addition of lamotrigine or a second mood stabilizer, a newer-generation antidepressant such as a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor or bupropion, or the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine.

- **Conclusions**: Although there is a scarcity of research in the treatment of refractory bipolar depression, the available data can provide rational treatment options for these patients. Further studies are urgently needed to determine which options are most appropriate for different types of patients.

### Current management of bipolar affective disorder: is it reflective of the BAP guidelines [^113Wd1Hx]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

In October 2003, the British Association of Psychopharmacology (BAP) published evidence-based guidelines on the management of bipolar disorder. The aim of this study was to assess whether the guidelines could provide the basis for examining clinical decisions and the extent to which practice accords with these guidelines. Case notes of outpatients with bipolar disorder were reviewed, with demographic details and treatment recommendations determined. The management of affective episodes was evaluated and compared with BAP guidelines.

In 84 subjects, 224 affective episodes were identified. Treatment was consistent with BAP guidelines in 72% of episodes. Mania was more likely to be managed in accordance with guidelines than depression or mixed episodes. The use of antidepressant medication was the most likely intervention to deviate from recommendations. Reasons for treatments at odds with the guidelines were identified. Our study demonstrates that clinical practice among a range of psychiatrists broadly reflects the guidelines issued by the British Association of Psychopharmacology (BAP). The BAP guidelines offer a practical and auditable basis for the short- and long-term treatment of bipolar affective disorder.

### Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder: Japanese expert consensus [^113znct7]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Similarly, lithium monotherapy was categorized as a first-line treatment for hypomanic episodes, depressive episodes, and the maintenance phase in BP-II, while combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic was endorsed for hypomanic episodes in BP-II. These findings are generally consistent with the Korean expert consensus guideline, except for the strategy for hypomania where only mood stabilizer and atypical antipsychotic monotherapies were recommended. However, due to inadequate evidence, conventional treatment guidelines other than the CANMAT and ISBD guideline did not include specific treatment recommendations for BP-II.

In addition, the CANMAT and ISBD guidelines did not include specific treatment recommendations for hypomania, since the reported studies had significant weaknesses, including small sample sizes and mixed samples. This is also the case for the acute treatment of depressive episodes with mixed features, acute treatment of manic and depressive episodes in the elderly, and the maintenance treatment for rapid cycling bipolar disorder. Notably, there were no first-line treatment options for geriatric bipolar disorder in the present study, which may reflect physicians' struggle to manage this challenging condition with psychopharmacological treatment. Further investigations are clearly needed to fill this gap in the literature.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^116vFeoZ]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). High credibility.

Monotherapy with quetiapine (level 1), lithium (level 2), and lamotrigine (level 2) are first-line options.

- **Quetiapine**: In two 52-week maintenance studies, patients with BDII who achieved remission from depression with quetiapine monotherapy continued it or switched to placebo. A pooled analysis reported that patients treated with quetiapine had a significantly longer time to relapse into any mood episode (hazard ratio [HR] 0.33, indicating a 67% reduction in the risk of relapse) and into depression (HR 0.28, showing a 72% risk reduction). Time to relapse into hypomania was not significantly greater (HR 0.65, or a 35% risk reduction). This finding might relate to the low base rate of hypomania, which occurred in only 10% of all study participants. Quetiapine was at least as effective in BDII as in BDI, with risk reductions of 42% for any relapse, 48% for depression, and 30% for mania.

- **Adjunctive treatment**: Adjunctive quetiapine was also studied in a 6-month single-blind trial that randomly assigned patients with either BDI or BDII to lithium or quetiapine, added to treatment as usual. They were equally effective in preventing relapse. Though results were not presented separately for BDII, BDII patients responded better to both treatments than did BDI patients.

### An analysis of the efficacy of treatments for bipolar depression [^113Zk3n1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Individuals with bipolar disorder are euthymic approximately half of the time, but recurring mood episodes are common, and time spent ill is predominated by depressive symptoms. Despite the prevalence of depression in bipolar disorder, evidence suggests that antidepressants are not likely to benefit most patients. Lithium, long considered a first-line treatment for bipolar disorder, is not the most effective agent for preventing bipolar depression. This article reviews multiple pharmacologic options that should be considered by clinicians treating bipolar disorder in both acute and maintenance phases.

- **Efficacy ratings for pharmacological agents used as maintenance therapy**: Evidence from RCTs is at the core of the recommendations in these guidelines. Nonetheless, RCTs are not the only source of clinically useful information, particularly when evaluating maintenance therapy. RCTs offer relatively limited follow-up timeframes while, for some patients, maintenance therapy may extend across decades. Furthermore, new medications are often assessed in studies with an enriched design (including only patients who have responded to the medication under study in the acute phase), limiting the generalizability of positive findings to patients who responded to the medication acutely.

	- Useful data can be obtained from large, often whole-population databases constructed from electronic medical records or electronic patient registries with large numbers of patients that would be difficult to obtain in RCTs. In some instances, they allow comparisons of multiple treatments. These large numbers make it possible to evaluate differences in rates of rare events such as less common side effects or suicide.

	- Patient cohorts followed in a specific setting provide another source of informative data. Their main advantage usually is the length of observation, in some instances reaching several decades. This comes at the cost of generalizability, in terms of both patient selection and non-random treatment allocation.

### Pharmacotherapy of bipolar depression: an update [^1154Cds8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Bipolar affective disorder is a virulent illness characterized by high rates of recurrence, disability, social impairment, and suicide. Although manic or hypomanic episodes define the disorder, depressive episodes are more frequent and less responsive to treatment. Initial depressive episodes are often misdiagnosed, leading to delayed initiation of therapy with mood stabilizers and increasing the risk of treatment-emergent affective switches when using antidepressant monotherapy. The empirical foundation for selecting treatments for bipolar depression is weak. Currently, only the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

- **Conventional mood stabilizers**: Preferred for first-line therapies. However, atypical antipsychotics are increasingly being used, and FDA approval for quetiapine is pending.
- **Antidepressants**: When mood stabilizers prove ineffective or for "breakthrough" depressions, the use of antidepressants — particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and bupropion — is indicated.

### "How harmful is your mania to you or others?" Sharing decisions about antidepressant treatment in bipolar depression [^113P19w9]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

There is a noticeable gap between guidelines and clinical practice. Multiple studies have shown that the majority of bipolar patients are routinely treated with antidepressants for their depression. Previous authors have speculated on the considerations in the consultation rooms that encourage or warrant the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The severity of bipolar depression and the estimated suicide rate of 15%-20% prompt clinicians to suggest SSRI treatment. For many patients, the side-effect profile of dopamine-serotonin receptor antagonists and the need for regular laboratory monitoring for mood stabilizers are relevant considerations. The extrapolation of antidepressant efficacy in unipolar depression may be another contributing factor.

In the past few decades, guidelines have been reluctant to endorse antidepressants as a treatment option for bipolar depression. Recent guidelines do not recommend tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or SSRI monotherapy, but they do propose the combination of an SSRI with lithium, valproate, or olanzapine as a first-line choice among other options such as lithium, lamotrigine, and quetiapine. Still, antidepressants have proven modestly efficacious, comparable to other treatments, with a number needed to treat of 5.75. A recent meta-analysis also showed that SSRI addition to lithium is superior over placebo in short-term regimes.

The hesitation to award antidepressants a more prominent role in the guidelines stems from the notion that they may induce (hypo)mania, particularly TCAs and venlafaxine. The risk of SSRIs triggering (hypo)mania is a concern.

### Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder: Japanese expert consensus [^115sFF41]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacological strategy for depressive episodes**: Lithium monotherapy was categorized as a first-line treatment for depressive episodes in both BP-I (7.1 ± 2.0) and BP-II (7.0 ± 2.2). While combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic was categorized as a first-line treatment for depressive episodes in BP-I (6.9 ± 2.2), it was considered to be a second-line treatment in BP-II (6.7 ± 2.2).

	- **Other second-line choices for BP-I included**:
	- Lamotrigine monotherapy (6.6 ± 2.3)
	- Combination therapy of lamotrigine and an atypical antipsychotic (6.6 ± 2.2)
	- Quetiapine monotherapy (6.5 ± 2.3)

### Marplan [^113KyurB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed, though not established in controlled trials, that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitating a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of these symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder. Such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that Marplan is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.

- **Second line status**: Marplan can cause serious side effects. It is not recommended as initial therapy but should be reserved for patients who have not responded satisfactorily to other antidepressants.

- **Hypertensive crises**: The most important reaction associated with MAO inhibitors is the occurrence of hypertensive crises, which have sometimes been fatal, resulting from the co-administration of MAOIs and certain drugs and foods (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

	- These crises are characterized by some or all of the following symptoms: occipital headache which may radiate frontally, palpitation, neck stiffness or soreness, nausea or vomiting, sweating (sometimes with fever and sometimes with cold, clammy skin), and photophobia.

### An evidence-based medicine strategy for achieving remission in bipolar disorder [^113CJjo8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of several classes of drugs for achieving acute response in bipolar mania and depression. For many years, clinical response has been the primary outcome in the majority of short-term efficacy studies. However, there is a growing consensus that the optimal goal in the long-term management of bipolar disorder is remission. The purpose of this article is to briefly summarize the clinical importance of remission in bipolar disorder and to review data on the effectiveness of available treatments for achieving and sustaining remission.

### The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression with mixed features: A systematic review [^11785PNk]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic search was conducted on PubMed and OVID (MedLine, Embase, AMED, PsychINFO, and JBI EBP) from inception to July 22, 2024. Additionally, the reference lists of the obtained articles were manually searched. The pharmacological agents included in the search terms were lithium salts, antidepressants, typical or atypical antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants that are US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD). The following Boolean logic search string was used to search the databases: ("Amitriptyline" OR "Citalopram" OR "Clomipramine" OR "Fluvoxamine" OR "Mirtazapine" OR "Nortriptyline" OR "Paroxetine" OR "Phenelzine" OR "Desipramine" OR "Duloxetine" OR "Escitalopram" OR "Sertraline" OR "Venlafaxine" OR "Agomelatine" OR "Desvenlafaxine" OR "Gepirone" OR "Levomilnacipran" OR "Moclobemide" OR "Selegiline" OR "Tranylcypromine" OR "Vilazodone" OR "Vortioxetine" OR "Bupropion" OR "Dextromethorphan" OR "Dextromethorphan-bupropion" OR "Ketamine" OR "Esketamine" OR "Fluoxetine" OR "Zuranolone" OR "Cariprazine" OR "Lurasidone" OR "Quetiapine" OR "Olanzapine" OR "Lumateperone" OR "Aripiprazole" OR "Asenapine" OR "Haloperidol" OR "Paliperidone" OR "Risperidone" OR "Ziprasidone" OR "Iloperidone" OR "Clozapine" OR "Amisulpride" OR "Brexpiprazole" OR "Carbamazepine" OR "Valproate" OR "Valproic acid" OR "Divalproex" OR "Gabapentin" OR "Oxcarbazepine" OR "Pregabalin" OR "Topiramate" OR "Lamotrigine" OR "Lithium").

### An update on antidepressant use in bipolar depression [^113NvebT]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

The effective treatment of depression in individuals with bipolar disorder remains a clinical challenge. The role of antidepressant medication in treating bipolar depression has been controversial. While early studies and meta-analyses supported a role for antidepressant medication, more recent, high-quality randomized controlled trials in bipolar depression have generally not demonstrated efficacy for these medications. Although there is concern about the risk of affective switch and long-term destabilization when using antidepressant medications in bipolar disorder, the magnitude of this risk has been difficult to ascertain with confidence. Maintenance use of antidepressant medication has generally not demonstrated a favorable risk-benefit ratio.

Future studies should explore the patient characteristics and response patterns that predict a more favorable response profile to antidepressants among patients with bipolar disorder, so that these medications can be rationally used in those most likely to benefit.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111E4z4F]. Bipolar Disorders (2018).

Patients should be encouraged to initiate or optimize maintenance treatment as soon after giving birth as possible, with preference given to medications that have previously been shown to be successful. Near delivery, close monitoring is essential for early detection and management of symptoms that might signal the onset of a mood or psychotic episode. If an acute mood episode emerges in the postpartum period, the hierarchies for non‐postpartum episodes should be followed. However, since most psychotropic medications are excreted in breast milk, treatment choice should take into consideration safety in breastfeeding when applicable.

The FDA website, as well as Table 21, include information on lactation. The FDA PLLR should be consulted for further information about medication risks, as many are secreted in milk if breastfeeding is being considered.

- **Discussion of potential risks and benefits**: The potential risks and benefits of taking medications while breastfeeding should be discussed with the patient. Education about early recognition of drug toxicity and the requirement for ongoing monitoring of infants is also critical. A recent systematic review suggested quetiapine and olanzapine as preferred choices for breastfeeding, considering their relatively lower infant dosages. The impact of medication on the infant can be reduced by scheduling medication administration after breastfeeding.

Replacing or supplementing breast milk with formula can also be considered. Although there are many benefits to breastfeeding, associated sleep disruption may increase the risk of mood episodes.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: Rational pragmatic approaches to management [^116LE4iN]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The evidence for the efficacy of many currently available treatments for bipolar disorder is based on studies of nonrefractory patients with bipolar disorder. Therefore, not surprisingly, most treatment recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder and its many comorbidities depend heavily on data from placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs). However, these RCTs provide little direction for the clinician regarding optimal next steps in non- or partial-responders and in those with ongoing medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Given this and the paucity of RCTs at later treatment stages, we found it appropriate to begin a discussion about the quality of data that some experts in the field might consider when choosing and sequencing drugs and their combinations.

We acknowledge that many other clinical investigators may prefer different sequences, yet we believe the suggestions offered here might be useful to some clinicians in the field, might initiate discussions of other options in the literature, and simultaneously, provide a preliminary outline for a new round of much-needed clinical trials to better inform clinical practice. Given the wide range of the quality of data and clinical principles on which the suggestions are based, only minimal references are included, and a comprehensive review of the literature supporting each option is outside the scope of this manuscript.

### Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder: Japanese expert consensus [^114Rkwd2]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Regarding depressive episodes with mixed features, only a combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic was categorized as a first-line treatment for BP-I (7.1 ± 2.0). Second-line treatments were lithium monotherapy (6.7 ± 2.2), a combination therapy of valproic acid and an atypical antipsychotic (6.5 ± 2.1), olanzapine monotherapy (6.3 ± 2.3), and a combination therapy of lithium and valproic acid (6.3 ± 2.2). None of the choices were categorized as a first-line treatment for depressive episodes with mixed features in BP-II. The following choices were categorized as second-line treatments: lithium monotherapy (6.7 ± 2.3), a combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic (6.6 ± 2.3), quetiapine monotherapy (6.2 ± 2.4), a combination therapy of valproic acid and an atypical antipsychotic (6.1 ± 2.3), and olanzapine monotherapy (6.1 ± 2.3).

- **Maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder**: Lithium monotherapy was considered a treatment of choice for the maintenance phase in BP-I (7.8 ± 1.8) and a first-line treatment in BP-II (7.3 ± 2.3). A combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic was categorized as a first-line treatment for the maintenance phase in BP-I (6.9 ± 2.1) and a second-line treatment in BP-II (6.7 ± 2.2). These were followed by second-line choices, including a combination therapy of lithium and lamotrigine (6.4 ± 2.5), a combination therapy of lithium and valproic acid (6.4 ± 2.4), and lamotrigine monotherapy (6.2 ± 2.3) for BP-I, as well as lamotrigine monotherapy (6.4 ± 2.5), quetiapine monotherapy (6.2 ± 2.3), and com.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: Rational pragmatic approaches to management [^113cVP6G]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine must ultimately proceed on the basis of what works for an individual patient. Data from randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for making clinical judgments. However, there are many pitfalls to this assumption. Patients are highly selected for homogeneity for RCTs, and typically do not represent the range and complexity of patients in the general population. There is little room for generating clinical predictors of response, as only half of the patients receive the active medication. Real responders cannot be readily separated from placebo responders, and secondary analyses of possible predictors and subgroups have methodological limitations that are frowned upon by the FDA, many journal editors, and referees.

The most egregious deficit is that there are rarely sufficient RCTs in patients with bipolar disorder to cover the whole range of first-, second-, or third-line treatments. Even when an RCT does exist in a given area, it often provides no guidance for the clinician interested in knowing what might be the next best option for nonresponders. Another problem is that most treatment guidelines take the perspective that most patients are responsive to initial treatment. In reality, many patients, perhaps the majority in some settings, present with complex late-stage illness that shows considerable treatment refractoriness rarely addressed in RCTs. These treatment-refractory patients are often excluded from industry-sponsored RCTs.

### Managing the side effects associated with commonly used treatments for bipolar depression [^114gzrCd]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

The most commonly used pharmacologic therapies for bipolar depression are mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants. This paper reviews common side effects associated with these medications and provides recommendations for managing adverse medication effects in clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Narrative review based on literature searches of Medline and evidence-based treatment guidelines for agents that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and/or are commonly used to treat bipolar depression.

- **Results**: Side effects of bipolar depression pharmacotherapies are common and vary by medication, with weight gain, metabolic dysregulation, sedation/somnolence, and akathisia among those observed most frequently. These adverse events (weight gain and sedation/somnolence, in particular) negatively affect treatment adherence in patients with bipolar disorder. Furthermore, endocrine and metabolic comorbidities, weight gain, and obesity may reduce the likelihood of positive clinical responses to pharmacologic therapies. Clinicians may consider switching patients to bipolar depression medication(s) with a lower propensity for sedation or adverse metabolic effects. Lifestyle modification (e.g. dietary changes, exercise) is an important component in the treatment of weight gain/obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hyperglycemia; in addition, a wide range of medications are available as therapeutic options for patients in whom non-pharmacologic management strategies are insufficient. The use of adjunctive medication may also reduce treat.

### Role of antidepressants in bipolar depression [^111JdfoQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A gap exists between the standard of care for bipolar depression and actual clinical practice. Although practice guidelines advise against treating bipolar depression with antidepressant monotherapy, this is the most frequently prescribed initial treatment. To provide quality care and improve patient outcomes, clinicians must be aware of the benefits and dangers of antidepressant use in bipolar disorder. Further, they must be informed about alternative, more efficacious treatment options for patients with depressive symptoms.

### Effective treatment of bipolar depression: Monotherapy and combination strategies [^115dE17W]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Managing patients with bipolar disorder remains a challenge due to its chronic nature. In addition, bipolar depression is understudied, even though patients spend more time in depressive episodes than in manic ones. Effective treatment requires an accurate and timely diagnosis, psychoeducation, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and the implementation of elements of the chronic care model. Pharmacologic strategies for treating bipolar depression differ from those for bipolar mania and unipolar depression and require knowledge of the efficacy and safety of agents, including mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants, both as monotherapy and in combination.

### Treatment strategies for bipolar depression [^112YHnmj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Resolving acute bipolar mood episodes is only one part of an overall strategy for treating bipolar disorder. Successful prevention of mood episode relapse, particularly bipolar depressive episodes, through effective continuation and maintenance therapies can greatly improve patient functioning and outcomes. Little evidence is available to guide decisions on the treatment of bipolar depression, especially in the maintenance phase, and additional research into effective options is urgently needed. General strategies for treating patients with bipolar disorder include continuing the acute pharmacotherapeutic regimen into the maintenance phase and considering tolerability.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological treatments for the treatment of acute bipolar depression: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111TiTnU]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

We investigated the comparative efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological treatment strategies for the treatment of acute bipolar depression. A systematic review and network meta-analysis was conducted by searching eight registries for published and unpublished, double-blind, randomized controlled trials of pharmacotherapies for the acute treatment of bipolar depression. PRISMA guidelines were used for abstracting data, while the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess data quality. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.

Primary outcomes were efficacy, measured by response and remission rates, and acceptability, assessed by treatment completion rates and dropouts due to adverse events. Summary odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects.

From the 4,404 identified citations, 50 trials were included comprising 11,448 participants. The network meta-analysis showed that escitalopram, phenelzine, moclobemide, carbamazepine, sertraline, lithium, paroxetine, aripiprazole, gabapentin, and ziprasidone appear to be ineffective compared to placebo in the treatment of bipolar depression. In contrast, divalproex, olanzapine/fluoxetine, olanzapine, quetiapine, cariprazine, and lamotrigine appeared to be effective compared to placebo in the treatment of bipolar depression. Aripiprazole displayed higher discontinuation rates versus placebo due to the occurrence of adverse events.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^11538XJY]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Due to the frequent depressive onset, variable help-seeking for hypomanic or manic periods, temporal instability of symptoms, and high rates of comorbidity, the accurate and timely identification of bipolar disorder (BD) can be difficult to achieve in many cases. Many individuals are not accurately diagnosed until up to 10 years after the onset of symptoms, with one to four alternate diagnoses typically being given prior to correct recognition and treatment. This delay has important consequences, including inadequate initial treatment and a worse prognosis in terms of episode recurrence and functional outcome.

The most frequent misdiagnosis is major depressive disorder (MDD), as patients are more likely to present for the treatment of depressive symptoms and may not recall periods of hypomania or mania, or may not interpret them as being pathological. Recall and insight are particularly impaired during periods of acute depression, with pronounced memory or concentration difficulties. There are several features of depression that may increase suspicion of bipolarity and prompt more careful investigation. These include:

- **Earlier age of illness onset**: Symptoms appearing at a young age could indicate bipolar disorder.
- **Highly recurrent depressive episodes**: Frequent depressive episodes can be a sign of bipolarity.
- **Family history**: A family history of BD increases the likelihood of bipolar disorder.
- **Depression with psychotic features**: The presence of psychotic symptoms during depression may indicate bipolar disorder.
- **Psychomotor agitation**: Agitation and hyperactivity during depressive episodes can be relevant.
- **Atypical depressive symptoms**: Symptoms such as hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and leaden paralysis should raise suspicion.
- **Postpartum depression and psychosis**: Depressive and psychotic episodes following childbirth are significant.
- **Past suicide attempts**: Such behavior may correlate with bipolar disorder.
- **Antidepressant-induced manic symptoms or rapid cycling**: These can be important indicators.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^1138i4WV]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). High credibility.

As in previous editions, these guidelines are organized into eight sections, including the introduction. Section 2, foundations of management, discusses the epidemiology of bipolar disorder (BD), screening and diagnostic considerations, the importance of monitoring risk for suicide, the chronic disease management model, and patient-centred care (including shared decision making). It also emphasizes the importance of incorporating psychoeducation and other psychosocial treatment strategies into treatment.

Additional information on presentation and hierarchical rankings of treatment options for acute mania (Section 3) and depression (Section 4) are reviewed, including descriptions of clinical features that may help direct treatment choices. The importance of long-term maintenance treatment and promotion of treatment adherence for mood stability, as well as hierarchical rankings of treatment options, are discussed in Section 5.

An expert review of the available evidence for treatments of bipolar II disorder (BDII) and recommendations based on those findings are presented in Section 6. Management issues related to specific populations, including women at various stages of the reproductive cycle, children and adolescents, older adults, and those with psychiatric or medical comorbidity, are each discussed in Section 7. Finally, the principles of medical monitoring and an overview of safety and tolerability concerns for recommended treatments are provided in Section 8.

For convenience and to avoid confusion, these guidelines also include a table of commonly used terms.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^1132hWd6]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacological treatment for acute bipolar depression**: Lithium, anticonvulsants, atypical antipsychotics, and other agents such as antidepressants have all been investigated for efficacy in managing bipolar depression. These treatments have been evaluated using the criteria for strength of evidence for efficacy, as well as safety and tolerability. Recommendations are summarized in a hierarchical ranking of first and second-line treatments.

- **Step 1: Review general principles and assess medication status**: Examination of a patient presenting in a depressed state should include an assessment of the nature and severity of depression and associated symptoms, risk of suicide and self-harm behavior, ability to adhere to a treatment plan, availability of a psychosocial support network, and functional impairment. Laboratory investigations should also be completed. Results of the overall assessment should be used to establish the most appropriate treatment setting, such as ambulatory or inpatient, with consideration given to the management of safety risks. Before initiating pharmacological treatment for a depressive episode, it is imperative to rule out symptoms secondary to alcohol or drug use, medications, other treatments, or a general medical condition. Patients should be supported to discontinue stimulant use and limit nicotine, caffeine, drug, and alcohol use. The course of illness and treatments used in prior episodes should be assessed.

- **Step 3: Add on or switch therapy (alternate first-line agents)**: If therapy with one or a combination of the first-line agents (lithium, divalproex, and/or an atypical antipsychotic) at optimal doses is inadequate or not tolerated, the next step is to switch to or add on an alternate first-line agent. An exception is that, despite level 1 evidence for monotherapy with paliperidone and ziprasidone, we do not recommend combination therapy with these agents due to lack of evidence for additional efficacy (see "No specific recommendation/agents that require further study" below). As there are multiple first-line agents with substantial efficacy data and relative safety and tolerability, the use of second- and third-line agents is only recommended after unsuccessful trials of multiple first-line strategies.

- **Step 4: Add on or switch therapy (second-line agents)**: In patients who are inadequately responsive to first-line agents, second-line choices include monotherapy with olanzapine (level 1), carbamazepine (level 1), ziprasidone (level 1), and haloperidol (level 1), or combination therapy with olanzapine plus lithium or divalproex (level 1). While each of these strategies has strong support for their efficacy, safety and tolerability concerns relegate them to second-line options. Although widely used in clinical practice, the combination of lithium and divalproex is also recommended as a second-line choice, as evidence supporting its efficacy is limited to uncontrolled trials (level 3).

ECT is also recommended.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^116SP4UW]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The data in pediatric samples are very limited and complicated by extremely high placebo-response rates in RCTs. These recommendations are therefore to a greater extent informed by clinical experience and studies in adults than the above acute mania recommendations (see Figure 8).

- **Treatments for pediatric bipolar depression**: A recently published RCT found that lurasidone was superior to placebo in improving depressive symptoms in children and adolescents with acute bipolar depression; however, there is comparatively little clinical experience in this population. Nevertheless, given its efficacy and clinical experience in adult bipolar depression, lurasidone is recommended as a first-line treatment.

- **Second-line treatments**: Although lithium and lamotrigine were recommended as first-line agents for bipolar depression in adults, there are only open-label data for lithium and lamotrigine in children and youth. Despite limited RCT data, there is substantial clinical experience with these agents as they are widely used in clinical practice. For this reason, together with the strength of evidence in adults, lithium and lamotrigine are recommended as second-line, rather than third-line agents (see Figure 8).

- **Third-line treatments**: There is a positive RCT of olanzapine-fluoxetine combination among youth with bipolar depression. However, there are metabolic concerns regarding olanzapine and limited clinical experience with olanzapine.

### The role of pharmacologic treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder [^117T7Lwt]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

With the growth in the number of pharmacologic options available for the treatment of bipolar disorder, clinicians face a challenge in appropriately selecting and sequencing newer and older treatments. Evidence-based practice has been suggested as a way to improve outcomes across medical specialties, leading to the development of numerous practice guidelines and treatment algorithms for bipolar disorder to aid clinical decision-making.

Most of these guidelines and algorithms are based on detailed reviews of the medical literature, with an emphasis on systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials. Some guidelines incorporate a consensus of expert opinion when the literature does not provide clear evidence. This review examines areas of overlap and discordance in practice guidelines issued by the American Psychiatric Association and the British Association for Psychopharmacology, as well as treatment algorithms developed by the Expert Consensus Guideline Series and the Texas Medical Algorithm Project.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: Rational pragmatic approaches to management [^113REEJz]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The achievement and maintenance of remission are the major goals of therapeutics for bipolar disorder. Since guidance from the literature is inadequate in advising how to achieve this goal, careful longitudinal assessment of an individual patient's degree of response and tolerability to a drug is crucial. More medications, from different mechanisms of action, and multiple types of therapeutic approaches, including psychotherapeutic and lifestyle interventions, may be necessary to initially achieve remission. Additional treatment revisions will likely also be required as symptoms emerge, with the hope that prompt attention to these will prevent the development of full-blown relapses. When a comprehensive approach is taken, recurrence of and sensitization to mood episodes, stressors, bouts of substance abuse, and their epigenetic underpinnings may be minimized.

It is our experience that even patients with late-stage, apparently treatment-refractory illness can achieve considerable improvement, if not remission, if unconventional approaches are utilized. These approaches may involve multiple medications with different neurotransmitter targets, various off-label adjuncts, lifestyle modification, psychosocial approaches, and nutraceuticals. Ideally, a systematic treatment literature would be available to guide clinical decisions rather than relying on indirect evidence and clinicians' suppositions. However, in the absence of such literature, the clinician must collaborate with patients and family members in constructing and revising treatment regimens.

### Decision tree for the treatment of bipolar disorder [^11545LBW]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Clinicians managing patients with bipolar disorder confront a myriad of complex treatment decisions. This complexity limits the practicality of treatment guidelines, which attempt to be comprehensive. However, a user-friendly guide can be constructed by considering only the most common early critical decision points likely to be encountered in the management of bipolar patients: new onset of an acute manic or mixed episode, interepisode treatment entry, and initial treatment for acute bipolar depression.

Three general treatment principles can be applied to guide decision-making at critical decision points that follow entry into clinical care: use proven treatments first, use a mood stabilizer in every phase of the illness, and use a multiphase treatment strategy to link assessment with an appropriate treatment plan. To guide the selection of appropriate therapeutic agents, a simple grading system can be used to evaluate the weight of evidence supporting the use of various options.

Multiple high-quality studies with positive results support the use of lithium, divalproex, carbamazepine, olanzapine, and haloperidol as initial interventions for acute mania; other agents with positive results in one double-blind mania trial are reasonable first-line alternatives. In the absence of high-quality evidence to guide treatment selection for non-acutely ill bipolar patients, guidelines recommend maintenance mood-stabilizer treatment. Standard antidepressant medications do not appear to add statistically significant benefit beyond that of mood stabilizers alone.

### Expanded treatment options and addressing unmet needs in the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder [^1127zhQT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder presents on a spectrum, with bipolar depression at one end and bipolar I on the other, and a host of other presentations in between. In addition to its many permutations and the difficulty of differentiating between diagnoses, comorbidities, incorrect treatment, and low self-report contribute to delayed diagnoses and inappropriate or delayed treatment. Once a diagnosis is reached, the latest evidence of the safety and efficacy profiles of existing and emerging treatments adds to the complexity when developing treatment strategies for patients with bipolar disorder.

As guidelines are updated and new treatments become available, developing individualized treatment regimens is key. Collaboration between clinician, patient, and family is critical in optimizing patient outcomes. New treatment options can reduce some of the side effect burdens associated with treating bipolar disorder, and clinicians should use measurement-based care to assess whether treatment changes are necessary. This requires engaging with the patient to monitor efficacy and manage side effects. It is important to ensure that the patient and family understand the information to foster informed decision-making and create a better therapeutic alliance.

Involving patients in designing their own treatment strategies according to their tolerability criteria can help combat the 90% nonadherence rate, and ultimately lead to better patient care.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: Rational pragmatic approaches to management [^111P5Vu8]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The evidence for the efficacy of many currently available treatments for bipolar disorder is based on studies of non-refractory patients. Therefore, most treatment recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder and its many comorbidities heavily depend on data from placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs). However, these RCTs provide little direction for clinicians regarding optimal steps for non- or partial-responders and those with ongoing medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Given this, along with the paucity of RCTs at later treatment stages, we found it appropriate to begin discussing the quality of data that some experts in the field might consider when choosing and sequencing drugs and their combinations.

We acknowledge that many other clinical investigators might prefer different sequences, but the suggestions offered here could be useful to some clinicians in the field, might initiate discussions of other options in the literature, and provide a preliminary outline for new, much-needed clinical trials to better inform clinical practice. Given the wide range of quality in the data and clinical principles on which these suggestions are based, only minimal references are included. A comprehensive review of the literature supporting each option is beyond the scope of this manuscript.

### Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder: Japanese expert consensus [^117ME6XM]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder have been based on solid evidence to reflect the results of randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. However, these conventional treatment guidelines do not always address challenging situations in the real world because of probable discrepancies between research and clinical settings. Indeed, participants in clinical trials do not necessarily represent patients that physicians usually encounter in clinical practice; strict selection criteria limit generalizability. Furthermore, treatment guidelines often fail to provide clear treatment recommendations on clinically important issues that are nevertheless difficult to examine and for which a high level of evidence is lacking, such as depressive episodes with mixed features.

A consensus guideline by experts in the field may fill this gap in the literature. The Japanese Society of Clinical Neuropsychopharmacology (JSCNP) is the largest academic society in the field of neuropsychopharmacology in Japan. The JSCNP has a board certification system in which psychiatrists are certified as experts in the field based on their academic activities and written examination scores regarding their professional expertise. A total of 277 psychiatrists have been certified as of November 2019. The Medical Education Panel of the society has recently developed an expert consensus guideline for depression. Thus, in this article, we aimed to create an expert consensus guideline regarding the treatment of bipolar disorders I and II (BP-I and BP-II), especially with regard to their clinical management.

### Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder: Japanese expert consensus [^111k89Ti]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Consensus on pharmacological strategy for depressive episodes shows that none of the choices were categorized as a first-line treatment for depressive episodes in elderly patients. Second-line treatments for these episodes included quetiapine monotherapy (6.3 ± 2.3), lithium monotherapy (6.2 ± 2.5), lamotrigine monotherapy (5.9 ± 2.6), a combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic (5.5 ± 2.5), and a combination therapy of lamotrigine and an atypical antipsychotic (5.5 ± 2.3).

Antidepressant use was categorized as a third-line treatment for depressive episodes in BP-I (3.8 ± 2.2) and a second-line treatment in BP-II (4.4 ± 2.3). When the respondents were asked to rate the use of adjunctive antidepressants concomitantly with an ongoing mood stabilizer for persistent depressive episodes, no specific antidepressant was categorized as a first-line treatment for both BP-I and BP-II. Second-line treatments included mirtazapine (5.4 ± 2.6) and escitalopram (5.3 ± 2.7) for BP-I, and escitalopram (5.7 ± 2.7), sertraline (5.5 ± 2.6), and mirtazapine (5.5 ± 2.6) for BP-II.

- **Step 1: Review general principles and assess medication status**: Many agents recommended for the management of acute manic or depressive episodes also have prophylactic efficacy. Generally, medications found effective in the acute phase should continue during the maintenance phase. However, exceptions exist: the efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant therapy has not been systematically examined in large double-blind placebo-controlled trials; thus, long-term antidepressant use is not recommended. This is especially true in light of concerns about the potential risk of manic/hypomanic switches and mood instability. Nevertheless, in subgroups of patients who have responded well to combination treatment and are stable, preliminary evidence suggests that withdrawing antidepressants may lead to destabilization.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that many atypical antipsychotics effectively prevent mood episode relapses. With many agents, this efficacy relates specifically to the prevention of manic, rather than depressive, episodes. However, many of these trials have been conducted in patients with an index manic episode. Since the polarity of an index episode predicts the polarity of relapse, studies found low depressive relapse rates in placebo groups, compromising their statistical power to test the efficacy of these agents in preventing depressive relapses. Consequently, the efficacy of many antipsychotics in preventing depressive relapses remains unknown.

For patients who are not currently receiving or responding to pharmacological treatment…

### Evidence-based guidelines for treating bipolar disorder: Recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^114Lj7Qi]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2003).

The British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines specify the scope and target of treatment for bipolar disorder. They are based explicitly on the available evidence and presented, similar to previous clinical practice guidelines, as recommendations to aid clinical decision-making for practitioners. They may also serve as a source of information for patients and carers. The recommendations are presented together with a more detailed review of the available evidence.

A consensus meeting, involving experts in bipolar disorder and its treatment, reviewed key areas and considered the strength of evidence and clinical implications. The guidelines were drawn up after extensive feedback from participants and interested parties. The strength of supporting evidence was rated. The guidelines cover the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, clinical management, and strategies for the use of medicines in short-term treatment of episodes, relapse prevention, and stopping treatment.

### Challenges in the management of bipolar depression [^111tLRp5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression has only relatively recently started to receive more attention in clinical trials, despite the fact that patients spend more time in the depressed phase than in the manic phase of bipolar disorder. The diagnosis and management of bipolar depression are challenging, and many patients are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to symptom similarities with unipolar depression or other illnesses and/or comorbidities. Untreated or inappropriately treated bipolar depression adds to the burden of illness and is associated with a greater risk of suicide.

Treatment options include lithium, lamotrigine, atypical antipsychotics, and traditional antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, traditional antidepressants are recommended with caution due to their potential risk of switching patients into mania. Some atypical antipsychotics have shown efficacy in bipolar depression, although longer-term studies are warranted.

The choice of treatment for different subgroups of patients with bipolar depression, including those with comorbid anxiety, may vary and also needs further study. Other important issues that require further investigation include the recognition of the core features of bipolar depression and the threshold symptoms for treatment, as well as the optimal treatment choices for monotherapy or combination therapy, and acute versus long-term management of bipolar depression.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^115m8nwC]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

First-line treatments for bipolar disorder are recommended based on evidence for efficacy as monotherapy. Quetiapine (level 1), lithium (level 2), lamotrigine (level 2), and lurasidone (level 2) are all supported by research.

Lurasidone (level 1) and lamotrigine (level 2) are also recommended as first-line adjunctive treatments. Although quetiapine and lithium have not been assessed for efficacy as adjunctive treatments for acute bipolar depression, clinicians may choose to apply this combination for patients stabilized on one of these medications.

- **Summary of evidence**: Recommendations for which first-line treatment should be prioritized are outlined in our hierarchy. We advise trying the agents listed first, unless patient-specific factors demand otherwise, such as previous history of response/non-response or particular clinical features.

For example, if a patient presents with an acute bipolar depressive episode and has not been treated for this episode, starting with quetiapine monotherapy is advised, provided there is no history of non-response or tolerability issues with quetiapine. If a patient had been taking lithium and experienced a breakthrough acute bipolar depres…

The diagnosis and management of bipolar disorder (BD) is complex, and effective, evidence-based care requires knowledge of research as well as insights gained from years of clinical experience. Members of the CANMAT guidelines committee hope this document provides an easy-to-understand narrative of both, thereby aiding specialists and primary care providers in delivering evidence-based care to their patients. As with previous editions of these guidelines, CANMAT strives to provide regular updates capturing emerging trends and evaluating new evidence. Readers are encouraged to consult these updates as they become available to stay current in the field.

### Methodological differences between pharmacological treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder: What to do for the clinicians [^115TLopZ]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The article highlights the main differences between consensus-based guidelines (CBG) and evidence-based guidelines (EBG) available for managing bipolar disorder. Numerous guidelines for bipolar disorder have been published.

- **Objective**: The aim of this article is to underline the main differences between consensus-based guidelines (CBG) and evidence-based guidelines (EBG) currently available for the management of bipolar disorder.

- **Methods**: A literature search for guidelines published since 2006 was performed, followed by a qualitative analysis to compare the methodologies and contents of the guidelines.

- **Results**: A comparison between CBG and EBG found more similarities than differences. However, discordances were noted in the first-line choice of treatment, such as monotherapy or combination and the use of lamotrigine or lithium in bipolar depression. Other differences included time to reassessment, duration of maintenance treatment, the introduction during the acute phase of a regimen compatible with long-term use, and pharmacotherapy during pregnancy.

- **Conclusions**: The choice of policy, regardless of the methodology used, is up to the authors and can depend on their interpretation of the available scientific evidence. Combining both CBG and EBG methodologies enables us to meet the complete definition of evidence-based medicine.
