## Question

Parkinson's diagnosis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing Parkinson's disease using the MDS criteria and related guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core motor syndrome and how to define parkinsonism. Then, I should verify the MDS framework of exclusion criteria, red flags, and supportive features. Next, I will review ancillary tests and when they add value. After that, I need to consider early-stage diagnostic uncertainty and the role of time and follow-up. Finally, I will integrate emerging biomarkers and synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm with counseling points, while double-checking areas of controversy and self-correcting any overstatements as needed.

> Let me first confirm the core motor syndrome. Parkinsonism is defined by bradykinesia plus at least one of rest tremor or rigidity; postural instability is supportive but not required for the core definition, and I should be careful not to over-weight it as a cardinal sign in isolation. Wait, let me verify the asymmetry point: unilateral onset and persistent asymmetry are supportive features rather than core requirements, though they increase diagnostic confidence. I need to ensure I document slowness, decrement with repetition, and the pill-rolling rest tremor pattern, and I should explicitly exclude mimics like essential tremor, drug-induced parkinsonism, or psychogenic movement disorders before proceeding [^114sXRuv] [^115U11L5].

> Next, I should review the MDS diagnostic framework. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the three categories after parkinsonism is established: absolute exclusion criteria that rule out PD, red flags that must be counterbalanced by supportive criteria, and supportive criteria that increase confidence in PD. I should confirm that two levels of certainty are used: clinically established PD for high specificity and clinically probable PD for balanced sensitivity and specificity, with explicit rules for how many supportive features offset red flags. Let me verify that the MDS criteria indeed outperform UK Brain Bank criteria in validation studies; yes, MDS criteria show higher sensitivity and specificity against expert clinical diagnosis, which supports their current primacy in clinical practice [^115S9oEB].

> I will now examine absolute exclusion criteria and red flags, and I need to ensure I do not misclassify them. Absolute exclusions include things like cerebellar signs, early falls within 3 years, early bulbar dysfunction, and vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, which should prompt me to reconsider atypical parkinsonism rather than PD. Red flags include rapid progression, early severe autonomic failure, and poor levodopa response; if present, I should balance them with supportive features to maintain diagnostic confidence. But wait, what if early cognitive impairment or hallucinations appear? I should double-check the MDS stance: early dementia is not an absolute exclusion, though it raises concern for DLB and should be contextualized with the 1-year rule and supportive features before finalizing the diagnosis [^116dJSCJ] [^113WS4vW].

> Let me consider supportive criteria carefully. I should confirm that a robust levodopa response, typically defined as greater than 30% improvement in UPDRS III, is supportive, and that levodopa-induced dyskinesias are highly specific for PD. Unilateral rest tremor, olfactory dysfunction, and cardiac sympathetic denervation on MIBG also add weight. Hold on, I should verify the role of acute levodopa or apomorphine testing; while a positive test supports PD, guidelines caution against routine use for diagnosis due to limited evidence and availability, so I should reserve it for uncertain cases and interpret cautiously [^116rF1w8] [^115rR4sJ] [^111qx6pk] [^112MmwBW].

> Next, I should review ancillary investigations and when they meaningfully change management. Let me first confirm that structural MRI is recommended early to exclude secondary causes and to look for atypical patterns such as MSA or PSP, with susceptibility and diffusion sequences as appropriate. I need to check the role of DaT SPECT; it can help when the diagnosis of parkinsonism is uncertain or to distinguish degenerative parkinsonism from essential tremor, but it does not differentiate PD from atypical parkinsonism. FDG-PET can aid in atypical syndromes when MRI is inconclusive, and cardiac MIBG may help differentiate PD from MSA when available. Transcranial sonography can show hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra, but I should remember it requires expertise and has limited specificity, so I should not over-interpret a positive result in isolation [^114e6Gtj] [^112oZoPc] [^116K7PDb] [^117Dehsn].

> I should double-check the role of genetics. Genetic testing is not routine for all, but I need to consider it in young-onset cases, those with a strong family history, or when phenotype suggests a monogenic form. Let me verify that guidelines endorse individualized genetic testing in specialist clinics with counseling; yes, that is the recommended approach rather than broad, unselected testing [^111ctBvp] [^115mDb3x].

> Now, I need to address early diagnostic uncertainty and the value of time. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of improvement with longitudinal follow-up; German guideline data show that diagnostic accuracy rises from about 53% at less than 5 years to over 85% after more than 5 years, and the presence of motor fluctuations or dyskinesias further increases confidence. I should confirm that Canadian guidance explicitly recommends long-term, regular follow-up to review the diagnosis and treatment response, especially in the first 5 years. This means I should communicate uncertainty early, document baseline features, and plan reassessment to refine the diagnosis over time [^116ygC7T] [^111JkEdd] [^116gyKBw].

> Let me integrate emerging biomarkers and biological definitions, but I must be cautious. Alpha-synuclein seed amplification assays and the SynNeurGe framework represent important advances, yet they remain primarily research tools pending standardization and validation. I should confirm that expert consensus advises against routine clinical use of fluid biomarkers at this time, so these tests should not replace clinical criteria in everyday practice. Still, I need to keep an eye on evolving evidence, as biological classification may soon complement clinical diagnosis in select scenarios [^111iH87Z] [^114phPtJ] [^116ZbN24].

> I will now synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm, but let me first confirm the sequence. Start with a careful history and examination to establish parkinsonism, then apply MDS criteria with explicit scoring of exclusions, red flags, and supportive features to assign probable versus established PD. If uncertainty persists, use ancillary tests judiciously: MRI for structural clues, DaT SPECT to confirm presynaptic dopaminergic deficit when needed, and MIBG or FDG-PET selectively. Throughout, plan longitudinal follow-up to capture evolving supportive features or red flags, and adjust the diagnosis accordingly. I should confirm that this approach aligns with MDS and German Society guidance, which it does [^116dJSCJ] [^113yTjcv] [^114e6Gtj].

> But wait, what about counseling patients when certainty is limited? I need to ensure I communicate that early clinical diagnosis has imperfect accuracy, especially in the first few years, and that we will revisit the diagnosis as new features emerge. I should confirm that guidelines emphasize acknowledging this uncertainty to set appropriate expectations and to guide management decisions, including when to initiate symptomatic therapy and how to monitor for atypical evolution [^116gyKBw] [^111JkEdd] [^11218CeJ].

> Finally, I should review key controversies and self-correct where needed. Initially, I thought early dementia might be an absolute exclusion, but wait, I should verify the MDS position. The MDS criteria do not treat early dementia as an absolute exclusion, though it is a red flag that must be balanced by supportive features and careful longitudinal assessment. I also briefly considered whether acute levodopa testing should be routine. Hold on, I should verify guideline recommendations again — routine drug challenge tests are not recommended due to limited evidence, so I will reserve them for selected uncertain cases. These course corrections ensure my diagnostic approach remains aligned with current standards [^116rF1w8] [^113WS4vW] [^112MmwBW].

Parkinson's disease is diagnosed clinically by identifying **bradykinesia plus rest tremor or rigidity** [^116dJSCJ], with **asymmetric onset** and a **good levodopa response** strengthening confidence [^11218CeJ]. The MDS clinical criteria are the current standard [^111qx6pk], categorizing diagnosis as clinically established or probable based on supportive features and exclusion of red flags or absolute exclusions [^116dJSCJ]. Ancillary tests — DaT SPECT [^112oZoPc], MRI [^1176Dsr8], olfaction, and polysomnography — are used when the diagnosis is uncertain or to exclude atypical parkinsonism [^114e6Gtj] [^1133Jn1U]. Early diagnosis is challenging [^116gyKBw], and **long-term follow-up** improves accuracy [^116ygC7T]; genetic testing is considered for young-onset or familial cases [^111ctBvp] [^115mDb3x].

---

## Clinical diagnostic criteria

The **MDS clinical diagnostic criteria** are the current gold standard [^notfound], providing a structured approach to diagnosis [^116dJSCJ]:

- **Core motor features**: Bradykinesia plus at least one of rest tremor or rigidity [^11218CeJ].
- **Supportive features**: Asymmetric onset, good levodopa response, levodopa-induced dyskinesias, olfactory dysfunction, and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) [^115rR4sJ].
- **Exclusion criteria**: Absolute exclusions and red flags (e.g. early falls, rapid progression, early severe autonomic dysfunction) that must be balanced against supportive features [^116rF1w8].

---

## Clinical features and diagnostic markers

Motor symptoms include bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity, and postural instability [^115U11L5]; **non-motor symptoms** include hyposmia, constipation, depression, anxiety, and autonomic dysfunction [^116esXBb]. Supportive diagnostic markers include a positive levodopa response, olfactory testing, polysomnography for RBD, and cardiac MIBG scintigraphy [^115rR4sJ] [^1133Jn1U].

---

## Ancillary diagnostic tests

Ancillary tests are used to support the clinical diagnosis, particularly in **atypical presentations**:

| **Test** | **Role in diagnosis** |
|-|-|
| DaT SPECT | Differentiates PD from essential tremor and other non-degenerative parkinsonism [^112oZoPc] [^116K7PDb] |
| MRI | Excludes structural lesions and atypical parkinsonism (MSA, PSP, CBD) [^117BjtHJ] [^114e6Gtj] |
| Olfactory testing | Supports diagnosis, particularly in early PD [^117Dehsn] |
| Polysomnography | Detects RBD, a strong supportive feature [^1133Jn1U] |
| Genetic testing | Considered in young-onset or familial cases [^111ctBvp] [^115mDb3x] |

---

## Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis includes **atypical parkinsonism** (MSA, PSP, CBD) [^115sgdFT], **essential tremor**, drug-induced Parkinsonism, and vascular Parkinsonism [^113iM52o]. Accurate differentiation relies on clinical features, imaging, and response to levodopa [^116rF1w8].

---

## Challenges and limitations

Early diagnosis is challenging due to **overlapping symptoms** and the lack of definitive biomarkers [^1176Dsr8] [^115P1tR7]; misdiagnosis is common, especially in early disease [^113EouEM]. Long-term follow-up and reassessment improve diagnostic accuracy [^116ygC7T].

---

## Recent advances and emerging biomarkers

Recent advances include the development of **alpha-synuclein seeding assays** [^115kpyEM], **dopamine transporter imaging**, and **genetic testing** [^117BjtHJ]. These biomarkers are promising but require further validation before routine clinical use [^114phPtJ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend using the **MDS clinical criteria** [^1132ScVM], incorporating supportive features, and excluding red flags or absolute exclusions [^116dJSCJ]. Long-term follow-up and reassessment are emphasized to improve diagnostic accuracy [^116ygC7T] [^113yTjcv].

---

Parkinson's disease diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by ancillary tests and guided by the **MDS criteria** [^116dJSCJ]. Early diagnosis is challenging, but recent advances in biomarkers and imaging are improving diagnostic accuracy [^116ZbN24].

### Definition and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^112QXzrP]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate definition and operational criteria for diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD) are crucial for evidence-based, patient-centered care.

Objective

To offer evidence-based recommendations for defining and diagnosing PD, incorporating contemporary clinical, imaging, biomarker, and genetic insights.

Methods

The guideline development began with the steering committee establishing key PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcome) questions, which were refined by the coauthors. Systematic literature searches identified relevant studies, reviews, and meta-analyses. Recommendations were drafted, evaluated, optimized, and voted upon by the German Parkinson's Guideline Group.

Results

Parkinson's disease (PD) is now understood to encompass a broader spectrum of etiologies than previously recognized. Advances in molecular pathogenesis, neuroimaging, and early clinical phenotypes suggest that PD is not a uniform disease entity and is often not idiopathic. This necessitates an updated framework for PD definition and diagnosis. The German Society for Neurology now endorses a broader concept of PD, incorporating both idiopathic and hereditary forms, as opposed to the previously narrower concept of "idiopathic Parkinson syndrome". The revised guidelines recommend using the 2015 Movement Disorders Society diagnostic criteria, emphasize the importance of long-term clinical follow-up for improved diagnostic accuracy, and highlight the significance of non-motor symptoms in clinical diagnosis. Specific recommendations are provided for the use of imaging and fluid biomarkers and genetic testing to support the clinical diagnosis.

Conclusion

The updated guidelines from the German Society for Neurology enhance diagnostic accuracy for PD, promoting optimized clinical care.

### Early recognition and diagnosis of parkinson disease and ongoing assessments [^114wS9vS]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is diagnosed when patients meet motor symptom criteria (bradykinesia plus tremor or rigidity). However, patients may demonstrate prodromal nonmotor symptoms 5–20 years prior to diagnosis. While motor symptoms are of concern, patients often consider nonmotor symptoms to be just as bothersome. In this brief CME activity, diagnostic criteria and assessment tools are described.

Regarding medical management for Parkinson's disease, more specifically with respect to management of depression, CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend to set a low threshold for diagnosing depression in patients with PD. Recognize that there are difficulties in diagnosing mild depression in patients with PD, as the clinical features of depression overlap with the motor features of Parkinson disease.

### Parkinson's disease: clinical features and diagnosis [^116esXBb]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterised by a large number of motor and non-motor features that can impact on function to a variable degree. This review describes the clinical characteristics of PD with emphasis on those features that differentiate the disease from other parkinsonian disorders.

Methods

A MedLine search was performed to identify studies that assess the clinical characteristics of PD. Search terms included "Parkinson's disease", "diagnosis" and "signs and symptoms".

Results

Because there is no definitive test for the diagnosis of PD, the disease must be diagnosed based on clinical criteria. Rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and loss of postural reflexes are generally considered the cardinal signs of PD. The presence and specific presentation of these features are used to differentiate PD from related parkinsonian disorders. Other clinical features include secondary motor symptoms (eg, hypomimia, dysarthria, dysphagia, sialorrhoea, micrographia, shuffling gait, festination, freezing, dystonia, glabellar reflexes), non-motor symptoms (eg, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive/neurobehavioral abnormalities, sleep disorders and sensory abnormalities such as anosmia, paresthesias and pain). Absence of rest tremor, early occurrence of gait difficulty, postural instability, dementia, hallucinations, and the presence of dysautonomia, ophthalmoparesis, ataxia and other atypical features, coupled with poor or no response to levodopa, suggest diagnoses other than PD.

Conclusions

A thorough understanding of the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of PD is essential to the proper diagnosis of the disease. Genetic mutations or variants, neuroimaging abnormalities and other tests are potential biomarkers that may improve diagnosis and allow the identification of persons at risk.

### Time to redefine PD? Introductory statement of the MDS task force on the definition of Parkinson's disease [^116TqPRB]. Movement Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Defending the Status Quo

Regardless of the dramatic differences in clinical manifestations, most patients with PD have a characteristic pathologic substrate, suggesting that a unifying diagnosis is appropriate. Moreover, many other diseases have dramatic differences in clinical severity and manifestations.
Current subtypes may not impact much upon disease course. Some studies find that tremor has little effect on prognosis. Where there are differences, there are potential confounds, including diagnostic sensitivity (tremor-dominant patients are diagnosed earlier, so prognosis appears better for disease duration), or misdiagnosis (patients misdiagnosed as tremor-predominant PD have relatively benign alternate diagnoses, such as essential tremor, versus akinetic-rigid syndrome alternate diagnoses, such as MSA or PSP). Age is continuous, and defining robust cutoffs is not simple. For example, young cutoffs (e.g. < 40) help identify genetic mutations, but represent only a small proportion of PD patients (< 1%). Criteria for "old-onset" PD may also be needed, because older patients have worse prognosis, higher mortality, more dementia, and more mixed pathology. Finally, current age, rather than onset age, may be the critical factor influencing disease manifestations.

Moving Forward

In summary, there is no doubt that PD has considerable heterogeneity in clinical presentation and prognosis. The task force proposes the following:

Clinical subtypes should only be delineated if there are clear data that demonstrate consistent, large differences in prognosis, predicted disease manifestations, or treatment. Currently, it is unclear whether any of the current subtype classifications qualify.
The search for subtypes should not be restricted to clinical features, but should include subtypes of molecular pathogenesis.

### Non-motor parkinson' s: integral to motor parkinson' s, yet often neglected [^117XYiTf]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

What are the non-motor symptoms of PD?

James Parkinson referred to sleep disturbance, constipation, dysarthria, dysphonia, dysphagia, sialorrhoea, urinary incontinence and 'at the last, constant sleepiness with slight delirium' in his essay. The widespread neuropathology of PD gives a wide range of symptoms from gastrointestinal to sleep disorders, from cognitive to apathy and depression. In addition, some symptoms relate to drug therapy. It is thus difficult to 'lump' non-motor symptoms into a single category, and we suggest the following classification:
Related to the disease process or pathophysiology Dopaminergic origin Non-dopaminergic origin
Related to a partial non-motor origin (usually brainstem autonomic impairment with motor end result, such as constipation or diplopia)
Related to non-motor fluctuations (cognitive, autonomic and sensory subtypes) Fluctuating Constant
Related to PD drug therapy Specific symptoms (eg, hallucinations, delirium) Syndromes — impulse control disorders, dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome, Parkinson's hyperpyrexia syndrome (thermoregulatory failure, delirium)
Possibly genetically determined Dementia in cases with glucocerebrosidase mutation Depression and sleep disorders in cases with leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 mutation

Some symptoms may overlap: for instance, hallucination as part of the advancing disease, or non-motor fluctuations in PD.

While some non-motor symptoms dominate in the early or even in the 'premotor' phase of PD, others complicate the clinical picture throughout the disease (pain, fatigue) and especially in its advanced stages (dementia, apathy, dysautonomia), as shown in the Sydney multicentre study report at 20 years. The 'Parkinson's at risk syndrome' study tries to identify the premotor non-motor risk factors for developing the motor syndrome of PD. There is now also an attempt to redefine PD, moving away from the typical brain bank-defined motor diagnostic criteria.

PD can be divided into a preclinical phase (supported by molecular or imaging markers), a premotor phase (with non-motor symptoms, table 2) and the motor phase, the 'tip of the iceberg'. The key is to develop robust biomarkers and also to define the specific predictive value of the premotor non-motor symptoms. Table 2 shows examples of non-motor symptoms reported in the premotor stage.

### A biological classification of Parkinson's disease: the synNeurGe research diagnostic criteria [^111iH87Z]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

With the hope that disease-modifying treatments could target the molecular basis of Parkinson's disease, even before the onset of symptoms, we propose a biologically based classification. Our classification acknowledges the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease by use of a three-component system (SynNeurGe): presence or absence of pathological α-synuclein (S) in tissues or CSF; evidence of underlying neurodegeneration (N) defined by neuroimaging procedures; and documentation of pathogenic gene variants (G) that cause or strongly predispose to Parkinson's disease. These three components are linked to a clinical component (C), defined either by a single high-specificity clinical feature or by multiple lower-specificity clinical features. The use of a biological classification will enable advances in both basic and clinical research, and move the field closer to the precision medicine required to develop disease-modifying therapies. We emphasise the initial application of these criteria exclusively for research. We acknowledge its ethical implications, its limitations, and the need for prospective validation in future studies.

### An update on the diagnosis and treatment of parkinson disease [^1113h86w]. CMAJ (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Parkinson's disease:

- **Definition**: PD is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive and autonomic dysfunction, as well as mood and impulse control disorders.
- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of PD is unknown; however, a combination of genetic and environmental factors have been implicated. Advancing age (> 65 years), male gender, genetics (LRRK2, glucocerebrosidase, and Parkin mutation), industrial exposure, heavy metals (manganese, copper, and lead), pesticides (rotenone, paraquat), and obstructive sleep apnea increase the risk of PD.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of PD in the US is estimated at 9.5–10.3 cases per 100,000 person-years, while its prevalence is estimated at 81 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: In patients with PD, premature selective loss of dopamine neurons and accumulation of Lewy bodies causes the classical motor manifestations of parkinsonism (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability), as well as autonomic dysfunction, cognitive dysfunction, and mood and impulse control disorders.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Patients with PD have 2.56-fold increased risk of mortality than similar age-matched individuals.

### Validation of the MDS clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease [^115S9oEB]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In 2015, the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society published clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease. These criteria aimed to codify/reproduce the expert clinical diagnostic process and to help standardize diagnosis in research and clinical settings. Their accuracy compared with expert clinical diagnosis has not been tested. The objectives of this study were to validate the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society diagnostic criteria against a gold standard of expert clinical diagnosis, and to compare concordance/accuracy of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society criteria to 1988 United Kingdom Brain Bank criteria.

Methods

From 8 centers, we recruited 626 parkinsonism patients (434 PD, 192 non-PD). An expert neurologist diagnosed each patient as having PD or non-PD, regardless of International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society criteria (gold standard, clinical diagnosis). Then a second neurologist evaluated the presence/absence of each individual item from the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society criteria. The overall accuracy/concordance rate, sensitivity, and specificity of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society criteria compared with the expert gold standard were calculated.

Results

Of 434 patients diagnosed with PD, 94.5% met the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society criteria for probable PD (5.5% false-negative rate). Of 192 non-PD patients, 88.5% were identified as non-PD by the criteria (11.5% false-positive rate). The overall accuracy for probable PD was 92.6%. In addition, 59.3% of PD patients and only 1.6% of non-PD patients met the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society criteria for clinically established PD. In comparison, United Kingdom Brain Bank criteria had lower sensitivity (89.2%, P = 0.008), specificity (79.2%, P = 0.018), and overall accuracy (86.4%, P < 0.001). Diagnostic accuracy did not differ according to age or sex. Specificity improved as disease duration increased.

Conclusions

The International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society criteria demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity compared with the gold standard, expert diagnosis, with sensitivity and specificity both higher than United Kingdom Brain Bank criteria. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### An update on Parkinson's disease: improving patient outcomes [^113GWsph]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Neurologists are faced with many challenges in caring for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). This chronic, long-term illness that affects at least one million people in the United States requires a coordinated healthcare partnership between the physician and the patient. The importance of early diagnosis is essential to delaying disease progression and early diagnosis and intervention may be aided by recent advances in biomarkers, genomics, and imaging. A misdiagnosis or late diagnosis will lead to deteriorating patient health. Additionally, physicians should incorporate current guidelines into their treatment strategies, and awareness of the reasoning behind these guidelines is critical for appropriate use. Physicians should be up to date on identifying the most appropriate therapies based on emerging science and disease staging, and should implement patient education into their practice. Due to limitations for currently available therapies, adjunctive therapies may lead to improved outcomes in patients with PD. The use of multiple therapies can improve myriad symptoms, more so than a monotherapy. Knowledge of these therapies is critical to achieving best outcomes in patients with PD. This webcast will discuss the current challenges with PD clinical practice, clinical features of PD, the impact of treatment, future treatments for PD and improving patient outcomes.

### Definition and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^117PECFx]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease

The term PD can be used both in the presence of a clinically established Parkinson syndrome and in the context of specific symptom constellations that indicate the future development of a Parkinson syndrome, such as premotor or prodromal PD. In the vast majority of cases, PD is non-inheritable and referred to as "sporadic PD". Sporadic PD is a Lewy body disease that results in a Parkinson syndrome. In rare cases, mutations (e.g. in the genes SNCA, LRRK2, and GBA1) can be identified, which are then classified as "hereditary Parkinson syndromes". Parkinson syndromes associated with mutations in other genes (e.g. VPS35, DJ1, PARKIN, and PINK1) typically do not exhibit the typical histopathological features of Lewy body disease. Hereditary PD should be reported with the specific nomenclature recommended by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force (e.g. PARK- VPS35) (Table 2).

Preclinical PD is defined as Lewy body disease in a very early stage that does not yet exhibit obvious motor or non-motor clinical signs (Table 2).

Premotor PD is characterized by Lewy body disease in an early stage that, at the time of examination, only presents non-motor symptoms, such as REM sleep behavior disorder, olfactory dysfunction, and/or depression (Table 2).

Prodromal PD refers to Lewy body disease in an early stage that, at the time of examination, exhibits non-motor symptoms and only mild-motor symptoms but does not yet meet the criteria for the diagnosis of classical Parkinson syndrome (Table 2).

PD with dementia (PDD) is defined as advanced-stage Lewy body disease accompanied by a neurocognitive disorder occurring more than 1 year after the manifestation of motor symptoms of PD (Table 2).

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is defined as Lewy body disease primarily presenting as a neurocognitive disorder, with the onset preceding or following the appearance of motor symptoms of PD by less than 1 year. Neuropathological examination of DLB typically reveals higher stages of Alzheimer-associated changes (amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) compared to pure PDD (Table 2).

The term Lewy body dementia refers to all types of dementia associated with Lewy body disease (i.e. an umbrella term for PDD and DLB) (Table 2).

### The prediagnostic phase of Parkinson's disease [^117Rr8wt]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The field of prediagnostic Parkinson's disease (PD) is fast moving with an expanding range of clinical and laboratory biomarkers, and multiple strategies seeking to discover those in the earliest stages or those 'at risk'. It is widely believed that the highest likelihood of securing neuroprotective benefit from drugs will be in these subjects, preceding current point of diagnosis of PD. In this review, we outline current knowledge of the prediagnostic phase of PD, including an up-to-date review of risk factors (genetic and environmental), their relative influence, and clinical features that occur prior to diagnosis. We discuss imaging markers across a range of modalities, and the emerging literature on fluid and peripheral tissue biomarkers. We then explore current initiatives to identify individuals at risk or in the earliest stages that might be candidates for future clinical trials, what we are learning from these initiatives, and how these studies will bring the field closer to realistically commencing primary or secondary preventive trials for PD. Further progress in this field hinges on greater clinical and biological description, and understanding of the prediagnostic, peridiagnostic and immediate postdiagnostic stages of PD. Identifying subjects 3–5 years before they are currently diagnosed may be an ideal group for neuroprotective trials. At the very least, these initiatives will help clarify the stage before and around diagnosis, enabling the field to push into unchartered territory at the earliest stages of disease.

### Changing the research criteria for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: obstacles and opportunities [^1121mPRm]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Recent findings question our present understanding of Parkinson's disease and suggest that new research criteria for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease are needed, similar to those recently defined in Alzheimer's disease. However, our ability to redefine Parkinson's disease is hampered by its complexity and heterogeneity in genetics, phenotypes, and underlying molecular mechanisms; the absence of biochemical markers or ability to image Parkinson's disease-specific histopathological changes; the long prodromal period during which non-motor manifestations might precede classic motor manifestations; and uncertainty about the status of disorders diagnosed clinically as Parkinson's disease but without Lewy pathology. Although it is too early to confidently redefine Parkinson's disease, the time has come to establish a research framework that could lead to new diagnostic criteria. We propose the establishment of three tiers encompassing clinical features, pathological findings, and genetics or molecular mechanisms. Specific advances in each tier, bridged by neuroimaging and biochemical data, will eventually lead to a redefinition of Parkinson's disease.

Figure 1
Simplified model of how the type of cortical pathology and clinical presentation of PDD and DLB might interact. Dementia in DLB/PD is associated with two major pathologies: synucleinopathy (i.e. Parkinson pathology) and neuritic amyloidopathy (i.e. Alzheimer pathology). In PD patients who develop dementia very late in their illness, or not at all (far left), neuritic amyloid deposition is minimal (or absent), and cortical pathology is mainly that of α-Syn deposition. At the other extreme, DLB patients with predominant neuritic amyloid deposition and very minimal α-Syn deposition would usually be diagnosed as AD during life, developing clinical DLB hallmarks late (if at all). Between these two extremes of the spectrum lie the most patients with PD and DLB. This hypothetical spectrum is not meant to be exclusive — other factors may also be important in determining dementia onset (e.g. "top down" vs. "bottom up" α-Syn deposition, degree of vascular pathology, and so on).

Therefore, the task force proposes the following:

Consider omitting the "1-year" rule, which separates PDD and DLB. Rather, when a patient presents with motor signs and meets full clinical criteria for PD, the diagnosis of PD is applied, regardless of presence or timing of dementia. In other words, dementia is no longer an exclusion criterion for PD. For those patients who already carry a DLB diagnosis (according to consensus criteria), the diagnosis can optionally be qualified as "PD (DLB subtype)".

Note that this proposal would not invalidate the diagnostic category of DLB. In clinical communication with patients with the DLB subtype, the diagnostic term DLB could continue to be used. Moreover, the classification of patients with DLB diagnosis who do not have parkinsonism, or whose parkinsonism does not not meet PD criteria (e.g. no response to dopaminergic medications), would not be affected by this definition change.

### Definition and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^113CXk7N]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosing a chronic (neurodegenerative) disease like PD often causes uncertainty and anxieties about the future for patients and their families, who seek reliable information regarding prognosis and treatment options. These decisions can influence significant life choices such as living arrangements and therapeutic limitations. Furthermore, predicting disease progression is crucial for healthcare providers in selecting both pharmacological and supportive therapies. It is also of scientific interest in defining outcome and prognostic parameters. PD is a heterogeneous disease with various subtypes, traditionally classified based on purely motor criteria (including akinetic-rigid and tremor-dominant types), but increasingly incorporating non-motor symptoms.

### Time to redefine PD? Introductory statement of the MDS task force on the definition of Parkinson's disease [^114nkqzT]. Movement Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Moving Forward

Regardless of the caveats listed above, there is little question that many patients have a preclinical/prodromal stage of their disease, which should be incorporated in the definition of PD. The task force proposes the following:

Clinical diagnosis of classic PD should remain centered on a motor syndrome. Separate research-based criteria should be developed to allow diagnosis of early PD stages.
For delineation of early stages, disease should be classified as "preclinical" and "prodromal". Preclinical refers to the presence of neurodegenerative synucleinopathy without clinical symptoms (i.e. defined by biomarkers; note that this stage cannot be currently diagnosed because reliable biomarkers are not available). Prodromal refers to the presence of early symptoms and signs before the classical PD diagnosis is possible. This prodromal term makes no assumptions about the order in which motor versus nonmotor symptoms develop.
Because one cannot determine whether any patient with prodromal neurodegenerative synucleinopathy will eventually progress to full clinical PD, the definition of prodromal PD should center upon the likelihood of a neurodegenerative synucleinopathy being present, regardless of "conversion rate" to full clinical PD.
Although PD, by definition, passes inevitably through some type of prodromal phase, there are currently no 100% reliable means to identify prodromal PD. Therefore, diagnostic criteria for prodromal PD will necessarily be probabilistic. We propose two levels of certainty. Probable prodromal PD would refer to a high likelihood (e.g. > 80%; sufficiently certain for neuroprotective trials). Possible prodromal PD would refer to a lower, but still substantial, likelihood of neurodegenerative synucleinopathy (e.g. 30%-80%).
Prodromal PD criteria should incorporate clinical motor markers, clinical nonmotor markers, and nonclinical biomarkers. Inclusion of a marker into prodromal criteria should generally require prospective studies documenting predictive value for full clinical PD. Markers should be divided into categories of specificity, such that high specificity markers carry more weight than those with lower specificity. Criteria should also incorporate risk, adjusting probability estimates for persons with documented high-risk states (e.g. carriers of genetic mutations).

### Time to redefine PD? Introductory statement of the MDS task force on the definition of Parkinson's disease [^116LE5dQ]. Movement Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

How then might future diagnostic criteria look? In developing criteria, some key aspects must be considered:

Clear definition of the motor syndrome: If the motor syndrome remains central to diagnosis, parkinsonism itself must be clearly defined. Several large-scale studies have documented mild parkinsonian syndromes in 25% to 50% of elderly persons without clinical features of PD–or α-Syn deposition; these must be distinguished from PD. Moreover, thresholds must be delineated to define parkinsonism "conversion" from prodromal stages.
Clinical expert as benchmark: 75% to 95% of patients diagnosed by experts during life have PD confirmed on autopsy, and more recent studies usually find better accuracy. Of note, experienced clinicians may diagnose PD with even greater accuracy than formal diagnostic criteria, perhaps because clinicians interpret exclusion criteria in context. If clinical expert opinion is the gold-standard diagnostic technique in life, then diagnostic criteria should attempt to codify the diagnostic process of an expert clinician. Criteria should systematize this process, so that it can be reproducible between clinicians (essential in research studies) and applied by clinicians with less expertise.
Diversity of criteria types: Imitating the diagnostic process of an experienced clinician involves incorporating numerous factors. First, clinicians assess both negative features that argue against PD and positive features that argue for PD. Second, not all features are of equal weight. Some negative features are so specific that they are incompatible with PD. Other features suggest a possible alternate cause, but are insufficient by themselves to preclude diagnosis. Third, rather than following a "recipe" to make diagnoses, experienced clinicians allow for flexibility in application of exclusion criteria, particularly if there are clear extenuating circumstances or complex situations that alter the significance of a criterion.
Time: Diagnostic accuracy increases with time; early in disease progression, response to treatment is less defined, and hallmarks of other neurodegenerative diseases may not have emerged. Also, some "atypical" features are incompatible with diagnosis early in disease, but may be a late feature in otherwise typical PD.
Grades of certainty: Overemphasis on avoiding false-positive diagnoses means missing many patients with true disease, whereas overemphasis on detecting all PD patients leads to false-positive diagnoses. The importance of false negatives versus false positives varies according to the purpose for which criteria are applied. For example, in a randomized, clinical trial, ensuring high specificity of PD diagnosis is key, and incorrect exclusion of true PD cases is arguably less critical (although excessive exclusion creates generalizability bias). By contrast, for natural history studies and epidemiologic research, diagnostic specificity and generalizability are both critical; one must balance false positives and false negatives.
Ancillary testing: Currently, PD diagnoses are generally made clinically, without requiring additional diagnostic tests. Any criteria should be applicable across a broad range of settings, and demanding specific ancillary diagnostic testing reduces generalizability and utility of the criteria. However, in certain contexts, ancillary diagnostic testing is used, particularly in resolving uncertain cases. Moreover, as knowledge advances, diagnostic biochemical markers, neuroimaging, or means to document α-Syn deposition may become clinically available.

### Parkinson's disease [^114fQggC]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder with evolving layers of complexity. It has long been characterised by the classical motor features of parkinsonism associated with Lewy bodies and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. However, the symptomatology of Parkinson's disease is now recognised as heterogeneous, with clinically significant non-motor features. Similarly, its pathology involves extensive regions of the nervous system, various neurotransmitters, and protein aggregates other than just Lewy bodies. The cause of Parkinson's disease remains unknown, but risk of developing Parkinson's disease is no longer viewed as primarily due to environmental factors. Instead, Parkinson's disease seems to result from a complicated interplay of genetic and environmental factors affecting numerous fundamental cellular processes. The complexity of Parkinson's disease is accompanied by clinical challenges, including an inability to make a definitive diagnosis at the earliest stages of the disease and difficulties in the management of symptoms at later stages. Furthermore, there are no treatments that slow the neurodegenerative process. In this Seminar, we review these complexities and challenges of Parkinson's disease.

### Improving the diagnostic accuracy in parkinsonism: a three-pronged approach [^111hCC2K]. Practical Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Separating Parkinson's disease from the various causes of atypical parkinsonism (AP) is a common and clinically relevant challenge in clinical practice. Distinguishing between the different causes of AP is even more difficult. Here the authors discuss a systematic, clinically based and three-pronged approach that can assist clinicians in establishing the correct diagnosis in the consulting room. The three consecutive steps include: (1) to verify that the clinical syndrome truly represents parkinsonism (hypokinetic-rigid syndrome); (2) to search systematically for 'red flags' (alarm signs that may signal the presence of AP); and (3) to integrate these two steps, as a basis for a narrow differential diagnosis and a guide for further ancillary tests.

### Parkinson disease [^112CsPQp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Parkinson disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive motor and nonmotor disability. It is diagnosed clinically and requires a detailed history and neurologic examination to exclude alternative diagnoses. Although disease-modifying therapies do not exist for Parkinson disease, effective symptomatic therapies, including dopaminergic medications and surgery, allow patients to maintain good quality of life for many years. Nonmotor symptoms, including mood, cognitive, sleep, autonomic, and gastrointestinal symptoms, should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians. Recent advances include new diagnostic criteria from the Movement Disorder Society and the addition of new symptomatic therapies for treating motor complications and nonmotor symptoms in advanced disease.

### Parkinson's disease [^114sXRuv]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Parkinson's disease is a recognisable clinical syndrome with a range of causes and clinical presentations. Parkinson's disease represents a fast-growing neurodegenerative condition; the rising prevalence worldwide resembles the many characteristics typically observed during a pandemic, except for an infectious cause. In most populations, 3–5% of Parkinson's disease is explained by genetic causes linked to known Parkinson's disease genes, thus representing monogenic Parkinson's disease, whereas 90 genetic risk variants collectively explain 16–36% of the heritable risk of non-monogenic Parkinson's disease. Additional causal associations include having a relative with Parkinson's disease or tremor, constipation, and being a non-smoker, each at least doubling the risk of Parkinson's disease. The diagnosis is clinically based; ancillary testing is reserved for people with an atypical presentation. Current criteria define Parkinson's disease as the presence of bradykinesia combined with either rest tremor, rigidity, or both. However, the clinical presentation is multifaceted and includes many non-motor symptoms. Prognostic counselling is guided by awareness of disease subtypes. Clinically manifest Parkinson's disease is preceded by a potentially long prodromal period. Presently, establishment of prodromal symptoms has no clinical implications other than symptom suppression, although recognition of prodromal parkinsonism will probably have consequences when disease-modifying treatments become available. Treatment goals vary from person to person, emphasising the need for personalised management. There is no reason to postpone symptomatic treatment in people developing disability due to Parkinson's disease. Levodopa is the most common medication used as first-line therapy. Optimal management should start at diagnosis and requires a multidisciplinary team approach, including a growing repertoire of non-pharmacological interventions. At present, no therapy can slow down or arrest the progression of Parkinson's disease, but informed by new insights in genetic causes and mechanisms of neuronal death, several promising strategies are being tested for disease-modifying potential. With the perspective of people with Parkinson's disease as a so-called red thread throughout this Seminar, we will show how personalised management of Parkinson's disease can be optimised.

### Parkinson disease… [^115U11L5]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of Parkinson disease is clinical, and key features include bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. The most common presenting symptom in Parkinson disease is a unilateral resting tremor, often localized to the distal muscles of the hand, causing a pill-rolling motion. Some patients note an internal tremulousness sensation before the manifestation of the pill-rolling tremor. The main diagnostic signs of Parkinson disease are motor symptoms; however, nonmotor symptoms are also common and debilitating. Nonmotor symptoms that often present before motor symptoms include rapid eye movement sleep disorder, depression, constipation, fatigue, and olfactory dysfunction. A large survey of patients with Parkinson disease found that almost all patients reported nonmotor symptoms, with psychiatric symptoms occurring most often. A physical examination should include assessment for decreased spontaneous or uncontrollable movements, tremors, or flat or masked facial expressions.

A gait examination should assess for shuffling gait, stooped posture, en bloc turns, freezing, or postural instability. Bradykinesia, or the overall slowing of movement, includes decreased manual dexterity, shuffling steps, freezing gait, and festinating gait. Misdiagnosis often occurs because of the multiple symptoms associated with Parkinson disease and the notable clinical overlap with other diseases. Careful examination of the tremor can differentiate between Parkinson disease and other causes. Whole hand tremor is usually an essential tremor or it can be attributed to cerebellar causes. Features supporting a diagnosis of Parkinson disease are asymmetric clinical motor presentation, gradual onset, and bradykinesia. Motor symptom response to levodopa also supports the diagnosis. Insidious progression of symptoms and postural instability are hallmarks of later stages of Parkinson disease.

Factors indicating another diagnosis are rapid disease progression, early or symmetric bilateral body involvement, and inadequate response to levodopa. 7 Although upper extremity tremor is the more common presenting symptom in Parkinson disease, the development of lower extremity tremor favors a diagnosis of Parkinson disease over essential tremor. 8, 9 Essential tremor, progressive supranuclear palsy, drug-induced parkinsonism, and Lewy body dementia are often mistaken for Parkinson disease. Pharmacologic Treatment INITIAL DRUG THERAPY SELECTION FOR MOTOR SYMPTOMS Guidelines recommend treating motor symptoms when they impact the functions of daily life or decrease quality of life.

### Parkinson's disease dementia: definitions, guidelines, and research perspectives in diagnosis [^115fALhm]. Annals of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Cognitive impairment is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and involves attentional, executive, visuospatial, and memory dysfunctions. Dementia is more frequently encountered in PD than in age-matched control populations, and whereas operational definitions of Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies have been developed, Parkinson's disease dementia (PD-D) has remained undefined. The Movement Disorder Society developed a task force to define and develop diagnostic guidelines for PD-D. This effort was based on existing descriptive studies with special emphasis on drawing distinction among Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and PD-related cognitive impairment without dementia whenever possible. The second goal was to provide practical diagnostic procedures to diagnose PD-D. This effort emphasized available bedside tools that do not require neuropsychological expertise to administer or interpret. This work recently has been completed, and two primary articles have been published. The suggested clinical diagnostic criteria for PD-D involve four domains and are anchored in core features, associated clinical features, features that make the diagnosis uncertain, and features that are not compatible with the diagnosis of PD-D. When all four criteria are satisfactorily met, probable PD-D is designated; when the first and last criteria are met, but clinical characteristics are atypical or uncertainty factors exist, possible PD-D is designated. Whereas these definitions are operative and subject to change based on future data, they are based on widely available tests. The inclusion criteria can be applied internationally and in multicenter research on treatment interventions, clinicopathological correlations, and studies of cognitive and other nonmotor elements of PD.

### Time to redefine PD? Introductory statement of the MDS task force on the definition of Parkinson's disease [^114WCyXW]. Movement Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Therefore the task force proposes the following:

Formal MDS diagnostic criteria should be created for the diagnosis of clinical PD.
Parkinsonism should remain a core feature of PD, based upon a combination of cardinal manifestations. The criteria should include clear definitions of what constitutes each cardinal manifestation, including explicit instructions for examination.
The benchmark of diagnostic criteria should be the expert clinical examination.
Criteria should incorporate both negative features (that argue against diagnosis) and positive features (that argue for diagnosis).
Criteria should be weighted, so that features that are highly specific for alternate conditions are differentiated from less specific "red flags".
Criteria should incorporate a time component, such that certainty can increase with longer disease duration, and individual diagnostic criteria can be applied differentially in early versus late disease.
Criteria should incorporate different levels of certainty, delineated as "clinical PD" (highly specific, but not necessarily sensitive or representative) and "possible PD" (balancing specificity and sensitivity).
Although ancillary diagnostic tests can be incorporated, only tests that have been extensively proven as specific diagnostic markers in PD should be included. Moreover, they should be considered as ancillary only and not be essential to making diagnosis.

### Definition and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^114e6Gtj]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Especially in the early motor stages of the disease, distinguishing PD from atypical and secondary Parkinson syndromes based solely on clinical criteria can be challenging. Therefore, there is a need for additional diagnostic methods to increase diagnostic accuracy. Cranial MRI provides valuable diagnostic assistance in the differential diagnosis of Parkinson syndromes, including the exclusion of symptomatic causes and differentiation from other neurodegenerative Parkinson syndromes (given the high positive predictive value of corresponding MRI signs for other neurodegenerative Parkinson syndromes). At the onset of symptoms, distinguishing PD) from other neurodegenerative disorders with Parkinsonian features, particularly MSA, PSP, and CBD, presents a clinical challenge. FDG-PET of the brain is an established routine procedure that can capture and diagnostically utilize the impact of the disease on brain metabolism.

Recommendation (new in German guideline, 2023), summary of questions 12–22

Cranial MRI (cMRI) should be conducted early in the disease course to aid in the differential diagnosis of Parkinson syndromes. For evaluating exclusion criteria for PD, cMRI scans with standardized sequences, including T1-weighted and T2-weighted (preferably high-resolution 3D). In addition, iron-sensitive/susceptibility-weighted and diffusion-weighted sequences may be included.

Consensus strength: 97%, strong consensus.

Transcranial brain parenchymal sonography (TCS) performed by a qualified examiner can be useful in differentiating PD from atypical and secondary Parkinsonian syndromes. TCS should assess the substantia nigra, nucleus lentiformis, and the third ventricle.

Consensus strength: 97.4%, strong consensus.

FDG-PET may be considered if clinical signs strongly suggest an atypical Parkinson syndrome and the results will impact clinical decisions, such as diagnosis, prognosis, or therapy.

Consensus strength: 84%, consensus.

FDG-PET may also be used to evaluate the risk of dementia in PD, provided the findings have clinical implications.

Consensus strength: 97%, strong consensus.

Dopamine transporter SPECT (DAT-SPECT) may be performed early in the disease course to detect nigrostriatal deficits in cases where the diagnosis of Parkinson or tremor syndromes is unclear, if the results will influence clinical management.

Consensus strength: 82.8%, consensus.

Cardiac MIBG scintigraphy or SPECT can be considered to distinguish PD from MSA if FDG-PET is not available.

Consensus strength: 100%, strong consensus.

### Clinical diagnostic accuracy of Parkinson's disease: where Do we stand? [^1122uz2z]. Movement Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical diagnostic accuracy of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains suboptimal. Changes in disease concept may have improved clinical diagnostic accuracy in the past decade. However, current clinical diagnostic criteria have not been validated against neuropathological confirmation.

Objectives

This study aims to provide up-to-date clinical diagnostic accuracy data and validate current clinical diagnostic criteria for PD against neuropathology.

Methods

A retrospective review of medical records of consecutive patients with parkinsonism from the Queen Square Brain Bank was performed between 2009 and 2019. Clinical diagnosis was documented at early (within 5years of motor symptom onset) and final stages and categorized by movement disorder experts or regular clinicians. Movement Disorder Society Parkinson's disease (MDS-PD) diagnostic criteria were retrospectively applied. Diagnostic accuracy parameters (sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value, and accuracy) were calculated using neuropathological diagnosis as the gold standard.

Results

A total of 267 patients (141 PD and 126 non-PD parkinsonism) were included. Clinical diagnostic accuracy was 97.2% for experts, 92.5% for the MDS clinically probable PD criteria, and 90.3% for clinicians. Similar figures were obtained when applied at an early stage (91.5%, 89.5%, and 84.2% diagnostic accuracy, respectively). MDS clinically established early PD criteria demonstrated very high specificity (98.4%) at early stages.

Conclusions

Our results showed an important improvement in PD clinical diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice over the past decade, more marked at early stages of the disease. MDS-PD diagnostic criteria is a valid tool in clinical practice and research for the identification of PD patients showing excellent sensitivity and specificity, although movement disorder experts' diagnosis remains the gold standard PD diagnosis during life. © 2023 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### MDS research criteria for prodromal Parkinson's disease [^112eYnMC]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

This article describes research criteria and probability methodology for the diagnosis of prodromal PD. Prodromal disease refers to the stage wherein early symptoms or signs of PD neurodegeneration are present, but classic clinical diagnosis based on fully evolved motor parkinsonism is not yet possible. Given the lack of clear neuroprotective/disease-modifying therapy for prodromal PD, these criteria were developed for research purposes only. The criteria are based upon the likelihood of prodromal disease being present with probable prodromal PD defined as ≥ 80% certainty. Certainty estimates rely upon calculation of an individual's risk of having prodromal PD, using a Bayesian naïve classifier. In this methodology, a previous probability of prodromal disease is delineated based upon age. Then, the probability of prodromal PD is calculated by adding diagnostic information, expressed as likelihood ratios. This diagnostic information combines estimates of background risk (from environmental risk factors and genetic findings) and results of diagnostic marker testing. In order to be included, diagnostic markers had to have prospective evidence documenting ability to predict clinical PD. They include motor and nonmotor clinical symptoms, clinical signs, and ancillary diagnostic tests. These criteria represent a first step in the formal delineation of early stages of PD and will require constant updating as more information becomes available.

### Evolution of diagnostic criteria and assessments for Parkinson's disease mild cognitive impairment [^115tUVHD]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Mild cognitive impairment has gained recognition as a construct and a potential prodromal stage to dementia in both Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD). Although mild cognitive impairment has been recognized in the Alzheimer's disease field, it is a relatively more recent topic of interest in PD. Recent advances include the development of diagnostic criteria for PD mild cognitive impairment to provide more uniform definitions for clinical and research use. Studies reveal that mild cognitive impairment in PD is frequent, but also heterogeneous, with variable clinical presentations, differences in its progression to dementia, and likely differences in underlying pathophysiology. Application of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society PD Mild Cognitive Impairment Task Force diagnostic criteria has provided insights regarding cognitive measures, functional assessments, and other key topics that may require additional refinement. Furthermore, it is important to consider definitions of PD mild cognitive impairment in the landscape of other related Lewy body disorders, such as dementia with Lewy bodies, and in the context of prodromal and early-stage PD. This article examines the evolution of mild cognitive impairment in concept and definition, particularly in PD, but also in related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies; the development and application of International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society PD Mild Cognitive Impairment diagnostic criteria; and insights and future directions for the field of PD mild cognitive impairment. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Challenges in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease [^116ZbN24]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and its prevalence has been projected to double over the next 30 years. An accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease remains challenging and the characterisation of the earliest stages of the disease is ongoing. Recent developments over the past 5 years include the validation of clinical diagnostic criteria, the introduction and testing of research criteria for prodromal Parkinson's disease, and the identification of genetic subtypes and a growing number of genetic variants associated with risk of Parkinson's disease. Substantial progress has been made in the development of diagnostic biomarkers, and genetic and imaging tests are already part of routine protocols in clinical practice, while novel tissue and fluid markers are under investigation. Parkinson's disease is evolving from a clinical to a biomarker-supported diagnostic entity, for which earlier identification is possible, different subtypes with diverse prognosis are recognised, and novel disease-modifying treatments are in development.

### Diagnostic markers for Parkinson's disease [^114HngXB]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review enumerates recent developments in the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, with an emphasis on detection of preclinical Parkinson's disease.

Recent Findings

Several clinical, laboratory, and imaging tests are now being investigated as potential early markers of Parkinson's disease. These include various nonmotor features that predate the motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease, including sleep abnormalities, neurobehavioral symptoms, and olfactory dysfunction. Tests of the autonomic nervous system, such as cardiac functional imaging, allow for a measure of cardiac sympathetic denervation. Cerebrospinal fluid and serum tests, including α-synuclein and DJ-1, are being developed and refined. Various imaging modalities have contributed to the diagnostic armamentarium in Parkinson's disease, including transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, radiolabeled tracer imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging. Early Parkinson's disease detection will pave the way for major advances in disease modifying therapies.

Summary

Various diagnostic modalities hold promise for the early and preclinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. It is likely that the future diagnosis of Parkinson's disease will rely on a combination of clinical, laboratory, imaging, and genetic data.

### Time to redefine PD? Introductory statement of the MDS task force on the definition of Parkinson's disease [^111YRM2R]. Movement Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

What Is the Gold Standard for the Definition of PD?

The issue: A patient with classic clinical PD died without autopsy; can one never say they are "sure" she had PD? Why is autopsy the gold standard if it is almost never available (and might become outdated, once we have good biomarkers). Furthermore, don't genetic studies suggest that pathology can be inconclusive? A patient from a family of pathologically confirmed LRRK2 PD who meets clinical criteria for PD, but has no Lewy bodies (LB) on autopsy, or patients with parkin mutations without LB; do they not have PD?

What we currently consider as the gold standard for PD diagnosis is not always explicit. Nevertheless, most clinicians would endorse the diagnostic gold standard as a combined clinical and pathological syndrome, consisting of the following:

A motor clinical syndrome, with levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, typical clinical characteristics, and an absence of markers suggestive of other disease.
Pathologic confirmation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) deposition and dopamine neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Only at this point is the diagnosis termed "definite". If typical synuclein pathology is not found, the clinical diagnosis is considered incorrect. Likewise, the pathology is "incidental" in the absence of clinical symptoms or attributed to another disease if parkinsonism did not dominate the clinical picture (e.g. DLB or primary autonomic failure).

Therefore, a motor clinical syndrome is the entry point, and pathology is the arbiter of diagnosis. Pathologic findings ultimately feed back into clinical criteria by correcting clinical diagnoses.

Question 2: how effective is the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease by a clinical movement disorder expert using the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria compared to long-term clinical follow-up?

Background

The diagnostic criteria for PD primarily rely on the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria, the only neuropathologically well-validated criteria so far. Key diagnostic criteria include bradykinesia, resting tremor, asymmetrical symptom presentation, and disease progression. Supportive diagnostic parameters include levodopa-responsiveness, long-term observation of at least 5 years, motor fluctuations, and dyskinesias.

Results

In a longitudinal study from Arizona, 232 patients were included, of whom 131 had possible or probable PD. They were evaluated annually with UPDRS III and medication records. Patients showing good response to levodopa, at least two classic clinical signs (e.g. tremor and bradykinesia), and no symptomatic causes were classified as probable PD. After their death, neuropathological examination confirmed the diagnosis in 89 patients and ruled it out in 42. Long-term observation was crucial: patients with classic symptoms and a positive response to levodopa but disease duration of less than 5 years had a 53% positive predictive value, increasing to 88% with more than 5 years' duration. The presence of motor fluctuations or dyskinesias further raised the positive predictive value to 92% and 96%, respectively.

Recommendation (new in German guideline, 2023)

Observing the disease progression for more than 5 years improves the likelihood of making a correct diagnosis from 53% to > 85% and is, therefore, superior to solely applying the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria, indicating that Parkinson's patients should always be re-evaluated over a long-term course.

During this process, the occurrence of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias should be considered both by examination and patient history, as these symptoms significantly enhance the likelihood of making a correct diagnosis, thus representing an important clinical feature in the long-term course.

Consensus strength: 100%, strong consensus.

### Validation of new diagnostic criteria for fatigue in patients with parkinson disease [^116Yf5oz]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Fatigue is one of the most disabling and common nonmotor feature in Parkinson disease (PD). At the phenomenological level, patients describe fatigue as an overwhelming lack of energy or a need for increased effort during daily activities. Fatigue affects from 44% to 56% of patients with PD, tends to develop early, persists over time, and impacts patients' quality of life.

Despite several epidemiological studies linking fatigue to PD, little is known about its pathophysiology, and there are currently no evidence‐based treatment options. Converging evidence supported the involvement of nondopaminergic pathways (particularly serotonergic) and nonmotor networks in fatigue in PD, but key mechanisms are still not fully understood. This knowledge gap could be partially ascribed to the lack of validated diagnostic criteria capable of distinguishing the fatigue specifically related to the disease from the fatigue that may be associated with concurrent motor and nonmotor aspects of PD.

In 2016, an international work group convened by the Parkinson Foundation developed case definition criteria for PD‐related fatigue on the basis of expert consensus (Table 1), yet no validation study has been conducted to support their use in clinical and research contexts. The main aims of these criteria were: (i) to promote a consistent case definition of PD‐related fatigue similar to clinically significant fatigue in other serious illnesses like cancer, (ii) to differentiate fatigue from other potentially similar neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g. depression, apathy), (iii) to distinguish clinically relevant fatigue as a durable syndrome from normal physiologic fatigue or temporary (state) fatigue, and (iv) to distinguish fatigue related to PD pathology from fatigue arising from other causes (e.g. anemia, medications). A recent qualitative study explored the lived experiences of 22 patients with PD suffering from fatigue and suggested that the fatigue criteria proposed by Kluger et al. are ecologically valid but need to be optimized and tested. Despite their face validity and potential utility, the clinimetric properties of the new criteria for PD‐related fatigue have not yet been assessed.

TABLE 1
Criteria for diagnosis of PD‐related fatigue

In the present study, we recruited a large sample of patients with PD to assess the clinimetric properties of the criteria in terms of acceptability (whether a clinical measure is acceptable to the patients), validity (whether a clinical measure actually measures what it set out to measure), and reliability (whether a clinical measure can be interpreted consistently across different situations).

Question 6: how effective is the therapeutic response to dopamine agonist therapy compared to long-term clinical follow-up for diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD)?

Background

The differential diagnosis of different Parkinson syndromes often poses major challenges, especially in the early years of the disease. This leads to the search for definitive predictors for PD or atypical Parkinson syndromes. Clinical experience indicates that patients with PD typically experience substantial improvement in cardinal symptoms, except tremor, with a dopamine agonists. In contrast, most atypical Parkinson syndromes show limited or no symptom improvement with such treatments over time. This underpins the clinical practice of the treatment with a dopamine agonist: a clinical improvement of > 30% in UPDRS III is considered a "positive response", indicative of PD, whereas < 30% improvement is termed "lack of response". Patients with atypical Parkinson syndromes often initially respond positively to dopaminergic stimulation, albeit partially and temporarily.

Results

While the lack of response to a dopamine agonist is generally considered to support a diagnosis of PD, the scientific evidence for a strong recommendation is lacking due to the absence of systematic prospective long-term studies to date.

Recommendation (new in German guideline, 2023)

Due to lack of evidence, no recommendation can be made regarding the effectiveness of dopamine agonist therapy for predicting a correct diagnosis of PD.

Consensus strength: 97%, strong consensus.

Question 7: is it beneficial to incorporate the MDS prodromal criteria in the early-stage diagnosis of PD compared to clinical follow-up over 3–5 years?

### EFNS / MDS-ES / ENS recommendations for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease [^117BjtHJ]. European Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A Task Force was convened by the EFNS/MDS-ES Scientist Panel on Parkinson's disease (PD) and other movement disorders to systemically review relevant publications on the diagnosis of PD.

Methods

Following the EFNS instruction for the preparation of neurological diagnostic guidelines, recommendation levels have been generated for diagnostic criteria and investigations.

Results

For the clinical diagnosis, we recommend the use of the Queen Square Brain Bank criteria (Level B). Genetic testing for specific mutations is recommended on an individual basis (Level B), taking into account specific features (i.e. family history and age of onset). We recommend olfactory testing to differentiate PD from other parkinsonian disorders including recessive forms (Level A). Screening for pre-motor PD with olfactory testing requires additional tests due to limited specificity. Drug challenge tests are not recommended for the diagnosis in de novo parkinsonian patients. There is an insufficient evidence to support their role in the differential diagnosis between PD and other parkinsonian syndromes. We recommend an assessment of cognition and a screening for REM sleep behaviour disorder, psychotic manifestations and severe depression in the initial evaluation of suspected PD cases (Level A). Transcranial sonography is recommended for the differentiation of PD from atypical and secondary parkinsonian disorders (Level A), for the early diagnosis of PD and in the detection of subjects at risk for PD (Level A), although the technique is so far not universally used and requires some expertise. Because specificity of TCS for the development of PD is limited, TCS should be used in conjunction with other screening tests. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging at 1.5 T are recommended as neuroimaging tools that can support a diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (MSA) or progressive supranuclear palsy versus PD on the basis of regional atrophy and signal change as well as diffusivity patterns (Level A). DaTscan SPECT is registered in Europe and the United States for the differential diagnosis between degenerative parkinsonisms and essential tremor (Level A). More specifically, DaTscan is indicated in the presence of significant diagnostic uncertainty such as parkinsonism associated with neuroleptic exposure and atypical tremor manifestations such as isolated unilateral postural tremor. Studies of [(123) I]MIBG/SPECT cardiac uptake may be used to identify patients with PD versus controls and MSA patients (Level A). All other SPECT imaging studies do not fulfil registration standards and cannot be recommended for routine clinical use. At the moment, no conclusion can be drawn as to diagnostic efficacy of autonomic function tests, neurophysiological tests and positron emission tomography imaging in PD.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of PD is still largely based on the correct identification of its clinical features. Selected investigations (genetic, olfactory, and neuroimaging studies) have an ancillary role in confirming the diagnosis, and some of them could be possibly used in the near future to identify subjects in a pre-symptomatic phase of the disease.

### Clinical aspects of parkinson disease [^115WuvSp]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Parkinson disease is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a varied clinical picture and a variable rate of progression. Recently, there have been some studies conducted to assess the diagnostic accuracy and other clinical aspects of the disease. In the absence of a biomarker the clinical diagnosis is imprecise. This leads to a significant number of misdiagnoses, especially in early disease. Assessment of the clinical features suggests that an accuracy of 90% may be the highest that can be expected using current diagnostic criteria. In addition to bradykinesia, which is a core symptom, different types of tremors occur. Whereas the rest tremor is characteristic, action tremor, re-emergent tremor and orthostatic tremor may occur in Parkinson disease. Symptomatic treatments are quite effective in early disease but clinical course is complicated by the appearance of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias in more advanced disease. Non-motor complications, such as cognitive, psychiatric and autonomic problems, become bothersome and disabling in some patients.

Background

In 2015, the new and currently active criteria of the Movement Disorder Society (MDS criteria) for diagnosing PD have been introduced. Supportive criteria include the levodopa test, levodopa-induced dyskinesias, unilateral rest tremor, non-motor symptoms, and additional instrumental examinations such as the DAT (dopamine transporter) Scan (with a normal result serving as an exclusion criterion) and metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy.

### Diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease: movement disorder society task force guidelines [^117BbwjE]. Movement Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Mild cognitive impairment is common in nondemented Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and may be a harbinger of dementia. In view of its importance, the Movement Disorder Society commissioned a task force to delineate diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment in PD. The proposed diagnostic criteria are based on a literature review and expert consensus. This article provides guidelines to characterize the clinical syndrome and methods for its diagnosis. The criteria will require validation, and possibly refinement, as additional research improves our understanding of the epidemiology, presentation, neurobiology, assessment, and long-term course of this clinical syndrome. These diagnostic criteria will support future research efforts to identify at the earliest stage those PD patients at increased risk of progressive cognitive decline and dementia who may benefit from clinical interventions at a predementia stage.

### Diagnosis and treatment of parkinson disease: a review… [^11218CeJ]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance Parkinson disease is the most common form of parkinsonism, a group of neurological disorders with Parkinson disease–like movement problems such as rigidity, slowness, and tremor. More than 6 million individuals worldwide have Parkinson disease. Observations. Diagnosis of Parkinson disease is based on history and examination. History can include prodromal features, characteristic movement difficulty, and psychological or cognitive problems. Examination typically demonstrates bradykinesia with tremor, rigidity, or both. Dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography can improve the accuracy of diagnosis when the presence of parkinsonism is uncertain. Parkinson disease has multiple disease variants with different prognoses.

Individuals with a diffuse malignant subtype have prominent early motor and nonmotor symptoms, poor response to medication, and faster disease progression. Individuals with mild motor-predominant Parkinson disease have mild symptoms, a good response to dopaminergic medications, and slower disease progression. Other individuals have an intermediate subtype. For all patients with Parkinson disease, treatment is symptomatic, focused on improvement in motor and nonmotor signs and symptoms. Conclusions and Relevance Parkinson disease is a heterogeneous disease with rapidly and slowly progressive forms.

Treatment involves pharmacologic approaches and nonpharmacologic approaches. Approaches such as deep brain stimulation and treatment with levodopa-carbidopa enteral suspension can help individuals with medication-resistant tremor, worsening symptoms when the medication wears off, and dyskinesias.

### Prodromal Parkinson's disease as defined per MDS research criteria in the general elderly community [^1114KT1g]. Movement Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society has defined research criteria for prodromal Parkinson's disease (PD), but to date their predictive value has not yet been tested in population-based cohorts.

Methods

We retrospectively applied these criteria to the longitudinal Bruneck Study cohort aged 55–94 years using recorded data on all included risk and prodromal markers that are quick and easily assessable.

Results

After excluding participants with idiopathic PD or secondary parkinsonism, prevalence of probable prodromal PD in the remaining 539 participants was 2.2% (95% confidence interval, 1.2%-3.9%). Of 488 participants followed up over 5 years, 11 developed incident PD. Sensitivity of "probable prodromal PD" status for incident PD was 54.6% (95% confidence interval, 28.0%-78.8%), specificity was 99.2% (97.8%-99.8%), positive predictive value was 60.0% (31.2%-83.3%), and negative predictive value was 99.0% (97.5%-99.6%).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that the new research criteria for prodromal PD are a promising tool to identify cases of incident PD over 5 years, arguing for their usefulness in defining target populations for disease-prevention trials. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Time to redefine PD? Introductory statement of the MDS task force on the definition of Parkinson's disease [^114eU63i]. Movement Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

With advances in knowledge disease, boundaries may change. Occasionally, these changes are of such a magnitude that they require redefinition of the disease. In recognition of the profound changes in our understanding of Parkinson's disease (PD), the International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society (MDS) commissioned a task force to consider a redefinition of PD. This review is a discussion article, intended as the introductory statement of the task force. Several critical issues were identified that challenge current PD definitions. First, new findings challenge the central role of the classical pathologic criteria as the arbiter of diagnosis, notably genetic cases without synuclein deposition, the high prevalence of incidental Lewy body (LB) deposition, and the nonmotor prodrome of PD. It remains unclear, however, whether these challenges merit a change in the pathologic gold standard, especially considering the limitations of alternate gold standards. Second, the increasing recognition of dementia in PD challenges the distinction between diffuse LB disease and PD. Consideration might be given to removing dementia as an exclusion criterion for PD diagnosis. Third, there is increasing recognition of disease heterogeneity, suggesting that PD subtypes should be formally identified; however, current subtype classifications may not be sufficiently robust to warrant formal delineation. Fourth, the recognition of a nonmotor prodrome of PD requires that new diagnostic criteria for early-stage and prodromal PD should be created; here, essential features of these criteria are proposed. Finally, there is a need to create new MDS diagnostic criteria that take these changes in disease definition into consideration. © 2014 The Authors.

### The movement disorder society criteria for the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy [^114QnBbM]. Movement Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The second consensus criteria for the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (MSA) are widely recognized as the reference standard for clinical research, but lack sensitivity to diagnose the disease at early stages.

Objective

To develop novel Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria for MSA diagnosis using an evidence-based and consensus-based methodology.

Methods

We identified shortcomings of the second consensus criteria for MSA diagnosis and conducted a systematic literature review to answer predefined questions on clinical presentation and diagnostic tools relevant for MSA diagnosis. The criteria were developed and later optimized using two Delphi rounds within the MSA Criteria Revision Task Force, a survey for MDS membership, and a virtual Consensus Conference.

Results

The criteria for neuropathologically established MSA remain unchanged. For a clinical MSA diagnosis a new category of clinically established MSA is introduced, aiming for maximum specificity with acceptable sensitivity. A category of clinically probable MSA is defined to enhance sensitivity while maintaining specificity. A research category of possible prodromal MSA is designed to capture patients in the earliest stages when symptoms and signs are present, but do not meet the threshold for clinically established or clinically probable MSA. Brain magnetic resonance imaging markers suggestive of MSA are required for the diagnosis of clinically established MSA. The number of research biomarkers that support all clinical diagnostic categories will likely grow.

Conclusions

This set of MDS MSA diagnostic criteria aims at improving the diagnostic accuracy, particularly in early disease stages. It requires validation in a prospective clinical and a clinicopathological study. © 2022 The Authors.

### "Recommendations for clinical study protocols for immune and inflammatory profiling in Parkinson's disease" [^115kpyEM]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Inclusion criteria

There must be diagnostic confidence in the diagnosis of PD. Currently, the most widely accepted criteria are the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Diagnostic Criteria for PD, which requires the presence of Parkinsonism, together with supportive features balanced against 'red flags'. However, these criteria are not well suited to recently diagnosed cases in whom supportive criteria and some 'red flags' may not have had time to evolve, and so for early/de novo cohorts, the revised MDS criteria for clinically established early PD may be more suitable. There is an ongoing debate about the need for additional biomarker testing, such as the alpha synuclein seeding assay, dopamine transporter imaging, and genetic testing to provide biological confirmation of the diagnosis. Whilst these newly proposed classifications of PD may strengthen confidence in the diagnosis, they still require further validation and may limit recruitment in centres where such testing is not readily available.

Prodromal PD cases may be interesting to include as they can help us to understand early disease mechanisms and to identify predictive biomarkers. In this line, accumulating evidence has shown an immune activation in patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), known to be at high risk of developing PD. A diagnosis of prodromal PD can be made by employing the MDS criteria. Furthermore, including carriers of variants in PD-associated genes who are considered at risk of developing PD, and comparing their immune profiles between those who eventually develop the disease and those who do not, may provide valuable insights into both causative and potentially protective immune responses –.

In terms of the selection of control participants, matching to the age range and sex of the PD population is critical, given the well-established impact of ageing and sex on the immune system. Furthermore, sex-dependent changes in the immune system have been reported in PD.

### Definition and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^116rF1w8]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

The MDS criteria of 2015 introduce several distinctions. They categorize negative and positive features, where negative features include absolute exclusion criteria and red flags. Positive features include supportive criteria, which can mitigate the impact of red flags if present. Exceptions to absolute exclusion criteria accommodate special cases. Importantly, dementia is not an exclusion criterion, as it may manifest early as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD and later progress to PDD clinically. Similarly, early cognitive impairments, fluctuations in vigilance, and hallucinations indicative of DLB are not exclusion criteria, as DLB is viewed as a continuum within the spectrum of PD manifestations. The clinical progression over time remains of relevance for the criteria. For the first time, a non-motor symptom (hyposmia) is also considered a supportive criterion. Clinical motor criteria include cardinal features of a Parkinson's syndrome such as bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. A positive response of > 30% on UPDRS III (motor assessment) after an acute levodopa test is considered a supportive criterion. Other supportive criteria include levodopa-induced dyskinesias, rest tremor in a limb, and positive findings from other diagnostic tests (such as olfactory testing or MIBG scintigraphy, indicating cardiac sympathetic denervation). A clinically established diagnosis (aiming for at least 90% specificity with slightly lower sensitivity) can be made if at least two supportive criteria are met without red flags or exclusion criteria. Criteria for a clinically probable diagnosis (targeting at least 80% specificity with at least 80% sensitivity) are met if one red flag is balanced by one supportive criterion, or two red flags by two supportive criteria. More than two red flags or any exclusion criteria should not be present. In a subsequent study by Postuma in 2018, these new MDS criteria were validated against clinical experts' diagnosis. This multicenter study involved clinical movement disorder experts and inexperienced neurologists assessing 434 patients with PD and 192 with Parkinsonian syndromes of other etiologies. Experts classified patients, while inexperienced neurologists used the newly developed MDS criteria for diagnosis. The overall diagnostic accuracy for probable PD was 92.6%, with an overall error rate of 7.4%. Specificity and sensitivity were higher using the MDS criteria (no neuropathological confirmation) compared to the previously standard UK Brain Bank criteria, which had an accuracy of 86.4% and an error rate of 13.6%, with specificity improving with disease duration.

### Definition and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^111bdwvz]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The classic motor symptoms of bradykinesia, rigidity, and rest tremor, which enable the diagnosis of PD, are typically preceded by a phase lasting years to decades during which the underlying neurodegenerative process spreads in the nervous system, but has not yet reached the extent required in the relevant brain areas for the manifestation of these classic motor symptoms. However, during this so-called prodromal phase, the neurodegenerative process can lead to other non-motor symptoms or motor symptoms of milder severity that are typical but not specific to the underlying disease.

Based on these facts, the International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society (MDS) has developed criteria using Bayesian statistics to calculate the probability that an individual, with certain prodromal symptoms and risk factors for PD (e.g. pesticide exposure and genetic predisposition), is in the prodromal phase of the disease or not. A criterion for including prodromal markers and risk factors in the statistical calculation was that at least two longitudinal prospective studies were available to calculate a "plausibility quotient" (likelihood ratio, LR). This LR, along with the individual's age, is integrated into a probability formula that calculates the individual likelihood of the prodromal phase based on the presence or absence of certain symptoms. The prodromal criteria, first published in 2015, were updated in 2019.

Moreover, the guidelines emphasize the importance of considering non-motor symptoms, olfactory testing, and RBD in the diagnostic process. These aspects not only enhance diagnostic certainty but also provide valuable insights into the disease's progression and prognosis. The inclusion of olfactory tests and polysomnography as supportive diagnostic tools represents a move towards more comprehensive diagnostic practices.

The strong consensus on most recommendations reflects a high degree of agreement among experts, reinforcing the credibility and reliability of the guidelines. Recommendations such as monitoring levodopa-responsiveness, but not recommending routine use of acute levodopa and apomorphine tests, while considering their diagnostic value in specific contexts, exemplify a differentiated approach to PD diagnosis. The focus on long-term follow-up to monitor development of PD-supporting motor complications or possible appearance of red flags arguing in favor of atypical Parkinson syndromes, and the recommendation of the MDS criteria for diagnosis of prodromal or established PD underscore the guidelines' commitment to improving diagnostic accuracy as novel evidence emerges.

In summary, the 2023 German guidelines for Parkinson's disease represent a significant advancement in the field, integrating recent genetic insights and emphasizing long-term, patient-centered approaches to diagnosis and management. As our understanding of PD continues to evolve, these guidelines provide a crucial framework for clinicians, ensuring that diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are both evidence-based and adaptable to the complexities of the disease.

### Neuropathological assessment of Parkinson's disease: refining the diagnostic criteria [^115MyZFs]. The Lancet: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

To date, there have been few systematic attempts to provide a standard operating procedure for the neuropathological diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Pathological examination cannot classify the clinical syndrome with certainty; therefore, the neuropathological diagnosis is, at best, a probability statement. The neuropathological diagnosis of parkinsonism has become increasingly based on fundamental molecular underpinnings, with recognition that the genetics of parkinsonism is heterogeneous and includes disorders that are associated with and without Lewy bodies. The advent of alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry has substantially improved the ability to identify Lewy pathology, particularly cortical Lewy bodies and smaller aggregates within processes and the neuropil. In this Review we discuss the diagnostic criteria for the neuropathological assessment of PD. These criteria are provisional and need to be validated through an iterative process that could help with their refinement. Additionally, we suggest future directions for neuropathology research on PD.

### Accuracy of clinical diagnosis of parkinson disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113EouEM]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD) reported in the last 25 years by a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

We searched for articles published between 1988 and August 2014. Studies were included if reporting diagnostic parameters regarding clinical diagnosis of PD or crude data. The selected studies were subclassified based on different study setting, type of test diagnosis, and gold standard. Bayesian meta-analyses of available data were performed.

Results

We selected 20 studies, including 11 using pathologic examination as gold standard. Considering only these 11 studies, the pooled diagnostic accuracy was 80.6% (95% credible interval [CrI] 75.2%-85.3%). Accuracy was 73.8% (95% CrI 67.8%-79.6%) for clinical diagnosis performed mainly by nonexperts. Accuracy of clinical diagnosis performed by movement disorders experts rose from 79.6% (95% CrI 46%-95.1%) of initial assessment to 83.9% (95% CrI 69.7%-92.6%) of refined diagnosis after follow-up. Using UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Research Center criteria, the pooled diagnostic accuracy was 82.7% (95% CrI 62.6%-93%).

Conclusion

The overall validity of clinical diagnosis of PD is not satisfying. The accuracy did not significantly improve in the last 25 years, particularly in the early stages of disease, where response to dopaminergic treatment is less defined and hallmarks of alternative diagnoses such as atypical parkinsonism may not have emerged. Misclassification rate should be considered to calculate the sample size both in observational studies and randomized controlled trials. Imaging and biomarkers are urgently needed to improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis in vivo.

### Movement disorders society scientific issues committee report: SIC task force appraisal of clinical diagnostic criteria for parkinsonian disorders [^115P1tR7]. Movement Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

As there are no biological markers for the antemortem diagnosis of degenerative parkinsonian disorders, diagnosis currently relies upon the presence and progression of clinical features and confirmation depends on neuropathology. Clinicopathologic studies have shown significant false-positive and false-negative rates for diagnosing these disorders, and misdiagnosis is especially common during the early stages of these diseases. It is important to establish a set of widely accepted diagnostic criteria for these disorders that may be applied and reproduced in a blinded fashion. This review summarizes the findings of the SIC Task Force for the study of diagnostic criteria for parkinsonian disorders in the areas of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, and corticobasal degeneration. In each of these areas, diagnosis continues to rest on clinical findings and the judicious use of ancillary studies.

### Atypical parkinsonism: an update [^1146dJRt]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

The knowledge obtained recently on atypical parkinsonian conditions points out clearly what are the major deficits in this field, which, compared to other neurodegenerative diseases, lacks major advances in terms of early diagnosis and treatments. With the expanding phenotypical spectrum of atypical parkinsonian conditions, the early identification of patients has become difficult; thus, new clinical criteria are being currently revised. The inability of conventional methods such as MRI to identify these disorders earlier and better than clinicians, and the recent failure of promising therapeutic compounds based on rational therapeutic hypotheses highlight the fact that the lack of biomarkers is probably the greatest limitation for developing treatments for these disorders. Thus, current and future research in this direction will be crucial.

### The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease [^113iM52o]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

The correct diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is important for prognostic and therapeutic reasons and is essential for clinical research. Investigations of the diagnostic accuracy for the disease and other forms of parkinsonism in community-based samples of patients taking antiparkinsonian medication confirmed a diagnosis of parkinsonism in only 74% of patients and clinically probable Parkinson's disease in 53% of patients. Clinicopathological studies based on brain bank material from the UK and Canada have shown that clinicians diagnose the disease incorrectly in about 25% of patients. In these studies, the most common reasons for misdiagnosis were presence of essential tremor, vascular parkinsonism, and atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Infrequent diagnostic errors included Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and drug-induced parkinsonism. Increasing knowledge of the heterogeneous clinical presentation of the various parkinsonisms has resulted in improved diagnostic accuracy of the various parkinsonian syndromes in specialised movement-disorder units. Also genetic testing and various other ancillary tests, such as olfactory testing, MRI, and dopamine-transporter single-photon-emission computed-tomography imaging, help with clinical diagnostic decisions.

### Definition and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^114phPtJ]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This guideline underscores the importance of a structured and comprehensive approach to PD diagnosis. By establishing key PICO questions, the steering committee ensured a focused and systematic literature review, which was critical in forming evidence-based recommendations. The collaborative effort of chapter authors and the iterative process of refining these recommendations through consensus voting illustrate the guideline's robust methodological framework.

The evolving understanding of PD and its genetic underpinnings necessitates a reevaluation of traditional terminologies and diagnostic criteria. Historically, the terms "Parkinson's disease" (PD) and "idiopathic Parkinson's syndrome" (IPS) were used interchangeably. However, recent advances in genetic research reveal that a substantial number of PD cases are linked to genetic variants, challenging the idiopathic nature of the disease. Consequently, the Parkinson's Guideline Group of the German Society for Neurology now advocates for the broader term PD to encompass both idiopathic and hereditary forms.

The distinction between hereditary and sporadic PD is particularly noteworthy. Hereditary PD, driven by specific pathogenic genetic variants, often follows clear Mendelian inheritance patterns, whereas sporadic PD involves a complex interplay of numerous genetic factors with each variant contributing modestly to disease risk. This polygenic nature of sporadic PD is a frontier of ongoing research, promising to enhance our understanding of the disease's genetic complexity and pave the way for more personalized treatment strategies. Although there are many interesting, promising approaches for diagnostic biomarkers in Parkinson's disease, no clinical use is currently recommended due to a lack of specificity and quality assessment of the biomarker tests.

Currently, the MDS criteria for the clinical and prodromal diagnosis of PD are valid and intensively applied in clinical practice.

The new recommendations published 2023 reflect a shift towards more nuanced diagnostic criteria and long-term disease management. Long-term clinical follow-up emerges as a superior strategy for accurate diagnosis, highlighting the dynamic nature of PD and the necessity for ongoing patient reassessment.

### Non-motor parkinson' s: integral to motor parkinson' s, yet often neglected [^114zFq7c]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Non-motor symptoms are a key component of Parkinson's disease, possibly representing a clinical biomarker of its premotor phase. The burden of non-motor symptoms can define a patient's health-related quality of life. Non-motor symptoms substantially increase the cost of care — requiring increased hospitalisation and treatment — and pose a major challenge to healthcare professionals. However, clinicians often regard non-motor symptoms and their management as peripheral to that of the motor symptoms. Here, we address the clinical issues and unmet needs of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease.

### The prediagnostic phase of Parkinson's disease [^115xcZiL]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The field of prediagnostic Parkinson's disease (PD) is fast moving with an expanding range of clinical and laboratory biomarkers, and multiple strategies seeking to discover those in the earliest stages or those 'at risk'. It is widely believed that the highest likelihood of securing neuroprotective benefit from drugs will be in these subjects, preceding current point of diagnosis of PD. In this review, we outline current knowledge of the prediagnostic phase of PD, including an up-to-date review of risk factors (genetic and environmental), their relative influence, and clinical features that occur prior to diagnosis. We discuss imaging markers across a range of modalities, and the emerging literature on fluid and peripheral tissue biomarkers. We then explore current initiatives to identify individuals at risk or in the earliest stages that might be candidates for future clinical trials, what we are learning from these initiatives, and how these studies will bring the field closer to realistically commencing primary or secondary preventive trials for PD. Further progress in this field hinges on greater clinical and biological description, and understanding of the prediagnostic, peridiagnostic and immediate postdiagnostic stages of PD. Identifying subjects 3–5years before they are currently diagnosed may be an ideal group for neuroprotective trials. At the very least, these initiatives will help clarify the stage before and around diagnosis, enabling the field to push into unchartered territory at the earliest stages of disease.

Clinical diagnostic criteria

Question 1: how effective is the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease by a clinical movement disorder expert using the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria compared to the post-mortem diagnosis?

Background

In medical care, PD must be accurately clinically differentiated from secondary Parkinsonian syndromes and other Parkinsonian syndromes with our without neurodegenerative diseases. A clinical diagnosis of PD should be based on recognized criteria. The UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria are still frequently applied in clinical and scientific practice.

Results

Three studies validating clinically diagnosed cases using the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria against histopathological post-mortem results in Parkinsonian syndromes at different disease stages have been published. These studies suggest that the clinical diagnosis of PD can be made using the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria.

Recommendation (new in German guideline, 2023)

It may be considered to diagnose PD using the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria. However, the criteria have limitations in terms of diagnostic certainty, since they include the clinical course as requirement for the diagnosis, and other criteria (see below) are available as alternatives.

Consensus strength: 97.4%, strong consensus.

### Biomarkers for Parkinson's disease [^114Nt8Cc]. Science Translational Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Biomarkers for detecting the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) could accelerate development of new treatments. Such biomarkers could be used to identify individuals at risk for developing PD, to improve early diagnosis, to track disease progression with precision, and to test the efficacy of new treatments. Although some progress has been made, there are many challenges associated with developing biomarkers for detecting PD in its earliest stages.

### Definition and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^111qx6pk]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendation (new in German guideline, 2023)

For diagnosing PD, the MDS criteria from 2015 should be applied. The sensitivity and specificity of the MDS criteria surpass those of the UK Brain Bank criteria. Long-term disease management under the guidance of an expert improves diagnostic accuracy, necessitating regular follow-up examinations.

Consensus strength: 94.7%, consensus.

Important yet insufficiently answered research question: The MDS criteria for diagnosing PD should be validated against the neuropathological diagnostic gold standard.

Question 4: how effective is the acute levodopa test or an apomorphine test compared to long-term clinical follow-up for diagnosing PD?

Background

Many PD patients show clinical improvement with a single dose of oral levodopa and/or subcutaneous apomorphine. The test sometimes comprises pre-treatment with domperidone for > 24 h to prevent side effects. A standardized dose of levodopa (150–250 mg) is administered orally after a pause of the patient's anti-Parkinson medication for several hours (e.g. 12 h). Alternatively, apomorphine injection can be used (e.g. starting with stepwise doses such as 1.5 mg, then 3 mg, and 4.5 mg). The motor score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS part III) is commonly used to measure the effect (before and approximately 1 h after levodopa administration or 15–20 min after apomorphine injection). A systematic review and diagnostic study examined the effectiveness of levodopa and apomorphine tests in diagnosing individuals with Parkinsonian syndromes.

### Determinants of delayed diagnosis in Parkinson's disease [^115cpwkQ]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The early and accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the first step towards optimal patient management. The aim of this study was to investigate the major determinants of delayed diagnosis in PD. We recruited a population-representative cohort of 239 newly-diagnosed PD patients who underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluation. Non-parametric methods were used to define the factors associated with diagnostic delay. The median time from motor symptom onset to primary care physician (PCP) presentation was considerably longer than the time from PCP presentation to PD diagnosis (11 vs. 1 months). Male sex and presenting motor phenotype were independently associated with delayed PCP presentation on Cox regression analysis. Patients presenting with gait disturbance experienced the longest delay, whilst those presenting with tremor had the shortest. In summary, male sex and presenting motor phenotype are key determinants of delayed diagnosis in PD.

### Validating the accuracy of Parkinson's disease clinical diagnosis: a UK brain bank case-control study [^112DFt88]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Despite refinements in criteria and guidelines, clinical diagnosis of PD still suffers from a not satisfying accuracy and specificity, with the post‐mortem validation as the diagnostic gold standard. Identifying more solid in‐vivo biomarkers, improving the characterization of prodromal symptoms and risk factors, and increasing knowledge of etiopathological mechanisms are required steps to augment the diagnostic process. Pathological examination is pivotal for new diagnostic criteria that reflect a comprehensive vision for a biological definition of the disease.

### Time to redefine PD? Introductory statement of the MDS task force on the definition of Parkinson's disease [^117DTGrT]. Movement Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

From Definition to Diagnostic Criteria

When a disease definition changes, its diagnosis inevitably changes with it. Therefore, creation of a new definition provides an opportunity to develop new clinical diagnostic criteria. There are several reasons to develop new clinical diagnostic criteria:

No standard clinical criteria exist. Many criteria have been proposed for PD,–but none have been developed or adopted by an international organization such as the MDS.
New knowledge: Diagnostic criteria must accommodate new findings. For example, it is no longer appropriate to consider having affected family members or autonomic dysfunction as exclusion criteria. Moreover, the systemic character of the disease needs to be acknowledged, especially incorporating nonmotor symptoms.
Changes in health care or disease patterns: Exclusion criteria for patients taking neuroleptic medicationsrequire rewording, given development of atypical neuroleptics such as clozapine and quetiapine. Similarly, excluding patients with encephalitis lethargica, may not be relevant as this epidemic passes into history.
Changes in definition that change diagnosis: For example, if early dementia is permitted, exclusion criteria targeted at cognitive impairment would be removed.

### Clinical features and laboratory findings for differentiating parkinsonian syndromes [^115sShC9]. Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Most clinicians and researchers still accept idiopathic Parkinson's disease as a disease entity, although the identification of several genes or loci responsible for certain inherited forms of Parkinson's disease have provided arguments for a clinical heterogeneity of this disorder. The here proposed new classification of syndromes and diseases which show a parkinsonian syndrome in isolation or in combination with other symptoms divides patients into groups based on a set of rules mainly on a clinicopathological basis. It illustrates the current state of the art and will eventually be replaced due to an increase in the knowledge of the pathophysiological basis of these diseases. According to this classification, the crucial clinical features and laboratory findings are reviewed. The report will mainly concentrate on parkinsonian syndromes in degenerative diseases.

### Differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes: dynamics of time courses are essential [^116bKoPT]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes encloses idiopathic Parkinson's disease, other primary neurodegenerative diseases (atypical parkinsonism), symptomatic cases, pseudoparkinsonism and inherited forms. Clinical diagnostic criteria are not safe when applied only at disease onset. Diagnostic accuracy can be intensified by recognition of distinct patterns of signs and symptoms and by focussing attention on the time course of the disease.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® movement disorders and neurodegenerative diseases [^1176Dsr8]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Movement disorders and neurodegenerative diseases are a variety of conditions that involve progressive neuronal degeneration, injury, or death. Establishing the correct diagnosis of a movement disorder or neurodegenerative process can be difficult due to the variable features of these conditions, unusual clinical presentations, and overlapping symptoms and characteristics. MRI has an important role in the initial assessment of these patients, although a combination of imaging and laboratory and genetic tests is often needed for complete evaluation and management. This document summarizes the imaging appropriateness data for rapidly progressive dementia, chorea, Parkinsonian syndromes, suspected neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, and suspected motor neuron disease. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Diagnostic criteria for psychosis in Parkinson's disease: report of an NINDS, NIMH work group [^116fKfCK]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

There are no standardized diagnostic criteria for psychosis associated with Parkinson's disease (PDPsy). As part of an NIH sponsored workshop, we reviewed the existing literature on PDPsy to provide criteria that distinguish PDPsy from other causes of psychosis. Based on these data, we propose provisional criteria for PDPsy in the style of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV-TR. PDPsy has a well-characterized temporal and clinical profile of hallucinations and delusions, which is different than the pattern seen in other psychotic disorders such as substance induced psychosis or schizophrenia. PDPsy is associated with a poor prognosis of chronic psychosis, nursing home placement, and death. Medications used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) contribute to PDPsy but may not be sufficient or necessary contributors to PDPsy. PDPsy is associated with Lewy bodies pathology, imbalances of monoaminergic neurotransmitters, and visuospatial processing deficits. These findings suggest that PDPsy may result from progression of the disease process underlying PD, rather than a comorbid psychiatric disorder or drug intoxication. PDPsy is not adequately described by existing criteria for psychotic disorders. We established provisional diagnostic criteria that define a constellation of clinical features not shared by other psychotic syndromes. The criteria are inclusive and contain descriptions of the full range of characteristic symptoms, chronology of onset, duration of symptoms, exclusionary diagnoses, and associated features such as dementia. These criteria require validation and may be refined, but form a starting point for studies of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of PDPsy, and are a potential indication for therapy development.

### Diagnostic procedures for Parkinson's disease dementia: recommendations from the movement disorder society task force [^117BpBq9]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

A preceding article described the clinical features of Parkinson's disease dementia (PD-D) and proposed clinical diagnostic criteria for "probable" and "possible" PD-D. The main focus of this article is to operationalize the diagnosis of PD-D and to propose practical guidelines based on a two level process depending upon the clinical scenario and the expertise of the evaluator involved in the assessment. Level I is aimed primarily at the clinician with no particular expertise in neuropsychological methods, but who requires a simple, pragmatic set of tests that are not excessively time-consuming. Level I can be used alone or in concert with Level II, which is more suitable when there is the need to specify the pattern and the severity on the dementia of PD-D for clinical monitoring, research studies or pharmacological trials. Level II tests can also be proposed when the diagnosis of PD-D remains uncertain or equivocal at the end of a Level I evaluation. Given the lack of evidence-based standards for some tests when applied in this clinical context, we have tried to make practical and unambiguous recommendations, based upon the available literature and the collective experience of the Task Force. We accept, however, that further validation of certain tests and modifications in the recommended cut off values will be required through future studies.

### Movement disorder society criteria for clinically established early Parkinson's disease [^112fRakZ]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In 2015, the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society published clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease (PD). Although recent validation studies suggest high accuracy, one unmet need is for highly specific criteria for clinical trials in early/de novo PD.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to generate and test a PD diagnostic criteria termed "clinically established early PD".

Methods

We modified the Movement Disorder Society criteria to increase specificity for early PD by removing all disease duration components and changing red flags to absolute exclusions. We then estimated the sensitivity/specificity of clinically established early PD criteria in patients with disease duration < 5 years, selected from a 626-patient validation study.

Results

After documentation of parkinsonism, 18 individual exclusion criteria are assessed that preclude the diagnosis of "clinically established early PD". Among 212 PD and 152 non-PD patients, the estimated specificity was 95.4%, with 69.8% sensitivity.

Conclusions

We describe high-specificity criteria for de novo PD, which are freely available for use in clinical trials. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### MDS clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease [^116dJSCJ]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

This document presents the Movement Disorder Society Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Parkinson's disease (PD). The Movement Disorder Society PD Criteria are intended for use in clinical research but also may be used to guide clinical diagnosis. The benchmark for these criteria is expert clinical diagnosis; the criteria aim to systematize the diagnostic process, to make it reproducible across centers and applicable by clinicians with less expertise in PD diagnosis. Although motor abnormalities remain central, increasing recognition has been given to nonmotor manifestations; these are incorporated into both the current criteria and particularly into separate criteria for prodromal PD. Similar to previous criteria, the Movement Disorder Society PD Criteria retain motor parkinsonism as the core feature of the disease, defined as bradykinesia plus rest tremor or rigidity. Explicit instructions for defining these cardinal features are included. After documentation of parkinsonism, determination of PD as the cause of parkinsonism relies on three categories of diagnostic features: absolute exclusion criteria (which rule out PD), red flags (which must be counterbalanced by additional supportive criteria to allow diagnosis of PD), and supportive criteria (positive features that increase confidence of the PD diagnosis). Two levels of certainty are delineated: clinically established PD (maximizing specificity at the expense of reduced sensitivity) and probable PD (which balances sensitivity and specificity). The Movement Disorder Society criteria retain elements proven valuable in previous criteria and omit aspects that are no longer justified, thereby encapsulating diagnosis according to current knowledge. As understanding of PD expands, the Movement Disorder Society criteria will need continuous revision to accommodate these advances.

### The differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease [^115sgdFT]. European Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease continues to be challenging with misdiagnosis rates as high as 20–30% in early stages. Such diagnostic inaccuracy is largely due to failure to recognize atypical parkinsonian disorders including multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). These disorders are characterized by distinctive sets of atypical features that have been incorporated into recent consensus diagnostic criteria. Early diagnosis of atypical parkinsonian disorders is important not only because of prognostic implications, but also because of variable therapeutic targets such as autonomic failure, apraxia or dementia.

### Validating the accuracy of Parkinson's disease clinical diagnosis: a UK brain bank case-control study [^114i2Yjs]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite updates of diagnostic criteria and several studies aiming to better define underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, the accuracy of in‐vivo diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unsatisfying. To date, clinical criteria for in‐vivo diagnostic certainty are still unmet, requiring pathological confirmation for a conclusive diagnosis.

The gold standard is the post‐mortem examination, unveiling the concomitant depletion of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and deposition of Lewy bodies in a predictable fashion, known as Lewy pathology.

The 1988 United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank (UKPDSBB) criteria are considered the gold standard for the clinical diagnosis of PD and involve a 3‐step process: (1) Diagnosis of parkinsonism: bradykinesia along with 1 or more among rest tremor, rigidity, or postural instability. (2) Exclusion criteria: rule out other potential causes of parkinsonism. (3) Supportive criteria: 3 or more supportive criteria such as unilateral onset, persistent asymmetry, marked positive response to levodopa (70–100%), response duration to levodopa of 5 years or more, levodopa‐induced chorea, rest tremor, progression of the disease and clinical course of at least 10 years must be present.

### Diagnostic criteria for parkinson disease… [^116PdPaZ]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease is based on the identification of some combination of the cardinal motor signs of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability, but few attempts have been made to develop explicit diagnostic criteria. We propose a clinical diagnostic classification based on a comprehensive review of the literature regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the characteristic clinical features of PD. Three levels of diagnostic confidence are differentiated: Definite, Probable, and Possible. The diagnoses of Possible and Probable PD are based on clinical criteria alone. Neuropathologic confirmation is required for the diagnosis of Definite PD in patients with the clinical diagnosis of Possible or Probable PD. Criteria for histopathologic confirmation of PD are also presented. Gelb DJ, Oliver E, Gilman S. Diagnostic Criteria for Parkinson Disease. Arch Neurol. 1999; 56: 33–39.

### Time to redefine PD? Introductory statement of the MDS task force on the definition of Parkinson's disease [^111tnnqh]. Movement Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Moving Forward

The task force proposes the following:

The core clinicopathologic criteria of a clinical motor syndrome accompanied by SNpc neurodegeneration and synuclein deposition remain a gold standard of PD diagnosis. In the future, should reliable biomarkers of synuclein deposition be developed, these can be used to indicate a likely gold-standard clinicopathologic diagnosis.
To incorporate genetic findings under the PD umbrella, a separate "clinicogenetic" category should be created to diagnose PD, regardless of the occurrence of synuclein deposition. This category would refer specifically to highly penetrant mutations in which the majority of affecteds meet clinical PD criteria, regardless of whether autopsy specimens of patients with this mutation find α-Syn pathology. In research studies, this diagnostic subcategory could be included or not according to the context. For example, an autopsy study validating clinical diagnostic criteria might exclude such patients, a randomized trial of symptomatic dopaminergic therapy might include them, and a neuroprotective trial may elect to include or exclude, depending upon the mechanism of the agent.
A new scheme is likely needed to replace the current PARK classification, which is under considerable strain. This scheme should specifically differentiate between causative genes and risk factors, consider the predominant phenotype, and — in the long run — admit the incorporation of protective variants. A dedicated task force of the MDS is currently working on this complex issue.

### Diagnosing PD-MCI by MDS task force criteria: how many and which neuropsychological tests? [^116RpfnM]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal properties of a comprehensive (level II) neuropsychological battery for determining Parkinson's disease mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) by Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Task Force criteria remain unresolved.

Methods

Seventy-six nondemented PD patients underwent PD-MCI classification using a consensus diagnosis and level II criteria. We examined the optimal number of tests in each of the five designated cognitive domains, identified the best tests within each domain, and determined the best overall battery for PD-MCI level II diagnosis.

Results

A battery with two tests per domain provided a highly practical, robust diagnostic assessment. Level II testing with the two best tests and impairment defined as 2 standard deviations below norms was highly sensitive and specific for PD-MCI diagnosis.

Conclusions

Our findings strongly support the MDS Task Force Level II testing recommendations, provide a framework for creating an optimal, efficient neuropsychological test battery for PD-MCI diagnosis, and offer specific test recommendations.

### How valid is the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in the community? [^111SbD9j]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease are later found to have an erroneous diagnosis, often only when they come to necropsy; conversely, many patients with Parkinson's disease in the community remain undiagnosed.

Objective

To assess the validity of a clinical diagnosis of parkinsonism in the general population according to strict published criteria.

Methods

As part of a population based study on the prevalence of Parkinson's disease in London, all patients were identified with a diagnosis of parkinsonism, tremor with onset over age 50 years, or who had ever received antiparkinsonian drugs. All patients who agreed to participate were diagnosed according to strict clinical diagnostic criteria, after a detailed neurological interview and examination and discussion of the findings with examination of their video recordings. Follow up information was obtained over a period of at least one year, and atypical cases were reviewed at the end of the study.

Results

A diagnosis of probable Parkinson's disease was confirmed in 83% of patients with this diagnosis, including three (2%) in whom atypical features were found that were insufficient to discard a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Two additional patients (2%) were found to have possible Parkinson's disease. However, in 15% of patients the diagnosis was unequivocally rejected. Conversely, 13 patients who had previously not been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (19%) were found to have this disorder.

Conclusions

At least 15% of patients with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in the population do not fulfil strict clinical criteria for the disease, and approximately 20% of patients with Parkinson's disease who have already come to medical attention have not been diagnosed as such.

### Definition and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^113yTjcv]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate definition and operational criteria for diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD) are crucial for evidence-based, patient-centered care.

Objective

To offer evidence-based recommendations for defining and diagnosing PD, incorporating contemporary clinical, imaging, biomarker, and genetic insights.

Methods

The guideline development began with the steering committee establishing key PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcome) questions, which were refined by the coauthors. Systematic literature searches identified relevant studies, reviews, and meta-analyses. Recommendations were drafted, evaluated, optimized, and voted upon by the German Parkinson's Guideline Group.

Results

Parkinson's disease (PD) is now understood to encompass a broader spectrum of etiologies than previously recognized. Advances in molecular pathogenesis, neuroimaging, and early clinical phenotypes suggest that PD is not a uniform disease entity and is often not idiopathic. This necessitates an updated framework for PD definition and diagnosis. The German Society for Neurology now endorses a broader concept of PD, incorporating both idiopathic and hereditary forms, as opposed to the previously narrower concept of "idiopathic Parkinson syndrome". The revised guidelines recommend using the 2015 Movement Disorders Society diagnostic criteria, emphasize the importance of long-term clinical follow-up for improved diagnostic accuracy, and highlight the significance of non-motor symptoms in clinical diagnosis. Specific recommendations are provided for the use of imaging and fluid biomarkers and genetic testing to support the clinical diagnosis.

Conclusion

The updated guidelines from the German Society for Neurology enhance diagnostic accuracy for PD, promoting optimized clinical care.

### Parkinson's disease [^115JyPok]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Parkinson's disease is the most common serious movement disorder in the world, affecting about 1% of adults older than 60 years. The disease is attributed to selective loss of neurons in the substantia nigra, and its cause is enigmatic in most individuals. Symptoms of Parkinson's disease respond in varying degrees to drugs, and surgery offers hope for patients no longer adequately controlled in this manner. The high prevalence of the disease, and important advances in its management, mean that generalists need to have a working knowledge of this disorder. This Seminar covers the basics, from terminology to aspects of diagnosis, treatment, and pathogenesis.

Methodology

Key PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcome) questions for the chapters were initially established by the steering committee of the Guideline Group "Parkinson's Disease" commissioned by the German Society of Neurology and then refined by the respective chapter author groups. A systematic computer-based literature search based on citations collected by the National Library of Medicine — National Institutes of Health, was conducted based on these questions, identifying relevant studies, reviews, and meta-analyses. This identified literature was further supplemented by additional sources found by the chapter authors. The chapter authors drafted background texts and recommendations, which were then put to an online vote by all members of the German Parkinson Guideline Group. Recommendations that received less than 85% consensus were discussed in online meetings of the group. Recommendations with over 95% approval were considered to have "strong consensus", while those with 75–95% approval were labeled as "consensus".

The complete guideline was published in November 2023 by the DGN and the Association of Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF). This article presents an abbreviated and translated version of the guideline chapters addressing the definition and diagnosis of PD. A detailed description of the methodological approach can be found in the original guideline (in German) at:.
