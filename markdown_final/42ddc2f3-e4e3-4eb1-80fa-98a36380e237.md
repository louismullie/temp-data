## Question

What are the specific pharmacological agents used to reduce ammonia production in the gut for halitosis treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pharmacological agents are used to reduce ammonia production in the gut and whether any of these are used for halitosis treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of gut-derived ammonia and how it relates to halitosis. Then, I should identify agents that mechanistically reduce intestinal ammonia production or absorption. Next, I will verify which of these have evidence for halitosis management. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically grounded conclusion and highlight any gaps or cautions in applying these data to halitosis care.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Halitosis is overwhelmingly an oral problem driven by bacterial putrefaction of proteins and volatile sulfur compounds on the tongue and in periodontal niches, with only a minority of cases attributable to non-oral sources; when systemic or gastrointestinal sources are suspected, the evidence base is limited and management focuses on treating the underlying condition rather than using gut ammonia–lowering drugs for breath odor per se [^113NmcfA] [^111LhgSo].

> Now, I need to check which agents actually reduce gut ammonia. Mechanistically, three classes stand out: nonabsorbable disaccharides like lactulose that acidify the colon and trap ammonia as nonabsorbable ammonium; minimally absorbed antibiotics like rifaximin that reduce urease-producing bacteria; and direct urease inhibitors such as acetohydroxamic acid and the investigational 2-octynohydroxamic acid that block urea hydrolysis to ammonia [^115p5g3c] [^111VxYPk] [^114qs6Kt] [^116h7Hwj] [^114YUGje].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for each. Lactulose is FDA-approved for portal-systemic encephalopathy and reduces blood ammonia by roughly 25–50% via acidification and catharsis, with clinical response in about three quarters of patients, which supports its ammonia-lowering effect in the gut lumen [^112hwRVK] [^1177aTpN]. Rifaximin is supported by randomized trials and meta-analyses showing reduced recurrence of hepatic encephalopathy and improved quality of life, with a mechanism that includes suppression of ammonia-producing bacteria and modulation of the gut microbiome, though it is typically used with lactulose rather than as monotherapy in practice [^114qs6Kt] [^116ANzEi]. The hydroxamate urease inhibitors are promising preclinical candidates; 2-octynohydroxamic acid reduced ammonemia in rodent models of liver disease, but there are no human halitosis data yet and formulation work is ongoing, so clinical applicability remains uncertain [^114YUGje] [^112knwvU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about halitosis. I should confirm whether any of these gut-directed ammonia-lowering agents have been studied for breath odor. The Cochrane review of halitosis interventions focuses on oral hygiene measures, mechanical debridement, and topical mouthrinses or dentifrices with antibacterial or odor-neutralizing agents; there are no trials of lactulose, rifaximin, or urease inhibitors for halitosis, and expert guidelines similarly emphasize oral cavity–targeted strategies rather than systemic or gut-directed pharmacotherapy for breath malodor [^111LhgSo] [^113NmcfA] [^117M49X3].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could there be an indirect rationale via SIBO or other GI overgrowth syndromes. Rifaximin is effective for SIBO in selected contexts, and some have speculated about nitazoxanide reducing urease-producing bacteria, but these data do not translate into validated halitosis indications; moreover, rifaximin's highest-quality evidence in cirrhosis is as an add-on to lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy prevention, not for halitosis, and nitazoxanide's ammonia-lowering signal is preliminary and not established for breath outcomes [^114s9exh] [^114qs6Kt] [^116rTYG8].

> I should double-check safety and feasibility if someone were to extrapolate these agents to halitosis. Lactulose commonly causes bloating, diarrhea, and electrolyte shifts and requires titration to multiple daily bowel movements, which is disproportionate for a cosmetic symptom like halitosis. Rifaximin is expensive and carries antimicrobial stewardship considerations. And urease inhibitors like acetohydroxamic acid have systemic toxicities and are reserved for specific urea-splitting infections, underscoring that the risk-benefit calculus does not favor off-label gut ammonia–lowering therapy for halitosis [^115Py8sa] [^1172SD8u] [^111reLMJ] [^116h7Hwj].

> Let me reconsider the core question and synthesize. Agents that reduce gut ammonia production include lactulose, rifaximin, and investigational urease inhibitors such as 2-octynohydroxamic acid. However, none of these are indicated, recommended, or studied for halitosis, and current halitosis management relies on oral cavity–focused measures such as tongue cleaning, antibacterial mouthrinses, and zinc-containing products, with treatment of underlying oral or systemic disease when present [^111LhgSo] [^113NmcfA] [^117M49X3].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is precise: while lactulose, rifaximin, and urease inhibitors can lower gut ammonia in hepatic encephalopathy and related hyperammonemia states, there is no evidence base supporting their use for halitosis, and standard halitosis care should remain oral-hygiene centered with attention to identifiable sources of malodor rather than gut ammonia modulation [^111LhgSo] [^113NmcfA].

There are **no pharmacological agents** that directly reduce ammonia production in the gut for halitosis treatment. Halitosis is primarily due to oral bacterial metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, not gut ammonia [^113NmcfA]. Standard care is **oral hygiene**, antibacterial mouthwashes, and zinc-containing products [^111LhgSo] [^116jweYe]. Agents that reduce gut ammonia (lactulose, rifaximin, urease inhibitors) are used for hepatic encephalopathy and are not indicated for halitosis [^114qs6Kt] [^111reLMJ] [^114YUGje].

## Pharmacological agents reducing gut ammonia production

Several agents reduce gut ammonia production, but they are used for hepatic encephalopathy or other hyperammonemia states, **not for halitosis**:

| **Agent** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Lactulose | - Non-absorbable disaccharide <br/> - Acidifies colon <br/> - Converts NH3 to NH4+ <br/> - Reduces absorption <br/> - Cathartic effect | Hepatic encephalopathy [^112hwRVK] [^115p5g3c] |
| Rifaximin | - Minimally absorbed antibiotic <br/> - Reduces urease-producing bacteria <br/> - Lowers ammonia production | Hepatic encephalopathy [^114qs6Kt] [^116ANzEi] |
| Urease inhibitors (e.g. acetohydroxamic acid) | Inhibit bacterial urease, reducing urea hydrolysis and ammonia production | Urinary tract infections with urea-splitting bacteria [^116h7Hwj] |
| 2-octynohydroxamic acid | Investigational urease inhibitor reducing ammonia production | Hepatic encephalopathy (preclinical) [^112Bftvo] [^114YUGje] |

---

## Relevance to halitosis treatment

Halitosis is mainly due to oral bacterial metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, producing volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) such as hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan [^113NmcfA]. Gut ammonia plays a **minimal role** in halitosis, so agents that reduce gut ammonia are not indicated or effective for halitosis.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **oral hygiene**, antibacterial mouthwashes, and zinc-containing products for halitosis [^113NmcfA] [^117M49X3]. There is **no recommendation** to use gut ammonia–lowering agents for halitosis.

---

## Safety considerations and potential side effects

Using gut ammonia–lowering agents for halitosis is unsupported and may cause adverse effects:

- **Lactulose**: Diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, abdominal discomfort [^115Py8sa].
- **Rifaximin**: Antibiotic resistance, gastrointestinal symptoms, rare hypersensitivity [^112GnqxC].
- **Urease inhibitors**: Gastrointestinal symptoms, hematologic abnormalities, teratogenicity.

---

## Conclusion and future directions

There are **no pharmacological agents** that directly reduce gut ammonia production for halitosis treatment. Halitosis management should focus on oral hygiene, antibacterial mouthwashes, and zinc-containing products [^111LhgSo]. Gut ammonia–lowering agents are for hepatic encephalopathy or other hyperammonemia states, not halitosis [^113X6aHe].

See Editorial on Page 764

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) constitutes a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities ranging from confusion to coma.–It is typically reversible, although patients do not always recover to the original level of function, and it represents a major burden to patients, families, and the health care system.–

The pathophysiology of HE is incompletely understood. Though elevated blood ammonia has long been suspected as important, the evidence is largely correlative, other factors have been postulated, and evidence against ammonia has been reported.–Current treatments, including poorly absorbed disaccharides (e.g. lactulose) and antibiotics (e.g. rifaximin), may act by reducing ammonia production and/or absorption in the intestine, but are not ammonia selective.

Glycerol phenylbutyrate (GPB; HPN-100; Hyperion Therapeutics, Inc. South San Francisco, CA) is approved for treatment of urea cycle disorders, inherited disorders manifested by hyperammonemia,–and is under development for HE.GPB consists of three molecules of phenylbutyric acid (PBA) joined to glycerol by ester linkage and is an odorless, nearly tasteless sodium-free liquid that acts by providing an alternate pathway for ammonia removal and waste nitrogen excretion in the form of urinary phenylacetyl glutamine (PAGN).–

A 4-week open-label study indicated that 6 mL of GPB given orally twice-daily with food was well tolerated and lowered ammonia in patients with cirrhosis and HE. Therefore, we performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study to test the hypothesis that lowering ammonia using this agent in patients with HE would decrease the likelihood of patients experiencing HE events.

### Ammonia-lowering strategies for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy [^115dHJXb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Hyperammonemia leads to neurotoxic levels of brain ammonia and is a major factor involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Ammonia-lowering treatments primarily involve two strategies: inhibiting ammonia production and/or increasing ammonia removal. Targeting the gut has been the primary focus for many years, with the goal of inhibiting the generation of ammonia. However, in the context of liver failure, extrahepatic organs containing ammonia metabolic pathways have become new potential ammonia-lowering targets. Skeletal muscle has the capacity to remove ammonia by producing glutamine through the enzyme glutamine synthetase (amidation of glutamate) and, given its large mass, has the potential to be an important ammonia-removing organ. On the other hand, glutamine can be deaminated to glutamate by phosphate-activated glutaminase, thus releasing ammonia (ammonia rebound). Therefore, new treatment strategies are being focused on stimulating the removal of both ammonia and glutamine.

Introduction

Patients with an impaired liver function caused by end-stage liver disease or liver failure can develop hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Brain function is impaired in HE. Even though the precise underlying pathophysiology of HE is unclear, it is widely accepted that increased amounts of ammonia in the systemic circulation is a key factor. Ammonia is produced during the metabolism of amino acids and other compounds that contain nitrogen and in the intestine by intestinal bacterial flora. Physiologically ammonia is cleared in the liver where it is converted to urea via the urea cycle. Urea is water-soluble and is subsequently excreted via the urine. If this system is somehow compromised, systemic ammonia levels rise, with the potential to cross the blood–brain barrier and cause brain damage. When ammonia levels rise acutely, astrocytes increase the conversion of ammonia into glutamine via glutamine synthase, which causes brain edema. Second, due to the increased glutamine production, there is an increase of reactive oxygen species, which triggers inflammatory cascades. It is hypothesized that, in chronically elevated ammonia, the enzyme glutamine synthase is downregulated, resulting in lower glutamine and higher brain ammonia levels. Ammonia is also directly neurotoxic, enhancing inhibitory signaling through multiple mechanisms, including GABA and glutamate. In patients with liver disease, HE is a predictor of poor outcome, and it is associated with a 1-year mortality of up to 54% and, therefore, a serious complication. Currently, treatment for HE in hepatic failure or portosystemic shunting is directed at reducing ammonia concentrations by reducing production and absorption in the intestines, mainly through the use of nonabsorbable disaccharides, such as lactulose and lactitol, and antibiotics such as rifaximin. However, no universally accepted guidelines for the treatment of HE exist.

In addition, our understanding of SIBO and its treatment has become much more nuanced since the beginning of the study. For example, we now know that rather than testing for hydrogen and methane alone, testing for hydrogen sulfide by hydrogen lactulose breath testing increases the ability to diagnose SIBO when it results in the production of this gas. In addition to nonabsorbable antibiotics, the use of adjunctive pharmacotherapies such as neomycin and metronidazole and/or bismuth compounds may be necessary to eradicate overgrowth bacteria, especially in cases of methane-predominant SIBO.

Bacterial culture of L. murinus and S. ruber

Ligillacotobacillus murinus (DSM 20452, L. murinus) and Salinibacter ruber (DSM 13855, S. ruber) were purchased from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). All culture media were autoclaved right after the preparation. L. murinus was activated in 5 mL MRS medium (CARLROTH, Karlsruhe, Germany; prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 220 rpm agitation. At the end of this incubation period, 1 mL of the L. murinus culture was taken and centrifuged at 3200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the bacterial pellet was gently resuspended in 5 mL SILAC-heavy medium (Glucose 10 g/L, KH 2 PO 4 3 g/L, K 2 HPO 4 3 g/L, sodium acetate 5 g/L, ammonium citrate dibasic 1 g/L, MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O 0.2 g/L, MnSO 4 ·4H 2 O 0.05 g/L, Tween-80 1 g/L, L-alanine 0.05 g/L, L-arginine-HCl (13C 6, 15N 4; Fischer Scientific) 0.05 g/L, L-asparagine 0.1 g/L, L-aspartic acid 0.1 g/L, L-cysteine 0.2 g/L, L-glutamine 0.1 g/L, L-glutamic acid 0.1 g/L, glycine 0.05 g/L, L-histidine 0.05 g/L, L-isoleucine 0.05 g/L, L-leucine 0.05 g/L, L-lysine-2HCl (13C 6, 15N 2; Fischer Scientific) 0.05 g/L, L-methionine 0.05 g/L, L-phenylalanine 0.05 g/L, L-proline 0.05 g/L, L-serine 0.05 g/L, L-threonine 0.05 g/L, L-tryptophan 0.05 g/L, L-tyrosine 0.05 g/L, L-valine 0.05 g/L, uracil 0.01 g/L, guanine 0.01 g/L, adenine 0.01 g/L, xanthine 0.01 g/L, biotin 0.01 g/, Vitamin Solution 2% (v/v)). The heavy-medium culture was incubated at 37 °C with 220 rpm agitation for 24 h. Bacterial growth was monitored with spectrophotometric measurements (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at an optical density of 600 nm (OD600). An OD600 above 0.8 was aimed to ensure suitable growth conditions. For daily passage, 500 μL of L. murinus culture were taken and transferred to another 5 mL SILAC-heavy medium. The labeling efficiency was evaluated on timsTOF Pro after 10 passages in heavy-medium culture. S. ruber was cultured in 5 mL DMSZ-936 medium according to the recommendation at 37 °C with 220 rpm agitation. The duration between passages for S. ruber was around 7 days due to its slow growth. For enlarged culture, 1 mL/each of L. murinus and S. ruber cultures were transferred to 30 mL medium, respectively. At the end of cultivation, 2 mL bacteria aliquots were made and pelleted at 3200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and one of the aliquots was resuspended in 2 mL of either pre-chilled PBS (L. murinus) or DSMZ-936 medium (S. ruber). The resuspended bacteria were further serial diluted (2–50 times dilution) with either PBS (L. murinus) or DSMZ-936 medium (S. ruber) for bacteria counting using QUANTOM Tx Microbial Cell Counter (BioCat, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the procedures supplied with the device. The rest of the aliquots were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until further use.

### Gut microbiome-derived ammonia modulates stress vulnerability in the host [^113apTXk]. Nature Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Ammonia has been long recognized as a metabolic waste product with well-known neurotoxic effects. However, little is known about the beneficial function of endogenous ammonia. Here, we show that gut ammonia links microbe nitrogen metabolism to host stress vulnerability by maintaining brain glutamine availability in male mice. Chronic stress decreases blood ammonia levels by altering gut urease-positive microbiota. A representative urease-producing strain, Streptococcus thermophilus, can reverse depression-like behaviours induced by gut microbiota that was altered by stress, whereas pharmacological inhibition of gut ammonia production increases stress vulnerability. Notably, abnormally low blood ammonia levels limit the brain's availability of glutamine, a key metabolite produced by astrocytes that is required for presynaptic γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) replenishment and confers stress vulnerability through cortical GABAergic dysfunction. Of therapeutic interest, ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl), a commonly used expectorant in the clinic, can rescue behavioural abnormalities and GABAergic deficits in mouse models of depression. In sum, ammonia produced by the gut microbiome can help buffer stress in the host, providing a gut-brain signalling basis for emotional behaviour.

### Probiotics prevent hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis: a randomized controlled trial [^115CW43h]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with advanced liver disease. Probiotics alter the intestinal microbiota with non-urease-producing organisms that reduce production of ammonia. We investigated the efficacy of probiotics for the primary prophylaxis of HE.

Methods

We conducted a prospective trial at a tertiary care referral institute in New Delhi, India, from January 2012 through March 2013, of patients with cirrhosis without overt HE (age, 48.6 ± 11.1 y; 96 men and 64 women); 25 were Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class A, 51 were CTP class B, and 84 were CTP class C. Subjects were assigned randomly to groups given probiotics (1 × 10(8) colony-forming units, 3 times daily; n = 86, 42 with minimal HE) or no test article (control, n = 74; 33 with minimal HE). All subjects underwent psychometric analyses, critical flicker fusion (CFF) threshold assessments, glucose hydrogen breath tests to identify small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), and lactulose hydrogen breath tests to measure orocecal transit time (OCTT). The primary end point was the development of overt HE.

Results

At baseline, subjects in each group had comparable CTP score, model for end-stage liver disease scores, CFF assessments, psychometric hepatic encephalopathy scores, and OCTT. After a mean follow-up period of 38.6 ± 8.80 weeks for patients given probiotics and 40.3 ± 9.8 weeks for controls, 6 patients given probiotics and 7 controls died (P = 0.81). Three months of probiotic administration significantly reduced levels of arterial ammonia, SIBO, and OCTT; increased psychometric hepatic encephalopathy scores; and increased CFF thresholds, compared with baseline. Seven subjects in the probiotic group and 14 controls developed overt HE (P < .05; hazard ratio for controls vs probiotic group, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–6.53). Psychometric hepatic encephalopathy scores, CTP scores, and SIBO correlated with the development of overt HE.

Conclusions

In a prospective, randomized controlled trial, probiotics were found to be effective in preventing HE in patients with cirrhosis. Trial registration No: CTRI/2012/07/002807.

### Lactulose (Generlac) [^115p5g3c]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Lactulose causes a decrease in blood ammonia concentration and reduces the degree of portal-systemic encephalopathy. These actions are considered to be results of the following:

Bacterial degradation of lactulose in the colon acidifies the colonic contents.
This acidification of colonic contents results in the retention of ammonia in the colon as the ammonium ion. Since the colonic contents are then more acid than the blood, ammonia can be expected to migrate from the blood into the colon to form the ammonium ion.
The acid colonic contents convert NH3to the ammonium ion [NH4]+, trapping it and preventing its absorption.
The laxative action of the metabolites of lactulose then expels the trapped ammonium ion from the colon.

Experimental data indicate that lactulose is poorly absorbed. Lactulose given orally to man and experimental animals resulted in only small amounts reaching the blood. Urinary excretion has been determined to be 3% or less and is essentially complete within 24 hours.

When incubated with extracts of human small intestinal mucosa, lactulose was not hydrolyzed during a 24-hour period and did not inhibit the activity of these extracts on lactose. Lactulose reaches the colon essentially unchanged. There it is metabolized by bacteria with the formation of low molecular weight acids that acidify the colon contents.

### Combination therapy for the treatment and prevention of hepatic encephalopathy [^117GXQHg]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy for the treatment and prevention of hepatic encephalopathy (HE).

Data Sources

A PubMed MEDLINE search was conducted (1947-June 2012) using the key terms lactulose, lactitol, nonabsorbable disaccharide, metronidazole, rifaximin, neomycin, probiotics, and hepatic encephalopathy. Searches were limited to include articles published in English.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Study selection included published trials, case reports, and case series of humans with HE who were treated with combination therapy of rifaximin, lactulose, lactitol, metronidazole, neomycin, and/or probiotics.

Data Synthesis

Only 6 studies that evaluated the benefits of combination drug therapy in the treatment or prevention of HE were available for review. Four studies addressed the treatment of HE, 2 found no significant difference between lactulose/neomycin versus placebo or rifaximin/lactulose, 1 assessed the use of rifaximin/lactulose without a control group, and the fourth found no significant difference between lactulose/probiotics versus either drug alone, although each group showed improvement from baseline. In the 2 prevention trials, both of which stemmed from the same data, the combination of rifaximin/lactulose was superior to lactulose alone, showing significant improvement in mental status, blood ammonia levels, and health-related quality of life and reductions in HE recurrence and hospitalization. Currently, there are no available clinical studies evaluating dual antibiotic therapy, metronidazole with nonabsorbable disaccharides, or antibiotics with probiotics.

Conclusions

The evidence evaluating the use of combination therapy for the treatment of HE does not support its widespread use. The combination of rifaximin and lactulose may be considered in the treatment of HE and in patients refractory to monotherapy. The combination of rifaximin and lactulose should be considered for the prevention of HE, especially after the second episode of HE recurrence.

### Interventions for managing halitosis [^111LhgSo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Halitosis or bad breath is a symptom in which a noticeably unpleasant breath odour is present due to an underlying oral or systemic disease. 50% to 60% of the world population has experienced this problem which can lead to social stigma and loss of self-confidence. Multiple interventions have been tried to control halitosis ranging from mouthwashes and toothpastes to lasers. This new Cochrane Review incorporates Cochrane Reviews previously published on tongue scraping and mouthrinses for halitosis.

Objectives

The objectives of this review were to assess the effects of various interventions used to control halitosis due to oral diseases only. We excluded studies including patients with halitosis secondary to systemic disease and halitosis-masking interventions.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 8 April 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 3) in the Cochrane Library (searched 8 April 2019), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 8 April 2019), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 8 April 2019). We also searched LILACS BIREME (1982 to 19 April 2019), the National Database of Indian Medical Journals (1985 to 19 April 2019), OpenGrey (1992 to 19 April 2019), and CINAHL EBSCO (1937 to 19 April 2019). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (8 April 2019), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (8 April 2019), the ISRCTN Registry (19 April 2019), the Clinical Trials Registry - India (19 April 2019), were searched for ongoing trials. We also searched the cross-references of included studies and systematic reviews published on the topic. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which involved adults over the age of 16, and any intervention for managing halitosis compared to another or placebo, or no intervention. The active interventions or controls were administered over a minimum of one week and with no upper time limit. We excluded quasi-randomised trials, trials comparing the results for less than one week follow-up, and studies including advanced periodontitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two pairs of review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We estimated mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 44 trials in the review with 1809 participants comparing an intervention with a placebo or a control. The age of participants ranged from 17 to 77 years. Most of the trials reported on short-term follow-up (ranging from one week to four weeks). Only one trial reported long-term follow-up (three months). Three studies were at low overall risk of bias, 16 at high overall risk of bias, and the remaining 25 at unclear overall risk of bias. We compared different types of interventions which were categorised as mechanical debridement, chewing gums, systemic deodorising agents, topical agents, toothpastes, mouthrinse/mouthwash, tablets, and combination methods. Mechanical debridement: for mechanical tongue cleaning versus no tongue cleaning, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported organoleptic test (OLT) scores (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.07; 2 trials, 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Chewing gums: for 0.6% eucalyptus chewing gum versus placebo chewing gum, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.11; 1 trial, 65 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Systemic deodorising agents: for 1000 mg champignon versus placebo, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome patient-reported visual analogue scale (VAS) scores (MD -1.07, 95% CI -14.51 to 12.37; 1 trial, 40 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for dentist-reported OLT score or adverse events. Topical agents: for hinokitiol gel versus placebo gel, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.27, 95% CI -1.26 to 0.72; 1 trial, 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Toothpastes: for 0.3% triclosan toothpaste versus control toothpaste, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -3.48, 95% CI -3.77 to -3.19; 1 trial, 81 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Mouthrinse/mouthwash: for mouthwash containing chlorhexidine and zinc acetate versus placebo mouthwash, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.18; 1 trial, 44 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Tablets: no data were reported on key outcomes for this comparison. Combination methods: for brushing plus cetylpyridium mouthwash versus brushing, the evidence was uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.24; 1 trial, 70 participants; low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low- to very low-certainty evidence to support the effectiveness of interventions for managing halitosis compared to placebo or control for the OLT and patient-reported outcomes tested. We were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the superiority of any intervention or concentration. Well-planned RCTs need to be conducted by standardising the interventions and concentrations.

### Further concerns about glutamine: a case report on hyperammonemic encephalopathy [^112omMFZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

We report a case of a woman with hyperammonemic encephalopathy following glutamine supplementation.

Design

Case report.

Interventions

Plasma amino acid analysis suggestive of a urea cycle defect and initiation of a treatment with lactulose and the two ammonia scavenger drugs sodium benzoate and phenylacetate. Together with a restricted protein intake ammonia and glutamine plasma levels decreased with subsequent improvement of the neurological status.

Measurements and Main Results

Massive catabolism and exogenous glutamine administration may have contributed to hyperammonemia and hyperglutaminemia in this patient.

Conclusion

This case adds further concerns regarding glutamine administration to critically ill patients and implies the importance of monitoring ammonia and glutamine serum levels in such patients.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper on the diagnosis and management of pediatric acute liver failure [^113dBSR5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) — hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and hyperammonemia: Clinical management includes head elevation and environmental/safety measures, specifically to elevate head to 30°, use a dim and quiet room with no sudden noises or unnecessary chatter, place pads on bed rails to prevent injury from sudden movements or combative behavior, and minimize tracheal suctioning if intubated. Medical management notes that the intraluminal environment favors conversion of ammonia (NH3) to ammonium (NH4+) thus decreasing intestinal absorption; rifaximin to alter intestinal microbiome and decrease NH3 production with efficacy comparable to lactulose in adults but very sparse data in children; there are conflicting studies on the efficacy of L-ornithine-L-aspartate in adults, but it has not been tested satisfactorily in children; and consideration of empiric antibiotics and extracorporeal support devices.

### Lactulose solution usp, 10 g / 15 mL (lactulose solution) [^111K2k8Z]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Lactulose causes a decrease in blood ammonia concentration and reduces the degree of portal-systemic encephalopathy. These actions are considered to be results of the following:

Bacterial degradation of lactulose in the colon acidifies the colonic contents.
This acidification of colonic contents results in the retention of ammonia in the colon as the ammonium ion. Since the colonic contents are then more acid than the blood, ammonia can be expected to migrate from the blood into the colon to form the ammonium ion.
The acid colonic contents convert NH3to the ammonium ion [NH4]+, trapping it and preventing its absorption.
The laxative action of the metabolites of lactulose then expels the trapped ammonium ion from the colon.

Experimental data indicate that lactulose is poorly absorbed. Lactulose given orally to man and experimental animals resulted in only small amounts reaching the blood. Urinary excretion has been determined to be 3% or less and is essentially complete within 24 hours.

When incubated with extracts of human small intestinal mucosa, lactulose was not hydrolyzed during a 24-hour period and did not inhibit the activity of these extracts on lactose. Lactulose reaches the colon essentially unchanged. There it is metabolized by bacteria with the formation of low molecular weight acids that acidify the colon contents.

### Ammonia levels and hepatic encephalopathy in patients with known chronic liver disease [^114tYJ6x]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Ammonia is predominantly generated in the gut by intestinal bacteria and enzymes and detoxified primarily in the liver. Since the 1930s, ammonia has been identified as the principal culprit in hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Many physicians utilize serum ammonia to diagnose, assess severity, and determine the resolution of HE in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) despite research showing that ammonia levels are unhelpful in all of these clinical circumstances. HE in patients with CLD is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion that should not be based on ammonia levels.

### Rifaximin for prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis [^114qs6Kt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatic encephalopathy describes the spectrum of neuropsychiatric changes that may complicate the course of cirrhosis and detrimentally affect outcomes. Ammonia plays a key role in its development. Rifaximin is a non-absorbable antibiotic that inhibits urease-producing bacteria and reduces absorption of dietary and bacterial ammonia.

Objectives

To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of rifaximin versus placebo, no intervention, or non-absorbable disaccharides for: (i) the prevention of hepatic encephalopathy, and (ii) the treatment of minimal and overt hepatic encephalopathy, in people with cirrhosis, both when used alone and when combined with a non-absorbable disaccharide.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Clinical Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, the reference lists of identified papers, and relevant conference proceedings. We wrote to authors and pharmaceutical companies for information on other published, unpublished, or ongoing trials. Searches were performed to January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials assessing prevention or treatment of hepatic encephalopathy with rifaximin alone, or with a non-absorbable disaccharide, versus placebo/no intervention, or a non-absorbable disaccharide alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Six authors independently searched for studies, extracted data, and validated findings. We assessed the design, bias risk, and participant/intervention characteristics of the included studies. We assessed mortality, serious adverse events, health-related quality of life, hepatic encephalopathy, non-serious adverse events, blood ammonia, Number Connection Test-A, and length of hospital stay.

Main Results

We included 41 trials involving 4545 people with, or at risk for, developing hepatic encephalopathy. We excluded 89 trials and identified 13 ongoing studies. Some trials involved participants with more than one type of hepatic encephalopathy or more than one treatment comparison. Hepatic encephalopathy was classed as acute (13 trials), chronic (7 trials), or minimal (8 trials), or else participants were considered at risk for its development (13 trials). The control groups received placebo (12 trials), no/standard treatment (1 trial), or a non-absorbable disaccharide (14 trials). Eighteen trials assessed rifaximin plus a non-absorbable disaccharide versus a non-absorbable disaccharide alone. We classified 11 trials as at high risk of overall bias for mortality and 28 for non-mortality outcomes, mainly due to lack of blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting. Compared to placebo/no intervention, rifaximin likely has no overall effect on mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 1.38; P = 48, I² = 0%; 13 trials, 1007 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and there may be no overall effect when compared to non-absorbable disaccharides (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.97; P = 0.97, I² = 0%; 10 trials, 786 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, there is likely a reduction in the overall risk of mortality when comparing rifaximin plus a non-absorbable disaccharide to a non-absorbable disaccharide alone (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.86; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 22; P = 0.001, I² = 0%; 14 trials, 1946 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There is likely no effect on the overall risk of serious adverse events when comparing rifaximin to placebo/no intervention (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.32; P = 68, I² = 0%; 9 trials, 801 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and there may be no overall effect when compared to non-absorbable disaccharides (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.40; P = 85, I² = 0%; 8 trials, 681 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, there was very low-certainty evidence that use of rifaximin plus a non-absorbable disaccharide may be associated with a lower risk of serious adverse events than use of a non-absorbable disaccharide alone (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.98; P = 0.04, I² = 60%; 7 trials, 1076 participants). Rifaximin likely results in an overall effect on health-related quality of life when compared to placebo/no intervention (mean difference (MD) -1.43, 95% CI -2.87 to 0.02; P = 0.05, I² = 81%; 4 trials, 214 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and may benefit health-related quality of life in people with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MD -2.07, 95% CI -2.79 to -1.35; P < 0.001, I² = 0%; 3 trials, 176 participants). The overall effect on health-related quality of life when comparing rifaximin to non-absorbable disaccharides is very uncertain (MD -0.33, 95% CI -1.65 to 0.98; P = 0.62, I² = 0%; 2 trials, 249 participants; very low-certainty evidence). None of the combined rifaximin/non-absorbable disaccharide trials reported on this outcome. There is likely an overall beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy when comparing rifaximin to placebo/no intervention (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.77; NNTB = 5; P < 0.001, I² = 68%; 13 trials, 1009 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This effect may be more marked in people with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.52; NNTB = 3; P < 0.001, I² = 10%; 6 trials, 364 participants) and in prevention trials (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.91; NNTB = 10; P = 0.007, I² = 36%; 4 trials, 474 participants). There may be little overall effect on hepatic encephalopathy when comparing rifaximin to non-absorbable disaccharides (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05; P = 0.13, I² = 0%; 13 trials, 921 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, there may be an overall beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy when comparing rifaximin plus a non-absorbable disaccharide to a non-absorbable disaccharide alone (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.71; NNTB = 5; P < 0.001, I² = 62%; 17 trials, 2332 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Compared to placebo/no intervention, rifaximin likely improves health-related quality of life in people with minimal hepatic encephalopathy, and may improve hepatic encephalopathy, particularly in populations with minimal hepatic encephalopathy and when it is used for prevention. Rifaximin likely has no overall effect on mortality, serious adverse events, health-related quality of life, or hepatic encephalopathy compared to non-absorbable disaccharides. However, when used in combination with a non-absorbable disaccharide, it likely reduces overall mortality risk, the risk of serious adverse events, improves hepatic encephalopathy, reduces the length of hospital stay, and prevents the occurrence/recurrence of hepatic encephalopathy. The certainty of evidence for these outcomes is very low to moderate; further high-quality trials are needed.

### Dispelling myths in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy [^1139Jmbj]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Guidelines for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy suggest ammonia reduction as the main focus, based on strategies to reduce ammonia's generation and absorption in the colon by using lactulose and a reduced protein diet.

Starting Point

Two studies provide compelling and provocative data questioning the relevance of these interventions. Bodils Als-Nielsen and colleagues, in a systematic review of randomised trials, found insufficient evidence about whether non-absorbable disaccharides are beneficial (BMJ 2004; 328: 1046–50). In a small randomised study, Juan Cordoba and colleagues showed that diets with normal protein content can be administered safely during episodic hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis and that protein restriction does not have any beneficial effect during such episodes (J Hepatol 2004; 41: 38–43).

Where Next

Two approaches to new therapies for hepatic encephalopathy are needed. First, it is important to focus on the interorgan metabolism of ammonia. The small intestine and kidneys might be important producers of ammonia, and muscle is an important organ that can remove ammonia. Novel therapies targeting these organs reduce ammonia. Second, research is needed to explore factors other than ammonia that might be important in hepatic encephalopathy, including the synergistic role of inflammation. The lack of conclusive data about the efficacy of any treatment supports the view that placebo-controlled trials of newer agents are needed and ethical. The emphasis should shift to aggressive management of the precipitating event.

### AGA clinical practice update on small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: expert review [^113zbs2q]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Breath testing — use, thresholds, and methane effects: The use of breath testing in the diagnosis of SIBO has lacked universal acceptance, in part due to inconsistency in performance and interpretation, and studies suggest that a positive breath test for SIBO requires 2 H2 peaks, a criterion that has not been validated. Breath testing is more complex than simply measuring H2; CH4 is also important, CH4 is produced by methanogens, 4 moles of H2 are required to produce 1 mole of CH4, the presence of CH4 suppresses H2 on the breath test, and conventional breath testing measures both H2 and CH4.

### Preventive and therapeutic effects of rifaximin on hepatic encephalopathy with differential application dosages and strategies: a network meta-analysis [^112GnqxC]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

The effective antibacterial concentration of rifaximin has significant implications for its therapeutic efficacy. An in vitro study showed that although rifaximin has a low Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC)50 against intestinal ammonia-producing bacteria, the concentration range between the MIC50 and MIC90 is very large (0.004–128 mg/L). When intestinal bacteria are cultured under sub-MIC rifaximin concentrations, they all exhibit a tendency toward drug resistance. In a clinical study, the efficacy of rifaximin in treating small intestine bacterial overgrowth also showed dose-dependent efficacy. Thus, the dose and application strategy of rifaximin will impact the effective drug concentration within the intestinal environment and further influence the inhibitory effect on ammonia-producing bacteria and their drug resistance, which deserves attention.

For HE prevention, the FDA recommended rifaximin 550 mg b.i.d. However, off-label applications have also been commonly adopted. Retrospective studies suggested that the regimen of 550 mg b.i.d. and the off-label regimen of 400 mg t.i.d. had similar effects on alleviating HE. Additionally, a low dose of 400 mg b.i.d. can also similarly reduce serum endotoxin levels after two weeks of treatment compared to a high dose of 600 mg b.i.d. Since rifaximin is expensive, low doses of rifaximin are associated with low treatment costs and can help improve patient compliance and lead to improved treatment efficacy. Therefore, an evidence-based analysis of the differential doses and application strategies of rifaximin in HE and HE-risk patients could help elucidate the discrepancies among previous meta-analyses, help optimize treatment strategies and costs, and improve patient treatment compliance. This review will analyze the effectiveness of different doses and application strategies of rifaximin in patients with HE and with HE risks.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome [^1133K6qd]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Attacks precipitated by intercurrent illness, fasting, and/or a high protein meal — vomiting induced by metabolic disorders often follows a catabolic state induced by acute illness, fasting, or a high protein meal. A symptomatic metabolic disorder constitutes a medical emergency with substantial risks for morbidity and mortality if appropriate treatment is not instituted promptly. If a metabolic disorder is suspected, then blood and urine for testing should be obtained immediately, followed by delivery of 10% dextrose-containing intravenous fluid at a rate of 1.5 times maintenance, and consultation with a metabolic specialist should be considered. In partial urea cycle enzyme deficiencies, ammonia accumulation may present following the ingestion of a high protein meal or with fasting, and a urea cycle disorder is suggested by a plasma ammonia level of ≥ 150 μmol/L when symptomatic.

### The burden of minimal hepatic encephalopathy: from diagnosis to therapeutic strategies [^111YiqC5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Non-absorbable disaccharides

Lactulose or lactitol are synthetic non-absorbable disaccharides extensively used in the management of OHE. Lactulose is fermented in the colon into acetic and lactic acid, resulting in the acidification of intestinal contents and conversion of ammonia (NH 3) to ammonium (NH 4 +). Unlike ammonia, ammonium is not systemically absorbed and is excreted in stool. Lactulose also has a cathartic effect, increasing nitrogen excretion fourfold.

Although Prasad et al concluded that treatment with lactulose improves both cognitive function and HRQoL in patients with cirrhosis who have MHE, most subsequent studies have not provided strong evidence on the efficacy of non-absorbable disaccharides in MHE treatment. A meta-analysis evaluating the role of pharmacological treatment with non-absorbable disaccharides in patients with MHE failed to show clear evidence that any treatment played a convincing role in improving cognitive function and HRQoL.

Probiotics

Probiotics are live microorganisms that alter the balance of intestinal microflora, and synbiotics are probiotics with the addition of fermentable fiber. It is presumed that reducing intestinal bacterial urease activity decreases the absorption of ammonia and other gut-derived toxins that result in oxidative stress/inflammation.

Seven recently published RCTs have tried to evaluate the role of probiotic treatment/supplementation in treating MHE. Unfortunately, the results do not support the evidence on the efficacy in MHE reversal of a treatment with probiotics alone or in addition to other drugs. In fact, no significant difference in the improvement of MHE, hospitalization rates, or progression to OHE has been reported when probiotics were compared with lactulose.

Branched-chain amino acids

A meta-analysis that evaluated the role of pharmacological treatment with branched-chain amino acids in patients with MHE reported no significant difference in the improvement of MHE.

LOLA (L-ornithine-L-aspartate)

LOLA has been shown to reduce ammonia levels by upregulating glutamine synthetase and urea cycle activity. L-ornithine and L-aspartate are separately metabolized to form glutamate, which, combined with ammonia, results in the formation of glutamine. Therefore, LOLA lowers plasma ammonia concentrations by enhancing the metabolism of ammonia to glutamine. Bai et al evaluated eight RCTs (646 total patients, 46% diagnosed with MHE), assessing the efficacy of LOLA compared to placebo in patients with cirrhosis. Treatment with LOLA diminished serum ammonia levels with no increase in adverse reactions.

### Lethal hyperammonemia in a CAR-T cell recipient due topneumonia: a case report of a unique severe complication [^1179Js3h]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Making a diagnosis of hyperammonemia due to urease-producing organisms is challenging in the CAR-T population. Acute encephalopathy could be due to sepsis or CAR-T therapy itself among other aetiologies. However, elevated ammonia in the setting of normal or near-normal hepatic function is a helpful clue. Given the patient's age, an undiagnosed inborn error of metabolism was also unlikely. However, it cannot be entirely excluded by age and a genetics evaluation should always be pursued in these patients without delaying other treatments. Finally, one must recognise that regular cultures will not detect these organisms and PCR testing is needed to diagnose the infection.

Given the high mortality rate in these populations, we advocate for early empirical coverage for urea-producing organisms in immunocompromised populations with hyperammonemia without evidence of liver disease. Some prior reports have demonstrated successful treatment by following this treatment pathway. Graetz et al reported improved ammonia levels in a BMT patient with Ureaplasma and Legouy et al presented a successfully treated case in a renal transplant patient. In the first case, levofloxacin plus azithromycin were used initially followed by levofloxacin alone. In the latter case, levofloxacin plus doxycycline were used. Although double coverage is not commonly recommended, the success in these cases in lowering ammonia compared with our patient is notable. Given the immunocompromised state of these populations, early double coverage with a macrolide and fluoroquinolone may be necessary to achieve infection control.

Additional treatment modalities for the management of hyperammonemia aim to reduce ammonia production or absorption, increase elimination and reduce neurological effects. Much of the literature stems from treatment of patients with inborn errors of metabolism or hepatic failure. To reduce absorption, lactulose and rifaximin are most commonly used. Lactulose acidifies the intestines causing a hostile environment for bacteria that produce ammonia. Lactulose's cathartic effect promotes gastrointestinal elimination of ammonia. Rifaximin is the preferred antibiotic agent given its broad antimicrobial activity in the intestines and minimal bioavailability. To reduce intestinal production, protein intake should be reduced. Additional steps include suppressing protein catabolism by providing calories via dextrose 10%. Arginine, L-carnitine or branched chain amino acids promote ammonia utilisation and therefore reduction of serum levels. Scavenging agents such as sodium phenylacetate and sodium phenylbutyrate can also promote degradation of ammonia through alternate pathways. Dialysis likewise aids in elimination of ammonia. Specifically for cerebral oedema associated with hyperammonemia, multiple therapies have been deployed with mixed success including hypothermia, N-acetylcysteine and mannitol.

### Efficacy and safety of ornithine phenylacetate for treating overt hepatic encephalopathy in a randomized trial [^1129SjC7]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and health care resource use. In this phase 2b study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of ornithine phenylacetate (OP), an ammonia scavenger, in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis, increased levels of ammonia at screening, and acute or overt HE.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind study of 231 patients with cirrhosis and HE at multiple sites in North America, Europe, Israel, and Australia from January 7, 2014, through December 29, 2016. Patients were assigned randomly to groups that received placebo or OP (10, 15, or 20 g/d, based on the severity of liver disease), plus each institution's standard of care (eg, lactulose to achieve 2–3 bowel movements with or without rifaximin, in accordance with guidelines). The primary end point was time to confirmed clinical response, defined as reduction to HE staging tool (HEST) stage 2 from baseline HEST stages 3/4 or improvement to HEST stages 0/1 from baseline stage 2, in the intent-to-treat population (all patients with increased levels of ammonia at screening, determined by a local laboratory).

Results

Median times to clinical improvement, based on ammonia measurements at local laboratories, did not differ significantly between the groups given OP vs the placebo group (P = 0.129). Analyses of central laboratory-confirmed increases in levels of ammonia at baseline (n = 201) showed clinical improvement in HE at a median of 21 hours sooner in groups given OP vs placebo. The percentages of patients with any specific adverse event did not differ significantly between groups. Serious adverse events occurred in 25% of patients in the OP group and in 29% in the placebo group (P = 0.552).

Conclusions

In a randomized controlled trial of patients with cirrhosis and HE, we found no significant difference in time to clinical improvement between patients given OP vs placebo. However, OP appears to be safe and should undergo further testing for treatment of hyperammonemia in hospitalized patients receiving treatment for the underlying precipitant of acute or overt HE.

### Emergency management of intoxication-type inherited metabolic disorders [^113Lgskk]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3
Summary of management for hyperammonaemia. The boluses of drugs are given over 90 min. IM, intramuscular; IV, intravenous; NG, nasogastric.

L‐arginine should also be given in urea cycle disorders (except arginase deficiency), as the defects prevent its synthesis; it is particularly effective at lowering ammonia acutely in arginosuccinate lyase deficiency. L‐carnitine is often given to patients with undiagnosed hyperammonaemia because it is indicated in organic acidaemias, although it may possibly have a deleterious effect in fatty acid oxidation disorders. Vitamin B12 and biotin may also be given, but few patients with severe hyperammonaemia respond.

Carglumic acid is an analogue of N‐acetylglutamate (NAG), which activates carbamoyl‐phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), the first step in the urea cycle (Figure 2). It is, therefore, the most effective treatment for hyperammonaemia in NAG synthase deficiency and in the branched‐chain organic acidaemias, where the defect leads to NAG synthase inhibition. Carglumic acid is also used for hyperammonaemia in fatty acid oxidation disorders, which is at least partly due to reduced NAG synthesis. For hyperammonaemia in severe carnitine‐acylcarnitine translocase deficiency, however, carglumic acid and nitrogen scavengers seem to confer limited benefit when added to high doses of glucose.

### The effects of probiotics and symbiotics on risk factors for hepatic encephalopathy: a systematic review [^111XZXEW]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Alterations in the levels of intestinal microbiota, endotoxemia, and inflammation are novel areas of interest in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Probiotics and symbiotics are a promising treatment option for HE due to possible beneficial effects in modulating gut microflora and might be better tolerated and more cost-effective than the traditional treatment with lactulose, rifaximin or L-ornithine-L-aspartate. A systematic search of the electronic databases PubMed, ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library was conducted for randomized controlled clinical trials in adult patients with cirrhosis, evaluating the effect of probiotics and symbiotics in changes on intestinal microflora, reduction of endotoxemia, inflammation, and ammonia, reversal of minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE), prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), and improvement of quality of life. Nineteen trials met the inclusion criteria. Probiotics and symbiotics increased beneficial microflora and decreased pathogenic bacteria and endotoxemia compared with placebo/no treatment, but no effect was observed on inflammation. Probiotics significantly reversed MHE [risk ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14, 2.05; P = 0.005] and reduced OHE development (risk ratio, 0.62; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.80; P = 0.0002) compared with placebo/no treatment. Symbiotics significantly decreased ammonia levels compared with placebo (15.24; 95% CI: -26.01, -4.47; P = 0.006). Probiotics did not show any additional benefit on reversal of MHE and prevention of OHE development when compared with lactulose, rifaximin, and L-ornithine-L-aspartate. Only 5 trials considered tolerance with minimal side effects reported. Although further research is warranted, probiotics and symbiotics should be considered as an alternative therapy for the treatment and management of HE given the results reported in this systematic review.

### Ammonia and autophagy: an emerging relationship with implications for disorders with hyperammonemia [^11436m1J]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

(Macro)autophagy/autophagy is a highly regulated lysosomal degradative process by which cells recycle their own nutrients, such as amino acids and other metabolites, to be reused in different biosynthetic pathways. Ammonia is a diffusible compound generated daily from catabolism of nitrogen-containing molecules and from gastrointestinal microbiome. Ammonia homeostasis is tightly controlled in humans and ammonia is efficiently converted by the healthy liver into non-toxic urea (through ureagenesis) and glutamine (through glutamine synthetase). Impaired ammonia detoxification leads to systemic hyperammonemia, a life-threatening condition resulting in detrimental effects on central nervous system. Here, we review current understanding on the role of ammonia in modulation of autophagy and the potential implications in the pathogenesis and treatment of disorders with hyperammonemia.

Cryptosporidiosis in children with HIV — treatment principles — Immune reconstitution resulting from ART often results in clearance of Cryptosporidium infection, and effective ART is the primary initial treatment for these infections in children and adults with HIV infection who are not already receiving ART; ART containing a protease inhibitor (PI) might be preferable to other ART regimens, and PIs also increase production of interferon-gamma, which in turn inhibits Cryptosporidium infection; supportive care with hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and nutritional supplementation should be provided, and antimotility agents to combat malabsorption of nutrients and drugs should be used with caution; other than ART, there is no consistently effective therapy to treat cryptosporidiosis in patients with HIV infection, no pharmacologic or immunologic therapy directed specifically against Cryptosporidium has yet been shown consistently effective and durable when used alone without concomitant ART, and the duration of treatment in patients with HIV is also uncertain.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) management in critically ill cirrhosis — if no obvious alternative cause is immediately apparent, empiric therapy with lactulose should be started, with a nasogastric tube used if needed and oral lactulose held in ileus; in those with Grade 3 or 4 HE, a lactulose enema (300 mL lactulose in 700 mL water for a total of 1 L) may be considered, and regardless of route the goal is improved mental status with careful electrolyte monitoring; in patients without acute kidney injury (AKI) who are critically ill, treatment includes lactulose (orally or rectally) or polyethylene glycol if at risk of ileus/abdominal distention, the role of rifaximin as an add-on to lactulose/polyethylene glycol warrants further investigation in ACLF, and the role of rifaximin and i.v. albumin in the acute setting remains unclear; polyethylene glycol has been studied with success compared with lactulose and maybe an alternative, especially to decrease the risk of ileus/abdominal compartment syndrome in the ICU setting; ammonia scavengers such as L-ornithine L-aspartate and ornithine phenylacetate are not available in the United States and are undergoing further trials; medications with short half-lives (e.g., propofol, dexmedetomidine) should be used for sedation and pain control in patients with cirrhosis who require intubation and mechanical ventilation.

### L-ornithine L-aspartate for prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis [^114TtC3W]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of cirrhosis and has high associated morbidity and mortality. The condition is classified as overt if it is clinically apparent or minimal if only evident though psychometric testing. The exact pathogenesis of this syndrome is unknown although ammonia is thought to play a key role. L-ornithine L-aspartate has ammonia-lowering properties and may, therefore, benefit people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.

Objectives

To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of L-ornithine L-aspartate versus placebo, no intervention, or other active interventions in people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.

Search Methods

We undertook electronic searches of The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and Science Citation Index Expanded to December 2017 and manual searches of meetings and conference proceedings; checks of bibliographies; and corresponded with investigators and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials, irrespective of publication status, language, or blinding. We included participants with cirrhosis who had minimal or overt hepatic encephalopathy or who were at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy. We compared: L-ornithine L-aspartate versus placebo or no intervention; and L-ornithine L-aspartate versus other active agents such as non-absorbable disaccharides, antibiotics, probiotics, or branched-chain amino acids.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors, working independently, retrieved data from published reports and correspondence with investigators and pharmaceutical companies. The primary outcomes were mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events. We undertook meta-analyses and presented the results as risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed bias control using the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group domains; we evaluated the risk of publication bias and other small trial effects in regression analyses; conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses; and performed Trial Sequential Analyses. We determined the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified 36 randomised clinical trials, involving at least 2377 registered participants, which fulfilled our inclusion criteria including 10 unpublished randomised clinical trials. However, we were only able to access outcome data from 29 trials involving 1891 participants. Five of the included trials assessed prevention, while 31 trials assessed treatment. Five trials were at low risk of bias in the overall assessment of mortality; one trial was at low risk of bias in the assessment of the remaining outcomes.L-ornithine L-aspartate had a beneficial effect on mortality compared with placebo or no intervention when including all trials (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.72; I² = 0%; 19 trials; 1489 participants; very low quality evidence), but not when the analysis was restricted to the trials at low risk of bias (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.06 to 3.58; 4 trials; 244 participants). It had a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy compared with placebo or no intervention when including all trials (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.83; 22 trials; 1375 participants; I² = 62%; very low quality evidence), but not in the one trial at low risk of bias (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07; 63 participants). The analysis of serious adverse events showed a potential benefit of L-ornithine L-aspartate when including all randomised clinical trials (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.90; 1 trial; 1489 participants; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence), but not in the one trial at low risk of bias for this outcome (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.15 to 4.65; 63 participants). The Trial Sequential Analyses of mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events found insufficient evidence to support or refute beneficial effects. Subgroup analyses showed no difference in outcomes in the trials evaluating evaluating the prevention or treatment of either overt or minimal hepatic encephalopathy or trials evaluating oral versus intravenous administration We were unable to undertake a meta-analysis of the three trials involving 288 participants evaluating health-related quality of life. Overall, we found no difference between L-ornithine L-aspartate and placebo or no intervention in non-serious adverse events (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.77; 14 trials; 1076 participants; I² = 40%). In comparison with lactulose, L-ornithine L-aspartate had no effect on mortality (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.11 to 4.17; 4 trials; 175 participants; I² = 0%); hepatic encephalopathy (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.57); serious adverse events (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.11); or non-serious adverse events (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.18). In comparison with probiotics, L-ornithine L-aspartate had no effect on mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.11 to 9.51); serious adverse events (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.23 to 4.88); or changes in blood ammonia concentrations from baseline (RR -2.30 95% CI -6.08 to 1.48), but it had a possible beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.90). Finally, in comparison with rifaximin, L-ornithine L-aspartate had no effect on mortality (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.03; 2 trials; 105 participants); hepatic encephalopathy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.96); serious adverse events (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.42), or non-serious adverse events (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.42).

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this review suggest a possible beneficial effect of L-ornithine L-aspartate on mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events in comparisons with placebo or no-intervention, but, because the quality of the evidence is very low, we are very uncertain about these findings. There was very low quality evidence of a possible beneficial effect of L-ornithine L-aspartate on hepatic encephalopathy, when compared with probiotics, but no other benefits were demonstrated in comparison with other active agents. Additional access to data from completed, but unpublished trials, and new randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials are needed.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution versus lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jmbtT]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

It is known that ammonia plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of HE. Only 3 trials compared serum ammonia concentration between the 2 groups. In this study, serum ammonia concentration increased from the baseline in all patients after 24 hours of treatment. However, aggregate data confirmed that PEG had no significant effect on the serum ammonia concentration after 24 hours of treatment compared with lactulose. Ammonia levels were not associated with better improvement in HESA grades. One reasonable explanation for this inconsistency is that the method and timing of testing used as biological samples to determine serum ammonia fail to distinguish between NH 4 + ion and NH 3. NH 3 exists in the form of gas with pH-dependent equilibrium, which is the form implicated in HE-related neurotoxicity. In contrast, NH 4 + ion is independent of the pathogenesis of HE, which is the predominant form (98%) of ammonia at physiological pH. It is worth noting that PEG may cause a mild metabolic acidosis, leading to an increase in NH 4 + ion levels and a decrease in NH 3. These chemical changes can explain the rapid improvement of PEG in mental status without significantly altering ammonia levels. Another explanation could be that PEG does not just work through ammonia. The fast-acting laxative leads to changes in the gut microbiome and a reduction in other gut-derived toxins or neuroinflammation contributing to the resolution of HE. Since PEG is a highly effective laxative, the potential clinical improvement of HE may be more clinically significant than the actual decline in ammonia levels. Publication bias and sensitivity analysis were not conducted due to only 3 studies include in the analysis. As such, this conclusion should be explained with caution and require more high-quality, multicenter RCTs validation.

### Mechanisms, diagnosis and management of hepatic encephalopathy [^111tABDT]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious neuropsychiatric complication of both acute and chronic liver disease. Symptoms of HE can include confusion, disorientation and poor coordination. A general consensus exists that the synergistic effects of excess ammonia and inflammation cause astrocyte swelling and cerebral edema; however, the precise molecular mechanisms that lead to these morphological changes in the brain are unclear. Cerebral edema occurs to some degree in all patients with HE, regardless of its grade, and could underlie the pathogenesis of this disorder. The different grades of HE can be diagnosed by a number of investigations, including neuropsychometric tests (such as the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score), brain imaging and clinical scales (such as the West Haven criteria). HE is best managed by excluding other possible causes of encephalopathy alongside identifying and the precipitating cause, and confirming the diagnosis by a positive response to empiric treatment. Empiric therapy for HE is largely based on the principle of reducing the production and absorption of ammonia in the gut through administration of pharmacological agents such as rifaximin and lactulose, which are approved by the FDA for the treatment of HE.

2.5 Nitrogen scavengers

Nitrogen scavengers such as benzoate, phenylacetate, and phenylbutyrate are first line therapies in the management of hyperammonemia in UCDs. This class of drugs bypass the urea cycle to provide an alternative pathway for nitrogen excretion by conjugating with nitrogen bearing amino acids such as glycine or glutamine and are later excreted in urine. Nitrogen scavengers are most often used for adult CD patients to manage elevated ammonia levels, but there are no systematic studies in CD available.

2.6 ‐arginine

‐arginine is an intermediary metabolite of the urea cycle used to clinically manage hyperammonemia in UCDs (except for arginase 1 deficiency) and is often administered together with nitrogen scavengers.‐arginine lowers ammonia levels by enhancing ureagenesis. Its use and effectiveness in CD were first reported in a 37‐year‐old patient where arginine granules were effective in lowering and maintaining normal blood ammonia levels. When arginine therapy was temporarily discontinued in this patient, ammonia levels increased significantly, and the patient fell into a coma. However, in contrast to most UCDs (except for arginase 1 deficiency), plasma arginine levels in CD are often elevated, questioning the role of arginine supplementation in this condition. There are no systematic studies available, but a thorough biochemical study would be of interest to understand the mechanism of action of arginine therapy in CD.

2.7 Liver transplantation

At present, liver transplantation remains the only curative treatment for CD and is typically performed in adult patients with severe symptoms who are unresponsive to other treatments, and rarely in NICCD patients. Post‐transplantation, laboratory results and clinical symptoms of patients were reported to normalize. Interestingly, the unique food preferences of patients also disappeared after liver transplantation and they no longer require diet restrictions. These drastic improvements also highlight that CD primarily affects the liver. Despite these positive outcomes, significant drawbacks concerning liver transplantation remain such as lifelong immunosuppression and associated risks, high costs, and shortage of suitable donors.

### Inhibition of urease-mediated ammonia production by 2-octynohydroxamic acid in hepatic encephalopathy [^111reLMJ]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Current HE treatments are centered around the regulation of ammonia production, absorption or elimination from the systemic circulation. Non-absorbable disaccharides (e.g. lactulose or lactitol) and poorly absorbed antibiotics (e.g. rifaximin) are the foundation of HE treatment. Lactulose is a laxative that reduces ammonia absorption by accelerating intestinal transit and subsequent ammonia passage from the colon. It is, however, associated with unpleasant GI symptoms impairing patients' compliance. Rifaximin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that exhibits minimal systemic absorption, and therefore exclusively depletes gut bacteria reducing ammonia production. Recent studies suggest that besides its antimicrobial activity, rifaximin might alter bacterial metabolism as well as exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. Due to its low bioavailability, rifaximin is generally safe and well-tolerated. The long-term use of rifaximin, however, raises concerns over the development of antibiotic resistance, although former work seems to indicate that the risk is low.

### Recent advances in the prevention and treatment of decompensated cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and the role of biomarkers [^114zhXqX]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Gut-derived systemic inflammation and CAID as a target of therapy

As the gut drives endotoxaemia and low-grade systemic inflammation, manipulating the gut microbiome towards health will reduce bacterial translocation, the predisposition to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and also lower blood ammonia, which has recently been shown to predict hospitalisation, liver-related complications and mortality. Therefore, dietary interventions with increased consumption of fruit, vegetables, fibre and fermented food substances, prebiotics (lactulose), probiotics and synbiotics should be evaluated. There is robust data now to suggest that rifaximin-α not only reduces the recurrence of overt HEbut may also favourably manipulate the gut microbiome. A recent mechanistic randomised-controlled trial showed that rifaximin-α suppressed oralisation of the gut, reducing levels of mucin-degrading sialidase-rich species, Streptococcus spp, Veillonella atypica and parvula, Akkermansia and Hungatella. Rifaximin-α also promoted a TNF-α-enriched and interleukin-25-enriched intestinal microenvironment, augmenting antibacterial responses to invading pathobionts and promoting gut barrier repair. Interestingly, patients on rifaximin-α were less likely to develop infection. Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is a well-established treatment, acting as a 'whole ecosystem' approach to restore the homeostatic balance of gut microbiota. An open-label phase I pilot study of 10 patients with cirrhosis treated with rectally instilled FMT restored gut-microbiota diversity and improved HE. However, there were limitations in attributing results to FMT alone as patients were treated concurrently with broad-spectrum antibiotics, whereas those allocated to standard care were not. A further 10-patient phase I trial using FMT capsules was associated with improved duodenal mucosal microbial diversity, gut microbial diversity, antimicrobial peptide expression and reduced lipopolysaccharide-binding protein.FMT, therefore, could represent a promising non-antimicrobial therapeutic strategy to improve an array of clinical outcomes in cirrhotic patients, ranging from the development of encephalopathy and infection to reducing AMR rates. Moreover, in the recent PROFIT trial, FMT decreased microbial-associated ammonia production and augmented ammonia excretion via anaerobic metabolism of L-aspartate to hippurate, providing proof of concept that FMT enhances ammonia metabolism, central in the pathogenesis of HE in cirrhosis. Finally, testosterone therapy in men with low serum testosterone safely increases muscle mass, bone mass and haemoglobin. Increased muscle mass may indirectly lower blood ammonia and improve outcomes. Therefore, testosterone treatment could merit a larger scale investigation.

### Quality of life as a therapeutic objective in the management of hepatic encephalopathy and the potential role of rifaximin-α [^113wkRFv]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain dysfunction caused by either liver insufficiency or portosystemic shunting or both, which manifests as a wide spectrum of neurologic or psychiatric abnormalities, ranging from subclinical alterations to coma. Although the aetiology of hepatic encephalopathy has not been conclusively established, its pathophysiology is thought to involve elevated blood levels of gut-derived neurotoxins (particularly ammonia) entering the brain, due to the inability of the damaged liver to remove them from the blood circulation. Systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation and endotoxaemia are also thought to be implicated. Hepatic encephalopathy is one of the most debilitating complications of liver disease and is associated with increased mortality. Hepatic encephalopathy negatively affects patients' quality of life (QoL), both physically and mentally, resulting in a substantial burden on the lives of both patients and caregivers. The economic burden of hepatic encephalopathy is also profound.

Hepatic encephalopathy guidelines recommend both the active treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy and secondary prophylaxis to prevent hepatic encephalopathy recurrence. Lactulose is recommended as the first choice for acute treatment and for the prevention of recurrence. Rifaximin is recommended as adjunctive therapy to lactulose for the prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence after the second episode. The guidelines also recommend that prophylactic therapy be continued, unless precipitating factors (e.g. variceal bleeding, infections) have been well controlled, or liver function or nutritional status have improved.

Rifaximin-α is a locally acting oral antibiotic that is minimally absorbed in the gut to reduce the effects of intestinal flora, including ammonia-producing species. It has also been shown to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and endotoxin. Rifaximin-α is indicated in Europe, Australia and New Zealand for the reduction in recurrence of episodes of overt hepatic encephalopathy in patients aged ≥ 18 years. Evidence has demonstrated that the addition of rifaximin-α to standard lactulose therapy significantly reduces overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence and hepatic encephalopathy-related hospitalisation, which may result in substantial reductions in healthcare resource utilisation over the long term. Rifaximin-α has also been shown to significantly improve health-related QoL in patients with cirrhosis and recurrent hepatic encephalopathy.

Given the impact of hepatic encephalopathy on QoL, we conducted a survey of hepatic encephalopathy specialists in Europe and Australia to better understand how QoL is valued as an outcome measure in hepatic encephalopathy, whether QoL is routinely assessed in hepatic encephalopathy patients in clinical practice, and the role of rifaximin-α in this context.

### Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate increases serum bicarbonate concentrations among patients with hyperkalaemia: exploratory analyses from three randomized, multi-dose, placebo-controlled trials [^115B7sZK]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Consistent with serum bicarbonate increases, SZC also reduced frequencies of serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L that were maintained over time. The proportions of patients receiving SZC with serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L at Day 29 was lower in HARMONIZE (17.2%) than in HARMONIZE-Global (77.6%) due to the differences in the proportion of patients with serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L at CP baseline between these studies (39.4% and 87.9%, respectively). Consistent with these reductions in proportions with serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L, SZC treatment was associated with dose-dependent decreases in serum urea and increases in urine pH in all three studies.

The mechanisms underlying the increase in serum bicarbonate with SZC are not fully understood, but may be due to the binding and removal of ammonium by SZC in the gastrointestinal tract, or to augmentation of renal ammoniagenesis through correction of hyperkalaemia. Ammonium ions have similar biophysical properties to K + ions in aqueous solution; thus, SZC demonstrates significant binding of ammonium ions in addition to K + in the gastrointestinal tract. Despite the release of hydrogen as one of the SZC exchange ions, paradoxically SZC increases serum bicarbonate and corrects acidosis compared with placebo. This suggests that although SZC exchanges hydrogen and sodium for K +, SZC must mostly exchange sodium for ammonium and not hydrogen for ammonium, which would otherwise release a stronger acid while binding a weaker one. Urea in the gastrointestinal tract is hydrolysed by bacterial ureases to release bicarbonate and ammonium ions, which are absorbed through the gastrointestinal epithelium and enter the liver, where urea is resynthesized. Thus, capture of ammonium by SZC in exchange for sodium ions, with subsequent elimination of ammonium in the faeces, interrupts the ammonium component of this enterohepatic loop. This allows bicarbonate to be reabsorbed while reducing the reabsorption of ammonium, which, in turn, reduces the substrate available for resynthesis of urea in the liver. The overall effect is an increase in serum bicarbonate, reduction in serum urea and net acid loss.

### Interventions for managing taste disturbances [^111VaPch]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The sense of taste is very much essential to the overall health of an individual. It is a necessary component to enjoy one's food, which in turn provides nutrition to an individual. Any disturbance in taste perception can hamper quality of life in such patients by influencing their appetite, body weight and psychological well-being. Taste disorders have been treated using different modalities of treatment and there is no consensus for the best intervention. Hence this Cochrane Review was undertaken. This is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in November 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for the management of patients with taste disturbances.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 4 July 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017 Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library (searched 4 July 2017); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 4 July 2017); Embase Ovid (1980 to 4 July 2017); CINAHL EBSCO (1937 to 4 July 2017); and AMED Ovid (1985 to 4 July 2017). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for trials. Abstracts from scientific meetings and conferences were searched on 25 September 2017. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any pharmacological agent with a control intervention or any non-pharmacological agent with a control intervention. We also included cross-over trials in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two pairs of review authors independently, and in duplicate, assessed the quality of trials and extracted data. Wherever possible, we contacted trial authors for additional information. We collected adverse events information from the trials.

Main Results

We included 10 trials (581 participants), nine of which we were able to include in the quantitative analyses (566 participants). We assessed three trials (30%) as having a low risk of bias, four trials (40%) at high risk of bias and three trials (30%) as having an unclear risk of bias. We only included studies on taste disorders in this review that were either idiopathic, or resulting from zinc deficiency or chronic renal failure. Of these, nine trials with 544 people compared zinc supplements to placebo for patients with taste disorders. The participants in two trials were children and adolescents with respective mean ages of 10 and 11.2 years and the other seven trials had adult participants. Out of these nine, two trials assessed the patient-reported outcome for improvement in taste acuity using zinc supplements (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 2.09; 119 participants, very low-quality evidence). We meta-analysed for taste acuity improvement using objective outcome (continuous data) in idiopathic and zinc-deficient taste disorder patients (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.65; 366 participants, three trials, very low-quality evidence). We also analysed one cross-over trial separately using the first half of the results for taste detection (mean difference (MD) 2.50, 95% CI 0.93 to 4.07; 14 participants, very low-quality evidence), and taste recognition (MD 3.00, 95% CI 0.66 to 5.34; 14 participants, very low-quality evidence). We meta-analysed taste acuity improvement using objective outcome (dichotomous data) in idiopathic and zinc-deficient taste disorder patients (RR 1.42, 95% 1.09 to 1.84; 292 participants, two trials, very low-quality evidence). Out of the nine trials using zinc supplementation, four reported adverse events like eczema, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, decrease in blood iron, increase in blood alkaline phosphatase, and minor increase in blood triglycerides. One trial tested taste discrimination using acupuncture (MD 2.80, 95% CI -1.18 to 6.78; 37 participants, very low-quality evidence). No adverse events were reported in the acupuncture trial. None of the included trials could be included in the meta-analysis for health-related quality of life in taste disorder patients.

Authors' Conclusions

We found very low-quality evidence that was insufficient to conclude on the role of zinc supplements to improve taste acuity reported by patients and very low-quality evidence that zinc supplements improve taste acuity in patients with zinc deficiency/idiopathic taste disorders. We did not find any evidence to conclude the role of zinc supplements for improving taste discrimination, or any evidence addressing health-related quality of life due to taste disorders. We found very low-quality evidence that is not sufficient to conclude on the role of acupuncture for improving taste discrimination in cases of idiopathic dysgeusia (distortion of taste) and hypogeusia (reduced ability to taste). We were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the superiority of zinc supplements or acupuncture as none of the trials compared these interventions.

### Intestinal dysbiosis and probiotic use: its place in hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^1124rPFs]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Intestinal dysbiosis in cirrhosis (Created by BioRender.com)

Apart from the above, dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota changes the circumference of the colonic lumen, as well as its pH. This causes increased ammonia production from the intestinal microbiota and increased ammonia transition from the colon lumen to the blood. Studies have shown differences in gut microbiota between healthy individuals and patients with cirrhosis. The prevalence of potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcaceae, may affect the prognosis, together with the reduction of beneficial populations such as Lachnospiraceae in patients with cirrhosis. However, the microflora imbalance is also associated with cirrhosis severity. The main causes of this imbalance are thought to be hypochlorhydria, decreased IgA secretion and intestinal motility, and malnutrition. The change in intestinal microbiota in patients with cirrhosis is summarized in Fig. 3 on the basis of phyla and family.

Figure 3
The change in intestinal microbiota in patients with cirrhosis

Treatment of cirrhosis and HE

The traditional treatment for HE is antibiotics or non-absorbed polysaccharides. Among the preferred non-absorbable disaccharides are lactulose (β-galactosidofructose) and lactitol (β-galactosidosorbitol). Fecal Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, thought to have health-promoting properties, can be increased by the addition of lactulose to the diet. Ten grams of lactulose per day increases fecal bifidobacterial numbers, and lactulose can be considered a prebiotic. With its prebiotic potential, lactulose promotes the growth of probiotic bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium species, known to have health-promoting effects. However, in a systematic review it was shown that there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of non-absorbable disaccharides for HE, and antibiotics are superior to non-absorbable disaccharides in the treatment of HE. Moreover, this difference was not clinically significant. In this review, it was concluded that the available evidence is not sufficient to support or reject the use of non-absorbable disaccharides for HE treatment. In a more recent systematic review, the efficacy and safety of non-absorbable disaccharides were evaluated for the prevention and treatment of HE in patients with cirrhosis, but insufficient evidence was found to recommend their use in clinical practice. However, they have been reported to show a significant beneficial treatment effect on both MHE and OHE.

### Rifaximin for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy [^113hUJGV]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the effectiveness and safety of rifaximin in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy (HE).

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1990-October 2008) was searched using the terms rifaximin, rifamycins, hepatic encephalopathy, liver cirrhosis, and acute liver failure. Other sources included the bibliographies of pertinent articles as well as programs and abstracts from infectious diseases and gastrointestinal diseases meetings.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles identified from the search were evaluated. All primary literature that addressed the efficacy and safety of rifaximin in the treatment of HE was included in this review.

Data Synthesis

HE is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome seen in patients with liver failure. It is characterized by disturbances in consciousness and behavior, personality changes, fluctuating neurologic signs, asterixis, and electroencephalographic changes. Although the etiology of HE is unknown, the accumulation of several gut-derived toxins such as mercaptans, ammonia, and benzodiazepine has been implicated. Current treatment options for HE include agents that reduce the concentration of these toxins, such as nonabsorbable disaccharides and antibiotics. Several studies have evaluated the use of rifaximin in the treatment of HE. They include a dose-finding study, 9 open-label studies, and 4 double-blind studies comparing rifaximin with either nonabsorbable disaccharides or antibiotics. Commonly used outcomes in most of these studies were changes in portal systemic encephalopathy index and the improvement in HE grade. Despite various limitations of the studies, rifaximin showed superior efficacy compared with lactulose for the treatment of HE, similar efficacy to paromomycin, and similar or greater efficacy than neomycin. Rifaximin was found to be associated with fewer hospitalizations, fewer days of hospitalization, and lower hospitalization charges than were seen with lactulose. Rifaximin also had a better tolerance profile than the comparative agents.

Conclusions

Rifaximin appears to be an effective and safe treatment option for HE. Better-designed studies are needed to characterize its efficacy in the treatment of HE.

### Characterization and treatment monitoring of ureagenesis disorders using stable isotopes [^117LFW3B]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

As single ammonia determinations are not ideal as endpoint of interventional studies and for monitoring of novel therapies, the use of stable isotopes to quantify ureagenesis as means of the flux through the UC can be a promising alternative. As a main advantage of stable isotopes for use in biochemical and metabolic studies, they exhibit essentially the same characteristics as the endogenous molecule, do not emit radioactivity, and are detectable at lowest concentrations by mass spectrometric techniques. For in vivo ureagenesis studies using a single oral bolus dose, 2 isotopes have been used as tracers: 13 C and 15 N, in the form of [1–13 C]- or -[13 C 2]acetate and 15 NH 4 Cl (ammonium chloride), respectively. Although the experimental design is the same for these tracers (collection of a pre-ingestion baseline sample and subsequent sample collections at different time points), each isotope is measured by different techniques and has advantages and disadvantages.

### Nitrogen scavengers: history, clinical considerations and future prospects [^114BPkk1]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Nitrogen scavengers play a critical role in treating acute and chronic hyperammonemia, especially in urea cycle disorders (UCDs), where impaired ammonia detoxification leads to toxic nitrogen accumulation. These agents complement low-protein diets and urea cycle intermediates. Sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate are the main scavengers, conjugating with glycine and glutamine to form hippurate and phenylacetylglutamine, which are excreted in urine. This therapeutic approach, introduced in the 1980s, was based on early findings linking benzoate to reduced urea excretion. Nitrogen scavengers are also used in secondary hyperammonemia from organic acidemias and fatty acid oxidation disorders, though they may become increasingly ineffective in progressing liver failure due to their reliance on hepatocyte function. To improve tolerability, phenylbutyrate was developed as an oral alternative to phenylacetate and is available in sodium-bound and prodrug forms, but issues with taste and side effects persist. While effective, current treatments target nitrogenous waste products rather than ammonia directly, offering an avenue of future drug development for UCDs. This review discusses the chemical properties, clinical use, and limitations of nitrogen scavengers, hereby focusing on phenylacetate and related substances, and highlights the need for improved therapies, including approaches that directly target ammonia removal. For the benefit of readers already experienced in nitrogen scavengers for UCDs, we also include considerations concerning the use of these drugs in animal experiments and a viewpoint on ornithine phenylacetate as a related substance.

### Management of decompensated cirrhosis in the surgical ICU: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^116Fgs2x]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

HE complicating DC is associated with a 1-year mortality of ≥ 50%, and has a varied clinical presentation ranging from disorientation to coma. In 70%–80% of cases, a precipitating event such as surgery, infection, or GI hemorrhage precedes these changes.HE is a clinical diagnosis that can be difficult to establish definitively in the ICU given the abundance of alternative etiologies. Neurological changes can be mimicked by alternate conditions such as delirium which need to be considered prior to establishing a diagnosis of HE. Cerebral CT should be obtained to rule out other pathology such as subarachnoid or subdural hemorrhage, stroke and edema. Electroencephalography changes are non-specific but useful to rule out seizures.

Ammonia levels do not correlate with clinical severity of HE; however, a normal ammonia level has a negative predictive value of 80%, suggesting an alternative cause of mental status changes. Blood samples should be drawn without tourniquet, placed on ice, and immediately sent to the laboratory. Monitoring ammonia levels as a response to therapy is not recommended. Ammonia levels are unlikely to normalize and often will remain elevated after resolution of an episode of HE. The response to therapy should be assessed on a clinical basis.

Lactulose, a non-absorbable disaccharide, has been shown to improve resolution of HE episodes and survival. The dose of lactulose should be titrated to achieve two to three bowel movements per day, being administered hourly until the first bowel movement. Enema formulations are available. L-ornithine l-aspartate can be considered when lactose intolerance exists and has been shown to have equivalent efficacy when compared with disaccharide therapy, but is not yet available in the USA. The addition of rifaximin should be considered when the clinical response to lactulose is poor. Rifaximin in combination with lactulose demonstrated greater efficacy than either alone in treating HE with a higher probability of resolution, shorter hospital length of stay, and improved survival. Rifaximin can also be given for primary prophylaxis of hepatic encephalopathy after gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Polyethylene glycol is an osmotic laxative that has been shown in small studies to be effective in the treatment of HE but requires further validation. Flumazenil therapy has been shown to improve encephalopathy but not impact mortality. Probiotics have not shown improvement when compared with placebo. The non-ureic nitrogen scavengers have promising early data but future studies are required.

### Nitrogen scavengers: history, clinical considerations and future prospects [^114Qv94w]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Nitrogen scavengers play a critical role in treating acute and chronic hyperammonemia, especially in urea cycle disorders (UCDs), where impaired ammonia detoxification leads to toxic nitrogen accumulation. These agents complement low‐protein diets and urea cycle intermediates. Sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate are the main scavengers, conjugating with glycine and glutamine to form hippurate and phenylacetylglutamine, which are excreted in urine. This therapeutic approach, introduced in the 1980s, was based on early findings linking benzoate to reduced urea excretion. Nitrogen scavengers are also used in secondary hyperammonemia from organic acidemias and fatty acid oxidation disorders, though they may become increasingly ineffective in progressing liver failure due to their reliance on hepatocyte function. To improve tolerability, phenylbutyrate was developed as an oral alternative to phenylacetate and is available in sodium‐bound and prodrug forms, but issues with taste and side effects persist. While effective, current treatments target nitrogenous waste products rather than ammonia directly, offering an avenue of future drug development for UCDs. This review discusses the chemical properties, clinical use, and limitations of nitrogen scavengers, hereby focusing on phenylacetate and related substances, and highlights the need for improved therapies, including approaches that directly target ammonia removal. For the benefit of readers already experienced in nitrogen scavengers for UCDs, we also include considerations concerning the use of these drugs in animal experiments and a viewpoint on ornithine phenylacetate as a related substance.

### Pivotal role of glutamine synthetase in ammonia detoxification [^116oLjd8]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Glutamine synthetase (GS) catalyzes condensation of ammonia with glutamate to glutamine. Glutamine serves, with alanine, as a major nontoxic interorgan ammonia carrier. Elimination of hepatic GS expression in mice causes only mild hyperammonemia and hypoglutaminemia but a pronounced decrease in the whole-body muscle-to-fat ratio with increased myostatin expression in muscle. Using GS-knockout/liver and control mice and stepwise increments of enterally infused ammonia, we show that ∼35% of this ammonia is detoxified by hepatic GS and ∼35% by urea-cycle enzymes, while ∼30% is not cleared by the liver, independent of portal ammonia concentrations ≤ 2 mmol/L. Using both genetic (GS-knockout/liver and GS-knockout/muscle) and pharmacological (methionine sulfoximine and dexamethasone) approaches to modulate GS activity, we further show that detoxification of stepwise increments of intravenously (jugular vein) infused ammonia is almost totally dependent on GS activity. Maximal ammonia-detoxifying capacity through either the enteral or the intravenous route is ∼160 μmol/hour in control mice. Using stable isotopes, we show that disposal of glutamine-bound ammonia to urea (through mitochondrial glutaminase and carbamoylphosphate synthetase) depends on the rate of glutamine synthesis and increases from ∼7% in methionine sulfoximine-treated mice to ∼500% in dexamethasone-treated mice (control mice, 100%), without difference in total urea synthesis.

Conclusions

Hepatic GS contributes to both enteral and systemic ammonia detoxification. Glutamine synthesis in the periphery (including that in pericentral hepatocytes) and glutamine catabolism in (periportal) hepatocytes represents the high-affinity ammonia-detoxifying system of the body. The dependence of glutamine-bound ammonia disposal to urea on the rate of glutamine synthesis suggests that enhancing peripheral glutamine synthesis is a promising strategy to treat hyperammonemia. Because total urea synthesis does not depend on glutamine synthesis, we hypothesize that glutamate dehydrogenase complements mitochondrial ammonia production. (Hepatology 2017;65:281–293).

### Recent advances in the prevention and treatment of decompensated cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and the role of biomarkers [^1134A6dV]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Ongoing studies, novel drugs and other applications

Over the last decade, we have largely focused on the treatment of two major mechanisms, portal hypertension and systemic inflammation, as well as the main precipitants of decompensation, such as infection, bacterial translocation and organ failure.

Therapies in patients with cirrhosis and CSPH to prevent hepatic decompensation and progression to ACLF

The pathophysiology of CSPH in patients with cirrhosis is underpinned by profound peripheral arterial vasodilatation and circulatory dysfunction. Activation of neurohormonal systems drives renal sodium and water retention. This fragile balance maintains organ function in a stable state, but as portal hypertension advances, bacterial translocation across an impaired gut barrier culminates in endotoxaemia, systemic inflammation and cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction (CAID). Gut barrier damage arises from endothelial damage, which is exacerbated by reduced gut microbial diversity with an increase in pathobiont species. These pathobionts, which frequently translocate from the mouth, drive gut inflammation, mucosal degradation and enhanced ammonia production. Gut-derived systemic inflammation and CAID, therefore, become the logical targets for therapies that prevent hepatic decompensation episodes and the progression to ACLF, which is often precipitated by infection and sterile inflammation (figure 2).

### The use of rifaximin in patients with cirrhosis [^116ANzEi]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

More than four decades ago, an association between HE and abnormalities in ammonia metabolism was observed. The association between circulating unmetabolized ammonia level and HE was weak. However, because production of ammonia is closely related to the composition of gut microbiota, the idea emerged that oral administration of minimally absorbed antibiotics that were effective against ammonia‐producing bacteria could help treat or prevent HE. Neomycin, which is active against urease‐producing bacteria, has been one of the first minimally absorbed antibiotics to be used, and controlled trials showed it had similar efficacy compared with lactulose. However, because neomycin is slightly absorbed, there were concerns about nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity during long‐term treatment. Ten years ago, a seminal controlled trial showed that rifaximin, another minimally absorbed antibiotic, was superior to placebo to prevent recurrent HE. It rapidly became apparent that beyond HE, rifaximin could have beneficial effects on the course of cirrhosis through interactions with the gut‐liver axis. This review focuses on rifaximin in the management of HE in cirrhosis but also on other documented or potential targets of rifaximin, including systemic inflammatory response syndrome, portal hypertension, and bacterial infections.

### Sodium benzoate for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in humans and animals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112SEsGe]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Two of the human studies evaluated the use of SB alongside standard treatments, whereas the other two studies tested SB as monotherapy. In two of the animal studies, the effect of SB combined with other ammonia-lowering medication was studied. Campollo et al. examined SB with lactulose and found the combination was more effective in reducing ammonia levels than either drug alone. In Mejia et al.'s study, the effect of SB in combination with LOLA was studied and observed that the combined treatment led to a greater ammonia reduction than either medication used individually. These findings suggest that SB enhances the effect of other ammonia-lowering therapies. This additive effect is consistent with the standard care for UCDs, where combined treatment with multiple drugs is common. For treating HE or acute hyperammonemia, SB is typically used as an adjunct therapy when standard treatments have failed or in acute situations where immediate effects are needed.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, the evidence level from the included studies is lower than necessary for definite evidence. This is due to the limited number of papers on SB as alternative treatment for HE in liver failure or shunting. The four randomized controlled human trials analyzed were small, involving only 195 patients in total. To strengthen the review, animal studies and case reports were also included. The quality assessment revealed a risk of bias in three of four randomized controlled trials. Issues included the potential of unblinding of patients and/or investigators due to drug-specific side effects, such as increased frequency and softer stools, which are more common for lactulose treatment. This could lead to performance bias.

Future trials should be designed with SB as an add-on treatment compared with placebo, in combination with the standard of care for the specific conditions. Case reports, reflecting real-world clinical scenarios, show that treating hyperammonemia due to end-stage liver disease or portosystemic shunting is only successful in a few cases. All cases involved multiple concurrent ammonia-lowering interventions and, in some instances, additional treatments for the underlying cause. Despite these efforts, half the patients did not survive, likely due to underlying conditions and the liver's insufficient capacity to conjugate SB, indicative of end-stage liver failure.

### Inhibition of urease-mediated ammonia production by 2-octynohydroxamic acid in hepatic encephalopathy [^112Bftvo]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Efficacy of 2-octynoHA in a rodent model of chronic liver disease

The in vivo efficacy of 2-octynoHA was also investigated in a rat model of type C HE induced by obstruction of the common bile duct(performed on day 0) (Fig. 4f). On day 35 after the bile duct ligation (BDL), both blood ammonia (Fig. 4g) and plasma bilirubin levels (Supplementary Fig. 14) markedly increased in BDL rats compared to those before surgery, confirming liver damage. Starting from day 35, animals received a 5-day treatment of 2-octynoHA either as aqueous suspension (30 mg/kg, twice daily), aqueous HPβCD solution (30 mg/kg, twice daily) or enteric capsule (10 mg or ca. 30 mg/kg, daily), or a control drug-free aqueous solution (Fig. 4f). In all treated groups, there was a trend towards reduced blood ammonia levels after three days of treatment (day 37) with statistical significance achieved in the group treated with the 2-octynoHA solution (42.3 ± 14.95 µmol/L vs. 70.4 ± 30.6 µmol/L, corresponding to a decrease in ammonemia of ca. 40%; multiplicity adjusted p = 0.0394) (Fig. 4g). On day 39, the effect was less pronounced, especially in the groups receiving the suspension or enteric capsules. This might be explained by the progression of the disease, the insufficient dissolution of the compound in the large intestine, and in the case of the capsule, by the lower administered dose. As expected, bilirubin levels did not seem to be affected by 2-octynoHA treatment (Supplementary Fig. 14). Bilirubin was comparably high in all 2-octynoHA-treated groups during treatment days indicating liver insufficiency, which could not be addressed by a urease inhibitor due to its mechanism of action. Animals receiving 2-octynoHA formulated as a solution or as an enteric capsule showed a statistically significant reduction of the body weight on days 37 and/or 39 post-surgery corresponding to the third and fifth days of the treatment, respectively, which was within 10% difference compared to the body weight at the beginning of the treatment (day 35) (Supplementary Fig. 15). The origin of this effect is unclear and may be related to the stress induced by the animal handling (i.e. oral gavage, blood sampling) and decreased food consumption. Plasma glucose (Glc) levels seem to decrease throughout the study, which might indicate the declining health status of animals subjected to BDL (Supplementary Fig. 16).

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution versus lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1143Qbh3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The definite mechanism that causes HE remains unknown. Treatment of patients with overt HE basically depends on nutritional support, reduction of inflammation, correction of nutritional deficiencies, regulation of neurotransmission, modulation of fecal flora, decrease of blood ammonia, and elimination of potential induction factors. A great number of studies have shown that ammonia production plays a role in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and an imperfect liver leads to impaired ammonia elimination. Therefore, the use of antibiotics and colon cleaners to reduce the number of GI bacteria plays a therapeutic role in HE. The underlying cause of HE is separated from such a therapeutic strategy. No matter electrolyte disorder or GI bleeding is an induction factor, HE can be possibly resolved by the administration of cleansing agents. PEG and lactulose are both osmotic laxatives used in the treatment of HE.

### The efficacy and safety of rifaximin-α: a 2-year observational study of overt hepatic encephalopathy [^1144Rg6j]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric complication of advanced liver disease characterized by indiscernible changes (covert HE) to clinically obvious changes (overt HE) in intellect, behaviour, motor function and consciousness. Overt HE affects approximately 30–40% of patients with cirrhosis, is the most lethal cirrhosis complication with a survival rate between 40–55% at 6 months after diagnosis, and negatively affects quality of life.

Rifaximin-α is a poorly adsorbed antimicrobial agent and has been registered since 2013 as secondary prophylaxis for overt HE in the Netherlands.

The pharmacological effect of rifaximin-α has been attributed to a reduction in gut absorption and production of ammonia. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of rifaximin-α treatment in HE found that rifaximin-α had a beneficial effect on the secondary prevention of overt HE, increased the proportion of patients who recovered from HE, and reduced mortality.

At present, the impact of rifaximin-α has not been extensively studied in a real-world setting (i.e. medical data outside controlled research study protocols in a heterogenous patient population). Recently, a cohort study of 114 patients concluded that rifaximin-α significantly reduced hospitalizations, critical care admissions, and accident and emergency (A&E) department attendances in patients using rifaximin-α for at least 6 months. However, a potential beneficial effect of rifaximin-α on liver transplantation waiting list mortality or overall mortality has not been clearly established.

The primary aim of this study was to assess the impact of rifaximin-α treatment by evaluating the effect on hospitalizations, A&E department visits, outpatient clinic visits, and bacterial infections in the first 6 months after initiation compared with the prior 6 months. Secondarily, we evaluated the treatment duration and safety profile of rifaximin-α.

Monitoring response to antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhosis occurs due to serious impairment of the immune system and may trigger severe complications, particularly AKI, HE, or ACLF; it is also associated with a high risk of mortality. The diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis requires a high index of suspicion because the clinical symptoms are heterogeneous and may not always include abdominal manifestations. The biomarker used for diagnoses and for monitoring the efficacy of antibiotic therapy is neutrophil count in the ascitic fluid, and a bacterial isolate is not required for diagnoses because ascitic fluid culture is positive in less than half of cases. Other biomarkers based on systemic inflammation secondary to the infection, such as cytokines (eg, IL-6), pro-calcitonin, and others, have been investigated, but none have yet successfully shown to improve diagnostic accuracy. A summary of the changes in neutrophil count in ascitic fluid during antibiotic therapy and their clinical interpretations is presented in Table 5.

Monitoring response to treatment of HE

Development of overt HE requires rapid clinical investigation and initiation of therapy, including the management of possible precipitating factors. Specific therapy of HE focuses on preventing ammonia absorption from the gut and reducing ammonia production. The response to treatment is generally monitored by evaluating neurological status every 6–12 hours on the same scales that are used to categorize disease severity, usually the West Haven criteria. Psychometric testing is reserved for monitoring treatment effects on covert HE. There are no specific biomarkers for monitoring the response to therapy of patients with overt HE, but plasma ammonia levels may be informative because these decrease in patients improving from HE symptoms. However, international guidelines do still not recommend the measurement of ammonia levels for monitoring the treatment of HE.

### Pharmacotherapies that specifically target ammonia for the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in adults with cirrhosis [^114WApV5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of cirrhosis, with high related morbidity and mortality. Its presence is associated with a wide spectrum of change ranging from clinically obvious neuropsychiatric features, known as 'overt' hepatic encephalopathy, to abnormalities manifest only on psychometric or electrophysiological testing, 'minimal' hepatic encephalopathy. The exact pathogenesis of the syndrome is unknown but ammonia plays a key role. Drugs that specifically target ammonia include sodium benzoate, glycerol phenylbutyrate, ornithine phenylacetate, AST-120 (spherical carbon adsorbent), and polyethylene glycol.

Objectives

To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of pharmacotherapies that specifically target ammonia versus placebo, no intervention, or other active interventions, for the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and three other databases to March 2019. We also searched online trials registries such as ClinicalTrials.gov, European Medicines Agency, WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform, and the Food and Drug Administration for ongoing or unpublished trials. In addition, we searched conference proceedings, checked bibliographies, and corresponded with investigators.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials comparing sodium benzoate, glycerol phenylbutyrate, ornithine phenylacetate, AST-120, and polyethylene glycol versus placebo or non-absorbable disaccharides, irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status. We included participants with minimal or overt hepatic encephalopathy or participants who were at risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the included reports. The primary outcomes were mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events. We undertook meta-analyses and presented results using risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and I 2 statistic values as a marker of heterogeneity. We assessed bias control using the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary domains and the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified 11 randomised clinical trials that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Two trials evaluated the prevention of hepatic encephalopathy while nine evaluated the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. The trials assessed sodium benzoate (three trials), glycerol phenylbutyrate (one trial), ornithine phenylacetate (two trials), AST-120 (two trials), and polyethylene glycol (three trials). Overall, 499 participants received these pharmacotherapies while 444 participants received a placebo preparation or a non-absorbable disaccharide. We classified eight of the 11 trials as at 'high risk of bias' and downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low for all outcomes. Eleven trials, involving 943 participants, reported mortality data, although there were no events in five trials. Our analyses found no beneficial or harmful effects of sodium benzoate versus non-absorbable disaccharides (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.28; 101 participants; 2 trials; I² = 0%), glycerol phenylbutyrate versus placebo (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.81; 178 participants; 1 trial), ornithine phenylacetate versus placebo (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.51; 269 participants; 2 trials; I² = 0%), AST-120 versus lactulose (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.85; 41 participants; 1 trial), or polyethylene glycol versus lactulose (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.64; 190 participants; 3 trials; I² = 0%). Seven trials involving 521 participants reported data on hepatic encephalopathy. Our analyses showed a beneficial effect of glycerol phenylbutyrate versus placebo (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.90; 178 participants; 1 trial; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6), and of polyethylene glycol versus lactulose (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.44; 190 participants; 3 trials; NNTB 4). We did not observe beneficial effects in the remaining three trials with extractable data: sodium benzoate versus non-absorbable disaccharides (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.93; 74 participants; 1 trial); ornithine phenylacetate versus placebo (RR 2.71, 95% CI 0.12 to 62.70; 38 participants; 1 trial); or AST-120 versus lactulose (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.85; 41 participants; 1 trial). Ten trials, involving 790 participants, reported a total of 130 serious adverse events. Our analyses found no evidence of beneficial or harmful effects of sodium benzoate versus non-absorbable disaccharides (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.68; 101 participants; 2 trials), glycerol phenylbutyrate versus placebo (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.13; 178 participants; 1 trial), ornithine phenylacetate versus placebo (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.36; 264 participants; 2 trials; I² = 0%), or polyethylene glycol versus lactulose (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.82; 190 participants; 3 trials; I² = 0%). Likewise, eight trials, involving 782 participants, reported a total of 374 non-serious adverse events and again our analyses found no beneficial or harmful effects of the pharmacotherapies under review when compared to placebo or to lactulose/lactitol. Nine trials, involving 733 participants, reported data on blood ammonia. We observed significant reductions in blood ammonia in placebo-controlled trials evaluating sodium benzoate (MD -32.00, 95% CI -46.85 to -17.15; 16 participants; 1 trial), glycerol phenylbutyrate (MD -12.00, 95% CI -23.37 to -0.63; 178 participants; 1 trial), ornithine phenylacetate (MD -27.10, 95% CI -48.55 to -5.65; 231 participants; 1 trial), and AST-120 (MD -22.00, 95% CI -26.75 to -17.25; 98 participants; 1 trial). However, there were no significant differences in blood ammonia concentrations in comparison with lactulose/lactitol with sodium benzoate (MD 9.00, 95% CI -1.10 to 19.11; 85 participants; 2 trials; I² = 0%), AST-120 (MD 5.20, 95% CI -2.75 to 13.15; 35 participants; 1 trial), and polyethylene glycol (MD -29.28, 95% CI -95.96 to 37.39; 90 participants; 2 trials; I² = 88%).

Funding

Five trials received support from pharmaceutical companies while four did not; two did not provide this information.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of these pharmacotherapies on the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in adults with cirrhosis. They have the potential to reduce blood ammonia concentrations when compared to placebo, but their overall effects on clinical outcomes of interest and the potential harms associated with their use remain uncertain. Further evidence is needed to evaluate the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these pharmacotherapies in this clinical setting.

### Faecal bacterial microbiota in patients with cirrhosis and the effect of lactulose administration [^1174NLky]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

In particular, we found that abundances of the bacterial groups which are involved in nitrogen metabolism and possess the capability to produce ammonia did not show any difference between the patients and controls. Such a comparison has not been reported previously. This finding suggests that even though the gut microbiota in patients with cirrhosis differs from that in healthy persons, this alteration may not impact the production of nitrogenous substances, which may play a role in causation of HE.

Lactulose is extensively used for the treatment of HE in several parts of the world. On reaching the colon, lactulose is broken down by colonic bacteria (primarily bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and streptococci) into lactic acid, acetic acid and other short-chain fatty acids. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the beneficial effects of lactulose in HE, including (i) its laxative action which reduces the contact time between luminal contents and the intestinal mucosa, reducing the absorption of ammonia; (ii) creation of an acidic environment in the colonic lumen, which traps ammonia by enhancing its conversion into polar and less-absorbable ammonium ions; and, (iii) change in the composition of colonic microbiota, with reduced density of bacteria that produce ammonia and an increased density of those that utilize ammonia for their metabolism.

Data on the effect of lactulose on gut microbiota are quite scanty and conflicting. In previous studies, lactulose was shown to facilitate the growth of acidophilic, urease-deficient bacteria, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, in the colon. Another study reported an increase in the number of anaerobic lactobacilli and a decrease in that of Bacteroides spp. after lactulose. However, in yet another study, no association was found between clinical improvement following lactulose and reduction in the number of ammonia-producing bacteria. However, all these studies were based on stool culture, a technique with several inherent limitations, such as the failure of a large majority of colonic bacteria to grow in vitro, and an inability to reliably distinguish between various bacterial groups or to provide a quantitative measure of the relative abundance of various species in a bacterial mixture.

### Rifaximin treatment for reduction of risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence [^115mv36t]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common problem in patients with chronic liver disease and is characterized by diminished mentation and neuromuscular abnormalities. Symptoms range from subtle cognitive changes to coma and death. Gut-derived toxins such as ammonia are thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of HE. Treatment strategies are directed at increased elimination or reduction of gut-derived ammonia in addition to correction of dynamic conditions that provoke bouts of HE. The standard of care for treatment of acute HE is lactulose, a nonabsorbable disaccharide that is thought to increase elimination and reduce absorption of ammonia. Although lactulose seems to work in the acute setting, the rate of recurrent HE on maintenance lactulose is high. Medications have been sought that reduce the rate of recurrent HE in patients at high risk for HE but none have been identified. Rifaximin is a poorly absorbed antibiotic that is thought to reduce ammonia production by eliminating ammonia-producing colonic bacteria. Many small studies have suggested that rifaximin is effective in treating acute HE and is extremely well tolerated. This led to a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multinational trial investigating the efficacy of rifaximin over a 6-month period in reducing the risk of recurrent HE in patients at baseline, but with a history of at least two bouts of acute HE in the previous 6 months prior to enrollment. Lactulose could be administered at the discretion of the investigator. A total of 299 patients were randomized to receive rifaximin or placebo; 91% of patients in each group received lactulose. Compared with placebo, patients at high risk for recurrent HE in the rifaximin group had highly statistically significant reductions in bouts of acute HE (58%) and reductions in hospitalizations related to HE (50%) over a 6-month period. The medication was well tolerated with a side-effect profile comparable to placebo. This led to the approval of rifaximin for reduction of risk of recurrent HE by the US Food and Drug Administration in March 2010. It is recommended that patients with a history of recurrent acute HE should be maintained on rifaximin with or without lactulose to reduce the risk of recurrent HE and related hospitalization.

Optimising therapeutics in ASA

This study demonstrates persisting neurological and systemic disease not obviously related to hyperammonaemia in ASA patients on conventional treatment. Although some organs (liver, kidney, gut) are more frequently affected in early-onset patients, who have higher ammonia and ASA levels, this is strikingly not the case for the brain. Our observation of parenchymal infarcts, nodular heterotopia and the report of mild neurological improvement after NO therapy (Nagamani et al.) support the role of NO deficiency in the pathophysiology of the brain disease in ASA. Currently correction of NO deficiency is not considered in the conventional treatment of ASA. Liver transplantation (Marble et al; Newnham et al.) cures the urea cycle but would not be expected to correct the systemic NO-arginine cycle defect. Similarly, successful liver-targeted gene therapy in Asl Neo/Neo mouse did not correct extra-hepatic features such as defective NO-mediated vascular relaxation (Nagamani et al.). Future therapeutic approaches in ASA might consider targeting the NO deficiency, which could include the use of an enriched nitrate diet, nitrate therapy (Nagamani et al; Erez) or multiorgan-targeted gene replacement.

### Faecal bacterial microbiota in patients with cirrhosis and the effect of lactulose administration [^117KbvnK]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cirrhosis is characterized by fibrosis leading to altered liver architecture, resulting in marked reduction in its function and in portal hypertension. Patients with cirrhosis are prone to serious complications, such as variceal gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatocellular carcinoma, and an increased mortality.

Normal human gut is inhabited by several microorganisms, in particular bacteria. The number of bacterial cells in the intestinal lumen of an individual is of the order of that of human cells in the body. These bacteria perform several important physiologic functions, such as digestion of complex carbohydrates leading to energy salvage, synthesis of essential substances such as vitamin K, and modulation of mucosal and systemic immune responses. With its strategic placement between the bowel and the systemic circulation, liver acts as a filter and removes any bacteria and their harmful products that may enter the blood from the gut; the loss of this function in patients with cirrhosis may play a role in the occurrence of complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, sepsis and hepatorenal syndrome.

Modulation of gut microbiota using antimicrobial agents and probiotic preparations has been shown to improve HE; this suggests that intestinal bacteria play a role in the causation of HE. Lactulose, a non-absorbable disaccharide, is another drug used for the prevention and treatment of HE. It cannot be digested by human intestinal enzymes, and reaches the colon unchanged where it is degraded by bacteria. It is believed that the resultant acidic environment changes the composition of the gut microbiota, with a reduction in the bacteria that produce ammonia and an increase in those that trap and use ammonia for their metabolism, ameliorating HE. In fact, in studies using stool culture, lactulose administration has been shown to alter the abundance of certain gut bacteria. However, culture-based techniques have several limitations. In particular, a majority of bacterial species inhabiting the gut can either not be cultured or not be reliably distinguished from other related bacteria. Further, these techniques are only qualitative or, at best, semi-quantitative. Thus, there is a need to study the effect of lactulose on the composition of gut microbiota using better techniques.

### A randomized controlled trial comparing nitazoxanide plus lactulose with lactulose alone in treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy [^116rTYG8]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a reversible spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities associated with liver dysfunction. Lactulose is a nonabsorbable disaccharide presently used to treat HE. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) has a broad-spectrum activity against urease-producing bacteria, so it decreases ammonia production and is therefore expected to reverse the symptoms of HE. A previous pilot study on HE patients given NTZ and lactulose had encouraging results with regard to amelioration of the clinical picture. Patients showed improvement in mental status and the drug was well-tolerated. Results such as these are encouraging larger studies. The aim of this study was to compare the safety and adequacy of NTZ plus lactulose versus lactulose and placebo in management of overt HE.

Methods

In total, 120 cirrhotic patients suffering from overt HE were randomly designated to take either NTZ plus lactulose (n = 60) or lactulose and placebo (n = 60). The Clinical Hepatic Encephalopathy Staging Scale (CHESS) score was assessed for all patients on inclusion to the study and 1 week from the start of treatment.

Results

Both groups evinced an improvement in CHESS score at 1 week, yet the improvement was significantly better in the NTZ group as the score decreased from 4.15 ± 2.09 to 0.00 ± 0.00 compared with 4.96 ± 2.29 to 1.28 ± 0.91 in patients receiving lactulose and placebo (P-value < 0.001).

Conclusions

NTZ significantly decreases the CHESS score and improves mental status in the form of patient alertness, orientation, response to stimulation, and ability to talk. NTZ is safe and well-tolerated apart from infrequent epigastric pain.

### Mouthrinses for the treatment of halitosis [^116jweYe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Halitosis is an unpleasant odour emanating from the oral cavity. Mouthwashes, which are commonly used for dealing with oral malodour, can be generally divided into those that neutralize and those that mask the odour.

Objectives

To investigate the effects of mouthrinses in controlling halitosis.

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to August 2008); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3); MEDLINE (1950 to August 2008); EMBASE (1980 to August 2008); and CINAHL (1982 to August 2008). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mouthrinses to placebo in adults over the age of 18 with halitosis and without significant other comorbidities or health conditions. The primary outcomes considered were self expressed and organoleptic (human nose) assessments of halitosis, and the secondary outcomes included assessment of halitosis as measured by a halimeter, portable sulphide monitor or by gas chromatography coupled with flame-photometric detection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors screened and extracted information from, and independently assessed the risk of bias in the included trials.

Main Results

Five RCTs, involving 293 participants who were randomised to mouthrinses or placebo, were included in this review. In view of the clinical heterogeneity between the trials, pooling of the results and meta-analysis of the extracted data was not feasible and therefore only a descriptive summary of the results of the included trials is provided.0.05% chlorhexidine + 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride + 0.14% zinc lactate mouthrinse significantly reduced the mean change (standard deviation (SD)) of organoleptic scores from baseline compared to placebo (-1.13 (1.1) P < 0.005 versus -0.2 (0.7)) and also caused a more significant reduction in the mean change (SD) in peak level of volatile sulphur compounds (VSC) (-120 (92) parts per billion (ppb) versus 8 (145) ppb in placebo). The chlorhexidine cetylpyridinium chloride zinc lactate mouthrinse showed significantly more tongue (P < 0.001) and tooth (P < 0.002) staining compared to placebo. However, in view of the incomplete reporting of results in three of the trials and the sole use of the halimeter for assessment of VSC levels as outcomes in two further trials, caution should be exercised in interpreting these results.

Authors' Conclusions

Mouthrinses containing antibacterial agents such as chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride may play an important role in reducing the levels of halitosis-producing bacteria on the tongue, and chlorine dioxide and zinc containing mouthrinses can be effective in neutralisation of odouriferous sulphur compounds. Well designed randomised controlled trials with a larger sample size, a longer intervention and follow-up period are still needed.

### Lactulose solution usp, 10 g / 15 mL (lactulose solution) [^1177aTpN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

For the prevention and treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy, including the stages of hepatic pre-coma and coma.

Controlled studies have shown that lactulose solution therapy reduces the blood ammonia level by 25 to 50%; this is generally paralleled by an improvement in the patients' mental state and by an improvement in EEG patterns. The clinical response has been observed in about 75% of patients, which is at least as satisfactory as that resulting from neomycin therapy. An increase in patients' protein tolerance is also frequently observed with lactulose solution therapy. In the treatment of chronic portal-systemic encephalopathy, lactulose solution has been given for over 2 years in controlled studies.

### Inadequate practices for hepatic encephalopathy management in the inpatient setting [^117NPNnQ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of HE — Pharmacology is the key

At the heart of the treatment of HE, is the identification and treatment of a precipitating cause/s. In some cases, correction of this derangement alone may reverse HE. Beyond this, the nonabsorbable disaccharide, lactulose, remains the cornerstone of HE treatment. It is theorized that lactulose works to mitigate and reverse HE through its prebiotic effects, promoting beneficial gut flora, acidifying the gut lumen, and thus inhibiting ammoniagenic bacteria and promoting the growth of lactobacilli, which produces less ammonia. Acidification also prevents the absorption of ammonia within the colon, and in conjunction with its laxative effects, increases the expulsion of ammonia within the stool. Lactulose is generally considered the first‐line medication for the treatment of OHE as well as maintenance in those patients at risk for recurrence. As a part of its four‐pronged approach in the treatment of OHE, the AASLD has recommended the initiation of lactulose 25 mL every 1–2 h until two soft bowel movements occur, with titration thereafter to maintain two to three bowel movements per day. However, close titration of lactulose is crucial, as overuse can lead to complications, such as aspiration, dehydration, hypernatremia, perianal skin irritation, and hypokalemia, which can contribute to potential precipitation of HE. One of the benefits of lactulose in the encephalopathic patient is its ability to be administered both in oral and rectal formulations. This route of administration is usually determined by the clinician depending on the sensorium of the patients. Practically, the titration of lactulose, which is usually nursing‐driven, can become challenging in hospitalized patients. To help improve this, order sets have been built into the electronic medical record by many hospitals. Continued lactulose use after an episode of OHE has resolved has been shown to prevent subsequent recurrence.

### The burden of minimal hepatic encephalopathy: from diagnosis to therapeutic strategies [^114nQE8F]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The proposed treatment for MHE and CHE is actually the same as the one used for the treatment/prophylaxis of OHE; however, in most cases these strategies only manage to ameliorate the indices of brain function (psychometric or neurophysiological) or lower ammonia. In addition, other treatment strategies are reasonably based on an alternative approach that considers drug use after having tested the efficacy of dietetic counseling, modification of gut microflora, as well as the correction of confounders or precipitating factors for HE, such as hyponatremia, or possibly based on a more complete knowledge of changes in human gut microbiota and the neurobiology of the encephalopathy.

Studies specifically aimed at establishing whether the treatment of MHE is able to affect clinically relevant endpoints are therefore greatly needed. The patients' inclusion should be based on the objective definition of the presence of minimal or CHE. The modification of psychometric tests should not be chosen as the main endpoint of the study; the tests should instead be used merely as a criterion to include comparable patients. The sample size should be calculated according to one of the clinically relevant endpoints, such as the QoL or the incidence of OHE; data on these outcomes are available in the literature. The assessment of the efficacy of a given treatment to prevent OHE in patients with MHE requires the organization of large multicenter studies. A parallel design with a placebo or a no-treatment arm is mandatory. Because MHE is a chronic condition, the choice of the drug to be tested should be limited to those that can be administered for a very long period of time without significant side-effects. Among the emerging drugs, modulators of the intestinal bacterial flora should be the first candidates to be tested in this field. Future studies should fill the gaps in our knowledge.

### The role of the intestinal microbiome in cognitive decline in patients with kidney disease [^117NB7Yj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

In mice, ischaemia–reperfusion injury, a model for AKI, higher abundance of Clostridium, Ruminococcus and Enterobacteriaceae and lower abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacilli was found. The role of the gut microbiome in also modulating the outcome from AKI has been recently reviewed. Patients with CKD show significant changes in the composition of their gut microbiota, including a relative decrease in Prevotellaceae and Roseburia and an increase in pathobionts such as Enterobacteriaceaecae, Streptococcaceae and Enterococcus. This is associated with an overall decrease in the production of SCFAs such as butyrate and an increase in urease activity. Similarly, changes in the diversity of the gut microbiome have been reported in patients on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

The causes of dysbiosis in patients with CKD are multifactorial (Fig. 3). Major contributors are elevated plasma urea levels, often sedentary lifestyles (especially in haemodialysis patients), low-fibre diets, constipation and slow stool transit times, and polypharmacy. In CKD, the intestinal epithelium secretes urea into the intestinal lumen, where it is hydrolysed by bacterial ureases to ammonia and binds protons (i.e. raises the intraluminal pH) to form ammonium. Higher luminal pH and urea levels favour the growth of bacteria that use urea as an energy source. Whether high urease activity is beneficial or detrimental remains an open question. Ammonia is well known as a neurotoxic agent in hepatic encephalopathy, while recent data in mice suggest that gut-derived ammonia may be an important precursor for brain metabolism to produce glutamine, glutamate and GABA. Low levels of glutamate and GABA are associated with depressive-like behaviour in mice and restoring brain glutamine levels in mice with reduced intestinal ammonia production reversed depression.

### Asparaginase-associated hyperammonemia [^116wg52A]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Sodium benzoate is routinely used in children with inborn urea cycle deficiencies to reduce ammonia levels. Sodium benzoate conjugates with glycine in the liver to form hippuric acid, which is water soluble and can be easily excreted in urine. As hippuric acid contains one nitrogen molecule per hippuric acid molecule, it provides an alternative pathway for excretion of nitrogen. AAH patients benefit from intervention with sodium benzoate as the reduction in available nitrogen limits ammonia elevations and sodium benzoate is a treatment option in patients with AAH and moderate encephalopathy (CTCAE grade 2) (Figure 1).

The primary highly efficacious intervention for hepatic encephalopathy is oral lactulose, which causes gut overgrowth of Lactobacillus species without high urease activity and production of short chain fatty acids that lead to acidification of colonic pH which can push diffusible ammonia into ammonium ions, thus reducing uptake of ammonia. It is important to monitor hydration status and sodium levels during lactulose therapy. There are no reports on the effect of lactulose in AAH.

Secondary treatment for hepatic encephalopathy is oral, heavily absorbed antibiotics including rifaximin and neomycin. Rifaximin is widely used. It can reduce colonization with ammonia-producing gut bacteria and has a favorable low toxicity profile. Neomycin can inhibit mucosal glutaminase in the intestine resulting in reduced ammonia production.

Figure 1.
Possible interventions according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade of encephalopathy. AAH: asparaginase-associated hyperammonemia; UNL: upper normal level; CTCAE: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.

Neomycin is, however, very rarely used due the drug's dismal toxicity profile. There are no reports of the effects of use of antibiotics to reduce ammonia in patients with AAH. Another intervention option in grade 1 encephalopathy is intravenous infusion of 10% glucose, which is known to reduce protein catabolism.

### Sodium benzoate for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in humans and animals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113F2LPP]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Animal studies

Campollo et al. investigated the effects of SB at 500 mg/kg, lactulose at 4 g/kg, or a combination of both on ammonia levels in rats. The study involved 28 rats, which underwent a portocaval shunt procedure. Ten days after the surgery, the rats were treated with either saline (n = 6), SB (n = 6), lactulose (n = 4), or a combination of SB and lactulose (n = 6). In the saline group, the mean ammonia level increased to 455.5 ± 35.7 µmol/l. However, ammonia levels decreased in all the treatment groups, with the most significant reduction observed in the combination group. Posttreatment ammonia levels were as follows: 188.5 ± 12.1 µmol/l in the combination group (P > 0.001 compared with the saline group), 312 ± 35.7 µmol/l in SB (P = 0.05), and 380.5 ± 35.7 µmol/l in the lactulose group (P = 0.05).

Campollo et al. conducted a study involving 25 rats that underwent a portocaval shunt procedure. Ten days after the surgery, the rats were treated with either saline or variant doses of a zinc derivative of SB (CH-1) via gastric gavage for 7 days. The dosages were 250 mg/kg (n = 4), 500 mg/kg (n = 9), and 1000 mg/kg (n = 3). At the end of the study, the mean blood ammonia levels were as follows: 470.9 ± 27.1 µmol/l in the saline group (n = 9), 417.1 ± 74.2 µmol/l in the 250 mg group, 337 ± 45 µmol/l in the 500 mg group, and 295.6 ± 99.2 µmol/l in the 1000 mg group. These results indicate a dose-dependent effect of SB on reducing ammonia levels(r = −0.487, P < 0.01).

### TMAO and diabetes: from the gut feeling to the heart of the problem [^113SYiqR]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

Impact of pharmacological treatments and lifestyle interventions on plasma TMAO Levels

The concentration of TMAO in the body can be influenced by various therapies and lifestyle changes. In the context of diabetes, special consideration should be given to drugs like metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors, which are key therapeutic agents in the treatment of this condition. Studies indicate that while metformin effectively lowers TMAO levels in mice, it may conversely increase these levels in humans. In patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, treatment with DPP-4 inhibitor does not significantly affect gut microbiota composition, whereas metformin promotes bile acid production, which may enhance the microbiota's capacity to produce TMAO precursors. On the other hand, CCL4 inhibition leads to changes in gut microbiota and normalizes the lipid profile, ultimately reducing TMAO levels. GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors can also lower TMAO levels while simultaneously improving metabolic control. However, inhibiting SGLT2, when used after myocardial infarction, may paradoxically increase TMAO levels.

### Nitrogen scavengers: history, clinical considerations and future prospects [^115uPpTp]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The first time that nitrogen scavengers have been mentioned with their capacity to treat hyperammonemia was by pioneers in UCD research Saul Brusilow and Mark Batshaw, at that time working at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who followed up on historical studies published before 1920 that showed decreased urinary urea excretion upon sodium benzoate ingestion "indicating that hippuric acid nitrogen is derived at the expense of the nitrogen normally eliminated as urea". In another study aiming to prove the existence of glutamine as a metabolite in the human organism, phenylacetylglutamine was detected in human urine after ingestion of phenylacetate. Brusilow and Batshaw were inspired by these reports and successfully used these compounds in a groundbreaking attempt to treat acute hyperammonemia in a few single patients, thereby showing for the first time that this method of nitrogen scavenging is a quantitatively significant alternative mechanism of waste nitrogen disposal in patients with UCDs. This laid the basis for the treatment of acute and chronic, primary and secondary hyperammonemias, which is still widely practiced today.

Phenylbutyrate was introduced in 1990 with the main intention to find a compound with a less unpleasant odor and taste than that of phenylacetate after the demonstration that phenylbutyrate, administered orally, is rapidly converted to phenylacetyl‐CoA in the body via beta‐oxidation. It is available in its sodium‐coupled form and its prodrug form glycerol phenylbutyrate. Notably, there was also some new development with changes to the drug formulations of oral phenylbutyrate, trying to improve adherence that was notoriously unsatisfactory, mainly due to the taste and the large amount and frequency of medication needed to swallow. However, the targets of scavenging therapy, glycine and glutamine, remained unchanged and treatment is still not directly addressing ammonia as the main culprit of hyperammonemia.

This paper will discuss the chemical characteristics of nitrogen scavengers and their clinical use, will delineate the potential side effects of especially phenylbutyrate that may be considered for alternative therapeutic routes, and will provide an outlook for future developments including direct ammonia scavenging.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^113NmcfA]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Halitosis

Terminology

Patients with genuine halitosis (i.e. objective evidence of malodour) can be subclassified into those with physiological halitosis (i.e. no evidence of underlying condition) and pathological halitosis (i.e. evidence of underlying condition).

Aetiology

Physiological halitosis is the most common type: the cause of physiological halitosis is the bacterial putrefaction of food debris, epithelial cells, blood cells and saliva within the oral cavity (and particularly on the posterior part of the dorsum of the tongue) and poor/limited oral hygiene. The cause of pathological halitosis may be an infection, inflammation or malignancy. In ~ 90% such cases, the source of the malodour is the oral cavity, but other potential sources include the upper respiratory tract (nose, sinuses), the lower respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract or a systemic metabolic problem.

Management

Management depends on the type of halitosis: in patients with physiological halitosis, it primarily involves oral hygiene measures, whilst in patients with pathological halitosis, it primarily involves treatment of the underlying cause (if possible), e.g. antibiotics for infections (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V).

The management of physiological halitosis includes (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V) (a) generic oral hygiene measures (see above); (b) avoidance of odorous foodstuffs (e.g. garlic, onions); (c) alcohol cessation; (d) smoking cessation; (e) measures to reduce bacterial numbers (e.g. tongue cleaning, chlorhexidine — mouthwash); (f) measures to reduce bacterial substrate (e.g. tongue cleaning, "professional" dental/periodontal cleaning) and (g) measures to convert offensive volatile sulphur compounds to inoffensive non-volatile compounds (e.g. zinc salts — toothpaste, mouthwash; sodium bicarbonate/baking soda – toothpaste). Many oral care products are available to manage halitosis, and those with specific properties (see above) should be prescribed in preference to those with simply "masking"/cosmetic properties (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). It should be noted that the evidence on managing halitosis in general is of limited quality.

### Lactulose (Enulose) [^111VxYPk]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Lactulose causes a decrease in blood ammonia concentration and reduces the degree of portalsystemic encephalopathy. These actions are considered to be results of the following:

Bacterial degradation of lactulose in the colon acidifies the colonic contents.

This acidification of colonic contents results in the retention of ammonia in the colon as the ammonium ion. Since the colonic contents are then more acid than the blood, ammonia can be expected to migrate from the blood into the colon to form the ammonium ion.

The acid colonic contents convert NH3to the ammonium ion (NH4)+, trapping it and preventing its absorption.

The laxative action of the metabolites of lactulose then expels the trapped ammonium ion from the colon.

Experimental data indicate that lactulose is poorly absorbed. Lactulose given orally to man and experimental animals resulted in only small amounts reaching the blood. Urinary excretion has been determined to be 3% or less and is essentially complete within 24 hours.

When incubated with extracts of human small intestinal mucosa, lactulose was not hydrolyzed during a 24-hour period and did not inhibit the activity of these extracts on lactose. Lactulose reaches the colon essentially unchanged. There it is metabolized by bacteria with the formation of low molecular weight acids that acidify the colon contents.

### Asparaginase-associated hyperammonemia [^113jDzxk]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Asparaginase-associated hyperammonemia

AAH is rarely reported, most likely due to the lack of clinical recognition. AAH definitions differ with respect to ammonia levels above the upper normal limit with or without symptoms in patients who are treated with L-asparaginase at the time of onset of hyperammonemia (Table 1). It has been shown in animal models that multiple asparaginase infusions cause stepwise increments of hyperammonemia, but the same pattern has not been sufficiently explored and reported in children and young adults treated with asparaginase.

Higher ammonia levels, probably due to increased glutaminase activity, are mainly observed with Erwinase administration compared to the E.coli -derived asparaginase formulations, as seen in the case described in this review. Ammonia is a by-product of amino acid metabolism and of gut bacterial hydrolysis of urea. Major organ contributors are the intestines and the kidneys. Ammonia is toxic to several cellular functions and is effectively scavenged from the blood stream by a clearance rate close to cardiac output. This happens primarily by amidation of glutamic acid to glutamine by glutamine synthetases, and also by the action of transaminases converting carbon skeletons to amino acids. Final elimination from the body is by hepatic transfer of amide- and amino-nitrogen into the urea cycle, which has a very large capacity, followed by urinary excretion of urea (Online Supplementary Figure S2).

Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body. The enzyme glutaminase catalyzes release of the amide nitrogen to ammonia and is present in all organs. The dynamics of ammonia turnover thus involves the balance between glutamine synthetase/glutaminase and the capacity of urea synthesis in the urea cycle. Hyperammonemia occurs when ammonia production is increased beyond the elimination rate or elimination is decreased. Thus, increased production may result both from increased glutaminase activity and decreased elimination from compromised urea synthesis. Ammonia passes freely across the blood-brain barrier in amounts parallel to the blood concentration, and astrocytic glutamine synthase subsequently increases glutamine concentration. The osmotic action of glutamine results in astrocytic swelling that may be discrete or, in cases with very high ammonia, be associated with brain edema. The metabolic consequence of the increased glutamine includes disturbances between excitatory glutaminergic/glutamatergic neurotransmission and neurotransmission via the strong inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) which suppresses neuronal energy consumption. The cerebral symptoms of hyperammonemia can, therefore, be related to different degrees of brain edema and/or to psychomotor neurodepression, as detailed below.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^1147SnGX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Metabolic acidosis in CKD — practice points, treatment thresholds, and dietary guidance are as follows: Practice Point 3.10.1 states to consider use of pharmacological treatment with or without dietary intervention to prevent development of acidosis with potential clinical implications (e.g., bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l in adults). Practice Point 3.10.2 advises monitoring to ensure therapy does not result in serum bicarbonate concentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal and does not adversely affect BP control, serum potassium, or fluid status. The KDOQI Work Group agrees that acidosis in adults should only be treated with pharmacologic agents when bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l or if there is a clear indication to do so, and notes a large clinical trial of veverimer did not demonstrate a decline in a composite CKD progression outcome. Pediatric clinicians may choose to treat milder acidosis more aggressively to help optimize growth and bone health. Nutrition guidance supports prevention and treatment via increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables, including the statement: In adults with CKD 1–4, we suggest reducing net endogenous acid production through increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables (2C) to reduce the rate of decline of residual kidney function.

For the prevention and treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy, including the stages of hepatic pre-coma and coma.

Controlled studies have shown that lactulose solution therapy reduces the blood ammonia levels by 25 to 50%; this is generally paralleled by an improvement in the patients' mental state and by an improvement in EEG patterns. The clinical response has been observed in about 75% of patients, which is at least as satisfactory as that resulting from neomycin therapy. An increase in patients' protein tolerance is also frequently observed with lactulose therapy. In the treatment of chronic portal-systemic encephalopathy, Lactulose has been given for over 2 years in controlled studies.

### Inhibition of urease-mediated ammonia production by 2-octynohydroxamic acid in hepatic encephalopathy [^114YUGje]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric complication of liver disease which is partly associated with elevated ammonemia. Urea hydrolysis by urease-producing bacteria in the colon is often mentioned as one of the main routes of ammonia production in the body, yet research on treatments targeting bacterial ureases in hepatic encephalopathy is limited. Herein we report a hydroxamate-based urease inhibitor, 2-octynohydroxamic acid, exhibiting improved in vitro potency compared to hydroxamic acids that were previously investigated for hepatic encephalopathy. 2-octynohydroxamic acid shows low cytotoxic and mutagenic potential within a micromolar concentration range as well as reduces ammonemia in rodent models of liver disease. Furthermore, 2-octynohydroxamic acid treatment decreases cerebellar glutamine, a product of ammonia metabolism, in male bile duct ligated rats. A prototype colonic formulation enables reduced systemic exposure to 2-octynohydroxamic acid in male dogs. Overall, this work suggests that urease inhibitors delivered to the colon by means of colonic formulations represent a prospective approach for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.

### Polyethylene glycol versus lactulose in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116PtMQg]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

The mechanism by which PEG improved HESA Score remains debatable. It has been revealed that lactulose works by reducing intestinal ammonia production and absorption leading to an improvement in HE; however, when comparing ammonia levels 24 hours after administration of PEG or lactulose, two trialsshowed that lactulose was associated with a higher drop in the mean ammonia level compared with patients that were in the PEG group, suggesting that improvement in symptoms of HE in patients that were given PEG was not entirely due to clearance of ammonia. It is important to note that the serum ammonia level does not always correlate with the severity of clinical symptoms, and clinical analysis has showed that lactulose was related to a non-response rate as high as 22%.

HE-related hospitalisation costs continue to rise; these costs escalated from $4.68 billion in 2005 to $7.25 billion in 2009. Our analysis showed that patients treated with PEG had a significantly shorter time to resolution of HE. Naderian et al found that patients treated with PEG and lactulose had a shorter mean hospital stay of 6.8 days compared with patients treated with lactulose alone (mean 8.9 days). These results were also validated by Ahmed et al who found that patients treated with both PEG and lactulose had a mean hospital stay of 9 days compared with 13 days in patients treated with lactulose alone. However, despite the fact that the studies included in this analysescommented on the shorter length of hospital stay in patient receiving PEG, our analysis failed to show statistical significance in terms of length of hospital stay even after omitting one study to create a more homogenous group. Accordingly, while the use of PEG contributed to a faster reduction in HESA Score and faster resolution of HE, however, it failed to show a statistical significance in terms of shorter length of hospital stay.

### Combined PEG3350 plus lactulose results in early resolution of hepatic encephalopathy and improved 28-day survival in acute-on-chronic liver failure [^115ipVFh]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is associated with high short-term mortality in those with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 electrolyte solution can ensure rapid gut catharsis, which may resolve HE more effectively than lactulose. In this open-label-randomized trial, we compared PEG+lactulose versus lactulose alone in ACLF with HE grade ≥ 2 for efficacy and outcome.

Patients and Methods

Patients were randomized to receive PEG (2L q12h) followed by lactulose (30mL q8h) or standard medical treatment [SMT, lactulose (titrated 30mL q8h)]. Endpoints were HE grade improvement at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 7 days using hepatic encephalopathy scoring algorithm (HESA), ammonia reduction, HE resolution, and survival benefit.

Results

Of 60 patients, 29 were randomized to PEG+lactulose arm and 31 to SMT. In the PEG arm, early reduction in HESA score was noted in more persons [18 (62.1%) vs. 10 (32.2%); P = 0.021] with a shorter median time to HE resolution [4.5 (3 to 9)d vs. 9 (8 to 11)d; P = 0.023]. On multivariate analysis, age [hazard ratio (HR),1.06 (1.00 to 1.13); P = 0.03], HESA score [HR, 6.01 (1.27 to 28.5); P = 0.024], and model for end-stage liver disease [HR, 1.26 (1.01 to 1.53); P = 0.022] were predictors of mortality at 28 days. Ammonia level or reduction did not correlate with HE grades. Adverse events included excessive diarrhea (20.6% vs. 9.6%) in the PEG and SMT arms, albeit without dyselectrolytemia or worsened renal function. In the PEG versus SMT arm, survival at 28 days were 93.1% versus 67.7% (P = 0.010) and at 90 days was 68.9% versus 48.3% (P = 0.940), respectively, with fewer persons relapsing with HE in the PEG arm.

Conclusions

PEG resulted in early and sustained HE resolution with improved short-term survival making, it a suitable and safe drug in patients with acute HE in ACLF.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^117M49X3]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Halitosis — management — management depends on the type of halitosis: in patients with physiological halitosis, it primarily involves oral hygiene measures, whilst in patients with pathological halitosis, it primarily involves treatment of the underlying cause (if possible), e.g. antibiotics for infections (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). For physiological halitosis, measures include generic oral hygiene, avoidance of odorous foodstuffs, alcohol cessation, smoking cessation, measures to reduce bacterial numbers (e.g. tongue cleaning, chlorhexidine — mouthwash), measures to reduce bacterial substrate (e.g. tongue cleaning, "professional" dental/periodontal cleaning) and measures to convert offensive volatile sulphur compounds to inoffensive non-volatile compounds (e.g. zinc salts — toothpaste, mouthwash; sodium bicarbonate/baking soda — toothpaste) (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). Many oral care products are available to manage halitosis, and those with specific properties should be prescribed in preference to those with simply "masking"/"cosmetic" properties (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). It should be noted that the evidence on managing halitosis in general is limited and of low quality.

### Pharmacological therapies for obesity [^115ux8mQ]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Pharmacological therapy for obesity is in transition. Historically, there have been few effective agents, and many have been with-drawn because of unacceptable side effects. Current options include three medications approved by the FDA for the treatment of obesity: phentermine, sibutramine and orlistat. Phentermine and sibutramine suppress appetite and promote thermogenesis, and orlistat blocks fat digestion and absorption in the gut. Several drugs approved for other indications often promote weight loss, including bupropion, metformin, topiramate and zonisamide; they have been used empirically for treatment of obesity and to counter the weight-promoting effects of other medications. Expanding knowledge of the physiological mechanisms of body weight regulation has revealed new molecular targets, and more than 150 novel agents are under active development. Because weight regulation is complex, and redundant systems protect against perceived starvation, optimal treatment of obesity will likely require combinations of therapies. The accelerating emergence of new medications will facilitate the development of such effective combinations.

### Acetohydroxamic acid (Lithostat) [^116h7Hwj]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

AHA reversibly inhibits the bacterial enzyme urease, thereby inhibiting the hydrolysis of urea and production of ammonia in urine infected with urea-splitting organisms. The reduced ammonia levels and decreased pH enhance the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents and allow an increased cure rate of these infections.

AHA is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration; peak blood levels occur from 0.25 to 1 hour after dosing. The compound is distributed throughout body water, and there is no known binding to any tissue. AHA chelates with dietary iron within the gut. This reaction may interfere with absorption of AHA and with iron. Concomitant hypochromic anemia should be treated with intramuscular iron.

In rodents, the metabolic fate of AHA is well known; 55% is excreted unchanged in urine, 25% is excreted as acetamide or acetate and 7% is excreted by the lungs as carbon dioxide. Less than 1% is excreted in the feces. Approximately 5% of the administered dose is unaccounted for. In rodents, AHA shows a dose-related change in pharmacokinetics; with increasing dose, there is an increase in the half-life and an increase in the percent of the administered dose recovered in urine as unchanged AHA.

Pharmacokinetics in man are generally similar to rodents including the dose-related increase in half-life, but they are not as well characterized as in the rodent. Thirty-six to sixty-five percent (36–65%) of the oral dosage is excreted unchanged in the urine. It is unaltered AHA in the urine that provides the therapeutic effect, but the precise concentration of AHA in urine that is necessary to inhibit urease is incompletely delineated. Therapeutic benefit may be obtained from concentrations as low as 8 mcg/ml; higher concentrations (i.e., 30 mcg/ml) are expected to provide more complete inhibition of urease. The plasma half-life of AHA is approximately 5–10 hours in subjects with normal renal function and is prolonged in patients with reduced renal function.

### ACG clinical guideline: small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^114sSU4d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth — breath testing endpoints emphasize symptom-based outcomes and a methane-specific threshold: In hydrogen subjects, a key secondary endpoint could be diarrhea or loose stool, with other symptoms as exploratory secondary endpoints. Methane would be considered a special case in which constipation is a key feature and could be the primary symptom and endpoint with bloating a key secondary outcome. For methane, a value of no greater than 10 ppm would be considered successful eradication. Because methane production and constipation have been shown to be correlated, a key secondary endpoint could be reduction in methane from baseline with corresponding reduction in constipation.

### Acute care and emergency general surgery in patients with chronic liver disease: how can we optimize perioperative care? A review of the literature [^1172SD8u]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy

Other possible etiologies of global neurologic decline should be investigated (e.g. hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypoglycemia, uremia, medications, delirium tremens, hypoactive delirium, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage). Elevated blood ammonia level (found in over 90% of cases) corroborates the clinical diagnosis, but correlation with the actual disease severity is poor. It should also be noted that monitoring blood ammonia levels is inferior to clinical assessment, and it is not recommended in asymptomatic patients. Benzodiazepines should be avoided and replaced with haloperidol when chemical restraint is indicated.

The classic protein-restricted diet does not find support in the current literature because most patients do not tolerate high-food/calorie intake. Furthermore, malnutrition is a much more significant concern. Despite ongoing debate, branched amino acid supplementation may also be beneficial. Other adjuncts, such as cathartics and oral antibiotics, are recommended in an attempt to decrease the intestinal production of ammonia due to bacterial overgrowth.

Lactulose, a non-absorbable sugar that causes osmotic diarrhea, has been traditionally used to treat hepatic encephalopathy. It acidifies the colon and promotes the conversion of ammonia to ammonium, which is not reabsorbed. Lactulose dosing should be titrated to two to three bowel movements per day. Known side effects of this therapy include electrolyte imbalances, nausea, and bloating.

Rifaximin, a semisynthetic drug derivative of rifampin, was originally employed as a second-line treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. In 2012, a meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials stated that rifaximin had similar effectiveness compared to lactulose, with fewer side effects. A more recent, larger meta-analysis has also further supported its use, although the dominant limitation remains its high cost when compared to lactulose.

Hepatorenal syndrome

Euvolemia and electrolyte homeostasis should be maintained under strict clinical and laboratory monitoring. Acute kidney injury in the absence of hemodynamic instability, use of nephrotoxic drugs, or parenchymal renal disease suggests the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. Additional diagnostic criteria include no improvement in renal function after volume expansion with albumin and diuretic withdrawal. Treatment of hepatorenal syndrome requires the use of splanchnic vasoconstrictors (terlipressin, noradrenalin, or midodrine) and albumin infusion. Improved renal function has been demonstrated with medical treatment, but a mortality benefit is only ultimately achieved with liver transplantation. TIPS placement and renal and hepatic replacement therapies can be indicated as bridging strategies.

### Asparaginase-associated hyperammonemia [^114McBFY]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment options

The management of AAH depends on the severity of the hyperammonemia and associated symptoms. The primary goal is to reduce ammonia levels while maintaining effective asparaginase therapy whenever possible. Early recognition of symptoms, such as lethargy, vomiting, and encephalop athy, is critical to prevent severe complications such as cerebral herniation.

In patients with hyperammonemia due to causes other than asparaginase treatment, such as inborn errors of metabolism, liver failure or sepsis, the therapy for hyperammonemia encompasses: (i) reduced protein intake, (ii) interventions that can reduce ammonia absorption from the gut, (iii) ammonia-scavengers using metabolic interventions and (iv) increasing the function/activity of the urea cycle with arginine and carglumic acid(Online Supplementary Figure S2). Similar approaches have been used in patients receiving asparaginase, including reducing the asparaginase doses preferably while monitoring asparaginase activity or by extending the infusion time of Erwinase and withdrawal of asparaginase. The latter however should be avoided(Table 1).

In asymptomatic patients (CTCAE grade 1) elevated ammonia levels do not require treatment. In patients with mild neurotoxicity, a protein-reduced or protein-free diet may reduce intestinal ammonia production. The role of restricting protein intake has been questioned. Protein restriction may offer limited benefit for patients with AAH, as most ammonia derives from asparaginase's glutaminase activity rather than dietary protein. It is not recommended in patients with hepatic encephalopathy because it results in catabolism with increased muscle ammonia production, and sarcopenia in which the reduced muscle mass reduces clearance of ammonia. Additionally, administration of 10% glucose infusions to reduce protein catabolism is commonly used.

In patients with moderate encephalopathy (CTCAE grade 1 or 2) we recommend ammonia-reducing therapies such as sodium benzoate and lactulose, antibiotics, glucose 10% infusion and a reduction in asparaginase dose.

### The butterfly effect: collateral damage and impacts of antimicrobial strategies on the oral microbiome [^113YJ7jT]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Beyond antibiotic therapies, probiotics provide promising alternatives for controlling disease and creating a habitable microenvironment for commensal bacteria, yet one that is hostile to pathogens. Probiotics are live microorganisms that when consumed in adequate amounts, either in their viable or non-viable forms, confer health benefits on the host by balancing the microbial ecosystems in the body. They are often used to restore or maintain healthy microbiota in the GI tract, at the vaginal epithelium, and within the oral cavity. Lactobacillus spp. (e.g. L. rhamnosus, L crispatus) and Bifidobacterium spp. (e.g. B. bifidum and B. longum) have been used to control microbial populations within these different ecological niches. The mounting evidence for probiotic therapy to combat oral diseases is promising, with several recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicating positive outcomes in patients with oral diseases such as dental caries, periodontitis and halitosis –. Probiotic therapies hold many advantages over antibiotics, with one in particular being the ability to integrate probiotics into lozenges for localized targeting of the oral cavity. Studies have shown that probiotics delivered in this manner can improve gingival health, reduce plaque and enhance immunity. Although dental material science continues to develop new and innovative methods for localized delivery of antimicrobials including antibiotics, we are still a long way from creating an alternative that bypasses the systemic implications associated with such therapy.

### Inhibition of urease-mediated ammonia production by 2-octynohydroxamic acid in hepatic encephalopathy [^112knwvU]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In rats, the aqueous solution of 2-octynoHA containing HPβCD significantly reduced ammonemia in both the DEN-induced liver disease model and the BDL model of type C HE. However, in both models, reduced ammonemia was observed only midway through the treatment which was then followed by the increase in ammonia levels at the end of the treatment. It is worth mentioning that such a trend was also found in the DEN model groups treated with rifaximin suggesting that it might be attributed to the late-stage liver disease and thereby to dramatically reduced liver capacity to metabolize ammonia. Therefore, further research should focus on assessing the efficacy of 2-octynoHA treatment when introduced earlier. Nevertheless, despite a slight elevation in ammonia levels, a significant decrease in cerebellar Gln in BDL rats treated with 2-octynoHA solution compared to the control was observed at the end of the treatment which additionally supports the effectiveness of 2-octynoHA in inhibiting ammoniagenesis. Interestingly, along with the decreased Gln level, other brain metabolites (i.e. Tau, Cr, PCr, tCr, Glu, GABA, Glc, NAA) also decreased compared to the negative control group. The mechanism behind these changes as well as practical implications are unclear, and therefore, should be addressed in further studies involving longitudinal 1 H MRS experiments and behavioral tests. Furthermore, the effects of 2-octynoHA suspension or enteric capsules on hyperammonemia and neurometabolic profile of BDL rats were less pronounced than that of a solution highlighting the importance of a dissolution agent in the formulation.

Taken together, this work highlights 2-octynoHA as a promising therapeutic option for HE. Future research should aim at maximizing 2-octynoHA activity in the colon through formulation optimization, characterizing its safety profile and assessing its efficacy in reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms of HE.

### Faecal bacterial microbiota in patients with cirrhosis and the effect of lactulose administration [^112Rrap4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

High-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing has a major advantage in that it not only permits accurate species-level identification of various bacterial species present in a complex mixture, but also estimates their relative abundances. This technique has not previously been used to assess the effect of lactulose on intestinal microbiota. Our study, using this technique, failed to show any change in gut microbiota after lactulose administration. This lack of effect was found on analysis at different levels of phylogenetic organization, i.e. from phylum to species level. Further, we also did not find any change in the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota, or of the abundance of bacteria that can produce ammonia. This indicates that the beneficial effect of lactulose on HE may not be related to a change in the composition of gut microbiota, and may instead be mediated by another mechanism. Our findings support a recent report in which Bajaj et al. found no major change, except for a reduction in the abundance in Faecalibacterium spp. (from 6% to 1%), in gut microbiota 14 days after lactulose withdrawal in seven patients with cirrhosis. In our study, bacteria belonging to this genus had an abundance of ~0.1% in both pre- and post-lactulose specimens, with no change after lactulose. Furthermore, we observed a closer similarity of paired (before and after lactulose) specimens from each individual with each other than with specimens from other patients collected at a similar time point; this too supports the conclusion that lactulose did not have a major effect on gut microbiota.

### Intestinal dysbiosis and probiotic use: its place in hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^117VuHYN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
The causes of cirrhosis

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE), on the other hand, represents a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities in patients with impaired liver function after exclusion of other known brain diseases. ΗΕ is generally classified as overt (OΗΕ) and minimal (MHE). MHE refers to the group of patients without any clinically detectable neurological anomalies, but with abnormal neuropsychiatric or neurophysiological test results. Oxidative stress, inflammation and neurosteroids have a synergistic role in the pathogenesis of HE. Via the creation of intestinal barrier dysfunction and systemic inflammation, intestinal flora and their byproducts — such as ammonia, indoles, oxindoles, and endotoxin — also play an important role in the pathogenesis of HE.

Differences between healthy individuals and patients with cirrhosis in terms of intestinal microbiota have been previously demonstrated. Bajaj et al, one of the leading research groups in this area, introduced the concept of the cirrhosis/dysbiosis ratio (CDR), expressed as the "good vs. bad" taxon abundance ratio, to determine the degree of dysbiosis in cirrhosis and to make comparisons. They showed that the CDR was significantly lower in healthy controls than in cirrhotic patients. At the same time, the stool microbiome profile changed as the severity of cirrhosis increased. Poorly absorbed antibiotics and probiotics have been identified as potential therapeutic interventions for dysbiosis in patients with cirrhosis, and prebiotics such as oligosaccharides, and poorly digestible starch and dietary fiber, which are weak digestible dietary components that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria and suppression of harmful bacteria, were previously used for HE treatment. Lactulose, a special sample synthetic disaccharide, has been shown to improve HE by reducing blood ammonia levels. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are functional food ingredients that modulate the gut microflora to improve host health and well-being. Probiotics affect the intestinal flora in the intestinal system, causing a decrease in the pathogenesis of urease-producing bacteria and thus reducing the production of toxic substances, especially ammonia, derived from the intestinal system. Probiotics have been shown to improve MHE and prevent OHE by reducing blood ammonia levels. Probiotics can also reduce oxidative stress by showing antioxidant activity, thereby providing positive modulation of the gut microbiota. Thus, probiotics can contribute to HE patients' health by modulating the intestinal microbiota. The purpose of this review is to explain the possible effects of probiotics in cirrhosis and HE via modulating gut microbiota.

### Sodium benzoate for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in humans and animals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114aQsHi]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Snehavardhan et al. conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 86 children under 18 years with chronic liver disease. The study compared SB (200 mg/kg/day) plus standard treatment (lactulose, rifaximin, and diet) to a placebo plus standard treatment. A total of 88 episodes of HE were analyzed, with 44 episodes per group. There was a significant decrease in ammonia levels after treatment compared with baseline (129.8 ± 34.0 vs. 109.0 ± 40.4 µmol/L), although the difference from the placebo group was NS. There was no significant effect on the resolution of overt HE, duration of hospital stay (11.8 ± 9.5 vs. 10.0 ± 7.6 days in SB vs. standard treatment, respectively; P = 0.315), or survival with native liver. Adverse events were similar between the groups, and SB was well tolerated. However, there was an increase in ascites observed in 15.9% of patients receiving SB, compared with 4.5% in the placebo group, though this difference was not statistically significant.

Sushma et al. reported on a randomized double-blind controlled trial involving 74 adult patients with cirrhosis or surgical portosystemic anastomosis and HE. Patients were randomized to receive either lactulose (n = 36) or SB at 5 g twice daily orally (n = 38). The clinical and demographic characteristics of the two groups were similar. There was no significant difference between the groups in ammonia reduction, clinical recovery, time to recovery (11.6 ± 6.4 vs. 12.8 ± 9.1 days in SB vs. lactulose, respectively; P > 0.1), recovery to normal mental status or adverse events.

Uribe et al. provided an interim report from a multicenter, double-blind randomized trial. The study included adult patients with chronic HE grade I or II and liver cirrhosis. After an interim analysis of 27 patients, the results were reported due to highly significant findings favoring SB. Patients were randomized to receive either SB (5.6 g/day) or lactitol for 2 weeks. Ammonia levels significantly decreased in both groups. Asterixis, mental state, and EEG results improved significantly in both groups (P < 0.001), with SB being better tolerated by patients.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and / or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^115Py8sa]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Nonabsorbable disaccharides not only remove nitrogen-containing substances from the gastrointestinal tract via their laxative effects but are also metabolized by the colonic microbiota to produce short-chain organic acids. These acids are thought to inhibit the growth of ammonia-producing bacteria and to convert ammonia to nonabsorbable ammonium, thereby further decreasing the ammonia load. Adherence to lactulose may be affected by its adverse effects, which can include severe diarrhea, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, bloating, flatulence, nausea and vomiting.

The most commonly used antibiotic, rifaximin-α 550 mg, is a locally acting oral antibiotic that is minimally absorbed in the gut to reduce the effects of intestinal flora, including ammonia-producing species. Rifaximin-α 550 mg is indicated for the reduction in recurrence of episodes of OHE in patients aged ≥ 18 years. C. difficile -associated diarrhea has been reported with the use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including rifaximin-α 550 mg.

Current guidelines recommend that an episode of OHE (whether spontaneous or precipitated) should be actively treated, and that secondary prophylaxis should be initiated after an episode to prevent recurrence. Lactulose is recommended as the first choice for treatment of episodic HE, and for the prevention of recurrent episodes of HE after the initial episode. Rifaximin is recommended as an effective add-on to lactulose for the prevention of OHE recurrence after the second episode. Intravenous LOLA and oral branched-chain amino acids can be used as alternative or additional agents to treat patients who are not responsive to conventional therapy. Prophylactic therapy should be continued, unless precipitating factors (e.g. infections and variceal bleeding) have been well controlled or liver function or nutritional status improved. However, a consolidated overview of current evidence for the effectiveness and safety/tolerability of HE treatment in the long-term setting is currently lacking. The aims of this systematic review were therefore to identify and assess published evidence for the long-term (≥ 6 months) pharmacological management of HE and to discuss the implications of this evidence for everyday clinical practice.
