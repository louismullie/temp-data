## Question

How to treat someone going to dialysis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat someone who is going to dialysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is acute kidney injury requiring dialysis (AKI-D) versus end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) starting maintenance dialysis. Then, I should verify the initial priorities in the first 24–48 hours, including access, modality, and safety. Next, I will examine medication management and dosing adjustments. After that, I need to check volume and blood pressure targets, followed by anemia and mineral bone disease strategies. I will then consider recovery monitoring and when to stop dialysis in AKI-D. Finally, I should review long-term planning, conservative care options, and special populations, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because management diverges substantially between AKI-D and ESKD. AKI-D is common after hospitalization, with roughly 20–30% of survivors discharged still requiring dialysis, and about half recover within 90 days, so I should not assume permanence and must plan for recovery and de-escalation from the outset [^ccf7146f] [^e7c1089e]. In contrast, ESKD represents irreversible kidney failure where the focus is on durable modality, access, and conservative care when appropriate, and the decision to start should be symptom- and goal-driven rather than purely eGFR-based [^9ee0773d] [^2895aa37].

> I need to ensure the first 24–48 hours prioritize life-threatening issues and safe dialysis delivery. That means securing vascular access, typically a tunneled internal jugular catheter for AKI-D unless a mature AV fistula or graft already exists, and initiating dialysis for urgent indications such as refractory hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema, or uremic encephalopathy, while watching for dialysis disequilibrium in those with very high urea and starting with lower-intensity sessions if needed [^822c9ba4] [^6cf8222a] [^0f194c5c]. Hold on, I should verify modality selection in hemodynamically unstable patients; continuous modalities are preferred when instability is present, though RCTs have not shown clear mortality differences between continuous and intermittent RRT, so I should individualize based on hemodynamics and local expertise [^6cf8222a].

> Next, I should review medication management because dialysis alters pharmacokinetics and AKI-D patients are at high risk of medication errors. I need to check for nephrotoxins and stop NSAIDs, PPIs, and other offenders when possible, and I should dose renally cleared drugs using an eGFR less than 10 mL/min in anuric patients with supplemental post-dialysis dosing when indicated, while remembering to readjust doses as kidney function recovers or dialysis is tapered [^3430d234] [^0a6d05ac]. Wait, let me verify RAAS blockade; in AKI-D, I should avoid ACE inhibitors or ARBs initially, but consider restarting them once hemodynamics stabilize and hyperkalemia risk is acceptable because they are cardio- and kidney-protective in appropriate indications [^0a6d05ac].

> I will now examine volume and blood pressure management, which are tightly linked in dialysis. Let me think about dry weight; I should individualize ultrafiltration targets to relieve congestion while avoiding intradialytic hypotension, which can impair kidney recovery in AKI-D, and I should maintain a permissive predialysis systolic BP under 180 mmHg rather than aggressively lowering it, given the U-shaped mortality curve and the risk of hypotension in recovery phenotypes [^b25a3df3] [^2b939386]. I should double-check dialysate sodium; individualizing dialysate sodium can mitigate intradialytic hypotension and cramping, though evidence for hard outcomes is limited, so I will tailor it to symptoms and hemodynamics while monitoring for sodium loading in those with hypertension or edema [^937b7333].

> For anemia, I need to ensure iron deficiency is corrected but avoid iron overload. Let me verify the approach in AKI-D; IV iron is reasonable to treat iron deficiency, but I should avoid maintenance IV iron protocols and reserve ESAs for patients with more than 30 days of dialysis dependence or those with baseline CKD, keeping hemoglobin targets modest to prevent transfusion-related allosensitization that could threaten transplant candidacy [^454b2b10] [^db896229]. Hold on, I should confirm that supraphysiologic iron stores are harmful; yes, excessive IV iron correlates with cardiovascular risk and should be avoided when ferritin is high without inflammation or when transferrin saturation is excessive [^826b7adf].

> I should confirm mineral and bone disorder management. In ESKD, maintaining dialysate calcium around 1.25–1.5 mmol/L helps balance hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia risks, and I need to monitor phosphate binders and vitamin D analogs with attention to dynamic changes during AKI recovery, adjusting as kidney function returns [^129e63e4]. But wait, what if the patient is on peritoneal dialysis; the same calcium range generally applies, though PD patients may have different phosphate and calcium profiles, so I should individualize and reassess frequently during recovery or transitions [^notfound].

> Now, I need to ensure a structured plan for kidney function recovery in AKI-D. I should categorize recovery likelihood into high, moderate, or low phenotypes based on baseline eGFR, age, comorbidities, and duration of dialysis, and continue recovery-focused care for at least 90 days in high-likelihood patients, 30–60 days in moderate, and consider earlier ESRD designation in low-likelihood cases to facilitate access and transplant evaluation [^fc8c6bd0] [^e7c1089e]. Let me verify tapering criteria; urine output above roughly 400–500 mL/day or creatinine clearance above 12 mL/min supports reducing frequency or holding dialysis, and I should actively taper to avoid dialytrauma while ensuring safe follow-up in nephrology clinics [^370bd71d].

> For long-term planning in ESKD, I should confirm that modality selection is patient-centered and timely. Shared decision-making should start in CKD stage 4, with education on home HD, PD, in-center HD, and conservative care, and early nephrology referral allows time for access planning and reduces starts with catheters, which carry higher infection risk and poorer outcomes [^7551a2e1] [^8590efe7]. Hold on, I should verify conservative care data; in older or frail patients, conservative kidney management can yield similar early survival with less time in hospital and more deaths at home, so I must align treatment with goals of care and not assume dialysis is the default [^bd523c95] [^3485809e].

> I need to check special populations and contexts. In COVID-19, dialysis patients are high risk, so infection control, isolation protocols, and vaccination strategies are essential to protect patients and staff in outpatient units [^64c9cbbf] [^0e3eac3f]. In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, PD is generally feasible unless organomegaly precludes effective fills, and modality choice should still be individualized with shared decision-making [^4fa33668]. For patients with advanced cardiovascular disease, I should individualize ultrafiltration and consider longer or more frequent sessions to mitigate intradialytic hypotension and cardiac stress, balancing symptom relief with recovery potential [^2b939386].

> Let me reconsider the synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Treating someone going to dialysis requires distinguishing AKI-D from ESKD, stabilizing with safe access and urgent indications, individualizing volume and BP management to protect recovery, meticulously adjusting medications and avoiding nephrotoxins, correcting iron deficiency judiciously, monitoring for recovery with a structured taper plan in AKI-D, and for ESKD engaging in early, shared decision-making about modality and conservative options, all within multidisciplinary, patient-centered care that adapts as kidney function and patient goals evolve [^ccf7146f] [^9ee0773d] [^370bd71d] [^869b9fe6].

Treat someone going to dialysis by **individualizing the dialysis prescription** to meet solute, fluid, and symptom goals, and by **managing comorbidities and complications** with a multidisciplinary team [^2b939386] [^e1c260d9]. Key steps include: confirm the indication and urgency; choose modality (HD vs PD) based on hemodynamics, comorbidities, and patient preference; secure appropriate vascular or peritoneal access; set session frequency, duration, and targets (e.g. Kt/V ≥ 1.2, ultrafiltration to dry weight) [^6cf8222a]; monitor for intradialytic complications and adjust as needed; manage anemia, CKD-MBD, and hypertension; provide education and psychosocial support; and coordinate transitions of care with medication reconciliation and follow-up [^3430d234] [^370bd71d].

## Indications and urgency of dialysis initiation

Dialysis initiation is guided by **clinical indications**, including:

- **Acute indications**: Life-threatening hyperkalemia, severe metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema from fluid overload, uremic encephalopathy, or pericarditis [^notfound].

- **Chronic indications**: Symptomatic uremia, refractory volume overload, progressive protein-energy wasting, or inability to manage metabolic abnormalities medically [^2895aa37].

- **Urgency**: Emergent dialysis is indicated for acute life-threatening conditions, whereas elective initiation is appropriate for chronic indications after patient education and shared decision-making [^869b9fe6].

---

## Dialysis modality selection

The choice between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) depends on patient-specific factors, including hemodynamic stability, comorbidities, lifestyle, and preferences [^f94cbcca]:

| **Modality** | **Indications** | **Contraindications** |
|-|-|-|
| Hemodialysis (HD) | - Hemodynamically unstable patients <br/> - Rapid solute/fluid removal needed <br/> - Acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring rapid correction | - Severe cardiovascular instability <br/> - Inability to tolerate rapid fluid shifts |
| Peritoneal dialysis (PD) | - Hemodynamically stable patients <br/> - Preference for home therapy <br/> - Residual renal function preservation | - Recent abdominal surgery <br/> - Peritoneal adhesions <br/> - Severe obesity |

---

## Vascular access planning and management

For HD, **timely access planning** is critical:

- **Temporary access**: Non-tunneled central venous catheter (CVC) for emergent or short-term use [^6cf8222a].

- **Permanent access**: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG) for long-term HD; AVF preferred due to lower infection and complication rates [^f12f22d5].

- **Access care**: Regular monitoring for infection, thrombosis, and malfunction; strict aseptic technique during catheter handling [^f12f22d5].

For PD, **catheter placement** should be planned and performed by experienced surgeons, with attention to infection prevention and catheter function [^6a435bff].

---

## Dialysis prescription and monitoring

The dialysis prescription should be **individualized** based on patient size, residual kidney function, and clinical goals:

- **Frequency and duration**: Typically three sessions per week for HD, each lasting 3–4 hours; PD exchanges vary based on prescription and patient tolerance.

- **Dialyzer and blood flow**: High-flux dialyzers and adequate blood flow rates (300–500 mL/min) are essential for effective clearance.

- **Fluid management**: Ultrafiltration targets should aim for dry weight, avoiding intradialytic hypotension or cramping [^2b939386].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Regular assessment of urea, creatinine, electrolytes, bicarbonate, hemoglobin, calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) [^notfound].

---

## Management of dialysis-related complications

Common complications require **proactive management**:

- **Intradialytic hypotension**: Adjust ultrafiltration goals, dialysate sodium, and consider midodrine or cooling strategies [^notfound].

- **Muscle cramps**: Modify dialysate sodium, adjust ultrafiltration, and consider quinine sulfate (where available).

- **Infection**: Strict infection control, prophylactic antibiotics for CVCs, and prompt treatment of suspected infections [^f12f22d5].

- **Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome**: Gradual initial dialysis sessions, lower blood flow, and use of sodium modeling to prevent cerebral edema [^0f194c5c].

---

## Medication management

Medication regimens require **careful adjustment**:

- **Dose adjustments**: Renally cleared medications must be dosed based on dialysis schedule and residual renal function [^3430d234].

- **Avoid nephrotoxins**: Minimize or avoid NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, and contrast agents when possible [^3430d234].

- **Anemia management**: Iron supplementation and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are used to maintain hemoglobin 10–11 g/dL, balancing risks and benefits [^454b2b10].

- **Phosphate binders and vitamin D**: Manage hyperphosphatemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism with binders and active vitamin D analogs [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and psychosocial support

Education and support are essential for **adherence and outcomes**:

- **Pre-dialysis education**: Explain dialysis options, access care, dietary restrictions, and symptom management [^7551a2e1].

- **Self-management**: Train patients in access care, fluid management, and medication adherence [^8ae93a60].

- **Psychosocial support**: Address anxiety, depression, and quality-of-life concerns through counseling and support groups [^ddd6ecdb].

---

## Coordination of care and follow-up

Effective care coordination involves **multidisciplinary teamwork**:

- **Nephrologist**: Oversees dialysis prescription, complications, and long-term planning [^notfound].

- **Dialysis nurses**: Provide direct care, education, and patient support [^notfound].

- **Dietitian**: Manages nutrition, fluid, and electrolyte restrictions [^notfound].

- **Social worker**: Addresses insurance, transportation, and psychosocial needs [^notfound].

- **Primary care physician**: Manages comorbidities and coordinates overall care [^688d1a8d].

Regular follow-up should monitor **recovery in AKI-D** or progression in CKD, adjust the dialysis prescription, and reassess goals of care [^370bd71d].

---

## Special considerations

Certain populations require **tailored approaches**:

- **Elderly or frail patients**: Conservative management may be appropriate when benefits of dialysis are limited [^bd523c95].

- **Diabetes**: Glycemic control must be individualized, balancing hypoglycemia risk and cardiovascular benefit [^bd4c20c2].

- **COVID-19**: Strict infection control, isolation protocols, and vaccination are essential [^64c9cbbf].

---

Treating a patient starting dialysis requires a **comprehensive, individualized approach** that addresses medical, psychosocial, and logistical needs. By following evidence-based practices and coordinating multidisciplinary care, clinicians can optimize outcomes and quality of life for patients undergoing dialysis.

### When should renal replacement therapy be initiated for acute kidney injury? [^22093c97]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is now well recognized as an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality particularly when dialysis is needed. Although renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been used in AKI for more than five decades, there is no standard methodology to predict which AKI patients will need dialysis and who will recover renal function without requiring dialysis. The lack of consensus on what parameters should guide the decision to start dialysis has led to a wide variation in dialysis utilization. A contributing factor is the lack of studies in the modern era evaluating the relationship of timing of dialysis initiation and outcomes. Although listed as one of the top priorities in research on AKI, timing of dialysis initiation has not been included as a factor in large, randomized controlled trials in this area. In this review we will discuss the criteria that have been used to define early vs. late initiation in previous studies on dialysis initiation. In addition, we propose a patient-centered approach to define early and late initiation that could serve as framework for managing patients and for future studies in this area.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^ccf7146f]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

ASN Kidney Health Guidance—AKI-D recovery prognosis and individualized management notes that outpatient recovery of kidney function ranges from 20% to 60% of patients and that at 6 months after discharge, 31% of patients with AKI-D achieved dialysis independence. Baseline kidney function is identified as the strongest predictive factor, and even among stage 4 CKD (chronic kidney disease), up to 20%–30% of patients will experience recovery. Because of poor predictive accuracy, it is appropriate to err on the side of assuming that most patients will recover, and therefore, all patients should initially receive AKI-D–specific individualized care; for patients with a high likelihood of recovery of kidney function, it is appropriate to maintain this approach for at least 90 days after discharge. Conversely, for patients with low likelihood for recovery, earlier designation of ESRD (end-stage renal disease) diagnosis may be appropriate, and for those with significant comorbidities, nephrologists should facilitate shared goals-of-care discussions, including advanced care planning and palliative care options.

### A patient centered decision making dialysis access algorithm [^af915b03]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2007). Low credibility.

Much controversy surrounds the establishment of proper planning, placement and management (the best practice pattern) of dialysis access. These include the dialysis type and modality selection, timing of access placement and who places the access. The lack of and the difficulty of performing randomized studies with multiple confounding factors, in an extremely heterogeneous and rapidly changing ESRD population demographics, only partly explains the dialysis access conundrum. Add to this the rapidly developing and competing technologies, the wide spectrum of the professional experience, bias and socio-economic forces to make the ESRD problems as multivariate and complex as life itself. This overview describes a dialysis access algorithm approach to the patient needing renal replacement therapy, considering long-term improved patient outcome as the ultimate objective.

### Management of patients with acute kidney injury undergoing dialysis after hospital Discharge [^723ce142]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a common diagnosis in hospitalized patients and can range in severity from a minor, reversible rise in creatinine to a more severe kidney injury with resultant complications. In a small but significant percentage of patients with acute kidney injury, renal replacement therapy is required for supportive care. Patients who require renal replacement therapy and survive to hospital discharge face major challenges in recovering from acute illness while adapting to an outpatient dialysis system that was not designed for patients with acute kidney injury. In addition, treating clinicians must navigate complex transitions of care and remain cognizant of signs of renal recovery. This review describes the current evidence in postdischarge acute kidney injury requiring dialysis management. We discuss risk factors for dialysis dependency, markers of kidney recovery, transitions of care, dialysis customization, and quality of life.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^3a2fa99b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the guidelines—clinical outcomes are optimized when the patient is treated with the delivered dose of dialysis recommended, but because dose as small‑solute clearance is a composite measure, an occasional patient may generate toxins at a rate well above average and therefore require more dialysis than recommended. Clinicians should be alert to subtle symptoms and signs of kidney failure that may indicate a need for more dialysis or a different dialysis modality. After the immediate life‑threatening effects of uremia have been controlled by standard hemodialysis, the patient is often left with symptoms and objective disorders termed a “residual syndrome,” whose combined effect may account for the relatively high yearly mortality rate observed in the dialysis population; in many cases, relief from specific aspects of the syndrome requires additional treatments that may not yet be available to clinicians.

### Care of the patient after renal allograft failure: managing the present and planning for the future [^92d2c376]. American Journal of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

The number of patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing kidney transplantation - both cadaveric and living-donor - continues to rise. With long-term graft survival relatively fixed, this trend means that increasing numbers of patients are returning to dialysis after graft loss. Most will never be retransplanted, which introduces a host of clinical questions regarding optimal management of this unique patient population. In this paper, we explore data that informs astute care of the patient requiring dialysis after graft loss. We address new data about the increased clinical risk and the optimal dialysis modality in renal allograft loss, explore new approaches to immunosuppression and transfusion management, and examine the risks and benefits of allograft nephrectomy and timing thereof. While there are no randomized clinical trials in this field, rapidly evolving data will aid the clinician whose practice includes patients who have been transplanted and are returning to dialysis.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^2895aa37]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 1—Decision to initiate maintenance dialysis: The decision to initiate maintenance dialysis in patients who choose to do so should be based primarily upon an assessment of signs and/or symptoms associated with uremia, evidence of protein-energy wasting, and the ability to safely manage metabolic abnormalities and/or volume overload with medical therapy rather than on a specific level of kidney function in the absence of such signs and symptoms (Not Graded).

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease in... [^57aab254]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

The NKF Work Group defined two principal outcomes of chronic kidney disease: progressive loss of kidney function and development of complications, particularly cardiovascular disease. Progressive loss of kidney function over time in most patients with chronic kidney disease is a well-known outcome. Because of the older age at onset for many forms of kidney disease and the slow rate of decline in kidney function, decreased kidney function is far more common than kidney failure, for which replacement therapy becomes necessary. Cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease is treatable, as well as potentially preventable.

A 1998 report from the NKF Task Force on Cardiovascular Disease 10 recommended that patients with chronic kidney disease be considered in the “highest risk” group for subsequent cardiovascular events, and that most interventions that are effective in the general population should be applied to patients with chronic kidney disease. 11, 12. 2, usually accompanied by signs and symptoms of uremia, or as the need for initiation of kidney replacement therapy for management of the complications of a decreased GFR. In the United States, approximately 98 percent of patients begin dialysis when their GFR falls below 15 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2.
23.

7 Treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease includes the following: therapy based on the specific diagnosis, evaluation, and management of comorbid conditions; measures to slow loss of kidney function; measures to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease; measures to prevent and treat complications of decreased kidney function; preparation for kidney failure and kidney replacement therapy; and replacement of kidney function by dialysis or transplantation if signs and symptoms of uremia are present. Medications should be reviewed at all visits. Dosage adjustments should be based on the level of kidney function. It is important to detect drug interactions, as well as potentially adverse effects of medications on kidney function or complications of chronic kidney disease. If possible, therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed.

Patients with chronic kidney disease should be referred to a nephrologist for consultation and co-management if a clinical action plan cannot be prepared, the appropriate evaluation cannot be performed, or the recommended treatment cannot be implemented. In most cases, patients with a GFR below 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m. 7 classify patients who have diabetes and microalbuminuria with a normal GFR as having stage 1 chronic kidney disease. Nondiabetic kidney disease includes glomerular, vascular, tubulointerstitial, and cystic kidney diseases.

### Starting dialysis is dangerous: how do we balance the risk? [^d6f43acf]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Recent studies of timing of dialysis initiation have challenged the recent trend to earlier initiation of therapy. The observed outcomes though are a consequence of the balance between the risks of advanced uremia versus the inherent dangers relating to dialysis therapy itself. Many of these risks are inherent in how dialysis treatment is currently carried out, and may indeed be amenable to mitigation, through refinement of clinical practice (and potentially modality choice). This article aims to lay out a discussion relating to patient outcomes being the composite result of this balance, pivoting on the vulnerability of a particular patient to these attendant risks.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^7e6e542f]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

KDOQI hemodialysis adequacy—grade for strength of recommendation defines Level 1 (strong recommendation): “We Recommend,” where “Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not,” “Most patients should receive the recommended course of action,” and “The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations.” Level 2 (conditional recommendation/suggestion): “We Suggest,” indicates “The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not,” “Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences,” and “The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined.” An additional category “Not Graded” was used to provide guidance where evidence application is inadequate and “The ungraded recommendations are generally written as simple declarative statements, but are not meant to be interpreted as being stronger recommendations than Level 1 or 2 recommendations.”

CONCLUSION

Managing BP and volume in dialysis requires an individualized approach with integration of numerous clinical, dialysis treatment, and patient factors. Bolstered by shared commitments to improving volume management and focusing on patient-stated priorities, the conference participants identified numerous strategies and technologies that should be considered in the design and implementation of future RCTs in this critical, yet understudied area.

### Medication management in dialysis: barriers and strategies [^41dce1a9]. Seminars in Dialysis (2020). Medium credibility.

People with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) who require chronic dialysis are often reliant on complicated medication regimens to manage their health conditions. Due to the complexities of the advanced kidney disease, underlying comorbidities, and special instructions, medication regimens for patients on dialysis put patients at high risk for medication therapy problems related to safety, effectiveness, appropriateness, and adherence. This article explores the factors that affect optimal medication use for people on dialysis, including the broader drug use system, and offers recommendations around medication reconciliation, medication review, deprescribing, and considering social determinants of health to improve medication management among patients with ESKD.

### Outpatient dialysis for patients with AKI: a policy approach to improving care [^d4f2ed25]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

The rate of AKI requiring dialysis has increased significantly over the past decade in the United States. At the same time, survival from AKI seems to be improving, and thus, more patients with AKI are surviving to discharge while still requiring dialysis. Currently, the options for providing outpatient dialysis in patients with AKI are limited, particularly after a 2012 revised interpretation of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidelines, which prohibited Medicare reimbursement for acute dialysis at ESRD facilities. This article provides a historical perspective on outpatient dialysis management of patients with AKI, reviews the current clinical landscape of care for these patients, and highlights key areas of knowledge deficit. Lastly, policy changes that have the opportunity to significantly improve the care of this at-risk population are suggested.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^8c9a9ba2]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Transition to end-stage renal disease (ESRD)—A significant proportion of patients with AKI-D will not recover to dialysis independence and will require maintenance dialysis, and the decision to change the diagnosis to ESRD is based on the nephrologist’s judgment after a thorough evaluation of the patient’s clinical history and course during outpatient dialysis, including duration of dialysis dependence.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^370bd71d]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Dialysis discontinuation—There are no uniform criteria for dialysis discontinuation when recovery from AKI-D is suspected; hospital trials have used thresholds requiring urine output of >0.4–0.5 L per day or creatinine clearance of ≥12 ml/min from a timed urine collection. Evidence from incremental dialysis in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) suggests that a hemodialysis frequency of 2x/week rather than 3x/week is likely safe in patients with residual urea clearance of ≥2.0 ml/min, and by analogy, many patients with CKD stage 5 with residual eGFR 5–10 ml/min per 1.73 m2 can be safely maintained off dialysis with close follow-up. Dialysis discontinuation requires a joint decision-making model between the nephrologist and the patient; options include reducing the duration of each treatment, reducing frequency of treatments (e.g., from thrice to twice weekly) or holding dialysis completely, and failure to actively taper the dialysis prescription in the setting of improving kidney function is potentially harmful because of unnecessary dialytrauma. It is imperative to ensure an appropriate transition from the outpatient dialysis facility to nephrology clinics, as such a transition has been associated with better outcomes, including reduced mortality.

### Managing the symptom burden associated with maintenance dialysis: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^ddd6ecdb]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Individuals with kidney failure undergoing maintenance dialysis frequently report a high symptom burden that can interfere with functioning and diminish life satisfaction. Until recently, the focus of nephrology care for dialysis patients has been related primarily to numerical targets for laboratory measures, and outcomes such as cardiovascular disease and mortality. Routine symptom assessment is not universal or standardized in dialysis care. Even when symptoms are identified, treatment options are limited and are initiated infrequently, in part because of a paucity of evidence in the dialysis population and the complexities of medication interactions in kidney failure. In May of 2022, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) held a Controversies Conference-Symptom-Based Complications in Dialysis-to identify the optimal means for diagnosing and managing symptom-based complications in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis. Participants included patients, physicians, behavioral therapists, nurses, pharmacists, and clinical researchers. They outlined foundational principles and consensus points related to identifying and addressing symptoms experienced by patients undergoing dialysis and described gaps in the knowledge base and priorities for research. Healthcare delivery and education systems have a responsibility to provide individualized symptom assessment and management. Nephrology teams should take the lead in symptom management, although this does not necessarily mean taking ownership of all aspects of care. Even when options for clinical response are limited, clinicians should focus on acknowledging, prioritizing, and managing symptoms that are most important to individual patients. A recognized factor in the initiation and implementation of improvements in symptom assessment and management is that they will be based on locally existing needs and resources.

### Considerations in the optimal preparation of patients for dialysis [^e05efb38]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

Every year, more than 110,000 Americans are newly diagnosed with end-stage renal disease and in the overwhelming majority, maintenance dialysis therapy is initiated. However, most patients, having received no predialysis nephrology care or dietary counseling, are inadequately prepared for starting treatment; furthermore, the majority of patients do not have a functioning permanent dialysis access. Annualized mortality in the USA in the first 3 months after starting dialysis treatment is approximately 45%; this high rate is possibly in part due to inadequate preparation for renal replacement therapy. Data from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns study suggest that similar challenges exist in many parts of the world. Implementation of strategies that mitigate the risk of adverse consequences when starting dialysis are urgently needed. In this Review we present a step-by-step approach to tackling inadequate patient preparation, which includes identifying individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are most likely to need dialysis in the future, referring patients for education, timely placement of dialysis access and timely initiation of dialysis therapy. Treatment with dialysis might not be appropriate for some patients with progressive CKD; these individuals can be optimally managed with nondialytic, maximum conservative management.

### Outpatient dialysis for acute kidney injury: progress and pitfalls [^6644cc7a]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (AKI) has increased markedly in the United States. At the same time, mortality rates have recently improved. As such, increasing numbers of patients with AKI are surviving to hospital discharge, including up to 30% who will continue to require outpatient dialysis. In recent years, policy changes have significantly affected the care of this high-risk population. Beginning in 2017, new legislation reversed a previous Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services policy that prohibited dialysis for AKI at end-stage renal disease (ESRD) facilities. This has improved dialysis options for patients, but the impact on patient outcomes remains uncertain. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of evidence basis to guide management of this vulnerable patient population. Moving forward, additional data reporting and analyses will be required, analogous to how the US Renal Data System has helped inform ESRD care. As the dialysis setting for patients with AKI shifts to the ESRD setting, it is incumbent on the nephrology community to identify best practices to promote kidney recovery, recognizing that these practices will differ from standard ESRD protocols.

A range of integrated treatment options should be available for estimated 4.9–9.7 million people who develop end-stage kidney disease each year worldwide—haemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), transplantation and conservative care. Reliable, stratified evidence of outcomes associated with each of these modalities is needed, whether local culture dictates that it is the patient, the family or the physician making the choice. This article provides background to and presents the evolution of a programme of work underway in the UK to provide more robust evidence in one of these areas: the comparative effectiveness of dialysis and conservative care in the frail older people with multiple health conditions.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^0048f656]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury requiring dialysis (AKI-D)—current outpatient dialysis facility care challenges include that patients with AKI-D are not easily identifiable within the dialysis unit, there is a lack of specific order sets, and receipt of protocolized long-term dialysis care with Static dry or target weight utilized for ultrafiltration and Anemia and bone and mineral disease protocols; additional issues are variable frequency of evaluation by nephrology team, no guidance for monitoring of kidney function recovery, lack of designated care team and no changes in staffing ratio, and policy challenges include no AKI-D–specific quality metrics; overall, patients with AKI requiring dialysis often experience fragmented care without clear clinical guidance.

### Managing hospitalized peritoneal dialysis patients: ten practical points for non-nephrologists [^b96c67a6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Although nephrologists are responsible for the long-term care of dialysis patients, physicians from all disciplines will potentially be involved in the management of patients with kidney failure, including patients on peritoneal dialysis, the major home-based form of kidney-replacement therapy. This review aims to fill knowledge gaps of non-experts in peritoneal dialysis and to highlight key management aspects of in-hospital care of patients on peritoneal dialysis, with a focus on acute scenarios to facilitate prompt decision-making. The clinical pearls provided should enable non-nephrologists to avoid common pitfalls in the initial assessment of peritoneal dialysis-related complications and guide their decision regarding when to refer their patients to a specialist, resulting in improved multidisciplinary patient care.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes: guidelines from KDIGO-AAFP (...) [^0099d2ad]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice • Structured diabetes self-management education programs are recommended because they improve self-efficacy and clinical outcomes. • First-line antiglycemic treatment for type 2 diabetes and CKD with eGFR as low as 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 should include metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor to improve cardiovascular outcomes and limit CKD progression. • ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment should be maximized in patients who have diabetes with albuminuria and hypertension unless complicated by symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia, or more than a 30% increase in creatinine level. From the AFP Editors. Team-Based Care People with diabetes and CKD have high risks of CKD progression, cardiovascular disease, and mortality, which can be reduced with a comprehensive approach to lifestyle and risk factor management in combination with appropriate pharmacotherapy.

Optimal care includes primary care, cardiology, nephrology, endocrinology, psychology, nutrition, and disease management nursing support. Glycemic Treatment For people with type 2 diabetes and CKD with an eGFR 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 or higher, metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, in combination, are recommended for first-line medical treatment because they improve glycemic control outcomes. Metformin limits weight gain and reduces cardiovascular events, whereas the SGLT2 inhibitor improves cardiovascular outcomes and limits kidney disease progression. The guidelines recommend treatment with a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes who have not achieved glycemic goals despite use of metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor or who are unable to use those medications. Some of the GLP-1 receptor agonists have a beneficial effect in reducing cardiovascular events.

GLP-1 receptor agonist trials are safe with an eGFR as low as 15 mL per minute per 1. 73 m. Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibition Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers are recommended to slow kidney disease progression in people with albuminuria and hypertension. An ACE inhibitor or ARB should be titrated to maximal tolerated dosage with monitoring of blood pressure, serum potassium, and serum creatinine within two to four weeks of dosing changes.

### Recommendations for the prevention, mitigation and containment of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic in haemodialysis centres [^64c9cbbf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus, is a major global human threat that has turned into a pandemic. This novel coronavirus has specifically high morbidity in the elderly and in comorbid populations. Uraemic patients on dialysis combine an intrinsic fragility and a very frequent burden of comorbidities with a specific setting in which many patients are repeatedly treated in the same area (haemodialysis centres). Moreover, if infected, the intensity of dialysis requiring specialized resources and staff is further complicated by requirements for isolation, control and prevention, putting healthcare systems under exceptional additional strain. Therefore, all measures to slow if not to eradicate the pandemic and to control unmanageably high incidence rates must be taken very seriously. The aim of the present review of the European Dialysis (EUDIAL) Working Group of ERA-EDTA is to provide recommendations for the prevention, mitigation and containment in haemodialysis centres of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The management of patients on dialysis affected by COVID-19 must be carried out according to strict protocols to minimize the risk for other patients and personnel taking care of these patients. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation and distribution have been shown to be efficient in similar settings. They are essential in the management of the pandemic and should be taken in the early stages of the disease.

Framework for approach to management of dialysis-requiring AKI in the outpatient setting by likelihood of kidney recovery—High (>30%) recovery phenotype: Example scenarios include all patients with baseline eGFR >60, younger patients (<55 yr) with baseline CKD but minimal comorbidity burden (e.g., no liver or heart failure), and patients with short duration of dialysis dependence <30 d; the approach includes care focused on promoting kidney function recovery and close monitoring for recovery for at least 90 d after discharge. Moderate (10%–30%) recovery phenotype: Example scenarios include patients with baseline CKD and limited comorbidity burden and patients with baseline CKD and intermediate duration of dialysis dependence (30–90 d); the approach includes care focused on promoting kidney function recovery and close monitoring for recovery for at least 30–60 d after discharge. Low (<10%) recovery phenotype: Example scenarios include patients with 3 or more of the following—advanced baseline CKD (eGFR <15 or eGFR <30 with A3 albuminuria), older age (>75 yr), significant comorbidities (decompensated liver or heart failure), or prolonged duration of dialysis dependence (>90 d); the approach includes initial care focused on promoting kidney function recovery with consideration for early (<30 d) transition to ESRD diagnosis with appropriate shift in management.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^3430d234]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Medication management—Patients with AKI-D have a significant medication burden; medication review and management (beyond simple medication reconciliation) at every transition of care is critical to avoid medication-related errors and to identify nephrotoxins. Nephrotoxins should be avoided whenever possible in the maintenance and recovery phases of acute kidney injury (AKI); potential nephrotoxins include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, certain antimicrobial agents, proton pump inhibitors, iodinated contrast, and herbal supplements. In patients with AKI-D, timed urine collections for creatinine and urea clearances can inform drug dosing, and in anuric patients, an eGFR <10 ml/min should be generally used for drug dosing, with possible supplemental dosing after dialysis for medications cleared by dialysis. Clinicians should also be aware of cardio- and kidney-protective medications and restart or initiate them in a timely manner as AKI survivors are at high risk of adverse cardiovascular events.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^3485809e]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline—dialysis versus conservative management in very elderly, frail, or medically complex chronic kidney disease (CKD): The Work Group suggests that patients in this population, whose first priority is duration of life, be referred to nephrology for evaluation for dialysis. Dialysis preparation typically includes modality selection, access planning, placement and maturation, and hepatitis B vaccination; initial nephrology referral at the time of dialysis initiation is associated with poorer clinical outcomes, and in the experience of the Work Group, up to a year may be required to adequately address these issues. These studies demonstrate that dialysis initiation may lengthen life while increasing hospitalizations and intensive procedures. In a retrospective cohort of 14,701 VA patients with an eGFR below 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 identified between 2000 and 2009 who died during that period, electing not to pursue dialysis was associated with significantly lower rates of hospital admission, intensive procedures (CPR, mechanical ventilation, total parenteral nutrition), and death occurring in the hospital, alongside increased palliative care/hospice use, fewer hospital days, and longer duration of hospice and palliative care services. In a target trial emulation among U.S. Veterans aged 65 or older, compared to starting dialysis when eGFR <12 mL/min/1.73m2, medical management without starting dialysis was associated with shorter life expectancy but approximately 2 weeks more at home. The prior evidence review concluded that the evidence has important limitations, because observational studies may be affected by lead time bias, confounding by indication, variability between comparator groups, as well as cultural and socioeconomic factors that influence treatment choices. Based on this evidence, a conservative or symptom-driven approach to advanced kidney disease management may better match the goals of care for patients who prioritize the avoidance of aggressive medical treatment when compared with dialysis. Potential survival benefits of dialysis must be balanced against risks for more intensive medical care, death in hospital, and loss of functional capability and independence, all of which may impact patient QoL. Particularly in frail and elderly patients, the decision to pursue dialytic therapy should not be assumed to be a foregone conclusion; instead, goals of care must be individualized to the preferences, values, and capabilities of the patient and their caregivers.

### Self-management interventions for adult haemodialysis patients: a scoping review of randomized controlled trials [^97033f45]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately eight million people, 0.1% of the world’s population, are estimated to have kidney failure. Kidney failure, formerly named end-stage kidney disease, means that kidney function has declined so severely that renal replacement therapy is necessary to sustain life. Based on a global median prevalence of 397 per million people, approximately 3.18 million individuals worldwide are estimated to be undergoing chronic dialysis, the most commonly used form of renal replacement therapy. Haemodialysis, the most frequent form of dialysis, is a medical procedure that filters waste, toxins, excess fluids, and electrolytes from the blood by diverting it via a vascular access through a machine with a specialized filter, thereby partially replicating kidney function.

When starting dialysis, patients encounter new challenges, requiring to restructure their daily routines and acquire new skills. During conservative chronic kidney disease treatment without renal replacement therapy, patients must manage a comprehensive therapeutic regimen including diet and fluid restrictions. After transitioning to dialysis, they must manage additional aspects such as vascular access care and strict dialysis schedule adherence to prevent complications. Patients describe haemodialysis as a demanding treatment regimen, typically requiring three or more sessions per week or more, each lasting four to five hours. While essential for survival, this intensive schedule affects patients’ daily lives including financial status, social roles and perceived quality of life and is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. Patients can experience side effects and symptoms such as fatigue (67-78%), bone and joint pain (70.9%), anxiety (28%) and/or sadness or depressive symptoms (30-49%).

### Managing chronic heart failure patient in chronic kidney disease [^bfd6ea3e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Management of systolic heart failure can be particularly challenging in patients with chronic kidney disease, especially those who are not yet receiving dialysis. Few clinical trials have been performed in this particular population, so management is directed by evidence from studies of patients with limited or no renal impairment. Their heightened risk for many treatment complications mandates additional considerations regarding drug selection, dosing, and monitoring. Subspecialty consultation is driven by patient instability or disease progression, intolerance of standard treatment, or need for device placement.

### PAlliative care in chronic kidney diSease: the PACKS study – quality of life, decision making, costs and impact on carers in people managed without dialysis [^5014ffc3]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

ESKD includes those patients who have reached stage 5 chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 as measured using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation (MDRD) formula). ESKD is a life-limiting condition associated with substantially increased risks of morbidity and mortality. The glomerular filtration may continue to fall in patients with ESKD until a point is reached where dialysis would normally be initiated to maintain life. In a number of renal units in the UK, patients with ESKD are offered an alternative treatment to dialysis or transplantation known as conservative kidney management where a palliative care approach is adopted and supportive care provided by the multidisciplinary team often in liaison with the community team and general practitioner (GP). Deciding when to withhold dialysis in this population and provide conservative kidney management as an alternative requires thorough ethical deliberation and complex decision-making. Some patients may not benefit form dialysis but there is limited evidence to guide patients, carers and staff when making this important decision. There are few service models designed to support this group and little known about how they can be best managed. Ideally, clinicians should be able to accurately distinguish between a patient who will do well on dialysis and a patient who will do poorly; however, any attempt to define such a population has been largely unsuccessful. Some studies have explored age, functional status, and comorbidity burden as predictors of survival but the development of a criterion score to select people for dialysis has not been developed and individualized assessment is always necessary. Informing that assessment with good quality research centred on patient and carer experiences is still required. When these complex decisions are made, the way in which conclusions are made are difficult to extract, teach and embed in practice. A recent thematic synthesis of qualitative studies described patients with ESKD and their caregiver perspectives on conservative management and end-of-life care and found only five studies [,–] offering a limited insight into quality of life (QOL) and decision making in those managed without dialysis with no exploration of changes over time. A systematic review of conservative management identified literature in this field as widely distributed and difficult to uncover with database search strategies. Findings were limited and preliminary in nature comparing small groups of patients. Results were not stratified by age or comorbidities and the authors suggest that in patients who opt for non-dialytic management of their kidney disease, guidelines are still required to determine the best clinical practice in this area. There appears to be no studies that explore economic aspects of conservative management in ESKD.

### Diagnosis and management of non-dialysis chronic kidney disease in ambulatory care: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^776f53a8]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Clinical Practice Guidelines are increasingly issued by various stakeholders to promote quality of care. The KDIGO guideline on diagnosis and management of CKD has been adapted in many countries and served as model for most guidelines included in this review. There was substantial variation in the quality of the guideline development process.

Although there is good agreement on most core recommendations, the scope of recommendations issued by the guidelines varied significantly. Many recommendations for management of CKD relyprimarily on consensus. The care for CKD in multimorbid patients might require more individualization based on patient preferences and circumstances than can be reflected by guideline recommendations based primarily on measurement of kidney function. Since subtle differences can have a significant impact on health resource utilization and increase burden of disease in affected patients, careful implementation and evaluation of benefits and harms in every health care system is warranted.

### Perceptions about the dialysis modality decision process among peritoneal dialysis and in-center hemodialysis patients [^d54ce2bd]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Over 120,000 patients reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD) every year in the United States (US) are faced with a complex and difficult decision regarding renal replacement therapy (RRT) modality options. Although kidney transplant results in the best clinical outcomes, 97% of ESRD patients will require dialysis, most frequently peritoneal dialysis (PD) or in-center hemodialysis (HD). Although clinical contraindications restrict modality choice in occasional cases, most patients are candidates for both PD and HD. Either dialysis modality may be a better fit for a specific patient based on dialysis treatment characteristics and their impact on daily life. Thus, the choice between modalities should center on patient preferences, and it is critical that patients are included and engaged in the dialysis modality decision. This is supported by increasing evidence that aligning treatment with patient preferences may improve adherence to therapy, quality of life, and ultimately better medical outcomes.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^e7c1089e]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Adult AKI-D recovery timeline and care planning—on the basis of USRDS data, the majority (>90%) of patients who recover to dialysis independence will do so within the first 3 months after discharge. With longer duration of dialysis dependence, the IDT should continually update patients on changes in prognostic expectations and offer ongoing support, and education should include discussions of various KRT modalities, vascular access, and transplantation when appropriate. In patients with a low recovery phenotype, assigning a diagnosis of ESRD before 3 months may be appropriate, with potential benefits including early vascular access placement (thereby reducing risk of catheter-associated bloodstream infections), establishing Medicare eligibility, and initiating transplant evaluation and listing.

### Anemia management in dialysis patients: a PIVOT and a new path? [^cb1f6756]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We will examine the current and future options in management of anemia in dialysis patients focusing on recent trials in iron supplementation and alternatives to erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs).

Recent Findings

We review the literature on Erythropoietin (EPO)-stimulating agents, focusing on the risk benefits of various options available. We review the recent practice changing trial in iron supplementation in dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease and movements in the research on alternatives to EPO-stimulating agents primarily hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs).

Summary

ESAs constitute the mainstay of treatment of anemia in dialysis and evidence does not support the preference of any one type over the other. But concerns exist about the cardiovascular safety of supra-physiological ESA levels. Iron supplementation has been shown to be a well tolerated method to decrease ESA doses while maintaining hemoglobin levels and recent evidence should result in a revisiting of the guidelines for iron supplementation. HIF-PHIs are potentially safe alternatives to ESAs that correct and maintain hemoglobin while maintaining physiological levels of erythropoietin. Ongoing phase III trials for these drugs will likely answer questions of long-term safety regarding these drugs.

### Medication reconciliation and therapy management in dialysis-dependent patients: need for a systematic approach [^ab2a89fb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis have highly complex medication regimens and disproportionately higher total cost of care compared with the general Medicare population. As shown by several studies, dialysis-dependent patients are at especially high risk for medication-related problems. Providing medication reconciliation and therapy management services is critically important to avoid costs associated with medication-related problems, such as adverse drug events and hospitalizations in the ESRD population. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 included an unfunded mandate stipulating that medication therapy management be offered to high-risk patients enrolled in Medicare Part D. Medication management services are distinct from the dispensing of medications and involve a complete medication review for all disease states. The dialysis facility is a logical coordination center for medication management services, like medication therapy management, and it is likely the first health care facility that a patient will present to after a care transition. A dedicated and adequately trained clinician, such as a pharmacist, is needed to provide consistent, high-quality medication management services. Medication reconciliation and medication management services that could consistently and systematically identify and resolve medication-related problems would be likely to improve ESRD patient outcomes and reduce total cost of care. Herein, this work provides a review of available evidence and recommendations for optimal delivery of medication management services to ESRD patients in a dialysis facility-centered model.

### Choice of dialysis modality [^f94cbcca]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Few medical decisions have as profound an impact on every aspect of a patient's life as the selection of dialysis modality by a patient with end-stage renal disease. It remains uncertain whether the outcome differences seen between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, if any, in observational studies are attributable to the dialysis modality. Such studies, thus, are insufficient to deny patients a choice in selecting their dialysis modality.

### Chronic dialysis therapies [^714bf73a]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

While both in-center and home dialysis modalities have improved life expectancy for people with end-stage kidney disease and have served as a bridge to eventual kidney transplantation, kidney health care providers must be keenly aware of the potential complications associated with these therapies. The following questions aim to shed light on some of the more important potential physiological consequences and medical dilemmas associated with the three primary dialysis modalities including in-center hemodialysis, home hemodialysis, and peritoneal dialysis. Moreover, we hope to highlight that caring for those requiring dialytic therapy necessitates a significant breadth of understanding in other core internal medicine disciplines beyond nephrology itself, including cardiovascular, infectious, and musculoskeletal disease entities.

### Long-term outcomes among patients with advanced kidney disease who forgo maintenance dialysis: a systematic review [^bd523c95]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Conservative kidney management is a planned, holistic, and person-centered approach to care for patients with stages 4 to 5 advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) who do not wish to pursue maintenance dialysis.It includes “interventions to delay progression of kidney disease and minimize risk of adverse events or complications; shared decision making; active symptom management; detailed communication including advance care planning; psychological support; social and family support; [and] cultural and spiritual domains of care.” (p7) Desire for a more conservative approach to treating patients with advanced CKD has galvanized efforts around the world to develop the evidence base to support the care of these patients.

Toward this end, several systematic reviews and meta-analyses,,,, have been conducted comparing outcomes between patients treated with dialysis and those treated conservatively. They show that dialysis is associated with longer survival compared with conservative approaches,,, but that these survival advantages are attenuated with increasing age and comorbidity.Patients treated conservatively also spend less time in the hospital and die there less often compared with patients receiving dialysis,and early changes in quality of life appear similar between treatment groups.

Although the findings of these prior studies help to inform shared decision-making about treatment of advanced CKD, they are restricted to studies comparing groups treated with dialysis and those treated conservatively. As a result, prior systematic reviews and meta-analyses reflect only a small fraction of the patients who forgo dialysis described in the literature and provide only a limited view of the clinical course of patients to guide ongoing management and anticipatory guidance to patients who have already decided that they will not pursue dialysis. To support a deeper understanding of the long-term outcomes of patients with advanced CKD who do not pursue dialysis, we performed a systematic review of longitudinal studies reporting survival, use of health care resources, quality of life, and end-of-life care of patients with advanced CKD who did not pursue dialysis.

### Blood pressure and volume management in dialysis: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^2b939386]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) and volume control are critical components of dialysis care and have substantial impacts on patient symptoms, quality of life, and cardiovascular complications. Yet, developing consensus best practices for BP and volume control have been challenging, given the absence of objective measures of extracellular volume status and the lack of high-quality evidence for many therapeutic interventions. In February of 2019, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) held a Controversies Conference titled Blood Pressure and Volume Management in Dialysis to assess the current state of knowledge related to BP and volume management and identify opportunities to improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes among individuals receiving maintenance dialysis. Four major topics were addressed: BP measurement, BP targets, and pharmacologic management of suboptimal BP; dialysis prescriptions as they relate to BP and volume; extracellular volume assessment and management with a focus on technology-based solutions; and volume-related patient symptoms and experiences. The overarching theme resulting from presentations and discussions was that managing BP and volume in dialysis involves weighing multiple clinical factors and risk considerations as well as patient lifestyle and preferences, all within a narrow therapeutic window for avoiding acute or chronic volume-related complications. Striking this challenging balance requires individualizing the dialysis prescription by incorporating comorbid health conditions, treatment hemodynamic patterns, clinical judgment, and patient preferences into decision-making, all within local resource constraints.

### Timing of dialysis initiation in acute kidney injury and acute-on-chronic renal failure [^2d0438dd]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

The decision to provide dialytic support and choosing the ideal moment to initiate therapy are common impasses for physicians treating patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Although renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been extensively used in clinical practice for more than 30 years, there is a paucity of evidence to guide clinicians on the optimal utilization of RRT in AKI. In the absence of traditional or urgent indications, there is no consensus on whether dialysis should be offered and when it should be started. The lack of agreed-upon parameters to guide the decision, the fear of the risk of the procedure, and the possible contribution to worse prognosis with RRT have resulted in a considerable variation in practice among physicians and centers. In this review, we summarize the evidence evaluating time of initiation of RRT and discuss possible approaches for future trials in addressing this issue.

End-stage renal disease is a major public health problem. In the United States, more than 350,000 patients are being treated with either hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Given the high burden of comorbidities in these patients, it is imperative that emergency physicians be aware of the complexities of caring for acute illnesses in this population. This article reviews the common medical problems that bring patients with end-stage renal disease to the emergency department, and their evaluation and management.

### The prepare for kidney care study: prepare for renal dialysis versus responsive management in advanced chronic kidney disease [^c9e7d033]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence on comparative effectiveness of dialysis and conservative care

Two systematic reviews have looked at quality of life and symptoms in relation to dialysis and conservative care. In individual studies, physical quality of life has been shown to be significantly lower in patients choosing conservative care rather than dialysis, though mental quality of life is similar ; a nice reminder that we are not comparing like with like in the observational studies. Once on their chosen treatments, trends in quality of life are broadly similar, though dialysis initiation tends to be associated with a reduction in ‘satisfaction with life’ and an increase in ‘effect of kidney disease’ and ‘burden of kidney disease’.

Prognosis is still an important consideration. While there is clear evidence that, on average, those aged >75 years treated with KRT can expect to live longer than those managed conservatively, this survival advantage diminishes when patients have higher comorbidity and poor functional status. A systematic review of older people (mean age across the studies ranged from 60.5 to 92.0 years) treated with dialysis or conservative care found 89 studies conducted between 1976 and 2014 including 294 921 older people with kidney failure. Regardless of whether patients were managed conservatively or with dialysis, initial 1-year survival was similar at 73% [95% confidence interval (CI) 66–80%] in the dialysis group and 71% (95% CI 63–78%) in the conservatively managed group. At 2 years, however, the data suggest a survival advantage in the group managed with dialysis: 62% (95% CI 55–69%) for the dialysis group and 44% (95% CI 36–53%) for those managed conservatively. While dialysis initiation may be associated with additional early risk, we should not over-interpret these observational data as it is likely that the group of patients with a better prognosis will have been chosen (or been medically advised to choose) to have dialysis. Even novel statistics can only adjust for measured confounders; random allocation of treatment groups is required if groups are to be balanced for measured and unmeasured confounders. There was also residual heterogeneity in the survival data, both between the studies and within the treatment groups. This likely reflects the long period covered by the review, the changes in treatment rates over time, differences in primary care referral patterns and differences in the components of care provided by centres. Finally, it should also be noted that only 724 (0.2%) of the 294 921 people studies received conservative care and that only six studies directly compared survival on the two treatments.

### Management of diabetes mellitus in dialysis patients: obstacles and challenges [^bd4c20c2]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major health issue that is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The treatment of DKD is challenging given changes in blood glucose homeostasis, unclear accuracy of glucose metrics, and altered kinetics of the blood glucose-lowering medications. There is uncertainty surrounding the optimal glycemic target in this population although recent epidemiologic data suggest that HbA1c ranges of 6-8%, as well as 7-9%, are associated with increased survival rates among diabetic dialysis patients. Furthermore, the treatment of diabetes in patients maintained on dialysis is challenging, and many blood glucose-lowering medications are renally metabolized and excreted hence requiring dose adjustment or avoidance in dialysis patients.

Method

ology: PubMed, Google Scholar, and Medline were searched for all literature discussing the management of diabetes in dialysis patients.

Results

The literature was discussed under many subheadings providing the latest evidence in the treatment of diabetes in dialysis patients.

Conclusion

The management of diabetes in dialysis is very complex requiring a multi-disciplinary team involving endocrinologists and nephrologists to achieve targets and reduce morbidity and mortality.

### The emergency department care for hemodialysis patient during the COVID-19 pandemic [^91ea9074]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic poses significant challenges to patients with end-stage kidney disease who receive treatment in outpatient dialysis centers. These patients represent a fragile population that is at higher risk for both infection and transmission. At the start of the pandemic, many suspected COVID-19 dialysis patients were diverted to the emergency department (ED) for testing/treatment, placing a tremendous burden on the ED and inpatient dialysis units. Several recommendations and guidelines have been established to optimize patient care while also decreasing the burden on the ED and inpatient dialysis units and maximizing the ability to perform outpatient hemodialysis. As the pandemic continues, dialysis facilities will have an increasing burden to provide safe and accessible dialysis, while also being able to direct patients to the ED for either emergent dialysis or COVID-19 treatment/testing. We reviewed opinions, recommendations and guidelines developed by professional organizations and dialysis facilities for the management of "patients under investigation" (PUIs) and COVID-19 positive patients that depend on whether the suspicion occurs while the patient is at home vs. at the dialysis center.

Outpatient AKI-D key practice points—anemia: Consider the use of IV iron to correct iron deficiency, but avoid maintenance IV iron protocols, and consider limiting the use of ESA to patients with >30 d of dialysis dependence or earlier in those with baseline underlying CKD stage 3 or higher, in the absence of reversible causes or contraindications to ESAs, with a goal of avoiding blood transfusions.

### Optimal dialysate sodium-what is the evidence? [^937b7333]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Oligo-anuric patients with end-stage kidney disease are dependent on hemodialysis to achieve and maintain the desired goal of euvolemia. The dialysis prescription, in addition to sodium and fluid restriction, is therefore a critically important factor in the care of hemodialysis patients. Various dialysate sodium concentrations have been favored throughout the history of dialysis, but the "optimal" concentration remains unclear. In this manuscript, we examine the historical context of changes to the dialysate sodium prescription, review the evidence of its associated effects, discuss 'individualization' of dialysate sodium, and highlight the need for definitive trials that are powered for important clinical outcomes.

### When to start dialysis in patients with acute kidney injury? When semantics and logic become entangled with expectations and beliefs [^0c60a78f]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Earlier initiation of dialysis may have a beneficial impact on survival of critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). A retrospective analysis in the previous issue of Critical Care showed that early initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT), as defined by RIFLE criteria, was not associated with a reduction in hospital mortality. The retrospective character of many studies describing the results of early RRT initiation and the validity of RIFLE criteria to determine the need for dialysis can be questioned, in particular when urinary output is not considered. Initiating dialysis in AKI should be based on clinical criteria and not on serum creatinine or another serum/urine-based biomarker.

### When should iron supplementation in dialysis patients be avoided, minimized or withdrawn? [^826b7adf]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

Parenteral iron is used to restore the body's iron pool before and during erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy; together these agents form the backbone of anemia management in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing hemodialysis. ESRD patients receiving chronic intravenous iron products, which exceed their blood loss are exposed to an increased risk of positive iron balance. Measurement of the liver iron concentration (LIC) reflects total body iron stores in patients with secondary hemosiderosis and genetic hemochromatosis. Recent studies of LIC in hemodialysis patients, measured by quantitative MRI and magnetic susceptometry, have demonstrated a high risk of iron overload in dialysis patients treated with IV iron products at doses advocated by current anemia management guidelines for dialysis patients. Liver iron overload causes increased production of hepcidin and elevated plasma levels, which can activate macrophages of atherosclerotic plaques. This mechanism may explain the results of 3 long-term epidemiological studies which showed the association of excessive IV iron doses with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among hemodialysis patients. A more physiological approach of iron therapy in ESRD is needed. Peritoneal dialysis patients, hemodialysis patients infected with hepatitis C virus, and hemodialysis patients with ferritin above 1000 μg/L without a concomitant inflammatory state, all require specific and cautious iron management. Two recent studies have shown that most hemodialysis patients will benefit from lower maintenance IV iron dosages; their results are applicable to American hemodialysis patients. Novel pharmacometric and economic approaches to iron therapy and anemia management are emerging which are designed to lessen the potential side effects of excessive IV iron while maintaining hemoglobin stability without an increase in ESA dosing.

### Epidemiology, diagnosis and management of hypertension among patients on chronic dialysis [^2a6a55e5]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2016). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and management of hypertension among patients on chronic dialysis is challenging. Routine peridialytic blood pressure recordings are unable to accurately diagnose hypertension and stratify cardiovascular risk. By contrast, blood pressure recordings taken outside the dialysis setting exhibit clear prognostic associations with survival and might facilitate the diagnosis and long-term management of hypertension. Once accurately diagnosed, management of hypertension in individuals on chronic dialysis should initially involve non-pharmacological strategies to control volume overload. Accordingly, first-line strategies should focus on achieving dry weight, individualizing dialysate sodium concentrations and ensuring dialysis sessions are at least 4 h in duration. If blood pressure remains unresponsive to volume management strategies, pharmacological treatment is required. The choice of appropriate antihypertensive regimen should be individualized taking into account the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties of the antihypertensive medications as well as any comorbid conditions and the overall risk profile of the patient. In contrast to their effects in the general hypertensive population, emerging evidence suggests that β-blockers might offer the greatest cardioprotection in hypertensive patients on dialysis. In this Review, we discuss estimates of the epidemiology of hypertension in the dialysis population as well as the challenges in diagnosing and managing hypertension among these patients.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^5564b0de]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

There is increasing evidence of the benefits of augmented haemodialysis schedules, in terms of both outcome and health-related quality of life, but providing more frequent dialysis in-centre is a challenge in the UK, and it is widely recognised that augmented schedules are most easily accommodated in the home setting [,,–]. The literature on home haemodialysis and augmented schedules therefore overlaps substantially, but home

haemodialysis additionally is increasingly acknowledged to provide a level of convenience and flexibility not achievable in-centre.

Despite these benefits the penetration of home haemodialysis in the UK remains low, comprising only 0.4% of incident and 2% of prevalent dialysis patients. Many organisations such as NICE and KDIGO promote universal availability for clinically suitable patients, acknowledging that collaborative working between centres maybe required. But it is clear from registry data that variability of access still exists, with some centres not offering this modality, and considerable variation in uptake between centres.

Home haemodialysis patients must be able to manage their dialysis safely, and monitor their condition. Modality decisions should be supported by a full assessment of clinical and social circumstances, as well as the home environment, including a discussion of the impact of therapy on others within the household. It is essential that patient and carer expectations and fears are appropriately addressed before commencing training. Few data are available to guidance on clinical suitability, but the ability to complete training may be more important than clinical diagnosis: a number of programmes have reported that patients with complex comorbidities can improve with more frequent therapy, more tailored to their needs.

Training on a ‘1 to 1’ basis with a specific training staff is widely accepted as optimal, with the learning style and training duration adapted to the individual. Type of vascular access should not be a limiting factor, but appropriate training, surveillance and technique assessment form essential parts of the home haemodialysis programme.

### When should iron supplementation in dialysis patients be avoided, minimized or withdrawn? [^390de1ed]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSIONS

Two years ago, Steven Fishbane, in an elegant and premonitory review on the balance of risks and benefit of iron therapy for anemia management, warned of the difficulty of justifying ferritin values above 500 μg/L in most dialysis patients. 2

It appears today that in addition to specific populations which require cautious iron management (peritoneal dialysis, HCV‐infected, and ferritin above 1000 μg/L without concomitant inflammation patients), most hemodialysis patients in the Western world may benefit from lower maintenance IV iron dosage (after adequate replenishment of iron stores as advocated by the labels) as recently shown by the Nancy proof of concept study 71 and the DOPPS researchers in an international epidemiological analysis. 73

Most importantly, these 2 latter studies can be applied to USA hemodialysis patients. Thus, new pharmacometric and economic approaches to iron therapy and anemia management are clearly emerging with the aim of lessening the potential side effects of excessive IV iron with the ability to maintain hemoglobin stability without the concerns and costs of higher ESA doses.

### Outcomes of newly diagnosed myeloma patients requiring dialysis: renal recovery, importance of rapid response and survival benefit [^394fc871]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

About 50% of newly diagnosed mutilple myeloma (MM) patients (NDMM) have some degree of renal impairment (RI) at presentation, up to 20% have severe acute kidney injury (AKI) and ~1–5% may require extrarenal dialysis, whereas severe RI is associated with high risk of early death and other complications. Immediate effective anti-myeloma therapy and vigorous supportive care are the cornerstones of management. However, there are limited data focusing specifically on the management and outcomes of MM patients requiring dialysis as a consequence of MM, mostly including small numbers of patients on dialysis.,, Moreover, the use of high cut-off hemodialysis to rapidly reduce the load of nephrotoxic light chains may provide some additional benefit in patients requiring dialysis when treated with bortezomib-based therapies, but the reported results of two randomized studies are controversial. Thus, we analyzed the outcomes of 52 consecutive NDMM with RI requiring dialysis, which were managed and treated in a single center, to provide data on response to therapy, dialysis discontinuation and survival in unselected patients, outside the context of clinical trials.

The analysis included 52 patients (6.2% of 796 consecutive NDMM) who were treated in the Department of Clinical Therapeutics, and which presented with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, between January 1995 and January 2016. An approval for data collection and publication was obtained by the Alexandra Hospital Scientific Committee. The analysis included all patients who received at least one dose of any therapy. All patients received similar supportive care and dialysis with regular filters. Patients with light-chain amyloidosis, light-chain deposition disease or previously under dialysis due to causes other than myeloma were excluded from the analysis. Renal response was defined as independence from dialysis and discontinuation of this procedure. Myeloma response and progression followed International Myeloma Working Group definitions.Time to renal recovery (renal response) was calculated from the date of initiation of therapy until the date of the last dialysis session. Survival was calculated from the date of first dose of therapy until the date of last follow-up or death.

### Nephrologists' experiences with patient participation when long-term dialysis is required [^8ae93a60]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Participation through self-management

The nephrologists recognised that hospital haemodialysis required rigid adaptation, which could provide patients with a passive role. Engaging patients in their care was considered important, as a way of making patients responsible for their own health. This could implicate training them in hands-on activities such as self-cannulating. Eventually, they suggested that patients could administer their own dialysis, considering this the highest level of patient participation.

As a haemodialysis patient, you can of course participate in your own treatment. You can learn to cannulate the fistula, to set up the machine and to a certain extent run the dialysis. (Participant D).

Other nephrologists referred to patient self-management as a way of decreasing health costs, because training patients in preparing the dialysis machine had the potential to save staff resources. Nephrologists and nurses typically discussed and assessed patient ability to perform self-care activities. They did not involve patients in this process, albeit the nurses encouraged participation from patients whom they had evaluated as able to participate, for instance, in self-cannulating. One of the nephrologists expressed: It’s not appropriate for everyone to be trained and involved. But I think they should get the chance (Participant H). From this perspective, patient participation was limited to people willing to exercise hands-on tasks.

Self-management included for the patient to adhere to food and fluid restrictions and administer medication as prescribed. Hence, the nephrologists emphasised thorough patient information. They argued that well-informed patients would be equipped with the rationale to act responsibly, associating responsible patients with better adherence and, hence, better treatment outcomes.

They must be allowed to make informed choices. They must know why we do things and why they get this treatment, the point of coming here so frequently, the point of the medications. (Participant F).

This illustrates how nephrologists provided patients with a personal responsibility for making choices about lifestyle and healthcare to support clinical treatment and accomplish treatment goals.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^00a3b3d3]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Table 2 
Potential advantages and disadvantages of choosing dialysis versus conservative management

For some patients, the goals of starting dialysis may be to obtain relief of renal failure related symptoms and other quality of life issues [Table 2],. Dialysis may facilitate treatment of intractable volume overload, improve physical symptoms such as a shortness of breath and decreased appetite, and can facilitate management of elevated potassium [Table 2]. The social interactions with staff and other patients during dialysis may significantly improve a patient’s quality of life. On the other hand, these purported benefits of dialysis may be less important than the patient’s desire to avoid the pain and discomfort associated with dialysis therapy. Older adults often require repeated painful vascular access procedures and some may die before the access is used [,–]. Central venous catheter dialysis access has been suggested as a way to mitigate some of the vascular access related discomfort, especially for patients with high comorbidity and a short predicted survival. Home peritoneal dialysis is another option for some patients whose primary goal is freedom from pain. Other than pain, potential adverse quality of life issues related to the dialysis choice include accelerated functional and cognitive declines as well as post dialysis fatigue and the feeling of being “washed out” after a dialysis treatment. Another relevant consideration is the time commitment required for dialysis. Some patients may be willing to sacrifice several months of longevity to gain more personal freedom, especially when considering that a large segment of their remaining life will be spent on dialysis and with dialysis related complications.

### Meeting the challenges of the new K / DOQI guidelines [^8a578216]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Substantial gains in the dialytic treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease have been made during the past several decades. However, inadequate attention has been given to the problem of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a whole. CKD and its associated complications emerge years before patients develop kidney failure and become dialysis dependent. It now is evident that to improve dialysis outcomes, it is essential for practitioners to recognize the earlier stages of CKD, not only to retard disease progression, but also to prevent and treat its complications and comorbidities long before the need for dialysis arises. The recently published National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines identify the broad-based problem of CKD in the general population and introduce action plans that can be used at the different stages of CKD. This article discusses the process behind the development of the CKD guidelines and highlights the disease evaluation, classification, and stratification system provided by the guidelines. It is hoped that widespread implementation of these recommendations will increase the understanding of CKD among both providers and patients and eliminate many of the obstacles that nephrologists have faced in providing optimal care to dialysis patients in particular and to patients with CKD in general.

### Dialysis and acute kidney injury: current evidence [^19a36110]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Optimization of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for severe acute kidney injury (AKI) has been intensively studied over the last decade. Several large recently published randomized trials have clarified uncertainties regarding dialysis modality selection as well as dialysis dosage. This information will help inform decision makers regarding resource allocation and establishment of treatment targets. The decision to initiate dialysis remains a clinical one, based on individual patient needs. Despite technological advances in renal replacement therapy, AKI continues to be associated with poor outcomes.

### Early fluid management affects short-term mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing chronic hemodialysis and requiring continuous renal replacement therapy [^ed663e17]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ESKD patients admitted to the ICU may have low effective arterial blood volume and hemodynamic instability due to various combinations of sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, and other underlying diseases. Restoration of intravascular volume and circulation may require the administration of large volumes of intravenous fluids. Moreover, fluid overload (e.g. pulmonary edema, respiration failure, and/or third-spacing) may be present on ICU admission in ESKD patients on dialysis who are vulnerable to poor fluid balance. Thus, clinicians have chosen CRRT as a dialysis option to reduce fluid overload and secure hemodynamic stability. However, it remains unclear how to manage volume status by controlling CRRT input and output in these patients. Although a number of literatures have been dealing with this issue, most studies have focused on AKI patients. To our knowledge, the present study is the first attempt to investigate fluid balance in ESKD patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis and requiring CRRT.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^db896229]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

AKI-D anemia management—nephrologists should address reversible causes including iron deficiency; there is no definitive evidence that IV iron impairs recovery of kidney function in AKI-D, therefore IV iron should be administered to correct iron deficiency when present, with caution to avoid protocols targeting supraphysiologic iron stores. It is reasonable to use erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in patients with severe anemia, particularly those with >30 days of dialysis dependence and/or with low recovery phenotype and no contraindications, but we suggest not targeting a hemoglobin >11 g/dl; the primary goal of ESA titration should be prevention of transfusion because allosensitization may hinder candidacy for kidney transplantation.

### Hemodialysis treatment time: a fresh perspective [^fe38ea56]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Historical, clinical, economic, and technological developments have driven a shift in clinical practice from predominantly 6-hour-long hemodialysis treatments to much shorter treatment times that are prevalent today. Patients, physicians, and providers had considered shortening dialysis treatments as a means to decrease the overall burden imposed by this necessary life-saving therapy. However, shorter dialysis is not a panacea and may engender trade-offs in terms of patient morbidity and mortality. We examine the literature with the benefit of hindsight and in light of recent studies that have improved understanding of the complex relationship between dialysis dose and outcome. We touch upon the role of dialysis frequency relative to treatment time. We conclude with the suggestion that a new treatment paradigm should consider a minimum adequate dialysis treatment time of 4 hours for the majority of patients, with anything shorter becoming the exception rather than the rule.

### Nephrologists' experiences with patient participation when long-term dialysis is required [^fc40cf94]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although paying attention to treatment schedules and biomedical quantifications, some nephrologists considered the clinical goals to be parts of a whole and emphasised that patient experiences should influence treatment adjustments. To tailor the treatment, they avoided being overly guided by biomedical targets and focused attention to listening to patients’ individual experiences of health and wellbeing between the dialysis sessions. One of them put it like this:

Dialysis isn’t a pre-set treatment impossible to adjust to individual needs… many are unaware of that… but dialysis is about so much more than just prescribing a time-scaled treatment with this or that dialysate solution and this or that filter [dialyzer membrane]. (Participant I).

Individual adjustments to treatment could decrease tensions, though the nephrologists had to balance adjustments with what they considered sufficient treatment. This illustrates the span nephrologists faced when they on the one hand aimed to provide evidence-based healthcare, while they on the other hand were expected to recognise patients’ preferences and values. When reflecting on their own practices, not all nephrologists considered patient experiences or issues without the potential for clinical adjustment to be their concern. For instance, some nephrologists saw hospital haemodialysis as a ‘take it or leave it’ treatment offer and preferred standardisation to individually customised treatment. Others experienced patient needs as never-ending and told of having to put up boundaries as to the issues with which they as nephrologists should engage and which issues they could leave to other professions.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^869b9fe6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Guideline 1.1—kidney replacement therapy (KRT) initiation and modality choice emphasizes shared decision-making and preservation of options: Guideline 1.1 specifically includes those who have initiated KRT for kidney failure, and whenever possible, the timing of presentation should not limit the treatment options for kidney failure. Although logistically, hemodialysis (HD) is easiest to implement, peritoneal dialysis (PD) and conservative care are important options, and dialysis should not be initiated without ensuring that a shared decision-making process among patients, their families and care-givers, and their physicians. The Work Group noted that the purpose of dialysis is not solely prolongation of life but rather promotion of living, and it is essential that dialysis initiation or the decision to forgo KRT be an individualized process that incorporates eliciting patient goals and life preferences, prognosis, and expected benefits and burdens associated with kidney failure and its treatment, followed by guidance and decision support regarding the therapies that can offer the patient the greatest likelihood of achieving their goals within their preference structure.

Dialysis modality selection for AKI-D in the outpatient setting is uncertain and evolving: The optimal modality of outpatient dialysis for individuals with AKI is uncertain, and in the United States the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ESRD Prospective Payment System final rule for 2025 included a provision to extend coverage for Medicare patients with AKI to include home dialysis beginning January 2025; in the hospital setting, acute peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been associated with similar clinical outcomes when compared with hemodialysis, PD may be associated with less intradialytic hypotension and therefore better recovery although not evaluated in clinical trials, home dialysis may be associated with increased patient and caregiver stress, the new rule also extends dialysis coverage to skilled nursing facilities and assisted PD may offer a middle ground, and at present there is not enough evidence to provide clinical practice points for PD in AKI-D with remaining guidance focusing on hemodialysis.

### Care of the dialysis patient: primary provider involvement and resource utilization patterns-a cohort study [^688d1a8d]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) require some of the most complex care in medicine, usually seeing multiple providers. Medicare’s ESRD Seamless Care Organization (ESCO) program, was created to address concerns about the ability of accountable care organizations (ACOs) to support the comprehensive care needed to optimally manage ESRD patients. Similar concerns previously prevented hemodialysis (HD) patients on Medicare from joining managed care plans In an ESCO, nephrology teams are held responsible for providing high-quality, value-based, comprehensive care in a bundled, shared savings model. The majority of dialysis care in the United States is provided in proprietary units administered and owned by large dialysis organizations with little integration into multispecialty clinics. Since the quality metrics on which the bundled payment is based include both population health measures such as vaccination rates and chronic disease management for common comorbidities, such as congestive heart failure, diabetes and depression, appropriate coordination between primary care providers (PCPs), nephrologists, and other specialists across the health system is essential for the success of such programs. In fact one of the three Medicare ESRD demonstration projects preceding the ESCOs did involve primary care practices in its quality efforts and an interventional study of patient centered medical home for chronic kidney disease embedded a primary care internist in the dialysis unit to address some of the patients’ medical needs. An increasingly complex geriatric ESRD population may also require care that the nephrologists feel should be managed by primary care.

Little is known about the role of PCPs in the care of dialysis patients. Studies suggest that most dialysis patients view their nephrologist as their PCP. A few small studies in the late 1990’s indicated that nephrologists functioned as de facto PCPs for most dialysis patients and found evidence of a primary care relationship for only 20–35% of dialysis patients. A survey of 233 nephrologists found that 90% reported providing primary care to their dialysis patients, and that over a third of their time was devoted to the general medical care of those patients If provided within the dialysis unit this care is not billable which may lead to lack of proper attention and documentation. Even less is known regarding clinician’s beliefs about the optimal division of tasks in the care of patients on dialysis. In a Canadian study, both nephrologists and PCPs believed that PCPs should play a bigger role in the provision of primary care to dialysis patients but had concerns whether family physicians had adequate knowledge/training to care for this group of patients.

Providing RRT

Although the timing of RRT initiation is controversial, the provision of RRT itself has become fairly well established. Patients with AKI requiring RRT have an evolving clinical status and should be supported by the appropriate and available modality. Modality choice should also be tailored to patient clinical status. As suggested in the 2012 KDIGO guideline, in hemodynamically unstable patients, continuous RRT, rather than intermittent hemodialysis, is more physiologically appropriate, but RCTs have not demonstrated better outcomes with continuous RRT.Both continuous and intermittent RRT can lead to changes in intracranial pressure, but the risk is higher with intermittent RRT. Selection of modalities should be considered in the context of available resources and expertise of personnel.

An uncuffed non-tunnelled dialysis catheter of appropriate length and gauge should be used to initiate RRT in AKI patients. In patients with expected prolonged indication for RRT, a cuffed catheter can be considered.The first choice for site is the right jugular vein or femoral vein, although the femoral site is inferior in patients with increased body mass. The next choices would be left jugular vein followed by subclavian vein. Anticoagulation type should be selected based on local resources and expertise of personnel. The recommendation from 2012 to use regional citrate anticoagulation for continuous RRT in patients who do not have a contraindication remains supported by existing data. – Delivery of RRT must reach the goals of electrolyte, acid–base, solute, and fluid balance for each specific patient.When using intermittent or extended RRT, a Kt/V of at least 1.2 per treatment 3 times a week should be delivered.For peritoneal dialysis, future studies should focus on dosing in AKI, although currently we suggest a dose of 0.3 Kt/V per session. An effluent volume of 20–25 ml/kg per h should be delivered when continuous RRT is used. This will sometimes require a higher prescription of effluent volume. The rate of fluid removal for a given patient with fluid overload is controversial,, and more research is needed. Methods to better assess fluid management goals during RRT would also be valuable. Finally, RRT should be discontinued when kidney function has recovered or when RRT becomes inconsistent with shared care goals. Modality transition from continuous RRT to intermittent hemodialysis in intensive care unit patients should be considered when vasopressor support has been stopped, intracranial hypertension has resolved, and positive fluid balance can be controlled by intermittent hemodialysis.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^9353d209]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 1 rationale—Referral, modality options, and patient choice: Recent KDIGO and prior KDOQI guidelines recommend referral of all individuals with GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 to a nephrologist. Multiple dialysis modalities are available for kidney replacement therapy (KRT), none of which is conclusively demonstrated to be superior, and conservative nondialysis care may be appropriate for many older or more infirm individuals. A thematic synthesis reported the experience of 375 patients and 87 caregivers and identified 4 major themes central to treatment choices; in one study of 584 patients with CKD stages 4 and 5, 61% of those who had started HD regretted the decision and 52% said it was their clinician’s choice.

Statements: multidisciplinary team approach—recommendations and team composition: KDOQI considers it reasonable to educate on, coordinate, and manage all aspects of dialysis access care by use of a multidisciplinary care team (Expert Opinion), but there is inadequate evidence for KDOQI to make a recommendation on using such a team to reduce the rate of CVC use or increase AVF use. For dialysis access, this team should include nephrologist, access surgeon, radiologist, nurse, social worker, and a patient family member or other supporter, and placement of any dialysis access—particularly an AV access—requires education of the patient and family with coordinated consultations and follow-up visits.

### Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis: towards improving evidence, practices, and outcomes [^c3871947]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Peritonitis is a common serious complication of peritoneal dialysis that results in considerable morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. It also significantly limits the use of this important dialysis modality. Despite its importance as a patient safety issue, peritonitis practices and outcomes vary markedly and unacceptably among different centers, regions, and countries. This article reviews peritonitis risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, particularly focusing on potential drivers of variable practices and outcomes, controversial or unresolved areas, and promising avenues warranting further research. Potential strategies for augmenting the existing limited evidence base and reducing the gap between evidence-based best practice and actual practice also are discussed.

### A conservative dialysis strategy and kidney function recovery in dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury: the liberation from acute dialysis (LIBERATE-D) randomized clinical trial [^5c1885b1]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

For patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury, persistent need for dialysis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, high health care use, and poor quality of life.

Objective

To test the effect of a conservative dialysis strategy on recovery of kidney function.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter, unblinded, randomized superiority trial enrolled participants with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury who had a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, had already initiated kidney replacement therapy, and were hemodynamically stable, with planned intermittent hemodialysis between January 23, 2020, and March 10, 2025, at 4 clinical sites in the United States. Of 909 patients assessed for eligibility, 221 were randomized and 220 received the allocated intervention. The date of last follow-up was June 10, 2025.

Intervention

With the conservative dialysis strategy, participants received dialysis only when specific metabolic or clinical indications were met. Participants in the conventional dialysis group received dialysis 3 times per week until urine output or creatinine clearance criteria were met.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary study end point was unadjusted kidney function recovery at hospital discharge, defined as being alive and not receiving dialysis, with at least 14 consecutive days without dialysis (including after discharge). Two prespecified key secondary end points were the number of dialysis sessions per week and the number of dialysis-free days to day 28.

Results

The mean age of participants was 56 years (SD, 16 years). A total of 148 of 220 participants (67%) were male, 28 (13%) were Black, and 133 (60%) were White. Mean baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate was 64.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 (SD, 30.9 mL/min/1.73 m2). Participants had started kidney replacement therapy a median of 9 days (IQR, 5-18.5 days) before randomization. In the conservative dialysis intervention group, 70 of 109 participants (64%) achieved kidney function recovery at hospital discharge vs 55 of 109 participants (50%) in the conventional dialysis control group (difference, 13.8% [95% CI, 0.8%-26.8%; P=.04]; unadjusted odds ratio, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.02-3.03; P=.04]; after prespecified adjustment: odds ratio, 1.56 [95% CI, 0.86-2.84; P=.15]). Participants in the conservative dialysis group received fewer dialysis sessions per week (median, 1.8 [IQR, 0-2.6] vs 3.1 [IQR, 2.6-3.5]; difference, -1.4 [95% CI, -1.8 to -1.0]) and recovered earlier (21 [IQR, 0-28] vs 5 [IQR, 0-21] consecutive dialysis-free days to day 28; difference, 16 days [95% CI, 5-27]). Dialysis-associated hypotension occurred less frequently in the conservative dialysis group (69 vs 97 events).

Conclusions and Relevance

A conservative dialysis strategy in dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury resulted in a shorter time to and higher rates of recovery of kidney function in the unadjusted analysis. Given uncertainty regarding the estimated effect size, this approach should be tested in a larger study population.

### Mortality and mode of dialysis: meta-analysis and systematic review [^01027d8a]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Key learning points

What is already known about this subject

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a significant public health issue with high mortality rates. Dialysis is the most common form of treatment for ESRD patients, and the choice of dialytic modality can have an impact on patient outcomes.

What this study adds

Since previous studies have been inconclusive regarding patient outcomes, this study provided an updated meta-analysis on mortality outcomes with dialytic modalities. Also, unlike most previous meta-analyses, we included randomized trials and observational studies comparing mortality outcomes with dialytic modalities irrespective of the type of kidney disease.

What impact this may have on practice or policy

This study indicates that the current evidence is insufficient to compare the safety of dialytic modalities. Well-powered multi-centered trials are required to inform clinical practice better.

### A randomized controlled trial to evaluate and assess the effect of comprehensive pre-end stage kidney disease education on home dialysis use in veterans, rationale and design [^77733510]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) and resultant kidney failure, conventionally referred to as ‘end stage kidney disease (ESKD)’ are huge public health burdens with high morbidity and mortality, poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and disproportionately high healthcare expenditure. Over 97% of incident kidney failure patients are managed by dialysis therapy. Despite equivalent survivals and trends for better patient-reported and health services outcomes, use of various forms of home dialysis therapies remains low (~ 10%) among the US kidney failure population, and ~ 90% of incident and prevalent kidney failure requiring dialysis therapy are managed by in-center hemodialysis. It is estimated that doubling the current home dialysis rates would save over a billion Medicare dollars each year though, it is uncertain whether these cost savings merely represent the bias in patient selection existent for home dialysis. Major stakeholders in kidney disease including providers, professional renal societies, patient advocacy groups, and payors such as Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Veterans Health Administration’s (VHA) National Kidney Program recommend increasing home dialysis utilization for the management of kidney failure requiring dialysis.

Professional organizations recommend informed decision-making for all advanced CKD patients for their dialysis modality selection. This requires individual patients/caregivers to comprehend the complex medical, social, and financial aspects of their dialysis options and select the modality best suited to their life. Unfortunately, awareness of CKD and its management options is low among advanced CKD patients, which serves as a major limitation to greater home dialysis use. Several cohort and a few randomized studies, largely from outside the US have shown that comprehensive pre- kidney failure disease education (CPE) improves CKD awareness and increases informed home dialysis selection and use, with the reported home dialysis rates ranging from 35 to 85% among the CPE recipients. Studies have further shown that provision of CPE improves patient awareness and is associated with beneficial impacts on several pre-, and post-kidney failure outcomes. In recent times, we and others have shown that provision of a formal protocol-based CPE, incorporated within the clinical care or as a stand-alone service leads to greater home dialysis selection (50–74%) and use (30–62%) even among the US advanced CKD patients.

### Predictive models for kidney recovery and death in patients continuing dialysis as outpatients after starting in hospital [^2e4d36d4]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dialysis is initiated in hospital for management of AKI or advanced CKD, and there can be significant overlap (“AKI on CKD”).AKI treated with dialysis (AKI-D) occurs in approximately 2% of all hospitalized patients.Approximately 50% of patients with AKI-D survive their index hospitalization, of who up to 30% remain dialysis dependent after discharge. These patients continue their dialysis treatments as outpatients, with approximately half recovering enough kidney function to discontinue dialysis within 90 days.After 90 days, only approximately 5% additional patients recover sufficient kidney function to stop dialysis. Of all patients with AKI-D who survive to discharge, approximately 35% die within 6 months,most commonly from cardiovascular disease.Patients may also start dialysis in hospital due to progressive CKD, but the extent to which superimposed AKI precipitated dialysis initiation can be difficult to determine, and the likelihood of kidney function recovery is highly variable. Prognostication is further complicated by worse outcomes when dialysis for kidney failure due primarily to CKD progression is initiated in hospital.

No predictive models currently exist to estimate a patient's likelihood of kidney recovery to dialysis independence or death when discharged to continue dialysis after hospitalization. An improved understanding of these risks could improve outpatient dialysis management for this patient population. To help address this knowledge gap, we derived and externally validated risk indexes to predict the likelihood of recovery to dialysis independence and of death within 1 year after discharge for patients continuing outpatient dialysis after in-hospital dialysis initiation.

Such risk indexes could be applicable to patients who start dialysis in hospital at any level of prehospitalization kidney function (i.e. due to AKI, “AKI on CKD”, or progression of CKD) and then continue to receive dialysis after discharge. Furthermore, they could be well suited to implementation using routine data available at the time of patients' first outpatient dialysis after hospital discharge.

### Will peritoneal dialysis be left behind? [^cba9d7fc]. Seminars in Dialysis (2005). Low credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) enjoyed huge growth in the 1980s, followed by a rapid decline in the late 1990s, and a now persistently low utilization rate in many countries, including the United States. Recent clinical data indicate a survival advantage for patients started on PD. Residual renal function is better preserved with PD. Adequacy targets are being revised and will likely allow PD prescriptions to be simplified. The physiology of the peritoneum is better understood and treatment strategies reflect that understanding. New solutions have been developed in response to studies that have assessed the impact of conventional PD dialysate on the structure and function of the peritoneum. A remaining challenge is to ensure that nephrology trainees and nephrologists in practice are fully informed of the advantages of PD for many patients and of the advances in the therapy. If this can be achieved, PD should start to grow again.

### COVID-19 and maintenance hemodialysis: a systematic scoping review of practice guidelines [^0e3eac3f]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has substantially impacted the provision of medical services. During the pandemic, many medical services, including facilities providing care to patients with end stage renal disease faced challenges in safeguarding patients and staff while providing clinical care. This study aims to identify the extent, range, and nature of articles related to COVID-19 and maintenance hemodialysis to understand the research gaps and propose recommendations for future research.

Methods

Using the terms: “Dialysis” OR “RRT” OR “Renal replacement therapy” AND “SARS-COV-2” OR “COVID-19” OR “novel coronavirus” OR “2019-nCov”, we performed a multi-step systematic search of the literature in the English language in Pubmed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science published from December 1, 2019, to May 13, 2020. Two authors separately screened the title and abstracts of the documents and ruled out irrelevant articles. We obtained a full report of the papers that met our inclusion criteria and screened the full texts. We conducted a descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the included articles and performed a narrative synthesis of the results. We conducted this scoping review in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR Checklist.

Results

We included 22 articles in this scoping review. Perspectives (n = 9), editorials (n = 4), and case series (n = 5) were the most common types of articles. Most articles were from Italy and the United States. Seventeen (77.3%) of the articles focused on the topic of recommendation for outpatient hemodialysis units. While many of the recommendations overlapped in several articles, there were also many unique recommendations.

Conclusions

most of the articles are based on single-center experience, which spontaneously developed best practices. Many of these practices have formed the basis for policies and guidelines that will guide future prevention of infection and management of patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and COVID-19.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on peritoneal dialysis in adults and children [^b8f4f042]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) (guidelines PD 2.1–2.4)

Guideline 2.1 – PD: Preparation for peritoneal dialysis

We recommend that all patients (and parents of paediatric patients) should, where possible, be adequately prepared for renal replacement therapy and this should include receiving information and education about PD treatment, delivered by an experienced member of the MDT. Patients commencing RRT in an unplanned fashion for whatever reason should receive this information once appropriate (1C). Fast track education and urgent PD catheter insertion with acute start of PD should be available, and be offered to suitable patients urgently starting on RRT who wish to avoid temporary haemodialysis, with the associated negative aspects of temporary vascular access and disruption to their lives (1C).
Audit Measure 8: Audit of care pathway for dialysis preparation to include information given (including proportion of patients offered PD), when and who delivers it.
Audit Measure 9: Audit of information on modality options provided to patients presenting who urgently require RRT, and both initial and subsequent modality of RRT selected by these patients.

Rationale

The arguments and rationale for this guideline relate to the National Service Framework for Renal Services, Part 1. The reader is referred to standard 2, Preparation and Choice pp. 21–23. The vast majority of patients commencing dialysis are medically suitable to receive PD if they select it. Some commonly perceived medical “contraindications” to PD are overstated. The majority of patients with a previous history of major abdominal surgery may successfully be treated with PD. It is also unusual to be unable to achieve target small solute clearances in the majority of larger patients (with the availability of APD, even when anuric).

When patients present needing prompt, unplanned start to renal replacement therapy, rapid insertion of a PD catheter with acute start of PD, along with fast track education regarding dialysis modalities, may allow a proportion to commence directly on PD, avoiding temporary vascular access and urgent haemodialysis. Such patients who initially receive acute start of haemodialysis should receive follow up education regarding RRT options.

Guideline 2.2 – PD: Preparation for peritoneal dialysis

We recommend that, where possible, timing of PD catheter insertion should be planned to accommodate patient convenience, commencement of training between 10 days and 6 weeks and before RRT is essential to enable correction of early catheter-related problems without the need for temporary haemodialysis (1C).
Audit Measure 10: Audit of care pathway for catheter insertion to include timeliness and need for temporary haemodialysis

### Prescribing the dialysis dose and treatment frequency in home haemodialysis [^09039dd5]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The ultimate goal for patients on dialysis is prolongation of life with the best achievable quality of life. Here we want to underline that the goal of dialysis adequacy is only a part of the adequacy of care of the patient on dialysis. Dialysis-dependent patients require the solution of several clinical and metabolic problems, which are independent of or only partially dependent on the dialysis adequacy per se. Many of these problems develop long time before the start of dialysis.

The quest for a reliable dialysis adequacy index/criteria has been a constant through the decades of dialysis. Recent publications reflect the shift in nephrologists’ understanding of dialysis adequacy and reinforce the idea that a new approach needs to be considered, moving away from a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to dialysis to more personalized care that incorporates patient goals and preferences while maintaining best practices for quality and safety. Nearly 60 years after the first clinical use of HD there is still no consensus on how to prescribe some important aspects of HD such as treatment duration and frequency of dialysis sessions. This is in part due to conventional HD practice being largely limited to a rigid 3 HD/week schedule. Recently, there has been a growing interest in more frequent dialysis schedules and personalized routines, especially in the setting of HHD. Technological advances have led to a wider use of HHD performed with low-flow dialysate devices, thus increasing its acceptance amongst patients due to miniaturization and simplification of devices and water treatment apparatus, but nevertheless raising the question of how these systems can be deployed to achieve an adequate dialysis dose adapted to the specific characteristics of the limited flow dialysate treatments. The ability to prescribe flexible but adequate dialysis schedules during the week allows personalization of the treatment and offers a huge incentive for greater uptake of HHD by patients.

ADPKD kidney failure—dialysis modality selection emphasizes shared decision-making: Choice of dialysis modality should be determined based on shared decision-making between physician and patient. We suggest that in people with ADPKD, selection of dialysis modality (hemodialysis [HD] or peritoneal dialysis [PD]) for treatment of kidney failure should be determined by patient-related factors, patient choice, and availability of facilities (2C). Peritoneal dialysis should be considered as a viable kidney replacement therapy (KRT) for people with ADPKD complicated by kidney failure, with caution indicated only when massive kidney and/or liver enlargement or other standard PD contraindications are present. The prescription of HD and supportive therapies, such as anticoagulation, should be the same as that for people without ADPKD.
