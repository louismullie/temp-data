## Question

Fluconazol in mechanic ventilation pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fluconazole should be used for mechanically ventilated patients with pneumonia, specifically regarding the approach to prophylaxis, empiric therapy, or treatment when Candida is isolated from the respiratory tract. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and definitions, especially VAP versus colonization. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about prophylaxis and empiric therapy in nonneutropenic, nontransplant ICU patients. Next, I will examine the evidence base, including RCTs and meta-analyses, and check for any subgroup signals. After that, I need to consider the pathophysiology of Candida in the respiratory tract and whether Candida pneumonia is a realistic diagnosis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with dosing, duration, and stewardship considerations, and I should double-check for any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't conflate entities. Mechanically ventilated pneumonia in this setting typically refers to ventilator-associated pneumonia, defined as pneumonia occurring more than 48 hours after initiation of mechanical ventilation, with substantial attributable mortality, whereas isolation of Candida from respiratory secretions usually reflects colonization rather than true invasive Candida pneumonia, which is rare and requires histopathologic evidence of invasion for confirmation [^113AZwMR] [^111XZfkL] [^1159BdSF].

> Next, I should review guideline positions before jumping to drug choice. The 2024 American Thoracic Society guideline issues a conditional recommendation against routine prophylactic or empiric antifungal therapy targeting Candida in critically ill adults without neutropenia or transplant, citing low-quality evidence and no mortality benefit, while IDSA 2016 allows consideration of fluconazole prophylaxis only in high-risk ICUs with high rates of invasive candidiasis and emphasizes that Candida from the respiratory tract is usually colonization and rarely warrants treatment [^114cgcfj] [^117MbUXV] [^113tFWe2] [^111XZfkL] [^1159BdSF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the strength of evidence. The ATS meta-analysis of eight RCTs in nonneutropenic, nontransplant ICU patients shows no mortality benefit for prophylaxis or empiric therapy, with a pooled RR of death of 1.03 and similar effects for fluconazole and echinocandins, and a Cochrane review likewise found reduced invasive fungal infections but no mortality reduction with untargeted antifungals, reinforcing the lack of outcome benefit in broad ICU populations [^114dHS7A] [^116toGMo] [^116ZV8WQ] [^116VMjsw].

> Wait, let me verify whether any subgroup or single-center signal contradicts this. A 2002 single-center RCT in mechanically ventilated patients receiving selective digestive decontamination showed that adding fluconazole 100 mg daily reduced Candida infections and candidemia without affecting mortality, but this was a highly selected population and regimen, and the ATS panel did not generalize this to routine practice; similarly, older meta-analyses suggested mortality benefit, but their heterogeneity and outdated ICU practices limit applicability today [^116Sj3mE] [^114zKN6g] [^114cgcfj].

> I need to check the pathophysiology to ensure I'm not missing a treatable entity. Candida pneumonia is exceedingly uncommon in immunocompetent hosts and requires tissue invasion for diagnosis. Most recoveries of Candida from endotracheal aspirates or BAL represent colonization, and treating colonization does not improve outcomes, so routine antifungal therapy based on respiratory isolation alone is discouraged [^111XZfkL] [^1159BdSF] [^1113XMfk].

> Let me consider empiric therapy more carefully. IDSA supports empiric antifungals for selected ICU patients with risk factors for invasive candidiasis and no other source of fever, with a strong preference for echinocandins if unstable or if azole resistance is a concern, and a large multicenter RCT of empiric fluconazole 800 mg daily in high-risk ICU patients failed to improve a composite outcome versus placebo, underscoring the limited role of empiric therapy outside narrowly selected contexts [^114jH1vC] [^111KVVqW] [^114MG9jP].

> I should double-check dosing and safety if fluconazole is used in exceptional prophylaxis scenarios. When prophylaxis is considered in high-incidence ICUs, IDSA suggests fluconazole 800 mg loading dose then 400 mg daily, with attention to drug interactions and hepatotoxicity, and ATS notes that echinocandins and fluconazole are generally better tolerated than mold-active azoles or amphotericin, though adverse effects were inconsistently reported across trials [^113tFWe2] [^114ZqJY5].

> But wait, what if the team is concerned about Candida in the airways worsening bacterial VAP risk. Observational and translational data suggest Candida tracheobronchial colonization may associate with Pseudomonas VAP, yet a pilot RCT of empiric antifungals in VAP with Candida in secretions showed no clinical benefit signal, so this remains hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing [^113rTsRt].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For most mechanically ventilated, nonneutropenic, nontransplant ICU patients with suspected VAP, do not start fluconazole for prophylaxis or empiric therapy; treat bacterial VAP per IDSA/ATS guidance and avoid treating Candida isolated from respiratory secretions unless there is strong evidence of invasive disease. Reserve empiric antifungals for selected high-risk patients with persistent fever, risk factors for IC, and no identified bacterial source, preferably with an echinocandin if unstable or if azole resistance is suspected, and de-escalate or stop if cultures and biomarkers are negative and the patient improves [^114cgcfj] [^114jH1vC] [^111XZfkL].

> I should confirm the bottom line. Fluconazole is not indicated for routine prophylaxis or empiric therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with pneumonia, and isolation of Candida from the respiratory tract should not trigger antifungal therapy in the absence of proven invasive candidiasis; management should focus on bacterial VAP treatment and careful, risk-stratified use of antifungals only when the pretest probability of invasive candidiasis is high and alternative sources have been excluded [^114cgcfj] [^111XZfkL] [^114jH1vC].

---

Fluconazole is **not recommended** for routine prophylaxis or empiric therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with pneumonia because it does not reduce mortality [^114dHS7A] and may promote resistance [^115qN5p3]. Candida in the respiratory tract usually reflects **colonization** [^111XZfkL], not infection, and treating it does not improve outcomes [^113rTsRt]. Use fluconazole only when there is **proven or strongly suspected invasive candidiasis** [^114jH1vC], based on cultures or validated biomarkers, and prefer echinocandins if the patient is septic or if azole resistance is a concern [^114jH1vC]. Routine fluconazole use in VAP is unsupported and should be avoided [^114cgcfj].

## Clinical evidence regarding fluconazole use in mechanically ventilated pneumonia

### Prophylactic use

- **ATS 2024 guidelines**: Recommend against routine prophylactic or empiric antifungal therapy targeting Candida in critically ill, non-neutropenic, non-transplant patients [^114cgcfj] [^117MbUXV].
- **Meta-analyses**: Prophylactic fluconazole reduces fungal infections but does not improve survival [^116VMjsw] [^115jdHzk].
- **Resistance risk**: Prophylaxis can select for non-albicans species and resistance, including C. glabrata and C. auris [^114ZqJY5] [^115qN5p3].

---

### Empiric use

Empiric fluconazole is **not supported** for suspected invasive candidiasis in mechanically ventilated patients without microbiologic evidence; a randomized trial showed no outcome benefit versus placebo [^111KVVqW]. Additionally, **colonization vs infection** applies: Candida in respiratory samples usually reflects colonization, not infection, and antifungal therapy does not improve outcomes [^111XZfkL] [^113rTsRt].

---

## Risks and benefits of fluconazole use in mechanically ventilated patients

### Benefits

Benefits are limited to **reduced colonization**, as fluconazole may decrease Candida colonization, but this does not translate into improved survival or clinical outcomes [^116VMjsw] [^114dHS7A].

---

### Risks

- **Resistance**: Promotes non-albicans species and resistance, including C. glabrata and C. auris [^111MdpvY] [^115qN5p3].
- **Adverse effects**: Hepatotoxicity, drug interactions, and CNS effects can occur [^114ZqJY5].
- **Cost**: Unnecessary use increases healthcare costs without benefit [^111uS6eg] [^114dHS7A].

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ATS 2024 | - Against routine prophylactic or empiric antifungal therapy in non-neutropenic, non-transplant ICU patients [^114cgcfj] [^117MbUXV] |
| IDSA 2016 | - Candida in respiratory secretions usually reflects colonization <br/> - Rarely requires treatment [^111XZfkL] [^1159BdSF] |
| ESCMID/ESICM 2019 | - Avoid preemptive antifungal therapy in critically ill patients [^114NRtcF] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where fluconazole may be appropriate

- **Proven invasive candidiasis**: Documented by cultures or validated biomarkers (e.g. β-D-glucan) [^notfound].
- **High-risk patients**: Severe immunosuppression, prolonged central venous catheter use, total parenteral nutrition, or broad-spectrum antibiotics [^notfound].
- **Echinocandin alternative**: Use fluconazole if the patient is hemodynamically stable, with no recent azole exposure, and no azole-resistant colonization [^111D3kwR].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Fluconazole is **not recommended** for routine prophylaxis or empiric therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with pneumonia because it does not improve survival and may promote resistance [^114cgcfj] [^114q4zpk]. Use fluconazole only for **proven or strongly suspected invasive candidiasis**, and prefer echinocandins in septic patients or when azole resistance is a concern [^114jH1vC].

### Candidemia in the critically ill: initial therapy and outcome in mechanically ventilated patients [^111biEg3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Candidemia is a major cause of nosocomial bloodstream infection in the United States, particularly among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Increasing attributable mortality from candidemia has prompted research into the role of early diagnosis and treatment in improving outcomes.

Rapid initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy has resulted in better survival among patients with septic shock and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Similarly, improved outcomes have been reported with early treatment of suspected fungal infections, though often patients are started on therapy before speciation. Thus, the epidemiology of candidemia may impact the choice of initial therapy. Non- albicans species comprise approximately half of Candida bloodstream infections, with increasing isolation of species less susceptible to fluconazole.

The introduction of the echinocandins has expanded the options available for the treatment of Candida infections in the critically ill. Whether these newer medications are preferable to fluconazole as initial antifungal therapy in the ICU remains unresolved. While recent guidelines recommend the use of echinocandins for moderately severe to severely ill patients with candidemia, previous comparisons of azoles and echinocandins have included only limited populations of critically ill patients. Perhaps more importantly, controlled trials have not evaluated initial therapy; enrollment criteria permitted up to 48 hours of antifungal therapy before initiation of study drug. Recent critiques of the guideline development process suggest the need for studies that address actual clinical circumstance.

A large controlled trial of initial antifungal therapy for critically ill patients with candidemia promises to be extremely challenging logistically. The need for therapy is often unrecognized until Candida is identified in culture. Once fungemia is recognized, evidence suggests therapy should be started as quickly as possible, leaving little time for trial related activities such as consent and randomization. Absent the more definitive data from such a trial, a cohort study of critically ill patients treated with either fluconazole or an echinocandin as initial therapy should inform current practice and point the way forward for further investigations. We therefore analyzed the epidemiology and outcomes of patients included in a large, multicenter mycosis registry who required mechanical ventilatory support, had candidemia, and received initial monotherapy of fluconazole or an echinocandin.

### Failure of empirical systemic antifungal therapy in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients [^115Pb5HR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Rationale

Systemic antifungal treatments are empirically administered to the sickest critically ill patients, often without documented invasive fungal infection.

Objectives

To estimate the impact of systemic antifungal treatment on 30-day survival of patients suspected to have invasive candidiasis.

Methods

All nonneutropenic, nontransplant recipients managed in five intensive care units intubated for at least 5 days, and free of invasive candidiasis, were included. To account for differences in patients' characteristics recorded daily before study end point, a causal model for longitudinal data was used to assess benefits from antifungal treatment. The composite primary end point was hospital mortality or occurrence of invasive candidiasis.

Measurements and Main Results

Among 1,491 patients, 100 (6.7%) received antifungal treatment for a suspected infection. Patients treated with antifungals were more severely ill than untreated patients. Within the 30-day follow-up period, 363 (24.3%) patients died, and 22 (1.5%) exhibited documented invasive candidiasis. After adjustment on baseline and time-dependent confounders (underlying illness, severity, invasive procedures, Candida colonization), and using a marginal structural model for longitudinal data, treatment was not associated with a decreased risk of mortality or of occurrence of invasive candidiasis (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–1.96; P = 0.91).

Conclusions

This study failed to show outcome benefits for empirical systemic antifungal therapy in the sickest critically ill, nonneutropenic, nontransplanted patients. The post hoc power did not allow us to conclude to an absence of treatment effect especially for specific subgroups. Studies to refine indications for empirical treatment based on surrogate markers of invasive candidiasis are warranted.

Implementation Considerations

Clinical Settings

Although the Panel refrained from suggesting combination therapy for the diagnosis of IPA as a whole, two clinical settings were proposed as potentially suitable for combination therapy (see implementation remark). Neither setting was proposed on the basis of available study data; rather, the setting was based on the collective experience of panel members and indirect evidence. One such setting is IPA in the critically ill. For patients admitted to the ICU, the mortality of IPA is particularly high, so it would be reasonable to surmise that the potential benefit of combination therapy would be maximized, and the risk of overtreatment minimized, in this high-risk setting. The echinocandins are widely available in the ICU and are routinely used to treat other fungal infections such as IC. Therefore, access of the critically ill to an echinocandin-containing regimen would not be expected to present an obstacle to implementation, except for the most resource-limited parts of the globe. Echinocandins also have a favorable use profile in patients with renal or hepatic impairment — both common conditions in the ICU — and do not pose a major challenge with drug–drug interactions.

The other setting in which the panel favored consideration of combination therapy is when there is concern for triazole resistance. Triazoles are often used for Aspergillus prophylaxis in patients at risk for IPA. It is unknown at present whether the prophylactic use of triazoles impacts the efficacy of monotherapy compared with combination therapy for IPA in the context of breakthrough infections. Overall, in Europe, the prevalence of triazole resistance in clinical A. fumigatus isolates has been reported to be 3.2%, whereas in the United States, the prevalence is substantially lower at 1.4%. On a related note, the availability and use of antifungal susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus isolates in U.S. laboratories is reduced compared with their European counterparts. This has translated into less environmental surveillance, especially on a state-by-state level, in the United States and thus more limited awareness of the epidemiology of Aspergillus resistance than exists in Europe. On other continents, some countries have registered a prevalence of resistance exceeding 10%, especially when environmental isolates are examined. The benefit of initial combination therapy is likelier to outweigh the risk in settings with increased triazole resistance: International expert opinion and European guidelines already advocate for this approach at an environmental resistance threshold of > 10%. Subsequent performance of antifungal susceptibility testing on the clinical isolate of a particular patient could enable deescalation to triazole monotherapy in susceptible cases.

### Editorial commentary: evidence vs instinct for pneumonia prevention in hospitalized patients [^113SdSMY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

These provocative findings are a shot over the bow of infection prevention and quality improvement programs. This meta-analysis simultaneously challenges the validity of current ventilator bundles and begs the question why selective digestive decontamination with systemic antimicrobials is not routinely employed?

In truth, evidence has been gathering for years that the classic ventilator bundle merits revision. Some bundle components, such as stress ulcer prophylaxis, paradoxically increase pneumonia risk. Other bundle components, such as routine oral care with chlorhexidine, do not clearly prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia and may even increase mortality risk.

A major challenge in pneumonia prevention science is the subjectivity and poor specificity of clinical criteria to define pneumonia. Subjectivity allows for the possibility that lower pneumonia rates in the treatment arms of open-label studies are due to observer bias. Poor specificity allows for the possibility that some of the decreases in pneumonia rates in both open-label and double-blind studies are due to less colonization rather than less pneumonia.

These challenges are the reasons why Roquilly and colleagues selected mortality as their primary outcome rather than hospital-acquired pneumonia. Other workers have reached similar conclusions. Indeed, the Society of Healthcare Epidemiologists of America and Infectious Disease Society of America's latest revision of their compendium of strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia specifically prioritizes interventions associated with less time to extubation, shorter intensive care stays, lower hospital mortality, less antibiotic prescribing, and/or lower costs over interventions associated with lower ventilator-associated pneumonia rates alone. The compendium recommends using noninvasive mechanical ventilation whenever possible, minimizing sedation, interrupting sedatives and assessing readiness to extubate daily, mobilizing patients early, using endotracheal tubes with subglottic secretion drainage, changing ventilator circuits only if visibly soiled or malfunctioning, and elevating the head of the bed.

Empiric antifungal therapy in critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients should be considered for those with risk factors for invasive candidiasis and no other known cause of fever, with preference given to an echinocandin for hemodynamic instability, prior azole exposure, or azole-resistant Candida colonization; fluconazole may be considered for hemodynamically stable patients colonized with azole-susceptible Candida or with no prior azole exposure, the appropriate duration is not defined but should not differ from documented candidemia, therapy can be stopped after several days if cultures and surrogate markers are negative, and a randomized ICU trial found empiric fluconazole (800 mg daily for 14 days) was not associated with better outcomes compared with placebo.

### Antifungal agents for preventing fungal infections in non-neutropenic critically ill patients [^114zKN6g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Invasive fungal infections, important causes of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients, may be preventable with the prophylactic administration of antifungal agents.

Objectives

This study aims to systematically identify and summarize the effects of antifungal prophylaxis in non-neutropenic critically ill adult patients on all-cause mortality and the incidence of invasive fungal infections.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to 2 September 2005), and EMBASE (1980 to week 36, 2005). We also handsearched reference lists, abstracts of conference proceedings and scientific meetings (1998 to 2004), and contacted authors of included studies and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials in all languages comparing the prophylactic use of any antifungal agent or regimen with placebo, no antifungal, or another antifungal agent or regimen in non-neutropenic critically ill adult patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently applied selection criteria, performed quality assessment, and extracted data using an intention-to-treat approach. We resolved differences by discussion. We synthesized data using the random effects model and expressed results as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We included 12 unique trials (eight comparing fluconazole and four ketoconazole with no antifungal or a nonabsorbable agent) involving 1606 randomized patients. For both outcomes of total mortality and invasive fungal infections, almost all trials of fluconazole and ketoconazole separately showed a non-significant risk reduction with prophylaxis. When combined, fluconazole/ketoconazole reduced total mortality by about 25% (relative risk 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.97) and invasive fungal infections by about 50% (relative risk 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.68). We identified no significant increase in the incidence of infection or colonization with the azole-resistant fungal pathogens Candida glabrata or C. krusei, although the confidence intervals of the summary effect measures were wide. Adverse effects were not more common amongst patients receiving prophylaxis. Results across all trials were homogeneous despite considerable heterogeneity in clinical and methodological characteristics.

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylaxis with fluconazole or ketoconazole in critically ill patients reduces invasive fungal infections by one half and total mortality by one quarter. Although no significant increase in azole-resistant Candida species associated with prophylaxis was demonstrated, trials were not powered to exclude such an effect. In patients at increased risk of invasive fungal infections, antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole should be considered.

An of ﬁ cial American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111321q8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Areas of Research Need

Given the clinical equipoise that persists regarding the use of prophylactic and empiric antifungals in ICU patients, further study is warranted. With respect to prophylaxis, the specific contribution of IC to ICU mortality requires further delineation. Then the question remains: In ICU patients who are at increased risk of IC, does receipt of a systemic antifungal prevent IC, and, if so, which antifungal drug or strategy is most beneficial, and what is the number needed to treat to prevent one episode of IC? With regard to preemptive therapy, current implementation of a true preemptive antifungal strategy to prevent IC is limited by the availability of a well-studied, sensitive biomarker that can be used to detect preclinical disease; however, should such a test become available, this strategy should be revisited. There are several new drugs in the antifungal pipeline that have not been assessed in this context and, given the novel mechanism of action of some, warrant consideration. Future studies must take into account risks to the individual, such as adverse effects of the antifungal, the impact on the host mycobiome, and the progression to infection with resistant fungi, as well as implications for local fungal ecology.

Evidence summary for ICU empiric candidiasis management — Candida species are an increasing cause of invasive infection in nonneutropenic ICU patients, with "half to two-thirds of all episodes of candidemia occur in an ICU". Mortality burden is high: "Most estimates of attributable mortality rates for invasive candidiasis in this setting are 30%–40%". In patients with septic shock due to Candida without source control or antifungal therapy "within 24 hours", "the mortality approaches 100%".

### Fluconazole prophylaxis in critically ill surgical patients: a meta-analysis [^115jdHzk]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of fluconazole prophylaxis on the incidence of fungal infections and on mortality among critically ill surgical patients.

Design

Meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of fluconazole prophylaxis.

Patients

Subjects participating in the clinical trials in this area.

Measurements and Main Results

We identified four randomized studies comparing fluconazole to placebo for prevention of fungal infections in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). The studies enrolled 626 patients and used differing dosing regimens of fluconazole. All trials were double-blind and two were multicenter studies. Fluconazole administration significantly reduced the incidence of fungal infections (pooled odds ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.27–0.72; p < .001). However, fluconazole prophylaxis was not associated with a survival advantage (pooled OR for mortality, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.59–1.28; p = NS). Fluconazole did not statistically alter the rate of candidemia, as this was low across the studies and developed in only 2.2% of all participants. Performing a sensitivity analysis and including two additional studies that indirectly examined fluconazole prophylaxis in the critically ill did not change our observations. Data from the reports reviewed were insufficient to allow comment on the impact of fluconazole prophylaxis on resource utilization, the distribution of non-albicans species of Candida, and the emergence of antifungal resistance. Generally, fluconazole appeared to be safe for SICU patients.

Conclusions

Prophylactic fluconazole administration for prevention of mycoses in SICU patients appears to successfully decrease the rate of these infections, but this strategy does not improve survival. The absence of a survival advantage may reflect the few studies in this area and the possibility that this issue has not been adequately studied. Because of the potential for both resistance and emergence of non-albicans isolates, clinicians must consider these issues when evaluating fluconazole prophylaxis in the SICU. Future trials should focus on more precisely identifying patients at high risk for fungal infections and on determining if broader use of fluconazole alters the distribution of candidal species seen in the SICU and impacts measures of resource utilization such as length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation.

### Disease-specific gaps within fungal respiratory tract infections: clinical features, diagnosis, and management in critically ill patients [^113jYNBe]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We aim to examine the most recent findings in the area of invasive pulmonary fungal infections to determine the appropriate/and or lack of prevention measures and treatment of upper fungal respiratory tract infections in the critically ill.

Recent Findings

This will be addressed by focusing on the pathogens and prognosis over different bedridden periods in ICU patients, the occurrence of invasive fungal respiratory superinfections in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 which has been recently noted following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Relevant reports referenced within include randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, observational studies, systematic reviews, and international guidelines, where applicable. Of note, it is clear there is a significant gap in our knowledge regarding whether bacterial and fungal infections in coronavirus disease 2019 are directly attributable to SARS-CoV-2 or a consequence of factors such as managing high numbers of critically unwell patients, and the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation/ICU admission duration of stay.

Summary

An optimal diagnostic algorithm incorporating fungal biomarkers and molecular tools for early and accurate diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia, invasive aspergillosis, candidemia, and endemic mycoses continues to be limited clinically. There is a lack of standardized molecular approach to identify fungal pathogens directly in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and suboptimal diagnostic approaches for mould blood cultures, tissue culture processing for Mucorales, and fungal respiratory cultures (i.e., the routine use of bronchoscopic examination in ICU patients with influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis) for fungal point-of-care testing to detect and identify new, emerging or underrecognized, rare, or uncommon fungal pathogens.

Recommendation strength interpretation — strong versus weak (conditional): For a strong recommendation, most individuals should receive the intervention and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. For a weak (conditional) recommendation, recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

An of ﬁ cial American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^117QSQtV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Invasive candidiasis epidemiology in critically ill patients — incidence and mortality: In critically ill patients, the incidence of candidemia varies from 3.5 to 16.5 episodes per 1,000 ICU admissions, and outcomes associated with invasive candidiasis are poor, with a crude mortality of 40–55%. Candida colonization logically precedes infection, and in critically ill patients, the presence and density of Candida colonization is predictive of development of invasive candidiasis.

Limitations of the Current Literature

One of the main limitations of this analysis is the heterogeneity among the included studies. As described, a range of antifungal durations and doses was used, particularly for fluconazole. Some studies used additional therapies to reduce infection, such as SDD. The eligibility criteria for antifungal prophylaxis varied from MV patients receiving SDD, to ICU patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, to critically ill surgical patients, to critically ill trauma patients. Similarly, each of the three studies of empiric antifungal therapy used different combinations of risk factors for inclusion. Despite the differences in the design of the studies, the outcomes were similar. Further studies of antifungal prophylaxis focused on specific subgroups that are at significantly increased risk of IC, such as those with severe pancreatitis, could help to identify populations that may benefit from prophylaxis. We excluded neutropenic and solid organ transplant recipients because, in certain subsets within these groups, the utility of anti- Candida prophylaxis has been long established.

The 2016 IDSA guidelines, the 2019 European Society of Intensive Care Medicine/ESCMID guidelines, and the 2021 Australian guidelines recommend empiric therapy for suspected IC in critically ill patients with risk factors for IC. The former but not the latter two guidelines recommend prophylactic antifungals for high-risk adult ICU patients, although this is a weak recommendation based on low- to moderate-quality evidence.

2. Is there an untargeted antifungal strategy or an antifungal drug more effective than others?

Subanalyses did not show any survival benefit from the use of either prophylactic or empiric treatment. No effect was detected for azoles, echinocandins, absorbable, or non-absorbable antifungals. Antifungal prophylaxis was associated with a significant reduction of IFI, whereas empiric treatment was not. Only one RCT evaluated the pre-emptive approach and few patients were enrolled. It may be argued that studies investigating empiric treatment, defined as the administration of antifungals in patients with signs/symptoms of infections at risk for IFIs, enrolled subjects with a more advanced disease process, leading to lack of efficacy. Azoles were associated with a significant reduction of IFIs, whereas studies investigating echinocandins did not show any significant benefit on IFI reduction. Notably, the numbers of studies and included patients were higher for the subanalyses of prophylaxis and azoles. An ongoing multicenter RCT will provide more data on the use of empiric treatment with echinocandins.

Antifungal drug class comparisons — mortality effects indicate no difference by class in these analyses: For fluconazole therapy, the pooled relative risk (RR) of death was 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82–1.33), and for echinocandin therapy the pooled RR of death was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.86–1.31). The consistency of the results across the two antifungal drug classes suggests that the drug class may not have an effect on mortality, although fluconazole has not been directly compared with an echinocandin in this setting.

Strengths and limitations of the study

The strengths of the present meta-analysis include the considerable number of studies and subjects included as well as the acceptable methodologic quality of the studies on which the analysis is based. It is well-known that the quality assessment of the primary studies has been identified as one of the most important steps of the peer-review process. This comes from the consideration that studies of poor quality may yield information that is not valid; therefore, the inclusion of studies with invalid information in a meta-analysis can make the conclusion of the meta-analysis invalid. Therefore, taking the quality of studies into account in a meta-analysis has the potential to enhance the validity of a meta-analysis because quality is implicitly a measure of validity. Moreover, the evaluation of the quality of the studies in a meta-analysis may contribute to point out limitations in published studies and suggest ways to improve the methodology of studies in further research. In this meta-analysis the quality of the RCTs was good with regard to the various methodological aspects of the research protocol (for example, description of therapeutic regimen, criteria for patient selection, randomization, blinding) while the main shortcomings were related to the overall assessment of the statistical methods and presentation of data. Limitations of the present meta-analysis study include the heterogeneity between the studies with respect to patient populations that had a different profile of risk factors; different medications used, particularly in antibiotic trials, in the choice of the antimicrobial agents or their associations or the delivery mode; different approaches for the control arms and different outcome definitions. Moreover, among our inclusion criteria there was restriction to studies published in English. This is a controversial issue, since some argue that authors are more likely to report positive results in international journals and negative results in local journals, as demonstrated by Egger et al. Language restriction could, therefore, introduce bias in the results of the meta-analysis. However, there has also been evidence that studies published in local journals may be of lower methodological quality, as reported by Sterne et al. and this would be in favor of their exclusion. We have also performed a search without language restriction and it would have led to the inclusion of two more papers. Vogel et al. was excluded because it was not a RCT, while we have repeated the meta-analyses of topical SDRD by antibiotics on VAP prevention and on mortality by entering Rathgeber et al. and the results did not alter our conclusions. Indeed, the overall estimate of efficacy of antibiotics on VAP prevention was 37% (95% CI of efficacy = 20% to 51%) and the meta-analysis on mortality showed no significant effect (efficacy = -2%; 95% CI of efficacy = -12% to 7%). These results were confirmed in the sensitivity analyses involving only upper respiratory tract decontamination with antibiotics (data not shown). Therefore, we believe that our strategy is not prone to substantial bias or to low robustness in the overall results. Finally, the findings are affected by the limitations of the individual trials included. According to the mentioned limitations, the results of the meta-analysis must be interpreted with caution; however, the careful examination of possible sources of heterogeneity contributed to assess the methodologic quality of research, and to identify potential biases, data gaps, and suggestions for future research.

### Prophylactic antifungal therapy in the intensive care unit [^111uS6eg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Antifungal prophylaxis is regularly used during treatment of patients with some cancers, as subgroups with high rates of invasive fungal infections are readily identified; for these patients, prophylaxis has been shown to be of value. High-risk liver transplant recipients also benefit from antifungal prophylaxis. Although the idea of extending this concept to the prevention of candidal infections in the larger population of critically ill patients who are seen in the intensive care unit (ICU) and who do not have neutropenia is attractive, implementation of this strategy is difficult because of the widely varying characteristics of patients in the ICU. Two studies have shown the benefit of such prophylaxis, but the benefit was shown only in selected groups of patients who had an unusually high risk for invasive candidiasis. Although the concept is sound, broad-scale implementation of antifungal prophylaxis would be premature and costly, both financially and with regard to resistance and toxicity. Investigations are needed to define and prove the utility of predictive tools for the identification of patients in the ICU who would benefit from prophylaxis.

### Clinical guidelines: asking the right questions to guide fungal infection management [^112HuDJi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The section on prophylactic and empirical antifungal therapy targeting Candida species also requires critical refinement. Prophylaxis and empirical treatment are distinct strategies with unique indications and clinical objectives. The aim of prophylaxis is to prevent fungal infections in high-risk populations. At the same time, empirical treatment is initiated on the basis of clinical suspicion and severity of illness, such as organ failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure. Previous guidelines have highlighted that prophylaxis is generally unnecessary for critically ill patients, whereas the complexity of clinical presentations must guide empirical therapy. By conflating these two approaches into a single recommendation, the guideline risks causing confusion and reducing clinical applicability. A stratified approach that distinctly addresses prophylaxis and empirical therapy would enhance clarity, usability, and alignment with evidence-based practice.

Robust methodology is indispensable for developing clinical guidelines but must be complemented by practical clinical insight. Not all clinical questions can be addressed by existing evidence, and overly rigid recommendations may fail to reflect real-world complexities. Effective guidelines require domain experts' contributions to ensure the recommendations are relevant and applicable. For instance, expertise in methodology only translates seamlessly into addressing complex questions in clinical practice recommendations. Ensuring multidisciplinary collaboration and clinical context is crucial to creating well-rounded, impactful guidelines.

The authors should be commended for their efforts in tackling such a critical topic in pulmonary and critical care medicine. Their work provides a foundation for improving the management of fungal infections in critically ill patients. However, refinements in key areas — such as combination therapy, amphotericin B formulations, voriconazole efficacy, and the distinction between prophylaxis and empirical therapy — would significantly enhance the guideline's relevance and utility.

A balanced approach that integrates rigorous methodology with practical clinical insights will ensure the guideline's recommendations are both evidence based and applicable in real-world practice. By addressing these limitations, the guideline can become an even more valuable resource for clinicians, ultimately improving patient outcomes in this challenging and high-stakes area of care.

### Empirical fluconazole versus placebo for intensive care unit patients: a randomized trial [^111KVVqW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Invasive infection with Candida species is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Optimal preventive strategies have not been clearly defined.

Objective

To see whether empirical fluconazole improves clinical outcomes more than placebo in adult ICU patients at high risk for invasive candidiasis.

Design

Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial conducted from 1995 to 2000.

Setting

26 ICUs in the United States.

Patients

270 adult ICU patients with fever despite administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. All had central venous catheters and an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than 16.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to either intravenous fluconazole, 800 mg daily, or placebo for 2 weeks and were followed for 4 weeks thereafter. Two hundred forty-nine participants were available for outcome assessment.

Measurements

A composite primary outcome that defined success as all 4 of the following: resolution of fever; absence of invasive fungal infection; no discontinuation because of toxicity; and no need for a nonstudy, systemic antifungal medication (as assessed by a blinded oversight committee).

Results

Only 44 of 122 (36%) fluconazole recipients and 48 of 127 (38%) placebo recipients had a successful outcome (relative risk, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.32; P = 0.78]). The main reason for failure was lack of resolution of fever (51% for fluconazole and 57% for placebo). Documented invasive candidiasis occurred in 5% of fluconazole recipients and 9% of placebo recipients (relative risk, 0.57 [CI, 0.22 to 1.49]). Seven (5%) fluconazole recipients and 10 (7%) placebo recipients had adverse events resulting in discontinuation of the study drug. Discontinuation because of abnormal liver test results occurred in 3 (2%) fluconazole recipients and 5 (4%) placebo recipients.

Limitations

Twenty-one randomly assigned patients were not included in the analysis because they either did not meet entry criteria or did not have postbaseline assessments. Fewer fungal infections than anticipated occurred in the control group. Confidence bounds were wide and did not exclude potentially important differences in outcomes between groups.

Conclusion

In critically ill adults with risk factors for invasive candidiasis, empirical fluconazole did not clearly improve a composite outcome more than placebo.

An of ﬁ cial American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112uQvjz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our multidisciplinary review of the available data provided the following recommendations. A conditional recommendation was made for patients with proven or probable IPA to receive either initial combination therapy with a mold-active triazole plus an echinocandin or initial mold-active triazole monotherapy based on low-quality evidence. Furthermore, a conditional weak recommendation was made against routine administration of prophylactic or empiric antifungal agents targeting Candida species for critically ill patients without neutropenia or a history of transplant based on low-quality evidence.

Antifungal strategy definitions and evidence base — study selection and trial characteristics in nonneutropenic, nontransplant critically ill adults: Systemic anti–Candida therapy was categorized as prophylactic, preemptive, and empiric, where "A prophylaxis strategy entails administration of antifungals to high-risk patients without microbiologic or radiographic evidence of infection; a preemptive strategy entails administration of antifungals to high-risk patients based on the presence of positive surrogate markers (e.g., β-D-glucan [BDG], mannan, antimannan antibody); an empiric strategy entails administration of antifungals to high-risk patients based on signs of infection but absence of microbiologic confirmation of infection". RCTs included assessed mortality versus placebo in nonneutropenic, nontransplant, critically ill adults with all-cause mortality as the primary outcome, and studies "with fewer than 25 patients" were excluded. The search "yielded 1,600 references, of which 1,526 were excluded after abstract screening… The full-text articles of the remaining 74 references were reviewed", after which "9 studies were not RCTs and 60 studies did not include the relevant population, intervention, control, and/or outcome, leaving 5 RCTs". From secondary sources, "An additional three eligible studies were then identified", and after excluding an unpublished early-terminated trial, "In total, eight RCTs were finally included". For prophylaxis, "Five placebo-controlled RCTs… totaling 441 patients in the intervention group and 421 in the control group", with "Three RCTs" of fluconazole and "two an echinocandin", and "Three RCTs… single center… and two were multicenter". Prophylaxis duration "varied from a defined duration of 14 days… to ICU length of stay… to development of IC". "None of the eligible studies identified by our search examined preemptive therapy as per the definition used herein", and a ventilator-associated pneumonia study with Candida from the respiratory tract was categorized as prophylaxis, noting Candida pneumonia is rare and requires histopathologic visualization that "was not achieved in this study".

### A complete and multifaceted overview of antibiotic use and infection diagnosis in the intensive care unit: results from a prospective four-year registration [^111RXwp8]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

For example, the respiratory system accounted for half of identified sources of bacterial infection and more than one third of the total antibacterial DOT. Compared to abdominal infections, which represented the second largest group of bacterial infections and destination for antibiotic consumption, respiratory infections were less frequently categorized as highly probable (76% versus 50%, respectively), which also reflected the amount of DOT that was designated to treat these highly probable infections (85% of the total DOT of abdominal and 56% of the total DOT of respiratory infections). One quarter of the infections that were diagnosed in our ICU were ICU-acquired, which is in contrast with the study of Bergmans et al. where half of the infections were ICU-acquired and almost exclusively occurred in ventilated patients. Whereas the authors of the previous study concluded that stewardship should be focused on the prevention of ventilator-associated respiratory infections, this statement may apply less to our ICU population. In addition, restricting duration of antibiotic therapy in VAP of high probability will offer little gain, as the median treatment duration was only 7 days. In contrast, more restrictive use of antibiotics in suspected respiratory tract infections with cultures remaining negative and/or a swift clinical resolution, could result in a more profound reduction of antibiotic consumption. In addition, we observed that prophylactic treatment accounted for one fourth of the total DOT. Although this figure seems extremely high, more in-depth evaluation showed that two thirds of the antibacterial prophylactic treatment consisted of perioperative prophylaxis and prophylaxis in the immunocompromised patient, which conformed to guidelines with regard to treatment duration in the ICU. Whether aspiration and trauma justify antibiotic prophylaxis, and for what duration, is still a matter of debate; more recent studies promote restrictive use of antibiotics in this setting. We believe that introduction of more restrictive guidelines on prophylaxis in trauma and aspiration, which are currently unavailable in our ICU, could lead to a reduction in antibiotic use, albeit rather limited if we take the total as well as the median DOT for both indications in our ICU into account. This is in contrast with use of the antifungal prophylactic treatment, which is extremely high in our ICU, particularly in the context of intra-abdominal infections. Clear instructions on prophylactic indication and treatment duration, which are also not in place, may restrain our overall use of antifungals.

### Aerosolized antibiotics for treatment of pneumonia in mechanically ventilated subjects [^117LsfUQ]. Respiratory Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Mechanical ventilation is a well-established and commonly employed modality of treatment for critically ill patients in the ICU. Pneumonia is a frequent complication in mechanically ventilated patients. Patients who develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) incur higher medical costs, have prolonged ICU and hospital stays, and have increased mortality risk. There is growing interest in finding new treatment modalities for this condition because the success rate for treating VAP with systemic antibiotics continues to be < 70%. Accordingly, clinicians are reevaluating the role of aerosolized antibiotics, either as a sole therapy or as adjuncts to systemic antibiotics, in an attempt to improve clinical outcomes in patients with VAP. There are several clinical settings in which aerosolized antibiotics could be used for treating pneumonia, including their use for prevention, as monotherapy, as adjunctive therapy with systemic antibiotics, and for treatment of extensively drug-resistant or pan drug-resistant pathogens. However, aerosolized antibiotics have not been uniformly effective for improving clinical outcomes of patients with VAP, and local and systemic side effects could complicate their use. Moreover, many questions about aerosolized antibiotics, such as optimal formulations and dosage and treatment regimens, remain unanswered and warrant future investigations.

### Guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia… [^117MDFB1]. CDC (1997). Low credibility.

Although patients receiving mechanically assisted ventilation do not represent a major proportion of patients who have nosocomial pneumonia, they are at highest risk for acquiring the infection. Most bacterial nosocomial pneumonias occur by aspiration of bacteria colonizing the oropharynx or upper gastrointestinal tract of the patient. Because intubation and mechanical ventilation alter first-line patient defenses, they greatly increase the risk for nosocomial bacterial pneumonia. Although patients receiving mechanically assisted ventilation do not represent a major proportion of patients who have nosocomial pneumonia, they are at highest risk for acquiring the infection. Most bacterial nosocomial pneumonias occur by aspiration of bacteria colonizing the oropharynx or upper gastrointestinal tract of the patient. Because intubation and mechanical ventilation alter first-line patient defenses, they greatly increase the risk for nosocomial bacterial pneumonia.

Outbreaks related to the use of respiratory-therapy equipment have been associated with contaminated nebulizers, which are humidification devices that produce large amounts of aerosol droplets less than 4 um via ultrasound, spinning disk, or the Venturi mechanism. When the fluid in the reservoir of a nebulizer becomes contaminated with bacteria, the aerosol produced may contain high concentrations of bacteria that can be deposited deep in the patient's lower respiratory tract. Contaminated aerosol inhalation is particularly hazardous for intubated patients because endotracheal and tracheal tubes provide direct access to the lower respiratory tract. In contrast to nebulizers, bubble-through or wick humidifiers primarily increase the water-vapor content of inspired gases.

Although heated bubble-through humidifiers generate aerosol droplets, they do so in quantities that may not be clinically important; wick humidifiers do not generate aerosols. of particles greater than or equal to 0. 3 um in diameter; b) directed room airflow; c) positive room-air pressure relative to the corridor; d) well-sealed rooms; and e) high rates of room-air changes, although air-change rates at the higher levels might pose problems of patient comfort.

### Clinical trials of antifungal prophylaxis among patients in surgical intensive care units: concepts and considerations [^113quXja]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal infections are important clinical infections in patients in surgical intensive care units. In some institutions, antifungal prophylaxis has become commonplace, and increasing resistance has been reported. However, trials of antifungal prophylaxis are hampered by difficulties in trial design, and the findings may not be generalizable.

Methods

Issues in clinical trial design are reviewed from existing and theoretical perspectives.

Results

Identification of a primary hypothesis with a sound epidemiological basis is essential. The study must include institutions where fungal infections have a high and well-studied incidence. A high-risk patient population should be identified and enrolled. The agent selected should have an appropriate spectrum, be easily delivered to the population selected, and be cost effective with few adverse events. At present, fluconazole appears to be the best agent for targeted prophylaxis. The primary end point of the study should be based on an easily measured outcome, for example, days free from fungal infection rather than death due to fungal infection.

Conclusions

Trials of antifungal prophylaxis for patients in surgical intensive care units have had problems in design, and several issues in the conceptual basis of future clinical trials must be addressed.

Recommendations for Selected Fungal Treatment Questions

Question 2

In critically ill patients who are nonneutropenic and are not transplant recipients, should systemic antifungal agents be administered as either prophylaxis or empiric therapy to reduce mortality?

Recommendation

In critically ill patients without neutropenia or a history of transplant, we suggest against routine administration of prophylactic or empiric antifungal agents targeting Candida species (conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence).

Empiric treatment for suspected invasive candidiasis in nonneutropenic intensive care unit (ICU) patients — empiric antifungal therapy "should be considered in critically ill patients with risk factors for invasive candidiasis and no other known cause of fever" and "should be started as soon as possible" in those with "clinical signs of septic shock" (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Preferred empiric therapy is an echinocandin: caspofungin "loading dose of 70 mg, then 50 mg daily"; micafungin "100 mg daily"; anidulafungin "loading dose of 200 mg, then 100 mg daily" (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Fluconazole "800-mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily" is an acceptable alternative when there has been no recent azole exposure and no colonization with azole-resistant Candida (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Lipid formulation AmB "3–5 mg/kg daily" is an alternative if other agents are not tolerated (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). If patients improve, recommended duration is "2 weeks", the same as documented candidemia (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). If there is "no clinical response… at 4–5 days" and no evidence of invasive disease or a negative non-culture diagnostic with high negative predictive value, "consideration should be given to stopping antifungal therapy" (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).

Antifungal therapy context for IPA — voriconazole standard and combination rationale: A pivotal randomized controlled trial (RCT) published in 2002 established the superior efficacy and safety of voriconazole, a mold-active triazole, compared with amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmB), and as a result voriconazole has been considered the drug of choice for IPA since that time. The currently available evidence does not support replacing voriconazole with an echinocandin as first-line monotherapy; however, the possible benefit of adding an echinocandin to voriconazole as combination therapy has long been entertained, with a mechanistic rationale for synergy because triazoles inhibit fungal cell membrane synthesis whereas echinocandins act at the cell wall.

### Biomarker-guided antibiotic stewardship in suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAPrapid2): a randomised controlled trial and process evaluation [^113RXxuQ]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Whether fungi and various bacteria traditionally considered commensals can be considered a cause of ventilator-associated pneumonia when isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage at 10⁴ CFU/mL or more is controversial. The argument that Candida is not a pathogen in ventilator-associated pneumonia has been strengthened by a recent prospective study, although the diagnosis of infection was partly based on endotracheal aspirate cultures. Our decision to consider the presence of such organisms at 10⁴ CFU/mL or more in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as ventilator-associated pneumonia was based on our previous studies and large clinical trials in suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia reporting substantial growth of these organisms. However, we acknowledge that many clinicians would not consider fungi, yeasts, or Enterococci as pathogens in ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Controversy also surrounds the issue of whether patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia should be included in trials if antibiotics have been started or adjusted in the 3 days before microbiological sampling, because of the theoretical risk of sterilising samples taken for culture. We elected to include such patients on the grounds that our derivation and validation studies had similar ventilator-associated pneumonia rates (24% and 35%, respectively), with the derivation study excluding and the validation study including such patients. The similar ventilator-associated pneumonia rate in the current study (34%) provides evidence that inclusion of such patients did not materially alter ventilator-associated pneumonia rates. However, although there was only one false negative result identified for our test, it remains theoretically possible that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples might be sterile for technical reasons, such as inadequate sampling or delays in analysis, as has been described for blood cultures. We attempted to mitigate this risk by implementing a protocolised bronchoalveolar lavage, ensuring timely delivery of samples and having quality control checks within the biomarker assay.

### Antifungal prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis in critically ill patients: an observational study [^112U8L98]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated acute respiratory failure contributes to a highly permissive inflammatory environment. This in turn favours fungal pathogenesis due to the release of danger-associated molecular patterns and collateral effects of host recognition pathways required for the activation of antiviral immunity. In this context, COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) has been emerging as an important fungal complication of COVID-19, affecting an average of 3.1% (range 0.7–7.7%) of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 8.9% (range 2.5–39%) of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and an average of 20.1% (range 3.2–38%) of those requiring invasive ventilation.

Diagnosis of CAPA is challenging in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS, as clinical picture and radiological findings of CAPA resemble those of severe COVID-19, and blood tests lack sensitivity due to the primarily airway invasive growth of Aspergillus in non-neutropenic patients. Testing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with fungal culture, galactomannan (GM), Aspergillus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or the Aspergillus GM lateral flow assay (LFA) is therefore preferred, but due to the presumed risk of COVID-19 transmission through bronchoscopies, sampling of the primary infection site is still not performed consistently across ICUs.

The high prevalence rates of CAPA in critically ill patients requiring invasive ventilation together with the difficulties in diagnosis and the devastating overall mortality rates of over 50% could justify clinical trials evaluating antifungal prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure. One retrospective single-centre case series from Belgium has reported the successful use of prophylaxis in terms of CAPA case reduction with inhaled liposomal Amphotericin B in a cohort of ICU patients with severe COVID-19; however, studies evaluating systemic antifungal prophylaxis are lacking.

The objective of this observational single-centre study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mould-active antifungal prophylaxis in preventing CAPA in critical care patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory failure. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of a potential survival benefit associated with antifungal prophylaxis as well as the impact of CAPA on overall survival.

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) patient characteristics and subgroup findings — one randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed a statistically significant reduction in 6-week mortality with combination therapy in two subpopulations: a dominant subgroup (80% of subjects) diagnosed by GM positivity and a smaller prespecified subgroup (99 of 277; 36% of subjects) without neutropenia at diagnosis; a calculated RR for death of 0.42 for this subgroup had a very wide 95% CI (0.19–0.94), was not incorporated into the guideline panel's evidence-to-decision process, and the panel noted that special attention to an individual patient's neutrophil count is warranted when deciding on monotherapy versus combination therapy for IPA.

Invasive candidiasis is a problem associated with substantial morbidity and mortality that is highly prevalent in the intensive care unit setting. Recent epidemiologic studies have shown a trend toward increasing numbers of infections and a shift toward infections caused by non-albicans Candida species. Guidelines for the management of these diseases have been published and recommend amphotericin B, fluconazole, or caspofungin as the primary therapeutic option. The choice of agent should depend on local epidemiology and patient factors. The role of newer antifungal agents for this population, such as the new azoles and echinocandins, remains to be determined. Priority areas of research include diagnostics, risk identification, and management strategy assessment such as prophylactic, preemptive, and empirical therapy.

### Evolving role of early antifungals in the adult intensive care unit [^113m6T64]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Invasive candidiasis (IC) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. This, in conjunction with difficulties in diagnosis, underscores the need for novel treatment strategies based on the identification of significant risk factors for IC.

Objective

To review the evidence surrounding the use of early antifungals in critically ill adult patients and to present concise and specific recommendations for different early treatment strategies for IC.

Data Sources and Data Extraction

Pubmed search from 1966 to July 2008 using the search terms "antifungals, critical care, prophylaxis, preemptive therapy, and empiric therapy". Examined all relevant peer-reviewed original articles, meta-analyses, guidelines, consensus statements, and review articles.

Conclusion

The use of early antifungal therapy should be reserved for patients with a high risk (10% to 15%) of developing IC. Despite a large number of articles published on this topic, there is no single predictive rule that can adequately forecast IC in critically ill patients. Until further prospective validation of existing data is completed, clinicians should assess patients on a case-by-case basis and determine the need for early antifungal treatment strategies based on frequent evaluations of risk factors and clinical status.

An of ﬁ cial American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114ZqJY5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Intensive care unit antifungal prescribing considerations — In the ICU, the prescription of antifungals to prevent or treat IC requires consideration of risks associated with widespread antifungal administration. For individual patients, antifungals may be associated with adverse effects and drug interactions. The panel was unable to assess adverse effects in this guideline iteration because of inconsistent reporting, but echinocandins and fluconazole are generally better tolerated than mold-active azoles and AmB formulations. The influence of the gut mycobiome, including gut bacterial microbiome assembly, is being appreciated and is likely perturbed by antifungal use.

### Anidulafungin compared with fluconazole in severely ill patients with candidemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis: support for the 2009 IDSA treatment guidelines for candidiasis [^112VqPHc]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The 2009 IDSA candidemia treatment guidelines recommend initial treatment with an echinocandin in patients with "moderately severe to severe" illness. To validate these guidelines for the treatment of candidemia, we identified a group of patients with critical illness at study entry in a prospective, randomized clinical trial that compared anidulafungin with fluconazole. In this group, global response at end of treatment was significantly higher with anidulafungin than with fluconazole.

We believe that this global-response observation supports the IDSA candidemia guidelines, as well as current European guidelines that recommend an echinocandin for treatment of candidemia in hemodynamically unstable ICU patients. Three recent reports, however, were unable to confirm the advantage of an echinocandin over other systemic antifungal agents for the treatment of candidemia in ICU patients. Two post hoc subgroup analyses of data collected in prospective randomized studies reported similar clinical responses and all-cause mortality in ICU patients receiving initial treatment with an echinocandin (micafungin or caspofungin) when compared with amphotericin B-based comparators. Similarly, a post hoc analysis of patients with candidemia requiring mechanical ventilation failed to demonstrate a survival advantage for an echinocandin compared with fluconazole, even after adjusting for nontreatment factors. In our analysis, similar patients with candidemia and respiratory failure who were treated with anidulafungin had better global responses at the end of treatment compared with those with fluconazole, but no significant difference in survival was found. In contrast to other studies, we did not limit our analysis to ICU patients. To be more consistent with the IDSA guidelines, we identified patients who were considered to be "moderately severe to severely ill" and included patients outside of an ICU setting.

### Association between selective digestive decontamination and decreased rate of acquired candidemia in mechanically ventilated ICU patients: a multicenter nationwide study [^111MdpvY]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

In our study, the impact of ICAC on the fate of patients, with a survival rate dropping in the overall population from 70.2 to 51.6%, deserves to be highlighted. Therefore, although having a low incidence rate (compared to other ICU-acquired infections), the consequences of ICAC make their prevention a priority.

Our results on the effect of SDD on ICAC are consistent with previous studies reporting very low incidence of candidemia in ICU patients receiving SDD suggesting another positive effect of SDD in addition to reducing VAP and bacteremia and improving ICU patient outcomes. Although recommended in ICUs where the prevalence of MDR bacteria is low (< 20%) as a validated strategy to prevent VAP in recent guidelines, implementation of SDD in ICUs remains low. In the present study, only 3.2% of the patients included benefited from such a preventive strategy which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Moreover, the low proportion of ICUs applying SDD might drive remaining residual confounders such as other measures to prevent nosocomial infections including candidaemia. Factors that may have contributed to the low compliance with current guidelines may include the resources required to implement such a strategy. However, the use of resources can be offset by the reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation and the decreased rate of healthcare-associated infections observed in previous studies. In addition, fear of antimicrobial resistance may prevent clinicians from implementing SDD. Nonetheless, studies deciphering this issue evidenced the absence of effect of SDD regimens on multidrug-resistant bacteria colonization and acquired infections. Moreover, in the present analysis, the rate of MDR bacteria acquisition in ICU appeared lower in SDD patients. Beyond multidrug-resistant bacteria, a global concern is the emergence of antifungal-resistant yeast. The growing incidence of azole and echinocandin resistances represents major challenges for therapeutic strategies. While previous studies assessed the impact of SDD on antibiotics resistance, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of administering amphotericin B to patients receiving SDD on antifungal resistance remains unexplored. Moreover, recent outbreaks of Candida auris infections could change the fungal landscape of ICU patients. Since exposure to fluconazole is a predictive factor for these multi-resistant yeasts infections, preventing ICAC could help limit the spread of these threatening pathogens. Neither resistance to antifungal agents nor colonization by Candida has been assessed in our study, leaving this question unanswered.

### Treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and preventive and empirical therapy for invasive candidiasis in adult pulmonary and critical care patients. An of ﬁ cial American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115ke7F3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence of invasive fungal infections is increasing in immune-competent and immune-compromised patients. An examination of the recent literature related to the treatment of fungal infections was performed to address two clinical questions. First, in patients with proven or probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, should combination therapy with a mold-active triazole plus echinocandin be administered vs. mold-active triazole monotherapy? Second, in critically ill patients at risk for invasive candidiasis who are non-neutropenic and are not transplant recipients, should systemic antifungal agents be administered either as prophylaxis or as empiric therapy?

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel reviewed the available data concerning the two questions. The evidence was evaluated, and recommendations were generated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Results

A conditional recommendation was made for patients with proven or probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis to receive either initial combination therapy with a mold-active triazole plus an echinocandin or initial mold-active triazole monotherapy based on low-quality evidence. Further, a conditional weak recommendation was made against routine administration of prophylactic or empiric antifungal agents targeting Candida species for critically ill patients without neutropenia or a history of transplant based on low-quality evidence.

Conclusions

The recommendations presented in these Guidelines are the result of an analysis of currently available evidence. Additional research and new clinical data will prompt an update in the future.

Meetings and Process

After initial discussions in 2020, the members of the ATS fungal working group convened by conference call to review fungal treatment topics commonly encountered in pulmonary and critical care practice with the express purpose of identifying those fungal treatment topics with new data since the 2011 ATS guidelines. After survey of the available literature, two selected questions were proposed, discussed with the ATS documents chair, and finalized for submission to the project review committee in July 2021. These selected topics were revised and approved for the project beginning in January 2022. All work was performed virtually with monthly or bimonthly conference calls. Literature search and analysis were performed under the direction of ATS-designated methodologists (M.H.M. and Q.S.H.). They presented the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach for guideline development. The committee performed the literature review, data evaluation, GRADE recommendation development, and guideline formation and drafted the document.

Formulating Clinical Questions

The panel reviewed emerging literature relevant to commonly encountered fungal treatment topics since the last ATS fungal treatment guidelines. The committee selected the two most relevant clinical treatment questions. The topics were selected by committee consensus and included the use of combination antifungal therapy in IPA and the use of prophylaxis and empiric treatment for IC in critically ill patients. Two specific PICO (patient/population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) questions were formulated. These PICO questions guided the systematic reviews of the literature, grading, and recommendations. In an ongoing fashion, the committee is currently formulating and reviewing additional questions that will serve as the basis for future guidelines.

Literature Search and Study Selection

A comprehensive search was conducted from January 1, 2000, to January 11, 2022, and included Medline In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. Search results were limited to English and were designed and executed by a librarian. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of fungal diagnosis. The actual strategies for PICO 1 and PICO 2 are available in the online supplementary material and yielded 2,260 citations for PICO 1 and 1,600 citations for PICO 2. The panel also assisted in identifying additional resources and monitored the literature for studies outside of the search dates and strategies. The methodologists and the committee members selected studies for inclusion by consensus.

### A randomized double-blind trial of iseganan in prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia [^115uC5k5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale

Iseganan, an antimicrobial peptide, is active against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi and yeasts. The drug has shown little resistance in vitro and to be safe and well tolerated in 800 patients with cancer treated for up to 6 wk.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of iseganan for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Methods

Mechanically ventilated patients in the United States and Europe were randomized to oral topical iseganan or placebo (1:1) and treated six times per day while intubated for up to 14 d. Patients were eligible if randomized within 24 h of intubation and estimated to survive and remain mechanically ventilated for 48 h or more. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was VAP measured among survivors at Day 14.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 709 patients were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug. The two groups were comparable at baseline except iseganan-treated patients were, on average, 3 yr older. The rate of VAP among survivors at Day 14 was 16% (45/282) in patients treated with iseganan and 20% (57/284) in those treated with placebo (p = 0.145). Mortality at Day 14 was 22.1% (80/362) in the iseganan group compared with 18.2% (63/347) in the placebo group (p = 0.206). No pattern of excess adverse events in the iseganan group compared with placebo was observed.

Conclusions

Iseganan is not effective in improving outcome in patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation.

### Adjunctive corticosteroids for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in patients with HIV infection [^114eEL7t]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) remains the most common opportunistic infection in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Among patients with HIV infection and PCP the mortality rate is 10% to 20% during the initial infection and this increases substantially with the need for mechanical ventilation. It has been suggested that corticosteroids adjunctive to standard treatment for PCP could prevent the need for mechanical ventilation and decrease mortality in these patients.

Objectives

To assess the effects of adjunctive corticosteroids on overall mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation in HIV-infected patients with PCP and substantial hypoxaemia (arterial oxygen partial pressure < 70 mmHg or alveolar-arterial gradient > 35 mmHg on room air).

Search Methods

For the original review we searched The Cochrane Library (2004, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1980 to December 2004) and EMBASE (January 1985 to December 2004) without language restrictions. We further reviewed the reference lists from previously published overviews, searched UptoDate version 2005 and Clinical Evidence Concise (Issue 12, 2004), contacted experts in the field and searched the reference lists of identified publications for citations of additional relevant articles. In this update of our review, we searched the above-mentioned databases in September 2010 and April 2014 for trials published since our original review. We also searched for ongoing trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP). We searched for conference abstracts via AEGIS.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that compared corticosteroids to placebo or usual care in HIV-infected patients with PCP in addition to baseline treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, pentamidine or dapsone-trimethoprim, and reported mortality data. We excluded trials in patients with no or mild hypoxaemia (arterial oxygen partial pressure > 70 mmHg or an alveolar-arterial gradient < 35 mmHg on room air) and trials with a follow-up of less than 30 days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two teams of review authors independently evaluated the methodology and extracted data from each primary study. We pooled treatment effects across studies and calculated a weighted average risk ratio of overall mortality in the treatment and control groups using a random-effects model. In this update of our review, we used the GRADE methodology to assess evidence quality.

Main Results

Of 2029 screened records, we included seven studies in the review and six in the meta-analysis. Risk of bias varied: the randomisation and allocation process was often not clearly described, five of seven studies were double-blind and there was almost no missing data. The quality of the evidence for mortality was high. Risk ratios for overall mortality for adjunctive corticosteroids were 0.56 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 0.98) at one month and 0.59 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.85) at three to four months of follow-up. In adults, to prevent one death, numbers needed to treat are nine patients in a setting without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) available, and 23 patients with HAART available. The three largest trials provided moderate quality data on the need for mechanical ventilation, with a risk ratio of 0.38 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.73) in favour of adjunctive corticosteroids. One study was conducted in infants, suggesting a risk ratio for death in hospital of 0.81 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.29; moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The number and size of trials investigating adjunctive corticosteroids for HIV-infected patients with PCP is small, but the evidence from this review suggests a beneficial effect for adult patients with substantial hypoxaemia. There is insufficient evidence on the effect of adjunctive corticosteroids on survival in infants.

An of ﬁ cial American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114dHS7A]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Summary of the evidence based on antifungal strategy — overall across eight RCTs, 978 critically ill patients received systemic antifungals versus 779 receiving placebo, with deaths of 183 (22.9%) and 173 (22.2%), respectively; the pooled risk ratio (RR) of death was 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86–1.23), the I2 value revealed no important heterogeneity with a P value of 0.90, and the absolute change in mortality was 7 more deaths per 1,000 (31 fewer to 51 more); certainty in the evidence was rated as low. In the antifungal prophylaxis subset of five RCTs, the pooled RR of death was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.77–1.27).

Implementation Considerations

A key consideration when determining whether prophylactic and/or empiric antifungals reduce mortality in the ICU is whether IC is driving mortality. Because of reporting biases, the true incidence of IC in the ICU is unclear; however, candidemia has been well studied. Mortality in an individual ICU patient with candidemia is reported to be as high as 10–47%; however, when factors such as age, disease severity, the presence of organ failure, and immunosuppression are accounted for, the attributable mortality is likely much lower. Although candidemia is more common in critically ill patients than in most other populations, the reported incidence is still relatively low: from 3.6 to 16.5 per 1,000 admissions. In a large study of 60,778 ICU admissions in nonneutropenic patients in the United Kingdom over a 2-year period, the incidence of IFI, consisting primarily of IC, was just 0.6%. When it did occur, IC was associated with a high rate of mortality. Simple risk models for predicting the development of IC were developed and incorporated into economic models to advise thresholds for initiating antifungal prophylaxis; however, because of the small number of outcomes, the certainty of these models was low. Thus, although it is relatively easy to identify ICU patients at risk of IC, the utility of prophylaxis remains unclear. To further complicate these decisions, ICU practices and the ICU environment are constantly evolving. Factors such as improved vascular access catheter management, more judicious use of total parenteral nutrition with a preference for enteral feeding, a greater focus on more appropriate use of antibiotics, and better surgical techniques may contribute to a decreased incidence of IC; thus, data produced 20 years ago may not apply to a modern ICU setting.

An of ﬁ cial American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114A8eRx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Rationale and evidence-to-decision considerations for combination therapy in IPA state that the panel issued a conditional recommendation for equipoise, that the RCT reported a higher incidence of hepatobiliary adverse events in the combination arm (12.7% vs. 8.4%) without a statistically significant difference and with similar treatment discontinuation rates, that no separate recommendation was issued for the salvage setting with extrapolation from primary therapy evidence, and that the recommendation is based exclusively on voriconazole-containing regimens with potential advantages of combining a triazole and echinocandin relating to limitations of voriconazole including resistance, variable pharmacokinetics with frequent subtherapeutic concentrations, and polymicrobial fungal infections.

An of ﬁ cial American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115qN5p3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In the ICU, the prescription of antifungals to prevent or treat IC requires consideration of risks associated with widespread antifungal administration. For the individual patient, antifungals may be associated with adverse effects and drug interactions. The panel was unable to assess adverse effects in this guideline iteration because of inconsistent reporting, but, reassuringly, echinocandins and fluconazole are generally better tolerated than mold-active azoles and AmB formulations. Increasingly, the influence of the gut mycobiome on maintenance of various aspects of human health and disease, particularly the gut bacterial microbiome assembly, is being appreciated and is likely perturbed by antifungal use. The sequelae of prophylactic and empiric antifungals on the gut mycobiome has not been studied. Beyond the individual, the epidemiology of Candida in ICUs is changing. Both the patient and the environment can be reservoirs of resistance, but it is not yet clear whether antifungal use is, at least in part, driving this change. In the United States, two-thirds of Candida isolates are non- albicans, with increasing incidence of Candida glabrata with increased minimum inhibitory concentrations to a triazole. The global threat of Candida auris, which is often resistant to all available antifungals, persists on environmental surfaces and is resilient to decontamination and requires close surveillance. Close surveillance of antifungal use, species causing IC, and fungal epidemiology within ICUs is required for early detection of associations and trends.

Additional approaches for preventing VAP and/or VAEs in adult patients

Additional approaches are interventions associated with lower VAP rates that that may also decrease VAE rates, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and/or mortality but carry some risk of harm. Additional approaches also include interventions that are associated with lower VAP rates, but insufficient data exist to determine their impact on objective outcomes. Hospitals can consider adopting additional approaches if their VAP or VAE rates do not improve despite high performance rates with essential practices.

The following interventions may decrease duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and/or mortality in some populations but not in others, and they may confer some risk of harm in some populations.

Consider using selective decontamination of the oropharynx and digestive tract to decrease microbial burden in ICUs with low prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Antimicrobial decontamination is not recommended in countries, regions, or ICUs with high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms (Quality of Evidence: HIGH). A meta-analysis of 6 cluster randomized trials performed in countries with low levels of antibiotic resistance reported that selective decontamination of the oropharynx with topical antibiotics was associated with a 16% reduction in hospital mortality, and decontamination of the oropharynx and digestive tract with a combination of topical, oral, and parenteral antibiotics was associated with an 18% reduction in hospital mortality. Selective digestive decontamination was more effective than selective oral decontamination alone (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82–0.97 for hospital death). A broader meta-analysis that included a larger but more heterogenous set of studies had similar findings. Oral agents that have been used for digestive decontamination include colistin, tobramycin, and amphotericin B. Parenteral agents include cefotaxime. ICUs that implement this practice should actively monitor its impact on antibiotic utilization, antimicrobial resistance, and Clostridioides difficile infections. There is no consensus on what constitutes "low levels of antibiotic resistance", but an arbitrary threshold that has been used by other guidelines and randomized trials is < 5% of bloodstream infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales. A cluster randomized trial of selective digestive decontamination (without parenteral antibiotics) versus selective oral decontamination versus oral care with 2% chlorhexidine versus routine care conducted in ICUs with high levels of antibiotic resistance (≥ 5% of bloodstream infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales) found no difference between study arms in ICU-acquired bloodstream infections or 28-day mortality rates. Selective oral and digestive decontamination with antibiotics is therefore not recommended in settings with high baseline levels of antibiotic resistance.

### Candidemia in the critically ill: initial therapy and outcome in mechanically ventilated patients [^111i4rnZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Candidemia is life-threatening in critically ill patients, with a crude 30-day mortality of approximately 50%. In our cohort, initial therapy with fluconazole was associated with better survival than therapy with echinocandins. Rapid initiation of antifungal therapy improves survival, but previous studies have not addressed initial treatment. PATH records actual clinical practice, includes a greater number of critically ill patients than other candidemia studies, and does not exclude patients for recent antifungal therapy, prophylaxis, or comorbidity. This registry thus may provide a truer picture of the treated population than do many controlled trials. Our findings may impact treatment decisions for these patients, particularly as they are inconsistent with recently promulgated recommendations for therapy.

Uniquely, our analysis focuses on initial therapy, considered key for other severe infections. For example, inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy for bloodstream infections and pneumonia is strongly associated with increased hospital mortality. Controlled trials of candidemia treatment have allowed as much as 48 hours of non-study antifungal therapy. Re-analysis of these trials cannot address this crucial early treatment period.

In clinical practice initial antifungal therapy cannot usually be directed by species. Germ tube analysis, a rapid test widely available during PATH registration, only determines whether a Candida is albicans. That day 1 was the most frequent day for switching from initial fluconazole therapy suggests changes were often made when it was determined that the pathogen was not albicans, since response to antifungal therapy could not have been reasonably assessed by that time. Consistent with this rationale, patients infected with parapsilosis were as likely to be switched from fluconazole as those with glabrata in the first days of therapy. Newer tests, such as peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA-FISH), have accelerated speciation in some centers, but the majority of patients with candidemia are started on therapy before the species is determined.

Initial therapy often differs from later tailored therapy, particularly if resistance is present. Some forms of resistance may not be relevant during early therapy; for example, fluconazole resistance in Candida glabrata is mediated by inducible enzymes that may not be expressed early in the course of treatment. Intrinsic Candida resistance to fluconazole is relatively rare, found in 9–15% of glabrata (25% of registry cases), and in krusei (fewer than 2% of cases), therefore impacting fewer than 5% of patients with candidemia overall. Resistance to both echinocandins and fluconazole has been reported from a large international survey of clinical Candida isolates.

### Approaches to antifungal therapy in the intensive care unit [^111G8aao]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

The risk of fungal infection is increasing in intensive care unit patients and the spectrum of pathogens is changing. A number of new antifungal agents are becoming available, but their use in critically ill patients has not been assessed in randomized controlled trials. Furthermore, distinguishing colonization from infection is problematic in intensive care unit patients. Clinicians who are involved in the management of intensive care unit patients must remain vigilant and devise a risk-based antifungal strategy that is based on local experience and susceptibility patterns.

What should be the next steps? The pandemic of severe COVID-19 has diminished, but seasonal influenza remains an issue, and other respiratory viruses may emerge or gain in virulence. The reasons why VAPA prevalence may exhibit such important variations across regions and even over time within a single center remain unclear. Although differential awareness and diagnostic algorithms likely play a role, environmental conditions and genetic predisposing factors should be investigated. The role of antifungal prophylaxis and the selection of patients at high risk qualifying for such an approach should be further investigated.

Until now, the core of the debate was about the distinction between true VAPA and colonization. The study by Vanderbeke and colleagues, despite its limitations, suggests that we should end this debate, as it showed that a substantial number of Aspergillus cases (with a positive mycological criterion) were in fact proven.

After a lot of efforts have been put into the elaboration of consensus definitions of VAPA, expert panels should now move to practical guidelines for the overall management of VAPA in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Because the emergence of mold infections in the ICU has become a reality, increased awareness is also expected to lead to an increase in antifungal drug use, with possible epidemiological shifts toward more resistant fungi, including more resistant Candida spp. that remain a major issue in this setting. In addition to management guidelines, epidemiological surveillance programs and antifungal stewardship policies will be needed.

### Candidemia in the critically ill: initial therapy and outcome in mechanically ventilated patients [^113MYzbh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

– Randomized controlled trials of therapy for candidemia in the critically ill have not evaluated initial therapy, considered critically important in the treatment of other types of infections.

– In a large, multicenter registry of fungal infections, mortality was lower among mechanically ventilated patients initially treated with fluconazole than among those treated with an echinocandin. These mortality differences persisted after adjusting for severity of acute and chronic illness.

– Currently published guidelines lean toward the use of echinocandins in the treatment of candidemia in critically ill patients. A large, randomized trial is justified to identify the optimal initial management of this population.

### Antifungal prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis in critically ill patients: an observational study [^1167TC45]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Antifungal prophylaxis group and control group

Assignment to antifungal prophylaxis was informed by our in-house recommendation, which recommended antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole or a similar mould active antifungal drug for every COVID-19 patient with acute respiratory failure admitted to the ICU. This recommendation was based on our experience with COVID-19-associated mould infections occurring before September 2020 and on frequent fungal resistance testing within our centre which revealed no case of azol resistance in Aspergillus spp. to date. This recommendation was first implemented at ICU 1 and later at ICU 2. However, the decision of administration of mould active antifungal prophylaxis largely relays on the treating intensivist allowing us to compare outcomes of patients with and without antifungal prophylaxis who were otherwise treated according to same medical standards. Treated patients and control patients were distributed among both intensive care units.

### Antifungal agents for preventing fungal infections in non-neutropenic critically ill patients [^116VMjsw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Invasive fungal infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients. Early institution of antifungal therapy is pivotal for mortality reduction. Starting a targeted antifungal therapy after culture positivity and fungi identification requires a long time. Therefore, alternative strategies (globally defined as 'untargeted antifungal treatments') for antifungal therapy institution in patients without proven microbiological evidence of fungal infections have been discussed by international guidelines. This review was originally published in 2006 and updated in 2016. This updated review provides additional evidence for the clinician dealing with suspicion of fungal infection in critically ill, non-neutropenic patients, taking into account recent findings in this field.

Objectives

To assess the effects of untargeted treatment with any antifungal drug (either systemic or nonabsorbable) compared to placebo or no antifungal or any other antifungal drug (either systemic or nonabsorbable) in non-neutropenic, critically ill adults and children. We assessed effectiveness in terms of total (all-cause) mortality and incidence of proven invasive fungal infections as primary outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to February 2015: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), and EMBASE (OVID). We also searched reference lists of identified studies and major reviews, abstracts of conference proceedings, scientific meetings and clinical trials registries. We contacted experts in the field, study authors and pharmaceutical companies as part of the search strategy.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (irrespective of language or publication status) comparing the use of untargeted treatment with any antifungal drug (either systemic or nonabsorbable) to placebo, no antifungal, or another antifungal agent in non-neutropenic critically ill participants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently applied selection criteria, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We resolved any discrepancies by discussion. We synthesized data using the random-effects model and expressed the results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals. We assessed overall evidence quality using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 22 studies (total of 2761 participants). Of those 22 studies, 12 were included in the original published review and 10 were newly identified. Eleven trials compared the use of fluconazole to placebo or no antifungal treatment. Three trials compared ketoconazole versus placebo. One trial compared anidulafungin with placebo. One trial compared caspofungin to placebo. Two trials compared micafungin to placebo. One trial compared amphotericin B to placebo. Two trials compared nystatin to placebo and one trial compared the effect of clotrimazole, ketoconazole, nystatin and no treatment. We found two new ongoing studies and four new studies awaiting classification. The RCTs included participants of both genders with wide age range, severity of critical illness and clinical characteristics. Funding sources from pharmaceutical companies were reported in 11 trials and one trial reported funding from a government agency. Most of the studies had an overall unclear risk of bias for key domains of this review (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data). Two studies had a high risk of bias for key domains. Regarding the other domains (blinding of participants and personnel, outcome assessment, selective reporting, other bias), most of the studies had a low or unclear risk but four studies had a high risk of bias. There was moderate grade evidence that untargeted antifungal treatment did not significantly reduce or increase total (all-cause) mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.09, P value = 0.36; participants = 2374; studies = 19). With regard to the outcome of proven invasive fungal infection, there was low grade evidence that untargeted antifungal treatment significantly reduced the risk (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.83, P value = 0.0001; participants = 2024; studies = 17). The risk of fungal colonization was significantly reduced (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.97, P value = 0.03; participants = 1030; studies = 12) but the quality of evidence was low. There was no difference in the risk of developing superficial fungal infection (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.29, P value = 0.24; participants = 662; studies = 5; low grade of evidence) or in adverse events requiring cessation of treatment between the untargeted treatment group and the other group (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.27, P value = 0.51; participants = 1691; studies = 11; low quality of evidence). The quality of evidence for the outcome of total (all-cause) mortality was moderate due to limitations in study design. The quality of evidence for the outcome of invasive fungal infection, superficial fungal infection, fungal colonization and adverse events requiring cessation of therapy was low due to limitations in study design, non-optimal total population size, risk of publication bias, and heterogeneity across studies.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate quality evidence that the use of untargeted antifungal treatment is not associated with a significant reduction in total (all-cause) mortality among critically ill, non-neutropenic adults and children compared to no antifungal treatment or placebo. The untargeted antifungal treatment may be associated with a reduction of invasive fungal infections but the quality of evidence is low, and both the heterogeneity and risk of publication bias is high. Further high-quality RCTs are needed to improve the strength of the evidence, especially for more recent and less studied drugs (e.g. echinocandins). Future trials should adopt standardized definitions for microbiological outcomes (e.g. invasive fungal infection, colonization) to reduce heterogeneity. Emergence of resistance to antifungal drugs should be considered as outcome in studies investigating the effects of untargeted antifungal treatment to balance risks and benefit.

### Candida in the respiratory tract secretions of critically ill patients and the impact of antifungal treatment: a randomized placebo controlled pilot trial (CANTREAT study) [^113rTsRt]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Candida spp. are frequently recovered from endotracheal secretions in critically ill patients suspected of having ventilator-associated pneumonia. Observational studies reported an association with worse clinical outcomes but the effect of antifungal therapy in these patients remains unclear. We designed this pilot study to assess the feasibility of a larger trial and to evaluate inflammatory profiles and clinical outcomes in these patients.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter pilot randomized trial of antifungal therapy in critically ill patients with a clinical suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia with positive airway secretion specimens for Candida spp. We also included an observational group without Candida spp. in their airway secretions. We measured recruitment rate, inflammatory and innate immune function profiles over time, and clinical outcomes.

Results

We recruited 60 patients into the randomized trial and 29 patients into the observational study. Markers of inflammation and all clinical outcomes were comparable between placebo and antifungal treatment group at baseline and over time. At baseline, plasma TNF-α levels were higher in patients with VAP and Candida compared to the observational group (mean ± SD) (21.8 ± 23.1 versus 12.4 ± 9.3 pg/ml, p = 0.02) and these patients had lower innate immune function as evidenced by reduced whole blood ex vivo LPS-induced TNF-α production capacity (854.8 ± 855.2 versus 1,559.4 ± 1,290.6 pg/ml, p = 0.01).

Conclusions

This study does not provide evidence to support a larger trial examining the efficacy of empiric antifungal treatment in patients with a clinical suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia and Candida in the endotracheal secretions. The presence of Candida in the lung may be associated with persistent inflammation and immunosuppression.

### Candidemia in the critically ill: initial therapy and outcome in mechanically ventilated patients [^111w5uCG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our study represents the largest investigation of initial antifungal therapy for candidemia in mechanically ventilated patients. The results favor fluconazole, contrasting with several recent recommendations and guidelines reflecting expert opinion but only limited clinical data. Despite the challenges, we believe a large, controlled clinical trial comparing fluconazole and an echinocandin as initial antifungal therapy for candidemia in the critically ill is warranted.

### Issues in the design and interpretation of antifungal drug trials in the critically ill [^1147Q31D]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Invasive fungal infections, such as invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis, are increasingly important in the critical care setting. This review will focus on clinical trials of antifungals in this setting and the methodological issues surrounding them.

Recent Findings

Critically ill patients have traditionally only comprised a fraction of the patients enrolled in clinical trials exploring antifungal use, but recently a few clinical trials with specific therapeutic approaches have focused on this subpopulation. Increased mortality and problems with diagnosis have fostered the development of new management strategies, such as prophylaxis, pre-emptive treatment, and empirical antifungal therapy.

Summary

Although there are limited data supporting preventive and early therapeutic strategies, their use is recommended in highly selected patients and settings. Although critically ill patients are under-represented in clinical trials of antifungals conducted for the purpose of licensing, most experts agree that it is reasonable to extrapolate from these data until specific trials are conducted.

### Prevention of severe Candida infections in nonneutropenic, high-risk, critically ill patients: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients treated by selective digestive decontamination [^116Sj3mE]. Intensive Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Infections caused by Candida spp. are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients and usually develop from endogenous colonization. We assessed the effectiveness of adding fluconazole to a selective digestive decontamination regimen to prevent candidal infections.

Design and Setting

We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among medical and surgical intensive care unit patients at a large university hospital.

Patients

All adult patients mechanically ventilated for at least 48 h with an expectation to remain so for at least an additional 72 h, and receiving selective decontamination of the digestive tract.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned fluconazole 100 mg daily (n = 103) or placebo (n = 101).

Measurements and Results

Candida infections occurred less frequently in the fluconazole group (5.8%) than in the placebo group (16%; rate ratio 0.35; Cl(95) 0.11–0.94). Some 90% of candidemia episodes occurred in the placebo group (rate ratio for fluconazole use 0.10; Cl(95) 0.02–0.74). The rate of treatment failure, development of candidal infection, or increased colonization, was 32% in the fluconazole group and 67% in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Crude in-hospital mortality was similar in the two groups (39% fluconazole vs. 41% placebo).

Conclusions

Prophylactic use of fluconazole in a selected group of mechanically ventilated patients at high risk for infection reduces the incidence of Candida infections, in particular candidemia.

### Short term Candida albicans colonization reduces Pseudomonas aeruginosa-related lung injury and bacterial burden in a murine model [^111VNdSB]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) occurs in a considerable proportion of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation and is associated with substantial morbidity, a two-fold increase in mortality rate, and excess cost. Tracheobronchial colonization (TBC) and duration of mechanical ventilation are the two most important risk factors for VAP. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most frequent causative microorganisms of VAP. Several studies have reported the presence of Candida species in the airway specimens of immunocompetent ventilated patients. Candida TBC occurs in 17% to 28% of ICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. Although the relationship between tracheal biofilm and VAP is based on one small observational study, P. aeruginosa is the most common pathogen retrieved from endotracheal tube biofilm in patients with VAP. P. aeruginosa and C. albicans coexist predominantly as biofilms rather than as free-floating (planktonic) cells on abiotic medical devices (catheters and prostheses).

The question of their interplay has been addressed by several experimental and clinical studies. So far, in vitro studies suggest that the interaction between C. albicans and P. aeruginosa is likely to be antagonistic. When mixing in vitro cultures, P. aeruginosa is involved in killing C. albicans filaments associated with biofilm formation. Additionally, quorum-sensing signaling molecules of P. aeruginosa impair C. albicans yeast-to-hyphae transition. The relative C. albicans hyphal-binding affinity within biofilm is reported to be lower for P. aeruginosa than for Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast, a synergistic relationship is described in vivo with a recent study showing that C. albicans TBC facilitates P. aeruginosa pneumonia occurrence in a rat model. A recent clinical study suggested an interaction between C. albicans and P. aeruginosa. The authors identified Candida spp. tracheobronchial colonization as an independent risk factor for P. aeruginosa pneumonia. No cause-and-effect relationship was demonstrated in that study. In addition, Candida spp. tracheobronchial colonization and P. aeruginosa pneumonia could both be a consequence of prior antibiotic treatment. Further, the median duration of mechanical ventilation in that study was 13 days. Therefore, the results could not be generalized to patients with shorter duration of mechanical ventilation. Another recent preliminary case-control study suggested that antifungal treatment might be associated with reduced risk for VAP or TBC related to P. aeruginosa, although no definite conclusion can be drawn from this observational retrospective single-center study including a small number of patients.

Empiric therapy for suspected invasive candidiasis in nonneutropenic intensive care unit patients: Empiric antifungal therapy should be considered in critically ill patients with risk factors for invasive candidiasis and no other known cause of fever and should be based on clinical assessment of risk factors, surrogate markers for invasive candidiasis, and/or culture data from nonsterile sites (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Empiric antifungal therapy should be started as soon as possible in patients who have the above risk factors and who have clinical signs of septic shock (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

### What is ventilator-associated pneumonia and why is it important? [^116BgErf]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Hospital-associated pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most common infections acquired among hospitalized patients. HAP is associated with excess mortality and increased medical care costs. The rise in HAP due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria has resulted in more common administration of inappropriate antimicrobial treatment, with an associated increased risk of hospital mortality. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) refers to HAP occurring in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. VAP is the most common nosocomial infection among patients with acute respiratory failure. Physicians treating patients with HAP and VAP should be aware of the predominant local pathogens associated with these infections and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. This will allow more appropriate initial antibiotic selection in order to optimize treatment regimens and clinical outcomes. Additionally, clinical strategies aimed at the prevention of HAP and VAP should be employed in all hospital settings caring for patients at risk for these infections.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111XZfkL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Candida isolated from the respiratory tract — antifungal treatment guidance and diagnostic notes: Growth of Candida from respiratory secretions usually indicates colonization and rarely requires treatment with antifungal therapy (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Isolation from the respiratory tract is commonly encountered in ICU or tracheostomy patients and almost always reflects colonization of the airways and not infection. Candida pneumonia and lung abscess are very uncommon, and only rarely after aspiration of oropharyngeal material has primary Candida pneumonia or abscess been documented. When Candida is isolated from respiratory samples in a severely immunosuppressed patient, this should trigger a search for evidence of invasive candidiasis. Although isolation from a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen can support the diagnosis, a firm diagnosis requires histopathological evidence of invasive disease.

Rationale and Evidence-to-Decision Considerations

The pooled RR from the eight included RCTs suggests little or no mortality benefit of systemic antifungal therapy when used as prophylaxis or as empiric therapy. The rationale for assessing mortality as the outcome of interest rather than IC was twofold. The first reason is that the purpose of prophylaxis or empiric antifungal therapy in critically ill patients is to prevent or treat IC as a contributor to mortality. The second reason is that within the reviewed and included studies, there was heterogeneity of definitions used for IC. In particular, Candida colonization was often reported as IC. The latter reflects the uncertainty and evolution of our understanding of IC over recent decades. For example, whereas the 2004 IDSA Invasive Candidiasis Treatment Guidelines recommended treatment of Candida isolated from the respiratory tract, more contemporary guidelines acknowledge this as a state of colonization rather than an etiology of infection. Although Candida colonization is a prerequisite for subsequent invasion, the two states are not synonymous, and progression from the former to the latter depends on various factors, including nutrient availability, the host microbiota, and immune defenses. Because of inconsistent or absent reporting in the included studies, the panel was unable to assess the potential harms of antifungal use, including drug side effects, the impact on the mycobiome, and risk of infection with resistant fungi. This uncertainty contributed to the issuance of a negative rather than neutral recommendation.

An of ﬁ cial American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^116nPeD2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Implementation considerations for intensive care unit (ICU) invasive candidiasis (IC) — incidence and mortality context: Mortality in an individual ICU patient with candidemia is reported to be as high as 10–47%; the reported incidence is still relatively low: from 3.6 to 16.5 per 1,000 admissions; in a large study of 60,778 ICU admissions in nonneutropenic patients in the United Kingdom over a 2-year period, the incidence of invasive fungal infection (IFI), consisting primarily of IC, was just 0.6%, and when it did occur, IC was associated with a high rate of mortality.

Table 4.
Characteristics of Studies Included in Question 2

We examined mortality outcome on the basis of the antifungal strategy used. Five placebo-controlled RCTs examined the impact of antifungal prophylaxis, totaling 441 patients in the intervention groups and 421 in the control group. Three RCTs examined fluconazole and two an echinocandin. Three RCTs were from a single center, and two were multicenter. Although all RCTs exclusively enrolled critically ill patients, some had other specific inclusion criteria, such as trauma or surgical patients, mechanically ventilated (MV) patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, MV patients receiving selective digestive decontamination (SDD), and patients with positivity of a clinical prediction rule for IC. The duration of antifungal prophylaxis varied from a defined duration of 14 days to ICU length of stay to development of IC. None of the RCTs designated mortality as a primary outcome; however, these data were extractable from the published articles. The study by Albert and colleagues was included in the prophylaxis rather than empiric category because the indication for empiric antifungals was ventilator-associated pneumonia in the presence of Candida isolated from the respiratory tract. Although Candida spp. are frequent colonizers of the respiratory tract, Candida pneumonia is rare and would require visualization of invasive forms of Candida on histopathologic examination of the lung parenchyma to confirm the diagnosis, which was not achieved in this study.

None of the eligible studies identified by our search examined preemptive therapy as per the definition used herein. In the trial by Ostrosky-Zeichner and colleagues, some patients were subjected to two different antifungal strategies: initial prophylaxis with either caspofungin or placebo with a permitted switch to open-label drug therapy for placebo recipients who developed proven or probable IC during follow-up. The authors termed such crossover therapy "preemptive". The panel considered this trial to be one of prophylaxis, and thus it was analyzed in that antifungal strategy category. On the basis of the definitions used herein, the "preemptive" therapy in this trial would be classified as either empiric (probable IC) or directed (proven IC) antifungal therapy. Recipients of open-label empiric antifungal therapy in this trial were not analyzable for the purposes of the present guideline, because there was no comparison group.

### Strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated events, and nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^111z2Jqn]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Approaches that are not recommended for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-associated event (VAE) prevention: Good-quality evidence suggests that these interventions neither lower VAP/VAE rates nor decrease duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, or mortality. For stress-ulcer prophylaxis, although it lowers the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, a meta-analysis of randomized trials suggested no impact on nosocomial pneumonia, length of stay, or mortality, and a large multicenter randomized trial of pantoprazole versus placebo in ICU patients reported no difference in pneumonia or mortality rates. For monitoring residual gastric volumes, monitoring for regurgitation and vomiting alone is as effective as including residual gastric volumes with regard to VAP rates, duration of mechanical ventilation, and mortality.

### The use of prophylactic fluconazole in immunocompetent high-risk surgical patients: a meta-analysis [^113Xqe6N]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

A pharmacoeconomic or cost-effectiveness analysis was not performed in the studies included in this meta-analysis. Based on the baseline risk of candidaemia of 4.5% in the placebo arm of this meta-analysis, the number of patients needed to treat is about 25 to prevent one episode of candidaemia. The cost of 200 mg fluconazole is about US$35 per day in Australia and Switzerland and a 2-week prophylactic course of fluconazole will therefore cost US$490 per patient. The cost to prevent one documented episode of candidaemia is estimated to be US$12,250, which is equivalent to 40% of the economic cost of an episode of candidaemia (US$30,000). Prophylactic fluconazole may therefore be potentially cost-effective and justified in some high-risk surgical patients if the candidaemia rate in the selected ICU is high despite optimising other preventive measures such as vigorous hand hygiene, central venous catheter care, and prudent antimicrobial use.

Emergence of resistant fungi with widespread use of a prophylactic antifungal agent is a concern even if the drug is cost-effective. Our results did not demonstrate an increase in the risk of colonisation with or infection with fluconazole-resistant fungi within the time frame of the clinical trials (mean = 29 months, median = 30 months, range = 12–60 months). Whether prophylactic fluconazole will select or induce emergence of fluconazole-resistant fungi in the longer term is still controversial and remains a major consideration before it can be recommended.

Limitations of the study

Meta-analyses are prone to bias. The quality of trials can affect the direction and magnitude of the treatment effect in meta-analyses. After excluding one study with unclear allocation concealment or double blinding, the direction and magnitude of the results of this meta-analysis remained unchanged. A funnel plot (Figure 6) showed that there was a possibility of a small publication bias, with a lack of small studies showing no effect on mortality with the use of prophylactic fluconazole.

Second, although the results of this meta-analysis were fairly consistent across the included studies, there were significant differences in the diagnoses of the patients and the study protocols, especially in the doses of fluconazole used. The optimal dose and route of administration of fluconazole as a prophylactic agent cannot be evaluated from these pooled studies.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia… [^113AZwMR]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia is defined as parenchymal lung infection occurring more than 48 hours after initiation of mechanical ventilation. This serves to differentiate this disorder from community-acquired pneumonia and highlights pathogenic features peculiar to mechanically ventilated patients. A recent multicenter European study1 has shown that pneumonia is now the most common infection acquired in the intensive care unit, and when acquired during mechanical ventilation it has an associated mortality of 24% to 71%. 2–10 A vast literature has accumulated concerning all facets of this disease, especially regarding the efficacy of available diagnostic methods and putative preventive measures.

A recent multicenter Canadian study16 evaluated 1014 mechanically ventilated patients and found the following independent predictors of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a primary diagnosis of burns, trauma, central nervous system disease, respiratory tract disease, or cardiac disease; witnessed aspiration; mechanical ventilation within the previous 24 hours; and use of paralytic agents. Two other important findings of this analysis are a rising daily risk for pneumonia until the fifth day of mechanical ventilation, with subsequent decline, and a protective effect of systemic antibiotic therapy. Empirical antibiotic medication selection should take into account risk factors, as outlined above, especially time of pneumonia onset.

Patients with late-onset pneumonia or risk factors should be covered with antibiotic drugs with acceptable antipseudomonal activity, including select fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, β-lactams with or without β-lactamase inhibitors, and third-generation cephalosporins, as well as imipenem, meropenem, and aztreonam. A traditional choice in this regard has been an extended spectrum β-lactam plus an aminoglycoside; however, newer agents also have excellent activity. Limited information suggests that piperacillin-tazobactam may be the preferred agent against high-risk organisms; one recent multicenter study91 comparing a combination of piperacillin-tazobactam plus amikacin with ceftazidime plus amikacin revealed a 2-fold higher rate of clinical and microbiologic failure with the ceftazidime-containing regimen.

High gastric pH is associated with increased numbers of gastric bacteria, 133–135 and pH-altering drugs are frequently administered to mechanically ventilated patients, potentially increasing the gastric bacterial burden.
