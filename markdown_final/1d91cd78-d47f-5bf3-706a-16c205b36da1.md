## Question

Can corticosteroids be used safely in hypertensive patients with inflammatory conditions?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether corticosteroids can be used safely in patients who have both hypertension and an inflammatory condition. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of evidence linking corticosteroids to hypertension. Then, I should verify dose-response thresholds and whether low-dose regimens are safer. Next, I will review guideline positions and practical monitoring requirements. After that, I need to consider patient-specific risk modifiers and drug–drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit framework and outline concrete prescribing and tapering recommendations with citations to support each point.

> Let me first confirm the strength of evidence. Multiple large observational cohorts in rheumatoid arthritis consistently show that glucocorticoid use is associated with incident hypertension, with hazard ratios around 1.17–1.44 after adjustment, and a clear dose–response signal emerging at or above 7.5 mg prednisone equivalent per day, whereas doses below 7.5 mg show smaller, often non-significant associations in some analyses [^55660568] [^9308abdb] [^ea0be719]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these are observational, so confounding by indication remains possible, but sensitivity analyses and consistent replication across datasets strengthen the inference that corticosteroids independently increase hypertension risk, particularly at higher doses [^55660568] [^9308abdb].

> Wait, let me verify the dose-response nuance. One pooled analysis of randomized trials with low-dose prednisone (≤ 7.5 mg/day) over 2 years found no significant increase in mean arterial pressure versus controls, suggesting that very low-dose, long-term regimens may have minimal blood pressure effects in RA populations, though weight gain still occurred and generalizability outside RA is uncertain [^b066f103]. I should double-check that this RCT signal does not negate the observational dose–response; in fact, it complements it by indicating that the risk is modest at very low doses and rises with higher daily exposure, which aligns with the cohort data showing significance at ≥ 7.5 mg/day [^55660568] [^9308abdb].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance to ensure my interpretation aligns with best practice. The FDA labeling for systemic corticosteroids repeatedly advises using the lowest effective dose and exercising caution in patients with hypertension due to sodium retention and edema, reinforcing a risk-aware approach rather than a blanket prohibition [^d34e4249] [^5518d656]. Specialty guidelines for IBD and endocrine societies similarly recommend baseline and periodic monitoring of blood pressure, glucose, lipids, and bone health when systemic steroids are used beyond brief courses, underscoring that safety is achievable with surveillance and dose minimization [^62caf162] [^8f636411].

> I will now examine mechanisms to ensure the clinical signal is biologically plausible. Glucocorticoids can promote sodium and water retention via mineralocorticoid receptor effects, increase vascular tone through altered vasoactive mediators (including reduced nitric oxide bioavailability and renin–angiotensin activation), and enhance sympathetic activity, all of which can raise blood pressure, particularly with higher doses or prolonged exposure [^980f1268] [^d8d15008]. Hold on, I should verify that modern synthetic glucocorticoids have less mineralocorticoid activity; yes, prednisone and methylprednisolone have relatively low mineralocorticoid potency, yet clinically meaningful blood pressure effects still emerge with dose and duration, indicating non-mineralocorticoid pathways contribute as well [^980f1268].

> Let me consider patient-specific modifiers that shift risk. Older age, higher baseline cardiovascular risk, diabetes, CKD, and concomitant NSAIDs or other pressor drugs amplify the likelihood of steroid-induced hypertension or resistance to therapy, so I need to ensure these are accounted for in shared decision-making and monitoring plans [^57615b69] [^d6dd83bb]. But wait, what if the inflammatory disease itself drives hypertension? Indeed, systemic inflammation is pro-hypertensive, so controlling disease activity with steroids may theoretically offset some cardiovascular risk even as steroids themselves raise blood pressure; this is a key balancing act that requires individualized judgment and, when possible, steroid-sparing strategies [^f2d703e2] [^40ca0244].

> Next, I should review practical safety measures. Before starting systemic steroids, I need to check baseline blood pressure, fasting glucose or HbA1c, lipids, weight/BMI, and bone health risk, then reassess blood pressure within 1–2 weeks of initiation and at each visit thereafter, escalating antihypertensive therapy promptly if readings rise [^62caf162] [^8f636411]. I should confirm that patients on diuretics are monitored for hypokalemia because steroids can worsen potassium losses, and I should consider MRAs in resistant cases, recognizing that spironolactone may not fully reverse glucocorticoid-induced hypertension even though it targets mineralocorticoid signaling [^980f1268] [^62caf162].

> Hold on, I should verify tapering and withdrawal principles because abrupt cessation can destabilize blood pressure and precipitate adrenal insufficiency. Guidelines advise tapering slowly, with larger decrements at higher doses and smaller decrements as physiologic ranges are approached, and to consider faster taper when uncontrolled hypertension or other serious steroid toxicities emerge, balancing disease flare risk against cardiovascular harm [^4dd55e29] [^8f636411]. I need to ensure patients understand sick-day rules and stress-dose steroids if they are on or recently tapered from prolonged courses, as HPA axis suppression can persist for months [^4dd55e29].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit answer. Yes, corticosteroids can be used in hypertensive patients with inflammatory disease, but safety is contingent on using the lowest effective dose, preferring short courses when feasible, and implementing proactive monitoring and blood pressure management. The absolute risk increase is modest at low doses and rises with higher daily exposure, and the cardiovascular consequences are nontrivial in chronic inflammatory diseases, so steroid-sparing agents should be pursued whenever possible [^55660568] [^9308abdb] [^f2d703e2]. I should double-check that this aligns with disease-specific guidance; indeed, in IBD, COPD, and autoimmune dermatologic conditions, experts emphasize minimizing steroid exposure and substituting steroid-sparing therapies to mitigate metabolic and cardiovascular harms, which supports a cautious, time-limited, and closely monitored approach in hypertensive patients [^4e2f62fc] [^6affc873] [^c262a081].

> Finally, I need to ensure concrete recommendations are clear. Use prednisone ≤ 7.5 mg/day when possible, limit duration to the shortest effective course, and avoid long-term maintenance unless absolutely necessary. Monitor blood pressure within 1–2 weeks of initiation and at every visit, intensify antihypertensives as needed, and consider MRAs or other fourth-line agents for resistance. In patients requiring repeated or prolonged steroids, prioritize steroid-sparing DMARDs or biologics and reassess the need for ongoing steroids regularly. Educate patients on sodium restriction, weight management, and symptom surveillance for edema, headache, and visual changes, and coordinate tapering plans to prevent withdrawal and disease flare [^62caf162] [^8f636411] [^4dd55e29]. If I initially thought "never use steroids in hypertension", wait, that overstates the evidence; the correct stance is to use them judiciously with dose minimization and vigilant monitoring, recognizing that the net clinical benefit in controlling inflammation may outweigh the modest blood pressure risk when managed proactively [^55660568] [^9308abdb].

Corticosteroids can be used in hypertensive patients with inflammatory conditions when **benefits outweigh risks** and **monitoring is in place**. Low-dose, short-term use is preferred, with close monitoring of blood pressure, weight, and electrolytes. If hypertension worsens, adjust antihypertensive therapy or taper the steroid. Long-term or high-dose steroids increase the risk of resistant hypertension and cardiovascular events, so use the lowest effective dose and consider steroid-sparing agents.

## Mechanisms of corticosteroid-induced hypertension

Corticosteroids raise blood pressure through **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Sodium retention**: Mineralocorticoid effects cause sodium and water retention, expanding plasma volume and raising blood pressure [^d34e4249].

- **Increased vascular sensitivity**: Enhanced responsiveness to catecholamines and angiotensin II increases vascular tone and resistance [^980f1268].

- **Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)**: Activation of RAAS further promotes sodium retention and vasoconstriction [^980f1268].

- **Nitric oxide deficiency**: Reduced NO bioavailability impairs vasodilation, contributing to hypertension [^1e95e0f2].

---

## Clinical evidence of corticosteroid-induced hypertension

Multiple studies and reviews document an **association between corticosteroids and hypertension**:

- **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**: Glucocorticoid use is associated with a 17% increased risk of incident hypertension; doses ≥ 7.5 mg/day significantly increase risk [^9308abdb] [^55660568].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Corticosteroid use is linked to increased hypertension risk, particularly with prolonged or high-dose therapy [^f346c200].

- **General population**: Even low-dose glucocorticoids (2.5–7.5 mg/day) are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, including hypertension [^9abe2468].

---

## Risk factors for corticosteroid-induced hypertension

Several factors **increase susceptibility** to steroid-induced hypertension:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Dose and duration | Higher doses and prolonged use markedly increase risk [^55660568] [^8f636411] |
| Age | Older adults are at higher risk due to reduced clearance and comorbidities [^57615b69] |
| Comorbidities | Pre-existing hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and renal impairment increase risk [^notfound] |
| Genetic predisposition | Family history of hypertension may increase susceptibility [^980f1268] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **cautious use and monitoring**:

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the minimal effective dose and taper when possible [^d34e4249] [^4dd55e29].

- **Monitoring**: Check blood pressure, weight, and electrolytes at each visit; monitor glucose and lipids periodically [^62caf162] [^8f636411].

- **Antihypertensive management**: Adjust existing therapy or add agents as needed; consider ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics [^notfound].

- **Steroid-sparing agents**: Prefer methotrexate, azathioprine, or biologics for maintenance to limit steroid exposure [^4e2f62fc] [^0d3485c0].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Untreated or poorly managed steroid-induced hypertension can lead to **significant complications**:

- **Cardiovascular events**: Increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure [^f2d703e2].

- **Renal impairment**: Chronic hypertension can accelerate renal dysfunction [^notfound].

- **Resistant hypertension**: Steroid-induced hypertension may be refractory to standard therapy, requiring multidrug regimens [^d6dd83bb].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management **requires a multidisciplinary approach**:

- **Baseline assessment**: Document blood pressure, weight, glucose, lipids, and electrolytes before starting steroids [^62caf162] [^8f636411].

- **Regular monitoring**: Track blood pressure, weight, and electrolytes at each visit; adjust therapy as needed [^62caf162] [^4f6fcfc0].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Sodium restriction, weight management, and alcohol moderation [^notfound].

- **Pharmacologic interventions**: Add or adjust antihypertensives; consider ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics [^notfound].

- **Steroid-sparing strategies**: Use immunomodulators or biologics to minimize steroid exposure [^4e2f62fc] [^0d3485c0].

---

## Alternative therapies

When steroid-induced hypertension is significant or persistent, consider **alternatives**:

- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: Use cautiously due to gastrointestinal and renal risks [^bf1d2186].

- **Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)**: Methotrexate, azathioprine, and biologics can reduce steroid dependence [^4e2f62fc] [^0d3485c0].

- **Local or topical steroids**: Minimize systemic exposure when feasible [^ecfa9b82].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Corticosteroids can be used in hypertensive patients with inflammatory conditions when **benefits outweigh risks**, with **close monitoring and dose minimization**. Use the lowest effective dose, monitor blood pressure and metabolic parameters regularly, and escalate antihypertensive therapy as needed. Prefer steroid-sparing agents for maintenance and reserve systemic steroids for short-term control or refractory disease.

### Safety of glucocorticoids-clinical trials [^e82954bc]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical trials published over the last 5 years support the main conclusion of a comprehensive review on glucocorticoid safety published in 2006: there is little if any solid evidence to support the fear that low-dose glucocorticoids are associated with significant toxicity when used appropriately in inflammatory rheumatic diseases. In fact, most of the recent randomised-controlled research underlines the influence of the underlying inflammatory process in the occurrence of 'adverse events' such as osteoporosis, fractures, hypertension and glucose intolerance. This 'confounding by indication' is inherent to the field and questions the validity of the observational data, that seems to drive currently common concepts about low-dose glucocorticoid toxicity. Decisive conclusions cannot, in any case, be achieved at this stage because the clinical trials available are of limited duration and dimension and have not been designed specifically to address toxicity. Toxicity with low-dose glucocorticoids needs to be kept under careful clinical surveillance while we expect such trials to be produced. Meanwhile, the risks of stopping these medications, even on longstanding well controlled disease, need also to be considered, as underlined by withdrawal trials recently published.

Adverse Effects of Long-term Glucocorticoid Therapy

While glucocorticoids are highly effective agents in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, they can cause adverse reactions, particularly when administered at high doses and/or for a prolonged period. However, even relatively low dose (in the range of physiologic daily dose equivalent), long-term glucocorticoid therapy is linked to a range of adverse outcomes. For instance, a British cohort study involving 9387 patients with rheumatoid arthritis observed over a median of 8 years (with an average prednisone dosage of 5.8 mg/day for approximately 9.5 months) exhibited elevated rates of conditions such as diabetes, osteoporosis, fractures, hypertension, thrombotic events, gastrointestinal complications, and increased mortality, compared to those not treated with glucocorticoids. Of note, these observations may be confounded by the underlying disease severity. Additional studies have corroborated these findings, linking even low dose glucocorticoid use (prednisone 2.5–7.5 mg/day) to increased risks of cardiovascular disease, severe infections, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis and fractures, and increased overall mortality with concurrent type 2 diabetes mellitus. While the absolute risk elevations were relatively modest, the implications are significant given the extensive patient population exposed to low dose glucocorticoids.

EFFECT OF MEDICATIONS USED IN IRD ON CV RISK

Medications used in the treatment of IRDs have the potential to further alter ASCVD risk. DMARDs are the cornerstone of treatment of inflammatory arthritis, aiming to control systemic inflammation leading to improvement in symptoms and prevention of joint and extra-articular damage. Corticosteroids and NSAIDs are typically used either as bridging therapy for short-term effects or together with DMARDs for control of symptoms and disease activity. Over the past two decades, a variety of targeted biologic and synthetic DMARD therapies have been approved for the management of rheumatic conditions. Despite effective control of inflammation, research has shown that different therapies have differential effects on CV risk. While medications such as systemic corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and some DMARDs, like leflunomide, may contribute to an increased CV risk, others, like methotrexate and anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) therapies, have been shown to have cardioprotective effects. Corticosteroid use is associated with a variety of adverse CV effects including HTN, premature atherosclerosis, risk of MI, arrhythmias, and HF. However, observational studies in RA suggested that low-dose prednisone (< 5 mg daily) used as maintenance therapy does not increase CV risk. Use of both nonselective and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2)-selective NSAIDs have been found to increase the risk of CV events. A number of studies, including a large nationwide Danish cohort study, have found that the CV risk associated with NSAID use in RA patients was significantly lower than in non-RA patients, possibly related to potential inflammatory mechanisms shared between RA and CV disease or better pain control and subsequent increase in mobility. Tofacitinib, a targeted synthetic DMARD that inhibits Janus Kinase (JAK), has been linked to higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) compared to anti-TNF therapy among patients with RA with a higher CV risk. In the ORAL surveillance study, a safety, non-inferiority trial mandated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), patients with RA aged ≥ 50 years who had at least 1 CV risk factor were randomized to tofacitinib or to a TNF inhibitor. The study showed that the risk of developing MACE and venous thromboembolism was higher in those on tofacitinib than TNF inhibitors, thus failing its non-inferiority criteria. This study led to the addition of a label warning by regulatory agencies, including Health Canada and the FDA, assigned to all JAK inhibitors for all clinical indications. A number of anti-inflammatory medications including canakinumab (anti-IL 1b) have been shown in randomized controlled trials to be effective in secondary prevention of ASCVD events in the general population, but efficacy and safety with regards to CVD outcomes in IRD have not been studied. Finally, medications such as the antimalarial drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, can have both important cardioprotective as well as uncommon, but potentially life-threatening cardiotoxic side effects in a small number of patients who develop cardiomyopathy, typically with long-term use.

Introduction

Glucocorticoids are recommended in the management of sepsis because they help to downregulate the excessive pro-inflammatory response, while preserving innate immunity. Nonetheless, there is no consensus regarding the type of steroid, dose, or treatment duration, due to the different causes of sepsis evaluated, age, and comorbidities of the patients, as well as the use of adjunctive therapies and their inflammatory profile. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SCC) published recommendations for COVID-19, suggesting a short course of systemic steroids for adults with severe or critical disease, with preference for dexamethasone over other corticosteroids (6 mg/day for a maximum of 10 days), based on previous recommendations for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. The Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) Trial aimed to test this recommendation in hospitalized patients. They found improvement in mortality and mechanical ventilation rates; however, this was limited to patients under invasive mechanical ventilation or those who required oxygen through invasive or not invasive ventilation. However, in this trial, important clinical information of the patients' characteristics was lacking. Nonetheless, this recommendation became mainstay for the treatment of severe COVID-19 worldwide in the second half of 2020, considering also that other promising therapies failed to prove efficacy and vaccines were not available for the general population yet.

The routine use of corticoids in severe respiratory diseases has been questioned by other authors. Steroid use should be tailored to the patient's needs, along with a careful and dynamic clinical evaluation to limit their adverse effects. Important acute adverse events, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, electrolyte disturbances, susceptibility to secondary infections, arrhythmias, gastric ulcer formation, and bleeding, and even psychosis may complicate the evolution of severe COVID-19 patients. Concerns have also risen because of contradictory results in different ethnicities, ages, and comorbidities. Clinical evidence in patients with previous use of steroids or with metabolic comorbidities is scarce. – Endocrine guidelines warn about adrenal suppression in any patient who used prednisolone 7.5 mg per day for 90 days or more or its equivalent (675 mg), which may affect long-term outcomes, and it can be related with post-COVID-19 syndrome, hyperpigmentation, hypotension, hypoglycemia, or recurrent shock. However, the number of patients that may be at risk of these complications has not been described

Oral corticosteroids in urticaria — short-term risk and monitoring — note that adverse effects such as adrenal suppression and bone/growth effects are unlikely with short-term use (< 2 weeks), and patients receiving oral corticosteroid therapy should be clinically monitored for response to therapy, side effects, and effects on comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes.

### Short term use of oral corticosteroids and related harms among adults in the United States: population based cohort study [^35eb00f7]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that have been used to treat a variety of diseases for over seven decades, dating back to their introduction for rheumatoid arthritis in 1949. A strong driver of corticosteroid use is the potent symptomatic relief they give many patients. Yet long term use of corticosteroids is generally avoided, given the risks of serious acute complications such as infection, venous thromboembolism, avascular necrosis, and fracture, as well as chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosis, and other features of iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome. Indeed, corticosteroids are one of the most common reasons for admission to hospital for drug related adverse events, and optimizing their long term use has been a major focus for clinical guidelines across diverse specialties for many years.

In contrast with long term use, however, the risk of complications from short term use is much less understood, and evidence is generally insufficient to guide clinicians. In the outpatient setting, brief courses of oral corticosteroids are often used to treat conditions with clearly defined inflammatory pathophysiology for which there is clinical consensus for efficacy, such as asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Yet anecdotally corticosteroids are also used often in the short term to treat many other prevalent conditions where evidence is lacking, such as non-specific musculoskeletal pain and rashes. Despite such pervasive indications for use of oral corticosteroids, little is known about the prescribing patterns of short term use of these drugs in the general adult population, or their potential harm.

In this study we characterized short term use of oral corticosteroids in a contemporary outpatient population, and the risk of acute adverse events. We describe those who use oral corticosteroids in the short term in an outpatient setting and then report (absolute) incidence rates of adverse events in users and non-users. We chose three acute events listed as adverse events on the Food and Drug Administration mandated drug label for oral corticosteroids (sepsis, venous thromboembolism, fracture). Given the inherent challenges related to confounding, we employed a self controlled case series (SCCS) design. This design has been used to examine drug and vaccine safety. Using this method, each individual serves as his or her own control allowing for comparisons of adverse event rates during periods after exposure to corticosteroids versus rates during periods when not exposed.

### Glucocorticoid use is associated with an increased risk of hypertension [^ea0be719]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study found that GC use was associated with incident hypertension in patients with RA, and in particular doses > 7.5 mg were associated with hypertension. There was an incidence rate of 64.1 per 1000 pyrs. BP was not frequently monitored in primary care and a large proportion of RA patients on GCs with high BP readings were untreated. Given that patients with RA are already at increased risk of CV disease, it is important that these patients should have their BP checked regularly and treated appropriately.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^0d3485c0]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The advent of modern disease‐modifying biologic therapies for the treatment of a diverse array of medical conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and asthma, offers the prospect of significantly reducing the need for long‐term systemic corticosteroid therapy and its attendant adverse effects (AEs). In the field of asthma, treatments targeting inflammatory mediators such as immunoglobulin E (IgE) (omalizumab), interleukin (IL)‐4 and IL‐13 (dupilumab), and IL‐5 (mepolizumab, reslizumab) or its receptor (benralizumab) have proved particularly effective in delivering disease control for severe asthma. Thus, although corticosteroids retain an important role in the management of acute exacerbations, the long‐held belief that a subgroup of patients with the most severe disease will inevitably require maintenance therapy with oral corticosteroids (OCS) is being increasingly questioned.

Important challenges remain, however, since the move away from long‐term OCS therapy needs to be delivered effectively and safely. For example, many patients who might benefit from biologic therapies remain unknown to specialist asthma services and continue to receive treatment with OCS at dosages that put them at significant risk of adverse sequelae (e.g. hyperglycaemia/diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, premature cardiovascular disease [CVD], osteopenia/osteoporosis and cataracts). Equally important, for those successfully treated with OCS‐sparing biologics, there remains the issue of how best to safely wean off long‐term corticosteroid therapy. Secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI) following exposure to supraphysiologic exogenous corticosteroids is common, yet under‐recognized. Too rapid weaning and/or inappropriate cessation of physiologic equivalent dosages in those with hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis suppression is often associated with impaired well‐being and may be life‐threatening in the event of an adrenal crisis.

Here, we consider why AI should be an important consideration for any asthma patient transitioning from long‐term OCS therapy in the era of biologics and we examine the available evidence to guide safe OCS withdrawal.

Discussion

Our study shows that the use of steroids in severe COVID-19 benefits only a group of patients and only at the same doses proposed by the RECOVERY trial. This group represents the extreme of the disease spectrum, where patients were older (59 years) than the mean age for infection reported for our country (46.47 ± 15.62 years). The patient in our cohort had other risk factors for hospitalization, such as high frequencies of diabetes and hypertension (around 40% for each disease); greater than 40% had some degree of obesity and kidney, lung, or heart disease; or a previous neoplasia was also common. The comorbidities that were diagnosed at hospital admission for COVID-19 were 69 cases of diabetes, 20 of hypertension, 35 of hyperlipidemia, and 16 of heart disease. The group that died had a greater number of poor prognostic factors for COVID-19, including an adverse biomarker profile in which use of steroids and other treatments was not enough to counteract their inflammatory status. The group that benefited most from the careful use of steroids were the youngest and with better laboratory profiles. Special attention to steroid management should be paid to patients receiving accumulated doses equivalent to 675 mg of prednisolone or higher, which represented 3.4% of the group and those with previous use of steroids for chronic diseases (11.1%) or comorbidities that may be affected by routine steroid use.

Corticoids are suggested in sepsis and septic shock for their unique anti-inflammatory profile; however, there is not a single steroid or dose that has been proven to be superior to any other in critically ill patients. The preferential use of hydrocortisone infusions by critical care specialists is related to its short half-life and the possibility to stop the infusion if necessary, while dexamethasone is a powerful glucocorticoid with a simple posology but lacks mineralocorticoid effects. Patient selection and treatment tailoring is mainstay to achieve the indented results and avoid serious adverse effects, which must be routinely evaluated considering their different potencies and effects, accumulated doses, and half-life. High accumulated doses have been associated with diabetes, hypertension, and acute liver injury, among other acute and chronic side effects that affect the long-term survival of critically ill patients.

### Glucocorticoid treatment and cardiovascular disease [^570b8df2]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

The propensity of glucocorticoids to produce hyperglycaemia, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and central obesity has long been a cause for concern among physicians regarding possible adverse cardiovascular events. Should heart failure be added to this list of concerns?

### Use of nonopioid analgesics and adjunctive agents in the management of pain in rheumatic diseases [^bf1d2186]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Antirheumatic analgesic medications generally fall into one of the following categories: acetaminophen, corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tramadol, traditional opioids, or adjunctive analgesics. This article does not discuss corticosteroids, opioids, or topical analgesics. Acetaminophen, usually indicated early for mild pain, is often used in combination with other drugs. It has established safety. Traditional NSAIDs are effective in relieving moderate pain in certain inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions. There are many effective choices, but as a class it is fraught with the risk of serious peptic ulcer disease and its complications. Cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitors are NSAIDS that reduce the gastrointestinal risk and platelet-mediated bleeding. All NSAIDs may produce peripheral edema, hypertension, and potentiate warfarin. The evidence that coxibs cause thrombotic heart disease is weak. Tramadol is an alternative to musculoskeletal pain management, particularly in patients with moderate to moderately severe pain who do not respond to or who cannot tolerate acetaminophen, NSAIDs, or opioids. The role of analgesic adjuvants is discussed.

5.2.8.5 Other metabolic complications of corticosteroids

Good Practice Recommendation 19. Patients on prolonged corticosteroids should have blood pressure, glycaemic control and serum potassium monitored. They should receive vaccinations as for those on immunomodulatory therapy (Agreement: 82.6%).

Before starting oral corticosteroid therapy for 3 months or longer or repeating oral steroids within 6 months of a previous course, record height, weight, blood pressure, full blood count, fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c and lipids. Blood pressure and BMI should be measured at every clinic visit. For patients with dyslipidaemia or a raised cardiovascular risk at initiation, repeat a lipid profile 1 month after initiation and then every 3–6 months. Monitor fasting glucose or HbA1c every 3 months. An annual examination by an ophthalmologist is required for patients with symptoms of cataracts, a personal or family history of open angle glaucoma, diabetes mellitus, high myopia or connective tissue disease (particularly rheumatoid arthritis). Mood disturbance such as depression or sleep disturbance should be questioned at every clinic visit. Steroids may exacerbate the potassium-lowering effects of thiazide or loop diuretics, and potassium should be monitored. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is a serious complication of prolonged steroid use, and if hip pain develops should be considered, and if suspected urgent MRI is recommended along with cessation of steroids. Patients on long-term steroids should be vaccinated as for those on immunosuppressive therapy (see Section 5.2.1.3: Common Disease Considerations, Immunosuppressive therapy, Vaccination).

### Treatment of patients with hypertension and arthritis pain: new concepts [^c13bbf32]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Arthritis pain often occurs concurrently with hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors. Treating patients with hypertension who have arthritis and other painful conditions can be a challenge because of potential risks associated with the agents commonly used to treat pain and inflammation. Hypertension is associated with endothelial dysfunction and decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO). Naproxcinod, an investigational drug, is the first in a new class of agents called cyclooxygenase-inhibiting NO donators. They differ from traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in their ability to donate NO, a signaling molecule known to have potentially beneficial effects on the vasculature and the gastrointestinal tract. Naproxcinod, by donating NO, offers a therapeutic option that might mitigate the negative blood pressure effects and adverse gastrointestinal effects associated with traditional arthritis therapies. This article reviews some preliminary preclinical and clinical studies of key safety data of an investigational new NO-donating anti-inflammatory agent.

Adverse effects of long-term glucocorticoid therapy include higher event rates in exposed rheumatoid arthritis cohorts and risks even at low doses; a British cohort study involving 9387 patients with rheumatoid arthritis observed over a median of 8 years with an average prednisolone dose of 5.8 mg/day for approximately 9.5 months exhibited elevated rates of diabetes, osteoporosis, fractures, hypertension, thrombotic events, gastrointestinal complications, and increased mortality compared to those not treated with glucocorticoids, and studies have linked even low dose use (prednisone 2.5–7.5 mg/day) to increased risks.

### Glucocorticoid use is associated with an increased risk of hypertension [^9308abdb]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study found that GC use was associated with a 17% overall increased risk of hypertension in patients with incident RA and without hypertension at RA diagnosis. When GC use was stratified by dose categories, doses < 7.5 mg were not found to be associated with hypertension, indicating that low doses were less of a concern, although the point estimates were in the direction of increased risk for all categories of GC dose. There was no clear pattern seen for cumulative dose, but this may be due to the nature of the measure itself, as a small cumulative dose may represent a person prescribed a low dose for a long period or a person prescribed a high dose for a short period, making it difficult to draw conclusions in terms of the entire exposed period. Additionally, 40% of patients prescribed GCs with hypertension (defined by consecutive high SBP or DBP readings) were not prescribed an antihypertensive at any point during the study duration. Whilst some may have been offered lifestyle advice, left untreated this has important implications in terms of addressing modifiable risk factors in an RA population already at increased risk of CV disease.

Differences in the frequency of BP measurement by GC exposure were not seen, providing reassurance that surveillance bias does not explain the findings. Importantly, around 30% of the cohort did not have their BP measured during the first 2 years after diagnosis. EULAR recommends monitoring and treatment of CV risk factors in RA and hypertension in GC-treated patients. This study highlights that this may not be the case overall in RA with regards to monitoring and treating high BP in primary care. Given this finding, it is important for primary care physicians (and rheumatologists) to be aware that GCs increase the risk of hypertension, and to monitor patients' BP more vigilantly while GCs are prescribed.

Previous studies

These results concur with a single-centre cross-sectional study, where long-term (< 6 months use) medium dose (≤ 7.5 mg) prednisolone was associated with hypertension, and a study of patients in a German registry where patients who were prescribed GC doses > 7.5 mg for > 6 months had higher proportions of self-reported 'increase in blood pressure'. However, our results do not concur with another study that used CPRD data to investigate adverse effects associated with GC use, including hypertension. They did not find an association between GC use and hypertension; however, only a Read code was used to identify hypertension, so cases may have been missed and may explain why their results were different from this study.

### Long-term risk of steroid-induced ocular hypertension / glaucoma with topical prednisolone acetate 1% after descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty [^e9033c81]. Cornea (2024). Medium credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay for short-term control of postoperative ocular inflammation, long-term treatment of ocular conditions involving immune hyperreactivity, and long-term prevention and treatment of immunologic rejection of corneal grafts (off-label use). The principal drawbacks, particularly with long-term use, include both cataract formation and steroid-induced ocular hypertension with the potential for steroid-induced glaucoma, which can cause irreversible vision loss. The incidence varies with the type of corticosteroid, dosing frequency, and treatment duration.

Corneal transplantation offers a unique opportunity to assess how long-term corticosteroid use affects intraocular pressure (IOP) without the confounding effects seen with immune hyperreactivity disorders. Surveys of corneal surgeons have found that all use topical corticosteroids to prevent transplant rejection and that most prefer prednisolone acetate 1% solution. In a recent review of glaucoma in endothelial keratoplasty patients, the longest reported follow-up was 3 years. The purpose of this study was to quantify longer-term risk of steroid-induced ocular hypertension/glaucoma with long-term use of topical prednisolone acetate.

### Corticosteroids for tuberculous pleurisy [^91253bb7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Description of the intervention

Corticosteroids are hormones produced by the adrenal cortex which have a variety of physiological functions, including carbohydrate metabolism, protein catabolism, regulation of electrolytes, the stress response and control of inflammation. Corticosteroids induce their anti‐inflammatory effect through the regulation of gene expression in cells, leading to increased expression of genes which inhibit inflammatory pathways, and repression of genes encoding pro‐inflammatory proteins (Barnes 2006). Multiple synthetic forms of these hormones have been produced and are used in the treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory conditions. Prednisolone is a synthetic corticosteroid derived from cortisol, and prednisone is a pro‐drug that is converted into the active form prednisolone by the liver. Several formulations of each drug are used for different conditions and diseases; in TB pleurisy patients are usually offered them in tablet form.

Corticosteroids have been used in medicine for many decades, and have well‐characterised adverse effect profiles. Adverse effects for medium to long‐term use include hyperglycaemia, hypertension, increased risk of infection, osteoporosis, gastric ulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding, thinning of the skin, proximal myopathy, psychiatric symptoms, and development of moon face, striae and acne (Cushing's syndrome). The use of synthetic corticosteroids can induce adrenocorticoid insufficiency, and so patients receiving more than one week's treatment must have the dose slowly reduced to avoid acute adrenal insufficiency causing hypotension and hypoglycaemia which can be life‐threatening (BNF 2016).

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad? [^980f1268]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertension

There is an established association between hypertension and the use of oral GCs. The risk factors predisposing to GC-induced hypertension are unclear and have not been examined in the same depth as GC-induced hyperglycemia. However, the duration of exposure and daily dosage are thought to be important, as well as a family history of essential hypertension.

The mechanisms underpinning GC-induced hypertension are complex and still not completely understood. It has previously been thought that the MC effects of GCs were the main drivers to the development of hypertension. However, there is emerging evidence to suggest that this may not be the case. The MC action of most commonly prescribed synthetic glucocorticoids is much lower than that of endogenous cortisol. Furthermore, the administration of spironolactone, an MR antagonist, does not prevent or control GC-induced hypertension. Sodium intake also does not appear to contribute to blood pressure change in patients taking GCs. However, there is evidence supporting a role in GCs driving alterations in vasoactive substances impacting on the balance between vasoconstriction and vasodilation (including catecholamines, nitric oxide, and atrial natriuretic peptide) as well as activation of the renin-angiotensin system activation and causing cardiac hypercontractility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — ATAD vs no ATAD: In people with AERD, the guideline panel suggests ATAD rather than no ATAD (conditional recommendation based on moderate certainty of evidence). The benefit of ATAD is moderate and is balanced by the risk of adverse effects that can lead to discontinuation. Decision factors include risks that impact the safety of performing an aspirin desensitization such as severe poorly controlled asthma; risks that impact safety of long-term aspirin use such as conditions or treatments that increase bleeding risk, such as age, male, low weight or BMI, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, prednisone use, or previous GI or intracranial bleed; that biologics may be preferred over ATAD in AERD for patients who have increased risk of harms with ATAD or who are avoiding a strict daily oral medication regimen and its associated desensitization procedure; and that patients intolerant to NSAIDs who require an NSAID for alternative indications (eg, cardiovascular disease) may prefer ATAD over other options.

Table 3

In the past, GTPS was commonly treated with corticosteroid injection; however, a recent study suggests that the most effective long-term treatment is hip abductor strengthening in addition to management of any contributing underlying musculoskeletal conditions, such as gluteal tendinopathy. As discussed earlier, only 20% of GTPS cases have inflammatory pathology, thus corticosteroids would be expected to provide relief to this small subset of patients. Even in these patients the effect will likely only be temporary if the underlying biomechanical etiology is not also addressed. Furthermore, corticosteroids should be used with caution in older adults because of their well-known systemic side effects such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, increased appetite, edema, immune suppression, behavior and sleep alterations, and, with frequent repeated use, hormonal and bone density effects. Evidence has demonstrated that corticosteroid injections are also toxic to local tenocytes and can potentially contribute to progressive tendonopathy and partial tears.

### Cancer therapy-related hypertension: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^b2b64e4f]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Contemporary anticancer drugs have significantly improved cancer survival at the expense of cardiovascular toxicities, including heart disease, thromboembolic disease, and hypertension. One of the most common side effects of these drugs is hypertension, especially in patients treated with vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, as well as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors. Adjunctive therapy, including corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, as well as anti-androgen hormone therapy for prostate cancer, may further increase blood pressure in these patients. Cancer therapy-induced hypertension is often dose limiting, increases cardiovascular mortality in cancer survivors, and is usually reversible after interruption or discontinuation of treatment. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying hypertension are unclear, but recent discoveries indicate an important role for reduced nitric oxide generation, oxidative stress, endothelin-1, prostaglandins, endothelial dysfunction, increased sympathetic outflow, and microvascular rarefaction. In addition, genetic polymorphisms in vascular endothelial growth factor receptors are implicated in vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor-induced hypertension. Diagnosis, management, and follow-up of cancer therapy-induced hypertension follow national hypertension guidelines because evidence-based clinical trials specifically addressing patients who develop hypertension as a result of cancer therapy are currently lacking. Rigorous baseline assessment of patients before therapy is started requires particular emphasis on assessing and treating cardiovascular risk factors. Hypertension management follows guidelines for the general population, although special attention should be given to rebound hypotension after termination of cancer therapy. Management of these complex patients requires collaborative care involving oncologists, cardiologists, hypertension specialists, primary care professionals, and pharmacists to ensure the optimal therapeutic effect from cancer treatment while minimizing competing cardiovascular toxicities.

### Strategies for improving the management of immune-related adverse events [^2ed312cf]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Optimizing the choice of immunosuppressive agents

Current guidelinesrely heavily on the use of steroids for management of irAEs. The duration of steroid use and cumulative dose are usually much greater for management of irAEs compared with other clinical indications for corticosteroid use. However, long-term use of steroids gives rise to several concerns.

Though the recommendation is to continue steroids until resolution of an irAE to grade 1 or better and subsequently taper the dose over a period of 4–6 weeks, efficacy of long-term steroid use in management of irAEs has not been validated. In contrast, when oral methylprednisolone was used as a 5-day tapered dose pack (steroid burst) for mild irAEs, all patients had recurrent grade 2 irAEs. Thus, the optimal dose and duration of steroid use with minimal risk of side effects in the management of irAEs are unknown.
Long-term steroid use may be associated with other complications, such as gastritis, hypertension, new-onset hyperglycemia, and opportunistic infections (eg, pneumocystis pneumonia).

### A different look at corticosteroids… [^ee965a4f]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

6 Management has always been supportive, using humidification, oxygen and racemic epinephrine. 7 The anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids were theorized to be useful in the treatment of croup. Corticosteroids have been studied in the management of croup for the past 30 years, but their use in this condition is controversial. Documented benefits of corticosteroid therapy in patients with PCP include reduced morbidity and mortality, decreased need for mechanical ventilation assistance and a reduced long-term decline in pulmonary function or exercise tolerance. 16 In addition, studies suggest that steroids may decrease the severity of toxic side effects, such as fever and rash associated with the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the primary anti-pneumocystis treatment. 15, 17 This benefit may enable the patient to complete the required course of antibiotic therapy.

Progression of other opportunistic infections associated with HIV infection as a result of the immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids is a risk that must be considered. While some studies report only minor complications associated with steroid therapy, such as reactivation of localized herpetic lesions, 18 others have reported an increased incidence of infection and cancer. 15 Whether the development of these severe complications is due to effects of the steroids or to the increased longevity and survival rate of these severely immunocompromised patients is unknown.
15. Further investigation is required to determine the appropriate use and benefits of steroid therapy when the patient has concomitant life-threatening infections and when the patient has already received more than three days of anti-pneumocystis therapy and has developed significant hypoxia. Other causes of hyperthyroidism that may be treated with corticosteroids are subacute thyroiditis and thyroid storm.

Hyperthyroid disease related to thyroiditis is usually mild and self-limited. Beta blockers may be used to treat symptoms. In subacute thyroiditis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids can be used to relieve thyroid pain and tenderness. Meta-analysis of studies from 1966 to 1989 supports the finding that patients with acute severe alcoholic hepatitis and hepatic encephalopathy, without gastrointestinal bleeding, benefit from a trial of corticosteroid therapy. 43 However, a more recent meta-analysis found that the overall effect on decreasing mortality in the corticosteroid-treated group is not statistically significant, even in the patient group presenting with encephalopahy. Further clinical trials were recommended to clarify the role of steroids in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. 44.

### Monitoring long-term oral corticosteroids [^4f6fcfc0]. BMJ Open Quality (2017). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids are synthetic analogues of human hormones normally produced by the adrenal cortex. They have both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid properties. The glucocortoid components are anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, anti-proliferative and vasoconstrictive. They influence the metabolism of carbohydrate and protein, in addition to playing a key role in the body's stress response. Mineralocorticoid's main significance is in the balance of salt and water concentrations. Due to the combination of these effects, corticosteroids can cause many adverse effects. Oral corticosteroids are absorbed systemically and are therefore more likely to cause adverse effects than topical or inhaled corticosteroids. Furthermore, it is assumed that greater duration of treatment will lead to a greater number of adverse effects, and therefore the most at risk group are those taking high dose, long-term oral corticosteroids (LTOC). High dose is defined as a prescription of > 5 mg oral prednisolone and long term as duration of treatment > 1 month (based on National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance for patient's 'at risk' of systemic side effects). Parameters to be monitored in primary care include weight, blood pressure, triglycerides, glucose and urea and electrolytes. From clinical experience within the general practice setting, the authors propose that these patients do not receive adequate baseline monitoring before starting corticosteroids nor are these markers monitored consistently thereafter. This project intended to evidence this claim, evaluate the adverse effect profile and improve monitoring in this patient group. The initial audit of 22 patients, within a single general practice, detected at least one documented adverse effect in 64% of patients, while 41% reported more than one adverse effect. 45% had recorded weight gain, 18% had recorded osteoporosis, 18% had at least one recorded cataract, 14% had recorded Hypertension, 14% had recorded diabetes mellitus, 9% had recorded dyspepsia and 5% had a recorded psychiatric complaint. All of these recorded conditions were either directly attributed to steroid medication or occurred since LTOC were prescribed. The aim of this project was to increase the percentage of patients on LTOC with complete baseline monitoring to 100%. 'Baseline monitoring' was defined as a measurement taken within the previous 5 years. Although somewhat arbitrary, 5 years was felt to be the maximum timeframe in which monitoring would still be relevant for comparison following introduction of LTOC. Quality improvement methodology was used throughout this project with multiple PDSA (Plan, Study, Do and Act) cycles. Through this, a monitoring system and protocol for patients taking LTOC was developed. As a result of this project, five adverse effects were detected in five different patients. These included two cases of secondary hypertension, one case of diabetes mellitus, one cataract and one case of adrenal insufficiency. 12 out of 20 patients achieved complete baseline monitoring. While this study did not fully achieve its aim, the aim was deliberately ambitious. As not all patients in this study attended for monitoring, a figure of 100% was impossible to achieve. The remaining 'incompletely monitored patients' had some but not all parameters measured. The creation of a staff protocol and increased clinical experience will ensure that complete monitoring takes place in the future. In conclusion, this project has shown that adverse effects from LTOC are prevalent in a single general practice population. It is also shown that monitoring for LTOC adverse effects is inadequate but can be improved relatively easily as skills and competencies from other medication monitoring systems already exist within healthcare settings and are immediately transferable.

### Impact of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids exposure on the risk of ocular hypertension and glaucoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^63a54f74]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2019, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) introduced what is described as the most radical change to the asthma treatment paradigm of the last 30 years. Previously, for patients with mild intermittent asthma, short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) alone were used as first-line therapy. The addition of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was reserved for more severely symptomatic cases. The new report from GINA recommended using SABA + ICS combination for both maintenance and relief therapy in patients of 12 years of age or older, affecting the patients with mild intermittent asthma who are not currently adherent to regular ICS treatment, thus increasing the population's exposure to corticosteroids. These recommendations influence clinical decision-making and treatment guidelines throughout the world and these changes continue to be reflected in the 2020 and 2021 GINA reports.

Asthma affects over 272 million people worldwide based on a 2017 report by Global Burden of Disease Study, which includes 3.8 million or 10.2% of Canadians. The new treatment paradigm exposes an entire new cohort of the patient population to ICS. In addition, many asthma patients are concurrently affected by rhinitis, conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. Management of these conditions often warrants intranasal corticosteroid (INS) use, increasing patient exposure to corticosteroids even further. ICS are also extensively used for medical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), another disease with significant health burden affecting over 251 million people worldwide, including 2.0 million Canadians.

Corticosteroid use has been previously linked to increased intraocular pressure (IOP). When IOP rises beyond a certain threshold, typically defined as 21 mmHg, the condition is defined as ocular hypertension (OHT). Glaucoma is a disease defined by progressive damage of the optic nerve, and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide.OHT and glaucoma are closely related, and are often identified concurrently, as studies have shown that OHT is a major risk factor for development and progression of glaucoma. Anatomic proximity of the administration routes of ICS and INS, in addition to documented systemic effects, may increase exposure of ocular structures to corticosteroids.

Incidence of GC-associated hypertension

This study provides an estimate of incidence of hypertension associated with GC use, which allows more informed decisions for the patient. A UK study using primary care electronic records has estimated the incidence of hypertension in patients with RA. This study found a lower incident rate of hypertension, 336.2 per 10 000 pyrs, and a higher proportion being treated (85%) compared with our study (60%). However, this study only identified hypertension using Read codes and/or antihypertensive prescriptions, which means patients with high BP but not coded or treated are missed, which may explain the differences found compared with our study.

### Prednisone (Deltasone) [^d34e4249]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

General Precautions

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroids should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual.

Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.

Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.

Cardio-Renal

As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency.

Endocrine

Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for up to 12 months after discontinuation of therapy following large doses for prolonged periods; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.

There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism.

Gastrointestinal

Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, since they may increase the risk of a perforation.

Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastrointestinal perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent.

There is an enhanced effect due to decreased metabolism of corticosteroids in patients with cirrhosis.

### Local therapies for inflammatory eye disease in translation: past, present and future [^ecfa9b82]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Periocular therapy for ocular inflammatory disease

The numerous side-effects of oral corticosteroids are well-known and include gastric ulcers, weight gain, psychological disturbances, osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension and suppression of growth in children. In patients with unilateral or asymmetric disease, or in whom systemic administration of medication is less desirable, e.g. during pregnancy or in patients with a history of gastric ulceration, periocular injection can be useful to provide a depot of corticosteroid that successfully reaches the posterior segment to control inflammation.

Periocular corticosteroids

The precise mechanisms by which locally injected corticosteroids enter the eye are not known, but systemic drug levels remain low, and corticosteroids can be found in all layers of the eye, even at 30 days after a single subtenon injection of 40 mg of triamcinolone acetate, the highest levels being found in the choroid and retinal pigment epithelium. Periocular corticosteroid injections can be administered either via the subtenon route or as an orbital floor injection. Both procedures are safe, with a low risk of ocular penetration and of developing other side-effects of corticosteroid administration such as raised intraocular pressure and cataract. The duration of effect is approximately 2 months.

Other periocular agents

Currently no other non-corticosteroid agents are injected periocularly for the treatment of ocular inflammatory disease.

Intraocular corticosteroid therapy for ocular inflammatory disease

Intravitreal injections are now commonplace in ophthalmology, and are used for the treatment for a variety of ocular inflammatory and medical retinal disorders. The injection of dexamethasone into the vitreous had previously been used as an adjunct to vitrectomy, but it remains in the eye at therapeutic levels for hours only, and thus was superseded by triamcinolone as the intravitreal corticosteroid of choice. Triescence and Trivaris are triamcinolone preparations that are licenced for intraocular use in the US, but neither is available in the Europe, and Kenalog is commonly used off-label instead. However triamcinolone has a considerable side-effect profile in terms of cataract formation and raised intraocular pressure. The injection-related side effects of intravitreal therapy resemble those of any other intraocular injection, and include endophthalmitis, intravitreal haemorrhage, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, although these are rare. Other corticosteroid and non-corticosteroid agents have subsequently been developed, including sustained-release implants.

### Severe acute ocular hypertension following pulsed methylprednisolone for juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^f62b168e]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Mild intraocular hypertension is a well-described side effect of both topical and systemic corticosteroid therapy: mild rises in IOP occur in up to 60% of patients, but significant rises are uncommon. Risk factors for raised IOP following steroid administration include a previous history of uveitis, comorbid connective tissue diseaseand younger age. Severe intraocular hypertension can be vision threatening but is frequently asymptomatic; therefore, early recognition and management is important.

Our case is noteworthy for several reasons: the severity of the ocular hypertension, the rapid speed of onset following the administration of intravenous steroids and due to its asymptomatic nature, being discovered almost incidentally. A previous published case described a patient with symptoms (headaches, eye pain, reduced visual acuity), while another described the onset following several months of therapy, but none described such markedly raised pressures in an asymptomatic patient.

Additionally this case highlights that significant intraocular hypertension can present very differently in children. Adults with such significant rises in IOP typically present with headaches and visual disturbance. The patient in this case was only fatigued, and had neither of these classical symptoms. Thus it is important to consider the diagnosis in children even in the absence of classical symptoms.

This patient developed severe ocular hypertension due to a combination of her topical prednisolone drops and pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone therapy. It is not possible to determine the precise contribution of each to her ocular hypertension, but it is likely that the severity of her ocular hypertension was related to the combination of both routes of administration. She developed this condition within 3 weeks of commencing topical steroid therapy. Had she not been followed-up for her uveitis the high pressure may have been missed. Routine measurement of IOP for patients receiving topical and intravenous steroid therapy with risk factors may be advisable to allow early detection and management of this condition.

### Hydrocortisone sodium succinate [^df35baf1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General:

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual.

Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.

Cardio-renal:

As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency.

Endocrine:

Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate adjustment in dosage.

Gastrointestinal:

Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and non-specific ulcerative colitis, since they may increase the risk of a perforation. Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastrointestinal perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. In particular, the increased risk of diabetes mellitus, fluid retention and hypertension in elderly patients treated with corticosteroids should be considered.

### Hypertension and prohypertensive antineoplastic therapies in cancer patients [^d8d15008]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Adjunctive Therapy During Cancer Treatment

Adjunctive therapies, such as corticosteroids, EPO (erythropoietin), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, calcineurin inhibitors, and radiotherapy are often administered concurrently with antineoplastic agents. These therapies can contribute to the development of hypertension or worsening of previously controlled hypertension. Therefore, careful monitoring is warranted when these are part of the anticancer therapy regime, particularly when co-administered with antineoplastic agents known to be associated with a rise in blood pressure.

Corticosteroids are an essential adjunctive therapy to many chemotherapy regimens for both hematologic malignancies and some solid tumors. They increase the efficacy of some antineoplastic agents via mechanisms that are mostly unclear. Also, they reduce treatment-associated side-effects and are frequently used as a form of palliative care. However, corticosteroids can lead to other significant side effects and a notable rise in blood pressure in conjunction with water and sodium reabsorption via mineralocorticoid receptor stimulation.

EPO, in routine use to correct anemia caused by the underlying malignancy or anticancer therapy, has prohypertensive effects. Several mechanisms underlie EPO-induced hypertension, including increased blood viscosity, and, potentially, a skewed balance between vasoconstrictor and vasodilator prostaglandins with vascular resistance to the vasodilator effects of NO. Indeed, in rats treated with EPO, elevated vascular intracellular calcium concentrations were observed, which associated with vasoconstrictor effects that could not be compensated by cGMP upregulation.

The modest prohypertensive effects of analgesic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are well documented. These agents should be used with caution, especially in patients with hypertension, preexisting CVD, or in those receiving other treatments with potential cardiovascular toxic effects. Water and salt retention and decreased production of vasodilatory prostaglandins are thought to underlie the prohypertensive effects. Although there is currently insufficient evidence to suggest the routine use of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of VEGFI-associated hypertension, given the beneficial role of aspirin in the treatment of preeclampsia and the similarities between VEGFI-associated hypertension and preeclampsia, this is worthy of future investigation (Figure 2).

### Impact of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids exposure on the risk of ocular hypertension and glaucoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1b66267c]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, a small but significant IOP elevation of 0.69 mmHg was identified in patients using ICS and INS. Increases of this magnitude are known to increase the risk of glaucoma at a population level. The relatively recent GINA recommendations would cause a significant increase in the number of patients exposed to chronic daily corticosteroid use. Awareness of the potential risk of glaucoma may be an important consideration for patient-informed consent and recommendations for patient management.

### Targeting the immune system to treat hypertension: where are we? [^467414dd]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Research over the past decade has significantly deepened our understanding of mechanisms that drive the development of hypertension. In particular, a novel paradigm of inflammation as a common mediator of cardiovascular and kidney disease has emerged. This review will summarize the role of the immune system in cardiovascular disease, explore some of the most promising new therapeutic directions and consider their potential as new treatments for hypertension.

Recent Findings

Recent data continue to demonstrate that targeting the immune system can prevent hypertension in a variety of experimental models. Tempering the enthusiasm for a long-awaited new approach to treating hypertension is decades of clinical data, showing that classic immunosuppression regimens are associated with significant side-effects - including cardiovascular disease - that effectively preclude their use in the setting of chronic hypertension. New, more specific therapies are being developed that target cytokines including IL-17, IL-6 and TNFα.

Summary

Preclinical data convincingly demonstrate a key role for the immune system and specific cytokine mediators. Several biotherapeutics targeting these pathways are on the market and more are in development. Side-effects, however, continue to resemble those of classic immunosuppressants, highlighting the challenge of translating these research advances into new therapies for hypertension.

Of 31 657 patients with a diagnosis of RA, 13 897 (44%) had hypertension prior to RA diagnosis, resulting in 17 760 patients who were included in this cohort (supplementary Fig. S1, available at Rheumatology online). Those included in the cohort had a mean age 56.3 years (. 12.7) and were predominantly female (68%, N = 12 101). Of those, 41.8% (N = 7421) were prescribed GCs during follow-up, and these patients were slightly older (mean age 57.7 vs 55.3 years of those never prescribed GCs), were predominantly female, had a history of smoking and had more comorbidities compared with those not prescribed GCs during follow-up (Table 1).

Baseline characteristics of cohort overall and stratified by glucocorticoid use during follow-up

There were 6243 cases of incident hypertension over 97 547 person years (pyrs) of follow-up, giving an incident rate of 64.1 per 1000 pyrs (95% CI: 62.5, 65.7). Cases were most frequently first identified through consecutive high SBP measurements alone (N = 4018, 64%), followed by consecutive high SBP and DBP measurements (N = 1134, 18%) and consecutive high DBP measurements alone (n = 504, 8%). Only 7% (N = 449) were identified first through antihypertensive prescriptions and Read codes alone (Fig. 1). Of those identified through high BP measurements, 60% (N = 3396/5656) were subsequently prescribed antihypertensive medication. 1

### Prevention of glucocorticoid morbidity in giant cell arteritis [^e84c4af8]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment for GCA. Patients often require long-term treatment that may be associated with numerous adverse effects, depending on the dose and the duration of treatment. Trends in recent decades for glucocorticoid use in GCA suggest increasing cumulative doses and longer exposures. Common adverse events (AEs) reported in glucocorticoid-treated GCA patients include osteoporosis, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, posterior subcapsular cataract, infections, diabetes mellitus, Cushingoid appearance, adrenal insufficiency and aseptic necrosis of bone. AEs considered most worrisome by patients and rheumatologists include weight gain, psychological effects, osteoporosis, cardiometabolic complications and infections. The challenge is to maximize the benefit-risk ratio by giving the maximum glucocorticoid treatment necessary to control GCA initially and then to prevent relapse but to give the minimum treatment possible to avoid glucocorticoid-related AEs. We discuss the safety issues associated with long-term glucocorticoid use in patients with GCA and strategies for preventing glucocorticoid-related morbidity.

### Dexamethasone sodium phosphate (cortaren corticosteroid / anti-inflammatory system) [^cff0e4d1]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

General

This product, like many other steroid formulations, is sensitive to heat. Therefore, it should not be autoclaved when it is desirable to sterilize the exterior of the vial.

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual.

Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.

Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.

Cardio-Renal

As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency.

Endocrine

Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.

Gastrointestinal

Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, since they may increase the risk of a perforation.

Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastrointestinal perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent.

There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids in patients with cirrhosis.

Intra-Articular and Soft Tissue Administration

Intra-articularly injected corticosteroids may be systemically absorbed.

Appropriate examination of any joint fluid present is necessary to exclude a septic process.

A marked increase in pain accompanied by local swelling, further restriction of joint motion, fever, and malaise are suggestive of septic arthritis. If this complication occurs and the diagnosis of sepsis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be instituted.

Injection of a steroid into an infected site is to be avoided. Local injection of a steroid into a previously infected joint is not usually recommended.

Corticosteroid injection into unstable joints is generally not recommended.

Intra-articular injection may result in damage to joint tissues (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Musculoskeletal).

### Advances in rheumatology: coxibs and beyond [^52204f17]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003). Low credibility.

Arthritis is a growing health concern in the US with approximately 70 million Americans currently affected. This figure will inevitably rise as the population ages. The pain and decreased mobility associated with arthritis have a significant impact on quality of life and because patients with arthritis are less active than the general population, they are at risk of additional conditions such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. There are currently no disease modifying osteoarthritis (OA) drugs available; therefore anti-inflammatory, and/or analgesic medications such as acetaminophen and NSAIDs and simple analgesics form the mainstay of treatment. Coxibs may be preferred to traditional NSAIDs because of their improved gastrointestinal (GI) safety and tolerability profile. The use of topical agents may also be beneficial in some patients. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where disease modifying drugs (DMARDs) are available, anti-inflammatory agents such as NSAIDs and coxibs are used as adjuncts to disease modifying therapy. However, patients with RA are at increased risk of NSAID-related GI injury, particularly if they are also on corticosteroid medication. Pharmacological treatment of both RA and OA should be combined with appropriate nonpharmacological modalities such as patient education, exercise programs, and joint motion and strengthening exercises. Such activities may delay joint degradation and help maintain physical function.

There is an enhanced effect due to decreased metabolism of corticosteroids in patients with cirrhosis.

Musculoskeletal

Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption both through their effect on calcium regulation (i.e., decreasing absorption and increasing excretion) and inhibition of osteoblast function. This, together with a decrease in the protein matrix of the bone secondary to an increase in protein catabolism, and reduced sex hormone production, may lead to inhibition of bone growth in pediatric patients and the development of osteoporosis at any age. Special consideration should be given to patients at increased risk of osteoporosis (e.g., postmenopausal women) before initiating corticosteroid therapy.

### Republished: severe acute ocular hypertension following pulsed methylprednisolone for juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^2682c56d]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Mild intraocular hypertension is a well-described side effect of both topical and systemic corticosteroid therapy: mild rises in IOP occur in up to 60% of patients, but significant rises are uncommon. Risk factors for raised IOP following steroid administration include a previous history of uveitis, comorbid connective tissue diseaseand younger age. Severe intraocular hypertension can be vision threatening but is frequently asymptomatic; therefore, early recognition and management is important.

Our case is noteworthy for several reasons: the severity of the ocular hypertension, the rapid speed of onset following the administration of intravenous steroids and due to its asymptomatic nature, being discovered almost incidentally. A previous published case described a patient with symptoms (headaches, eye pain, reduced visual acuity), while another described the onset following several months of therapy, but none described such markedly raised pressures in an asymptomatic patient.

Additionally this case highlights that significant intraocular hypertension can present very differently in children. Adults with such significant rises in IOP typically present with headaches and visual disturbance. The patient in this case was only fatigued, and had neither of these classical symptoms. Thus it is important to consider the diagnosis in children even in the absence of classical symptoms.

This patient developed severe ocular hypertension due to a combination of her topical prednisolone drops and pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone therapy. It is not possible to determine the precise contribution of each to her ocular hypertension, but it is likely that the severity of her ocular hypertension was related to the combination of both routes of administration. She developed this condition within 3 weeks of commencing topical steroid therapy. Had she not been followed-up for her uveitis the high pressure may have been missed. Routine measurement of IOP for patients receiving topical and intravenous steroid therapy with risk factors may be advisable to allow early detection and management of this condition.

### Thromboembolic and atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in inflammatory bowel disease: epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical management [^f346c200]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Effect of IBD drugs on ASCVD

Interventions reducing inflammatory burden might attenuate ASCVD risk, as shown by reduced risk of IHD in patients with previous intestinal surgery and on combination therapy (IRR 0.92; 95%CI 0.75–1.13 and IRR 0.58; 95%CI 0.22–1.56, respectively).

Aminosalicylates

Among 5-ASA users, a significant lower risk of IHD was reported as compared with non-users, also after adjustment for corticosteroid use. In vitro, 5-ASA shares anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties with aspirin.

Corticosteroids

Despite the frequent prescription of corticosteroids, remarkably few publications address the occurrence of hypertension, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance specifically for IBD populations. A pilot study showed that orally taken but not bolus administration of methylprednisolone increased BMI, body fat percent and TC levels after 12-week treatment. In CD patients aged > 50 years, treatment with corticosteroids significantly increased the risk of hypertension, but not of hyperglycemia or congestive heart failure. Studies addressing the risk of corticosteroid-induced diabetes in IBD are lacking. In a large population-based cohort study, the increased risk of DM type 2 was not assigned to corticosteroid exposure. In contrast, the risk of HF was higher in patients using systemic corticosteroids as compared with non-users (adjusted HR 2.51, 95%CI 1.93–4.57). A dose-dependent increase in the hazard of all-cause ASCVD was observed in immune-mediated diseases treated with corticosteroids, including IBD (1.08, 95%CI 1.07–1.10 per 5 mg/day). Future research is needed to establish whether these effects differ between formulas, among which corticosteroids with a different mechanism of action (prednisone versus budesonide) or mode of administration (oral versus topical).

Immunomodulators: methotrexate and thiopurines

The effect of methotrexate on cardiovascular risk factors and ASCVD incidence in IBD are unknown. In other chronic inflammatory conditions, methotrexate was shown to have a beneficial effect on arterial stiffness and to reduce cardiovascular events. Exposure to thiopurines was not associated with the risk of acute arterial events in IBD.

### The effect of low-dose glucocorticoids over two years on weight and blood pressure in rheumatoid arthritis: individual patient data from five randomized trials [^b066f103]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Weight gain and hypertension are well known adverse effects of treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of 2 years of low-dose glucocorticoid treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Design

Pooled analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials with 2-year interventions allowing concomitant treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.

Setting

12 countries in Europe.

Patients

Early and established RA.

Intervention

Glucocorticoids at 7.5 mg or less prednisone equivalent per day.

Measurements

Coprimary end points were differences in change from baseline in body weight and mean arterial pressure after 2 years in intention-to-treat analyses. Difference in the change of number of antihypertensive drugs after 2 years was a secondary end point. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were done to assess the robustness of primary findings.

Results

A total of 1112 participants were included (mean age, 61.4 years [SD, 14.5]; 68% women). Both groups gained weight in 2 years, but glucocorticoids led, on average, to 1.1 kg (95% CI, 0.4 to 1.8 kg; P < 0.001) more weight gain than the control treatment. Mean arterial pressure increased by about 2 mm Hg in both groups, with a between-group difference of -0.4 mm Hg (CI, -3.0 to 2.2 mm Hg; P = 0.187). These results were consistent in sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Most patients did not change the number of antihypertensive drugs, and there was no evidence of differences between groups.

Limitation

Body composition was not assessed, and generalizability to non-European regions may be limited.

Conclusion

This study provides robust evidence that low-dose glucocorticoids, received over 2 years for the treatment of RA, increase weight by about 1 kg but do not increase blood pressure.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### Portal hypertension and its complications [^0b00e55d]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Portal hypertension is responsible for most of the complications associated with cirrhosis, specifically variceal hemorrhage, ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Progress in understanding the pathophysiology of portal hypertension and improvements in the diagnosis and management of its complications that have occurred over the last year are discussed.

Recent Findings

Endothelial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of portal hypertension and may represent a novel therapeutic target. Hepatic venous pressure gradient measurements, when properly performed, are useful in the management of patients with cirrhosis. Hyponatremia in cirrhosis has prognostic value and novel aquaretic and other agents may provide alternative approaches to the management of chronic liver disease. The mechanisms for bacterial translocation in cirrhosis that predisposes patients to infectious complications, such as spontaneous bacterial peritionitis, are being explored. Adrenal insufficiency is common in septic patients with advanced cirrhosis and corticosteroids may provide a survival benefit. Pulmonary disease complicates the management of patients with advanced liver disease.

Summary

Significant advances continue to be made in the diagnosis and management of the complications of portal hypertension in the face of an increasing burden of chronic liver disease.

### Pulmonary sarcoidosis [^abde2d11]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown cause, occurs worldwide and has a highly variable prevalence. The disease is typically dominant in the lungs, although it can affect virtually any organ and is unpredictable in its clinical course. The severity of pulmonary sarcoidosis ranges from incidentally discovered radiographic abnormalities in asymptomatic patients to a chronic progressive disease that is refractory to treatment. Mortality from sarcoidosis appears to have increased in the past three decades, with respiratory failure being the most common cause of sarcoidosis-related death. Pulmonary fibrosis, extensive disease on high-resolution chest CT, impaired lung function, and pulmonary hypertension are well established predictors of poor clinical outcomes. In patients who need systemic therapy to control their disease, corticosteroids are the most commonly used first-line treatment, with antimetabolites generally representing an alternative for patients who are unresponsive to corticosteroids or who cannot tolerate them. Indeed, corticosteroid therapy is associated with toxic effects that correlate with both the cumulative dose and duration of treatment. The scarcity of truly effective therapies and shortage of reliable predictors of the unpredictable development of disease in individual patients greatly contribute to making sarcoidosis such a difficult disease to manage.

### Use of inhaled corticosteroids and the risk of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction [^cbf2c1f4]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Use of inhaled corticosteroids may reduce the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) through reductions in systemic inflammation and C-reactive protein.

Objectives

To examine the association between the use of inhaled corticosteroids and the risk of non-fatal acute MI.

Methods

In the Dutch PHARMO record linkage system database, we conducted a case-control study (2476 MI cases), nested in a cohort of antihypertensive drug users. The use of inhaled corticosteroids 100 days before the index date was compared with never use. We adjusted the analyses for the severity of the underlying respiratory disease and general drug and disease history.

Results

We found that the use of inhaled corticosteroids was not associated with a decreased risk of non-fatal MI in antihypertensive drug users after adjustment for the underlying respiratory disease severity, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97–1.57. A higher daily dose (adjusted OR 1.82, 95% CI 0.80–4.13) and longer duration of use (adjusted OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.90–1.81) were not associated with a decreased risk of non-fatal MI. An inhaled corticosteroid dispensing in the 30 days before the index date was not protective but resulted in a 1.7-fold increased risk of non-fatal MI.

Conclusion

Our results do not support the hypothesis that inhaled corticosteroids protect against the risk of non-fatal MI by a reduction of systemic inflammation.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^4dd55e29]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Glucocorticoids should only be tapered if the underlying disease no longer requires glucocorticoid therapy. In general, glucocorticoid taper can be faster and in larger decrements if the total daily glucocorticoid dose is high (eg, greater than 30 mg of prednisone). As the total daily glucocorticoid dose is approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent (greater than equivalent of 15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone, see Table 1), the taper should be slower and with smaller decrements (Table 4). In certain patients with glucocorticoid-induced complications, such as uncontrolled hypertension and hyperglycemia, glucocorticoid-induced psychosis, or herpetic keratitis, a more rapid glucocorticoid taper towards physiologic daily dose equivalent may be required. The pre-test probability of adrenal atrophy and concurrent adrenal insufficiency is high for patients taking long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses; adrenal function testing is unnecessary until a physiologic glucocorticoid dose is achieved.

Table 4.
Suggested tapering regimen depending on glucocorticoid dose

HPA recovery is possible once the glucocorticoid therapy has been tapered to a near-physiologic daily dose (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). At this time, taper or assessment for HPA recovery could be performed unless glucocorticoids at this dose are required for control of the underlying condition (for example transplant, or polymyalgia rheumatica).

It is helpful to consider the likelihood of adrenal insufficiency and the risk of underlying disease flare before planning further tapering. It is also important to consider the underlying comorbidities and evaluate concurrent drugs that could impact glucocorticoid metabolism and overall glucocorticoid exposure. Although lacking systematic evidence, empirically, the patient's previous history of success or failure of glucocorticoid taper may also help design the most effective glucocorticoid taper. Additional factors that may impact the risk of adrenal insufficiency include inter-individual variability of glucocorticoid pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. A study examining oral and intravenous methylprednisolone found that 20% of individuals demonstrated increased clearance of methylprednisolone. In general, older individuals have reduced drug clearance, despite a small sample size in these studies, data suggest a considerable and multifactorial inter-individual variability in what would be considered a physiological glucocorticoid dose.

R 2.3 — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper. When glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is severe, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. (Good clinical practice)

### Targeting inflammation in hypertension [^40ca0244]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Revealing immune mechanisms in the pathophysiology of hypertension has clearly expanded its already multifactorial etiology. A precise characterization of the underlying immune mechanisms may create new possibilities to treat hypertension causally. Lowering arterial pressure will undoubtedly remain an important target of the therapy, but improved understanding of immune mechanisms shifted the accent from a simply pressure related cause of hypertension to a mechanistic insight into causes of related organ damage. First experimental and clinical intervention studies clearly point to the fact that targeting the immune system in hypertension may have beneficial outcomes on various organ systems independent of lowering arterial pressure. The clinical studies also suggest that attempts of immunosuppression or immunomodulation with a single target may not be sufficient and may even be detrimental. Therefore, further unraveling inflammatory markers and their interactions in immune networks is crucial for more efficient immunomodulation of hypertensive disease.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: recent clinical and biological advances [^f6522c34]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids

Cortisol is the endogenous corticosteroid, produced from cholesterol in the adrenal gland, and acts predominantly on glucocorticoid receptors. Synthetic corticosteroids, including prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone, are selected based on a high glucocorticoid preference. The exact mechanisms by which corticosteroids treat autoimmune CNS conditions is unclear but likely to rely on a combination of their pleotropic abilities to decrease blood–brain barrier permeability, rapidly suppress (within minutes) transcription of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules, repression of key immunomodulatory transcription factors (e.g. NF-κB and AP-1), suppression of myeloid cell function, and induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes. Due to their clear benefits on cognition and seizure frequency in observational studies, corticosteroids are the most frequently employed the first-line treatment for patients. Corticosteroid dosing and weaning regimes vary hugely between physicians treating these conditions and, in our experience, depends on the autoantibody underlying the disorder. For example, in NMDAR-AbE, we have been successful in corticosteroid induction without tapering, but in LGI1-AbE, we have observed that this approach precipitates relapses, often necessitating prolonged courses of corticosteroids in this condition. Unfortunately, corticosteroid side effects are myriad and include insomnia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteopenia, avascular necrosis, muscle atrophy, and psychiatric disorders. Many of these side effects are related to duration of treatment and dose, and particularly affect the more elderly patients, the main group affected by LGI1-antibody encephalitis.

The choice of corticosteroid is also not closely scrutinized in studies, with prednisolone and methylprednisolone empirically reached for on a neurological ward. However, evidence exists that dexamethasone remains at a higher concentration in the CNS for a longer duration, as well as having higher glucocorticoid efficacy and less mineralocorticoid activity. Hence, an ongoing challenge is to establish optimum steroid treatment regimens and mitigate many of these common adverse effects.

### Association of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy with mortality among veterans with inflammatory bowel disease [^4e2f62fc]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition associated with disability and reduced quality of life. Corticosteroids temporarily treat inflammation, but guidelines recommend against their long-term use because of their toxicity profile and ineffectiveness at maintaining clinical remission (the resolution of symptoms). Patients with moderate to severe IBD are often prescribed corticosteroid-sparing therapies, such as anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, for the induction and maintenance of clinical remission. However, many patients do not respond to anti-TNF agents or develop recurrent inflammation despite them, prompting reinitiation of corticosteroids.

Both corticosteroids and anti-TNF agents have adverse effects, including infections (both), osteoporosis (corticosteroids), and congestive heart failure (both). A study of Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries found a decreased risk of death among patients with Crohn disease (CD) exposed to anti-TNF agents, compared with those taking corticosteroids for a prolonged time. Prior registry studies show similar findings for immunomodulators and the anti-TNF medication infliximab, compared with corticosteroids. Furthermore, recent data suggest that corticosteroid use is also associated with a 6-fold increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), wherease anti-TNF agent use is not. Despite this, longstanding corticosteroid use among patients with IBD remains common, particularly among the elderly and those with comorbid conditions.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest integrated health system in the United States, serving 9 million veterans. Veterans with IBD frequently have risk factors predisposing them to both corticosteroid and anti-TNF agent adverse effects, including older age, tobacco use, and comorbidities, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. We aimed to examine the hypothesis that anti-TNF therapy is associated with reduced mortality relative to prolonged corticosteroid use in an established cohort of veterans with IBD.

PRECAUTIONS:

This product, like many other steroid formulations, is sensitive to heat. Therefore, it should not be autoclaved when it is desirable to sterilize the exterior of the vial.

Following prolonged therapy, withdrawal of corticosteroids may result in symptoms of the corticosteroid withdrawal syndrome including fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise. This may occur in patients even without evidence of adrenal insufficiency.

There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids in patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis.

Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex for fear of corneal perforation.

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction must be gradual.

Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids.

Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia.

Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess, or other pyogenic infection, also in diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, active or latent peptic ulcer, renal insufficiency, hypertension, osteoporosis, and myasthenia gravis. Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastrointestinal perforation in patients receiving large doses of corticosteroids may be minimal or absent. Fat embolism has been reported as a possible complication of hypercortisonism.

### Glucocorticoid use is associated with an increased risk of hypertension [^1115b35c]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcome

A validated definition of hypertension was used where a person was considered to have hypertension from the earliest of either: (i) two consecutive systolic blood pressure (SBP) readings ≥ 140 mmHg within a year, (ii) two consecutive diastolic blood pressure (DBP) readings ≥ 90 mmHg within a year, (iii) a hypertension Read code (see and Supplemental Data S1, available at Rheumatology online), and on therapy with antihypertensive medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and diuretics) prescribed on at least two different dates within 6 months either side of the Read code. For criteria (i) and (ii), a person was considered hypertensive from the second BP reading as a person would not be considered hypertensive based on one BP reading. For criteria (iii), a person was considered hypertensive from the earliest of Read code or antihypertensive prescription start date. Follow-up was censored at the point of hypertension diagnosis.

Confounders

The following covariates were included in the analyses: baseline age; gender; baseline BMI calculated using height and nearest weight measurement (if present within 5 years prior to baseline); baseline smoking status, classified as ever or never using Read codes and smoking cessation prescription codes; time-varying conventional synthetic DMARD use and time-varying prescribed NSAID use, identified using product codes where patients were considered exposed for the duration of their prescription; and Charlson comorbidity index at baseline, determined using a validated algorithm, where patients were considered to have the comorbidity if they had a Read code at any point from registration with the practice or up to research standard date, whichever was latest, until baseline. All these covariates were considered a priori confounders and were included in the analysis. All code lists can be found in Supplemental Data S1, available at Rheumatology online.

Missing data

Baseline BMI and smoking status had 43% and 17% missing data, respectively. Data were imputed using multiple imputation with 47 imputations, this number was based on the fraction of missing information.

### Corticosteroids influence the mortality and morbidity of acute critical illness [^bb0093ae]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Administration of corticosteroids in a variety of settings in acute critical illness has become widespread. Corticosteroids are used therapeutically for relative adrenal insufficiency as well as for the attenuation of the inflammatory and immune response in the critically ill. Early use of corticosteroids has been recommended in sepsis, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome and refractory vasodilatory shock. The Corticosteroid Randomization after Significant Head Injury study, a large, international, randomized placebo-controlled trial, was terminated after enrolment of 10,000 patients because of an unexpected rise in the death rate after early administration of corticosteroids. That study report raised concerns with regard to the safety of corticosteroids since, up to that time, they had been liberally administered in a variety of life-threatening illnesses with the intent to improve survival. These concerns were substantiated when we observed, in a previous study, that administration of corticosteroids increased the mortality in vasopressor-dependent critical illness. A similar observation of an unexpected increase in mortality from corticosteroids use was also reported from a randomized controlled trial of corticosteroids in late acute respiratory distress syndrome.

The morbidity related to metabolic, immune and musculoskeletal side-effects of corticosteroids in noncritical illness has been recognized and has created great interest in developing alternative treatments to avoid these complications. In transplantation practice, the therapeutic use of corticosteroids for immunosuppression has decreased because of the introduction of other therapies targeted against specific cytokines including tumour necrosis factor and interleukins or selective lymphocytes calcineurin inhibition. New immunosuppression regimes produced superior allograft survival and yet had fewer side effects than traditional high-dose corticosteroids. For autoimmune inflammatory disorders and rheumatologic diseases, the use of corticosteroids has also declined because of better treatment options targeting inflammatory cytokines known to influence the progression of these conditions.

The use of corticosteroids in noncritical illness has gradually diminished, yet their use in acute critical illness appears to be expanding in relative adrenal insufficiency, sepsis and systemic inflammatory organ injury. This study was designed to address the following questions: What are the frequency and patient characteristics associated with corticosteroid use in acute critical illness? Does the exposure to corticosteroids influence death or disability? What were the mechanisms for the observed effects of corticosteroids in acute critical illness? This study was a retrospective case–control analysis of all admissions to an adult intensive care unit (ICU) with exposure to corticosteroids defining the case group.

### Tofacitinib for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in Japanese patients: subgroup analyses from a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^1a78e758]. The Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease. The most common form is plaque psoriasis, which accounts for approximately 90% of all cases. 1 Psoriasis is associated with an increased incidence of chronic comorbid conditions, and psoriasis patients are at higher risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular mortality than the general population. 2, 3, 4, 5 The effect of psoriasis on the patient includes psychosocial as well as physical manifestations, and can result in stigmatization, anxiety and depression, and affect interpersonal relationships. 6, 7

The prevalence of psoriasis in the Japanese population has been reported to be 0.34%. 8 Although this is lower than reported in other regions, which range from 1% in the USA to 8.5% in Norway, 9 there are currently more than 400 000 Japanese patients with psoriasis. 8 Given the prevalence, together with the consequences of the disease, psoriasis represents a substantial health issue in Japan.

In Japan, therapies currently approved for treatment of psoriasis include topical corticosteroids and vitamin D 3, phototherapy, the oral systemic agents etretinate and cyclosporin and the injectable/infusible biologics infliximab, adalimumab, ustekinumab, secukinumab, brodalumab and ixekizumab; methotrexate is not available as a treatment option for psoriasis in Japan. 10, 11, 12, 13 Topical therapies have limited effectiveness, particularly in moderate to severe disease, and are also considered inconvenient by many patients. 14, 15 The effectiveness and convenience of phototherapy have also been reported to be lower than many systemic treatments. 14, 15 Side‐effects, including renal failure and hypertension, limit the long‐term use of cyclosporin. 16 Although biologics have a high level of therapeutic effect, 10 use of some biologic agents has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections. 17 In addition, some biologics can also lose efficacy over time due to the development of anti‐drug antibodies, 18 and the requirement for parenteral administration may be an issue for some patients. 19 Because of these limitations, there remains an unmet need for safe and effective oral therapies with unique mechanisms of action for treatment of psoriasis.

### Exposure to biologic therapy and associated maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by inflammatory bowel disease [^b85fa126]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is growing evidence that biologic therapy is safe in pregnancies complicated by inflammatory bowel disease and that its use outweighs the risk of worsening disease activity, which is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. To our knowledge, there are limited data regarding the use of biologic therapy and the associated maternal adverse effects such as the risk of hypertensive outcomes, postoperative complications, and infectious risk.

Objective

Our objective was to evaluate a variety of obstetrical complications including maternal infectious outcomes, hypertensive outcomes, other adverse maternal outcomes including postoperative complications, venous thromboembolism, and postpartum hemorrhage; we also evaluated the neonatal outcomes associated with biologic use in pregnancies affected by inflammatory bowel disease.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort study including patients with inflammatory bowel disease who were pregnant and delivered at our institution. The maternal demographics and the incidence of maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared among groups on the basis of biologic exposure using the chi-square or Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the t test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed on composite outcomes adjusting for age, disease activity, maternal obesity, history of cesarean delivery, and history of corticosteroid use in pregnancy. The statistical significance was defined as P < .05.

Results

A total of 322 patients who were pregnant, had inflammatory bowel disease, and delivered at our institution from 2012 to 2019, were included for analysis. Of these, 112 (34%) were on biologics during pregnancy. The patients in the biologic group had significantly lower body mass indices than the patients in the nonbiologic group (median body mass index, 22.4 vs 24.0, respectively; P = 0.04), and they were less likely to be multiparous (41% vs 59%, respectively; P = 0.003). In addition, more patients in the biologic group were likely to have Crohn disease with previous inflammatory bowel disease surgery (33% vs 20%, respectively; P = 0.01); otherwise, the 2 groups had similar baseline characteristics. Maternal infectious and hypertensive outcomes occurred significantly more frequently in the biologic group than the nonexposed group (22% vs 7%; P = 0.0003 and 19% vs 8%; P = 0.003, respectively). This remained statistically significant in multivariable logistic regression models. Specifically, maternal infectious and hypertensive outcomes occurred significantly more frequently in the patients on a single-agent antitumor necrosis factor treatment than the patients on no inflammatory bowel disease medication (24% vs 6%; P = 0.002; 22% vs 6%; P = 0.004), which remained statistically significant in multivariable logistic regression models. There was no difference in the neonatal adverse outcomes between the 2 groups.

Conclusion

Our data suggest an association between antepartum biologic use- specifically antitumor necrosis factor alpha therapy-and an increased risk of maternal infectious and hypertensive outcomes. This increased risk may be related to underlying disease activity and the same should be incorporated into a discussion with the patient. However, the discussion must be balanced with the important benefit of optimal disease control associated with biologic use in patients being treated for IBD.

### International perspectives on management of inflammatory bowel disease: opinion differences and similarities between patients and physicians from the IBD GAPPS survey [^2bbc5202]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) that result in considerable morbidity and a significantly diminished quality of life (QOL). In general, IBD causes a substantial economic burden on health care systems, in the form of both direct and indirect costs. The primary goals of treatment for CD and UC are to adequately control the immune dysfunction and thereby eliminate the inflammatory burden to achieve symptom control, establish corticosteroid-free remission, and improve QOL. Patients with IBD may be treated with a variety of agents, including 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs), antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics, and new small-molecule agents. Despite the effectiveness of biologics such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, anti-α4β7 integrin agents, and anti-interleukin-12/23 (IL-12/23) agents, patients may experience loss of response for many reasons, such as antidrug antibody formation, and increased risk for other complications such as serious infections or malignancies. Corticosteroids are effective as induction therapy and for treating exacerbations of IBD but are neither effective nor safe in maintenance of remission. Common adverse effects include (but are not limited to) infections, osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, hypertension, psychiatric disturbances, and difficulty with wound healing. Despite these risks, excessive or prolonged corticosteroid use has been documented in 15% to 17% of patients with IBD, suggesting a need for improved disease management.

As a chronic disease, IBD requires long-term management and extended interactions and communication between patients and physicians. Good patient-physician communication is particularly important for optimizing patient involvement in IBD management. Indeed, most patients report that their physician is the primary source of information about their disease. Surveys designed to understand IBD from the perspective of patients and physicians have revealed differences and misalignments on the fundamental concepts of IBD management. For example, physician estimates of IBD severity have been shown to be lower than patient reports. Similarly, physicians may tend to underestimate the impact or burden of IBD on patients. To better understand the global experience and perceptions of patients with CD or UC and physicians who treat IBD, we conducted 2 online surveys. Herein, we report the results of the IBD Global Assessment of Patient and Physician Unmet Need Surveys (IBD GAPPS).

### Optimum management of glucocorticoid-treated patients [^8f636411]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids are taken by approximately 2% of the US adult population at any given time. The powerful anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive benefits of these drugs must, however, be weighed against their multisystem adverse effects. Clinicians should always prescribe the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time. Patients should be informed of the short-term and long-term adverse effects to expect, particularly if the dose of glucocorticoids is expected to exceed the equivalent of approximately 7.5 mg prednisone daily for 2 months or more. At the commencement of glucocorticoid therapy, a patient's blood pressure, lipid profile, 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) level and fasting glucose level should be measured and baseline bone densitometry performed. Bisphosphonate therapy should be initiated for postmenopausal women and men with a bone density T-score below -1 or for those with a history of fracture. Regular ophthalmic screening for cataracts and glaucoma is warranted, and patients at high-risk of gastric ulceration (especially patients simultaneously taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) should receive proton-pump inhibitors. Prophylaxis against opportunistic infections is appropriate for high-risk populations, such as organ-transplant recipients. Trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole can be given to high-risk populations, such as organ transplant recipients. The duration of weaning from glucocorticoid treatment should be proportionate to treatment duration. Appropriate preventive therapy can mitigate many of the adverse effects associated with glucocorticoid therapy.

### Glucocorticoids for therapeutic immunosuppression: clinical pearls for the practicing neurologist [^6ce99b9b]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

Given widespread use of glucocorticoid therapy in neurologic disease, understanding glucocorticoid pharmacology and risk is paramount for the practicing neurologist. While dosing and tapering regimens vary depending on the neurological disease and indication being treated, there are important general principles of glucocorticoid prescribing and monitoring that can guide clinical decision-making. Glucocorticoid-related toxicities can occur across multiple organ systems, including hypertension; dyslipidemia; weight gain; hyperglycemia; osteoporosis and avascular necrosis; myopathy; gastrointestinal bleeding; infection; and neuropsychiatric effects with sleep, mood disturbance and cognition. This narrative review provides a practical framework for safe and responsible prescribing of this therapeutic class of medications, including appreciation of immunosuppressive consequences, risk mitigation strategies, dosing and tapering, and recognition of adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal.

### Efficacy and safety of esaxerenone (CS-3150) for the treatment of essential hypertension: a phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study [^60cbdb9f]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a multifactorial disease involving complex interactions between various metabolic, neurohormonal, and inflammatory factors, and is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with vasculopathy, heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, and nephropathy, all of which are classic manifestations of hypertensive end-organ damage.

In addition to non-pharmacological treatments, management of hypertension often requires pharmacotherapy with an antihypertensive agent, which is a proven approach for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although monotherapy may be effective in some patients, failure to achieve the desired antihypertensive effect requires the concurrent use of multiple antihypertensive drugs as part of a multifactorial strategy. In fact, many patients require three or more antihypertensive drugs to achieve a blood pressure (BP) level of < 140/90 mmHg. Triple drug therapy combinations usually include a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor (angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors or angiotensin II-receptor blockers), a calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic.

The Japanese Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension (2014) recommend adding an aldosterone antagonist to the treatment regimen of patients with poorly controlled BP or resistant hypertension. Aldosterone is a steroid hormone that regulates electrolyte homeostasis and BP via binding to the mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in the distal tubule and collecting duct of the kidney. Primary aldosteronism (PA) is caused by the excess production of aldosterone and is the most common cause of secondary hypertension as well as a common cause of antihypertensive treatment resistance. Furthermore, aldosterone-induced MR activation impairs insulin sensitivity and is associated with obesity and diabetes. Therefore, treatment-resistant hypertension in the presence of conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) can occur despite normal plasma aldosterone concentrations (PAC). The role of pathological overstimulation of MR in the absence of high aldosterone levels has been indicated in cases of MR-associated hypertension.

### Hypertension in cancer patients and survivors: epidemiology, diagnosis, and management [^7da5a8e6]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

In individuals at high risk of volume depletion who also have proteinuria, it may be preferable to defer renin-angiotensin system–blocking drugs or, in those with transient risk of volume loss, recommend a sick-day protocol to temporarily withhold these medications on days in which they have symptoms. Correspondingly, diuretic and mineralocorticoid antagonist therapies are often added, or titrated, later in the cascade of antihypertensive therapy in patients on undergoing active cancer treatment, because these patients are at higher risk for volume depletion through reduced intake of nutrients and fluids, as well as increased volume losses from diarrhea or vomiting, predisposing them to electrolyte abnormalities and acute kidney injury. If there is no further individual-level contraindication, diuretic therapy (specifically thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics) should be considered first-line therapy in patients undergoing active surveillance and in cancer survivors. Similarly, if there is no contraindication, mineralocorticoid antagonist therapy should be used in individuals with resistant hypertension, with close monitoring for hyperkalemia.

Depending on the half-life and frequency of chemotherapy administration, some individuals may not be able to be treated with a fixed dose of antihypertensive medication. These individuals may particularly benefit from frequent home blood pressure monitoring (see the preceding section Approach to out-of-office blood pressure monitoring), including instructions on antihypertensive medication–holding parameters and appropriate supplemental dosing of antihypertensive medications for fluctuations in blood pressures related to chemotherapy administration and side effects.

Consideration of medication interactions, interfering substances, and polypharmacy

Currently, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and diltiazem are avoided because they use cytochrome p450 3A4, a feature shared by many chemotherapy agents, risking potentiation of chemotherapy toxicity by inhibiting chemotherapy drug metabolism.

In some individuals undergoing active cancer treatment, the blood pressure cannot be controlled even with multiple antihypertensive agents. In this case, it is reasonable to discuss with the oncologist and the patient a trial of chemotherapy dose reduction, or a chemotherapeutic holiday period. It is also reasonable to consider dose reduction or temporary discontinuation of other therapeutic agents that may be contributing to high blood pressures, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, erythropoietin-stimulating agents, and high-dose corticosteroids.

Polypharmacy is common in cancer patients. In individuals who require > 1 agent to achieve adequate blood pressure control, it is reasonable to use fixed-dose combinations of first-line agents to minimize pill burden and optimize adherence.

### Low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and the risk of acute myocardial infarction in COPD [^188eda5e]. The European Respiratory Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Inflammation plays a major role in the development and complications of atherosclerosis. Here, the dose-related impact of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), used for their anti-inflammatory properties, on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is studied in a cohort of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Saskatchewan (Canada) health services databases were used to form a population-based cohort of 5,648 patients, ≥ 55 yrs, who received a first treatment for COPD between 1990 and 1997. A nested case-control analysis was conducted, where 371 cases presenting with a first AMI were matched with 1,864 controls, based on the date of cohort entry and age. A conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of ICS, after adjusting for use of oral corticosteroids, severity of COPD, sex, systemic hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. ICS were used in the prior year by 42.2% of cases and 46.4% of controls. Overall, current use of ICS was not associated with a significant decrease in the risk of AMI. However, a 32% reduction in the risk of AMI was observed for doses ranging 50–200 microg x day(-1). In conclusion, very low doses of inhaled corticosteroids may be associated with a reduction in the risk of acute myocardial infarction.

Children and adolescents with HIV — adjunct therapies and corticosteroids: We suggest using ACE inhibitors or ARBs to treat proteinuric nephropathy in children with HIV infection and suggest their use as first-line therapy for hypertension in these children; because HIV-infected children with proteinuria may be at greater risk for salt wasting and prone to dehydration, ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be used with caution in children (weak, very low). We suggest that corticosteroids not be used in children with HIVAN (weak, very low).

### Advancements in bullous pemphigoid treatment: a comprehensive pipeline update [^c262a081]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Therapy

BP treatment can be very challenging as BP is a chronic disease requiring long-term management. Glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of BP treatment. High-dose systemic corticosteroids are used to induce remission, followed by gradual tapering (Table 1). However, BP is a chronic disease and therefore frequently requires long-term use of systemic corticosteroids, which may cause a variety of adverse effects, such as hypertension, bone fracture, cataract, gastrointestinal discomfort and metabolic conditions (e.g. weight gain, hyperglycemia).

Table 1
Synopsis of the current treatment options in bullous pemphigoid

BP bullous pemphigoid, BPDAI Bullous Pemphigoid Disease Area Index, IL interleukin, IL-4RA alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor, Ig immunoglobulin, DEJ dermo-epidermal junction, C5 complement 5, C5aR1 Complement 5a receptor 1, C1s complement 1s, IL interleukin, IL-5RA alpha subunit of the interleukin-5 receptor, FcRN neonatal Fc receptor, JAK Janus kinase, PsA psoriatic arthritis

Consequently, one of the key principles in the management of BP is to reduce the patient's exposure to systemic glucocorticoids. Using high potency topical corticosteroids, such as clobetasol propionate, as a topical regimen may have similar efficacy but is often difficult to realize in the home-setting of elderly patients. Corticosteroid-sparing adjuvant agents are prescribed when monotherapy with glucocorticoids is inadequate to achieve disease control or when there is a relapse during corticosteroid tapering. Moreover, these drugs are considered if there are contraindications to oral corticosteroids or existing comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis and psychosis. The choice of adjuvant agents depends on the availability, price, practical experience of the treating clinician, and the presence of specific contraindications. For BP, the adjuvant agents may include (Table 1):
azathioprine – depending on thiopurine methyltransferase activity;
doxycycline – alone or in combination with daily oral nicotinamide;
mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid;
methotrexate – which may eventually be used as a monotherapy also;
dapsone;
cyclosporin;
rituximab.

However, certain patients remain irresponsive to conventional therapies, highlighting a pressing demand for treatments with reduced adverse effects and enhanced efficacy.

The aim of this review was to summarize and discuss the novel targeted BP treatment options that have been developed and tested in clinical trials in recent years, based on the complex pathophysiology of BP.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^6affc873]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment-emergent adverse events

Two studies (n = 247) assessed the risk of treatment-emergent adverse events. The list of adverse events included (but was not limited to) hyperglycemia, hypertension, secondary infection, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, acute psychiatric illness requiring a consultation, an invasive procedure, or initiation of a specific therapy. The studies revealed a statistically significant increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use versus no oral steroid (RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.16–2.34; P = 0.006). There was low certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 174 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 43 more to 359 more).

Summary

Based on the five critical outcomes using RCT evidence and completion of the GRADE evidence table, the overall certainty of evidence was judged to be "low" and this certainty was assigned to the final recommendation as per GRADE guidance.

Committee discussion

The panel believed that maintenance oral steroid therapy has not been shown in clinical trials to improve clinical outcomes, and the available evidence suggests that chronic oral steroid therapy has a potential for harm. Two RCTs revealed an increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use, suggesting excess adverse events (harms) in patients who are prescribed daily oral steroids. However, this recommendation was based on RCTs that had small sample sizes, a small number of events, short durations, and broad CIs around the point estimates. In addition, these studies occurred when there was a paucity of medications available for maintenance therapy. The quality of the underlying evidence was poor, and therefore the panel believed that a recommendation in favor of maintenance oral steroid use would be problematic given the concerns surrounding patient safety. The panel also believed that well-informed patients would place a greater value on avoiding the potential harms of adverse events and less value on the uncertain benefits of decreased dyspnea and hospital admissions.

After considering these issues and the low certainty of the evidence, the panel concluded that in patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations, the balance of benefits of maintenance oral steroid therapy did not outweigh the risks when compared with no steroid use. Given that the panel recommended against the intervention, issues related to feasibility, acceptability, and health equity were not discussed.

### Steroids as treatment for glomerulonephritis: time for a rethink [^d84269a2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids have been a cornerstone of treatment for inflammatory and autoimmune kidney diseases for almost 70years, yet it is fair to say, we still do not know how 'best' to use them. Significant adverse events are associated with their continued use, which contribute to premature patient mortality. Steroid avoidance or minimization is possible and has been tested in various glomerular diseases, as a result of novel agents or innovative regimens using established therapeutics. It is now time to seriously address our use of steroids and educate physicians on better ways of managing inflammatory kidney diseases.

Sensitivity analyses

CPRD data can be linked to secondary care data and area-based datasets where practices consent to linkage, with 58% of all practices currently consenting to linkage. For those practices, data were linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics outpatient data and practice level deprivation data. This allowed additional adjustment for healthcare utilization and socioeconomic status in a subpopulation. Healthcare utilization was measured as a proxy for disease severity where a person was considered to have high disease activity if they had more than three rheumatology outpatient visits per year. Socioeconomic status was measured using quintiles of English Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2015. Further sensitivity analyses using a stricter definition of hypertension were conducted, where only those with a Read code for hypertension and at least two antihypertensive medication prescriptions within 6 months either side of the Read code were considered hypertensive.

### Budesonide (eohilia) [^979e8f38]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Effect on Growth

Use of corticosteroids may cause a reduction of growth velocity in pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients on EOHILIA. The maximum recommended duration of treatment with EOHILIA is 12 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.5 Symptoms of Steroid Withdrawal in Patients Transferred from Other Systemic Corticosteroids

Monitor patients who are transferred from corticosteroid treatment with high systemic effects to corticosteroids with lower systemic availability, such as EOHILIA, since symptoms attributed to withdrawal of steroid therapy, including those of acute adrenal axis suppression or benign intracranial hypertension, may develop. Adrenocortical function monitoring may be required in these patients and the dose of corticosteroid treatment with high systemic effects should be reduced cautiously.

Replacement of systemic corticosteroids with EOHILIA may unmask allergies (e.g., rhinitis and eczema), which were previously controlled by the systemic drug.

5.6 Other Corticosteroid Effects

Monitor patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, glaucoma or cataracts, or with a family history of diabetes or glaucoma, or with any other condition where corticosteroids may have unwanted effects.

5.7 Kaposi's Sarcoma

Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi's sarcoma. The maximum recommended duration of treatment with EOHILIA is 12 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

### Burden of asthma by severity and exacerbation frequency among adult patients naive to biologic asthma therapy: a Finnish cohort study [^75a7f47c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma, per se, associates with an increased mortality rate. The mortality rate of 0.029 PPY (29/1000 patient year) in patients with severe and frequently exacerbating asthma is higher than that observed in other studies, ranging from 5–9/1000 patient years in asthma to 12–25/1000 patient years in severe asthma. These estimates have not considered exacerbation frequency and the patients have been on average almost 10 years younger compared with those in our study. Little to no data exist on patients with nonsevere asthma and frequent exacerbations, with a mortality rate of 0.027 (27/1000 patient years) in this study, almost as high as in corresponding patients with severe asthma. Notably, when comparing patients with frequent exacerbations (nonsevere/severe asthma) with patients with nonsevere asthma and infrequent exacerbations, not only respiratory mortality was increased, but also mortality due to cardiovascular and other causes.

Existing literature supports the role of high doses of corticosteroids affecting comorbidities such as metabolic conditions, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. However, emerging evidence suggests that asthma and exacerbation-related systemic inflammation associate with extrapulmonary conditions such as depression, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic diseases. Thus, both inflammation and corticosteroid-related adverse events could be the potential link between exacerbations and the increased disease burden and mortality evidenced in this study.

Encouraging results of treating inflammation in other conditions come from anti–TNF-α drugs, where the treatment of one inflammatory condition may alleviate the other. For example, anti–TNF-α drugs in inflammatory bowel disease have improved not only the condition but also coexisting mood disorders. Whether biologic therapies would result in similar multiorgan benefits in the asthma population remains a topic for future studies.

### Glucocorticoid use is associated with an increased risk of hypertension [^55660568]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoid association with hypertension

In those exposed to GCs there were 1321 cases of incident hypertension with an incidence rate of 87.6 per 1000 pyrs. In those unexposed there were 4922 cases with an incidence rate of 59.7 per 1000 pyrs. (Table 2).

2
Number of cases and rate of hypertension by GC status

The unadjusted Cox proportional hazards model for recent GC use showed GC use was associated with a 44% increased hazard of hypertension [hazard ratio (HR) 1.44; 95% CI: 1.35, 1.53]; when fully adjusted this was attenuated to 17% increased hazard but remained statistically significant (HR 1.17; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.24). The unadjusted model for categories of recent exposure dosage showed all GC dosage categories were associated with hypertension. When fully adjusted, only doses of ≥ 7.5 mg were statistically significant, indicating increased hazard of hypertension (7.5–14.9 mg: HR 1.18; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.29; ≥ 15 mg: HR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.18, 1.56). Doses < 7.5 mg had increased hazard but were not statistically significant. The unadjusted model for categories of cumulative dose showed all categories were significantly associated with hypertension, but when fully adjusted there was no clear pattern. Only the category of 5–9.99 g was statistically significant, though10 g had a similar point estimate (Table 3). Point estimates for the covariates in the adjusted models were in the expected direction, with leflunomide having the biggest effect and NSAIDs having a similar magnitude of effect on hypertension as recent GC use (supplementary Table S1, available at Rheumatology online).

Possible surveillance bias

When the cohort follow-up was censored to 2 years, most patients (73%) had at least 2 years' follow-up. The majority of the cohort did not use GCs during this period (n = 12 124, 68.3%), 3461 (19.5%) had intermittent use and 2175 (12.3%) had continuous use. There were no differences in the frequency of BP measurements between the groups (Table 4 and Fig. 2), suggesting that surveillance bias was not present. 2

### Drug-related hypertension and resistance to antihypertensive treatment: a call for action [^d6dd83bb]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Several drugs can cause hypertension and/or blunt the effect of antihypertensive treatment. They can exacerbate a previously well controlled hypertension and/or render it resistant to therapy. Accordingly, drugs represent a common cause of resistance of hypertension to treatment. Identification of drug-related hypertension can be achieved with a thorough medical history targeted to ascertain concurrent therapies that are prescribed for conditions other than cardiovascular diseases. This can avoid prescribing a more aggressive antihypertensive treatment and may prevent embarking in costly and sometimes invasive diagnostic procedures. Drugs that commonly raise blood pressure include NSAIDs, steroids, oestroprogestinic agents, immunosuppressants, erythropoietin, inhibitors of angiogenesis, anti-HIV agents, and also some high-density lipoprotein-raising agents. As withdrawal of the offending drug is often impracticable, knowledge of the mechanism(s) by which each drug exerts its pressor effects may help selecting the most effective treatment. Purpose of this review is to examine the most common causes of resistant hypertension that are due to drugs or abuse of substances along with their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The strategy for selecting the most appropriate treatment and the reasons for 'a call of action' of research in this area are also examined.

### Interventional procedures and future drug therapy for hypertension [^3677f69e]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Immunity and inflammation

It has been recognized that immunity contributes to human hypertension. Numerous stimuli involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension (e.g. angiotensin II, salt, and catecholamines) are also recognized to impact upon T lymphocytes (both number and type such as T regulatory/helper) and derived cytokines production (IL-17, IFN-γ, TNF-α, or IL-6) leading to both sustained BP elevation (through enhanced sodium retention, SNS activation, or increased vascular resistance) and end organ damage. Antihypertensive therapies are known to influence these factors such as MRA (spironolactone). Moreover, hypertension, by increasing oxidative stress, also contributes to immune activation in hypertension through mechanisms involving dendritic cells. However, in trials investigating drugs known to affect these pathways or cells (e.g. in the field of psoriasis), immunomodulation had no effect on BP. These observations potentially suggest a more active role of B lymphocytes and the need to further pursue our understanding of the interaction between immunity and BP. Abatacept, a fusion protein known to inhibit T-cell activation and used in various inflammatory condition, is currently being investigated as an adjunctive therapy in resistant hypertension (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02232880).

Dietary management of hypertension

A diet emphasizing flavonoid-rich fruits and vegetables achieves a BP reduction of approximately half that observed with the DASH diet. The major pharmacodynamic effect was restoration of endothelial function, either directly, by affecting nitric oxide levels, or indirectly, through other pathways (i.e. antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, or acetylcholine -related). Quercetin has demonstrated the most consistent BP-lowering effect in animal and human studies, irrespective of dose, duration, or disease status. However, further research on the safety and efficacy of the flavonoids is required before any of them can be used by humans, presumably in supplement form, at the doses required for therapeutic benefit.

### How we escalate vasopressor and corticosteroid therapy in patients with septic shock [^74b33430]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Septic shock is defined by the need for vasopressor agents to correct hypotension and lactic acidosis resulting from infection, with 30%-40% case fatality rates. The care of patients with worsening septic shock involves multiple treatment decisions involving vasopressor choices and adjunctive treatments. In this edition of "How I Do It", we provide a case-based discussion of common clinical decisions regarding choice of first-line vasopressor, BP targets, route of vasopressor delivery, use of secondary vasopressors, and adjunctive medications. We also consider diagnostic approaches, treatment, and monitoring strategies for the patient with worsening shock, as well as approaches to difficult weaning of vasopressors.

### Ketoprofen [^17c44edf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Ketoprofen capsules cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.

If steroid dosage is reduced or eliminated during therapy, it should be reduced slowly and the patients observed closely for any evidence of adverse effects, including adrenal insufficiency and exacerbation of symptoms of arthritis.

The pharmacological activity of ketoprofen capsules in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.

Ketoprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause nephritis in mice and rats associated with chronic administration. Rare cases of interstitial nephritis or nephrotic syndrome have been reported in humans with ketoprofen since it has been marketed.

A second form of renal toxicity has been seen in patients with conditions leading to a reduction in renal blood flow or blood volume, where renal prostaglandins have a supportive role in the maintenance of renal blood flow. In these patients, administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug results in a dose-dependent decrease in prostaglandin synthesis and, secondarily, in renal blood flow which may precipitate overt renal failure. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, and the elderly. Discontinuation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy is typically followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

The exact mechanism by which glucocorticoid induces hypertension is unclear. Several mechanisms have been proposed, although there is evidence against the role of sodium and water retention as well as sympathetic nerve activation. This review highlights the role of nitric oxide-redox imbalance and their interactions with arachidonic acid metabolism in glucocorticoid-induced hypertension in humans and experimental animal models.

### Glucocorticoid use is associated with an increased risk of hypertension [^c7639410]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This was a large retrospective cohort study using routinely collected data with a number of strengths. The use of prescription data allowed more precise measurement of time-varying GC use, and a variety of attribution models were used to test the impact of our assumptions when preparing the data. Hypertension diagnosis has not been consistently defined across the few studies using CPRD data, and in our study hypertension was identified through BP measurements or a Read code and antihypertensive prescriptions. This definition has been validated in Spanish primary care electronic health records and allowed a more robust identification of the outcome. As anti-hypertensive medication can be prescribed for other indications, it was important to use both Read code for hypertension and antihypertensive medication prescriptions to ensure antihypertensive medication was not prescribed for another indication.

Alongside these strengths there are some limitations. Misclassification of medication use is a possibility; as CPRD data only contains prescriptions, we do not know if these medications were dispensed. However, we used a number of attribution models to allow for potential differences in when prescriptions would be dispensed. This study was designed specifically to examine incident hypertension and thus included only patients without prior hypertension. Further work is needed to understand how GCs may affect BP in those already diagnosed with hypertension. Although we need to be careful of over-interpretation of covariate point estimates, the variables adjusted for were in the expected direction. However, there are some variables that cannot be measured in CPRD: disease severity is not available. However, currently there is no evidence that high disease activity is associated with high BP, suggesting that confounding by indication is less of a concern. There is not a validated proxy for disease severity in CPRD; however, we have conducted a sensitivity analysis using a pragmatic proxy for disease severity and this did not alter the results. As biologics are prescribed in secondary care this is not well captured in CPRD. TNF inhibitors have been shown to reduce BP; however, it has been shown that those prescribed biologics are more likely to have received GCs. As we would expect GCs to increase BP, if TNF inhibitors are prescribed more frequently in those prescribed GCs we would expect the effect of GCs on BP to be underestimated. Therefore any unmeasured confounding would not explain our positive findings.

### Vamorolone (Agamree) [^77010de8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation

Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including AGAMREE. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection.

Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with AGAMREE. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy.

Fungal Infections

Corticosteroids, including AGAMREE, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid AGAMREE use in the presence of such infections unless AGAMREE is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic AGAMREE therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, AGAMREE withdrawal or dosage reduction is recommended.

Amebiasis

Corticosteroids, including AGAMREE, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating AGAMREE in any patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea.

Strongyloides Infestation

Corticosteroids, including AGAMREE, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia.

Cerebral Malaria

Avoid corticosteroids, including AGAMREE, in patients with cerebral malaria.

5.3 Alterations in Cardiovascular/Renal Function

Corticosteroids, including AGAMREE, can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium and calcium.

Monitor blood pressure and assess for signs and symptoms of volume overload. Monitor serum potassium levels.

AGAMREE should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency. Literature reports suggest an association between use of corticosteroids and left free wall rupture after a recent myocardial infarction; therefore, therapy with AGAMREE should be used with great caution in these patients.

### Pre-eclampsia [^e0d932e8]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Pre-eclampsia is a major cause of maternal mortality (15–20% in developed countries) and morbidities (acute and long-term), perinatal deaths, preterm birth, and intrauterine growth restriction. Key findings support a causal or pathogenetic model of superficial placentation driven by immune maladaptation, with subsequently reduced concentrations of angiogenic growth factors and increased placental debris in the maternal circulation resulting in a (mainly hypertensive) maternal inflammatory response. The final phenotype, maternal pre-eclamptic syndrome, is further modulated by pre-existing maternal cardiovascular or metabolic fitness. Currently, women at risk are identified on the basis of epidemiological and clinical risk factors, but the diagnostic criteria of pre-eclampsia remain unclear, with no known biomarkers. Treatment is still prenatal care, timely diagnosis, proper management, and timely delivery. Many interventions to lengthen pregnancy (eg, treatment for mild hypertension, plasma-volume expansion, and corticosteroid use) have a poor evidence base. We review findings on the diagnosis, risk factors, and pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia and the present status of its prediction, prevention, and management.

### Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 [^9e3b98b8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID-19 because they counter hyper-inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. So far, systemic corticosteroids are one of the few treatment options for COVID-19. Nonetheless, size of effect, certainty of the evidence, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated.

Objectives

To assess whether systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19, and to keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 16 April 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, participant age, gender or ethnicity. We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids. We included the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (plus/minus placebo), dose comparisons, timing comparisons (early versus late), different types of corticosteroids and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome), corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long-COVID treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, ventilator-free days, new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, quality of life, serious adverse events, adverse events, and hospital-acquired infections.

Main Results

We included 11 RCTs in 8075 participants, of whom 7041 (87%) originated from high-income countries. A total of 3072 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority received dexamethasone (n = 2322). We also identified 42 ongoing studies and 16 studies reported as being completed or terminated in a study registry, but without results yet. Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care plus/minus placebo We included 10 RCTs (7989 participants), one of which did not report any of our pre-specified outcomes and thus our analysis included outcome data from nine studies. All-cause mortality (at longest follow-up available): systemic corticosteroids plus standard care probably reduce all-cause mortality slightly in people with COVID-19 compared to standard care alone (median 28 days: risk difference of 30 in 1000 participants fewer than the control group rate of 275 in 1000 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.00; 9 RCTs, 7930 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Ventilator-free days: corticosteroids may increase ventilator-free days (MD 2.6 days more than control group rate of 4 days, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.53; 1 RCT, 299 participants; low-certainty evidence). Ventilator-free days have inherent limitations as a composite endpoint and should be interpreted with caution. New need for invasive ventilation: the evidence is of very low certainty. Because of high risk of bias arising from deaths that occurred before ventilation we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics. Quality of life/neurological outcome: no data were available. Serious adverse events: we included data on two RCTs (678 participants) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids compared to standard care (plus/minus placebo); for adverse events and hospital-acquired infections, we included data on five RCTs (660 participants). Because of high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and underreporting we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics (very low-certainty evidence). Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids We identified one study that compared methylprednisolone with dexamethasone. The evidence for mortality and new need for invasive mechanical ventilation is very low certainty due to the small number of participants (n = 86). No data were available for the other outcomes. We did not identify comparisons of different dosages or timing. Outpatients with asymptomatic or mild disease Currently, there are no studies published in populations with asymptomatic infection or mild disease.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence shows that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly reduce all-cause mortality in people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID-19. Low-certainty evidence suggests that there may also be a reduction in ventilator-free days. Since we are unable to adjust for the impact of early death on subsequent endpoints, the findings for ventilation outcomes and harms have limited applicability to inform treatment decisions. Currently, there is no evidence for asymptomatic or mild disease (non-hospitalised participants). There is an urgent need for good-quality evidence for specific subgroups of disease severity, for which we propose level of respiratory support at randomisation. This applies to the comparison or subgroups of different types and doses of corticosteroids, too. Outcomes apart from mortality should be measured and analysed appropriately taking into account confounding through death if applicable. We identified 42 ongoing and 16 completed but not published RCTs in trials registries suggesting possible changes of effect estimates and certainty of the evidence in the future. Most ongoing studies target people who need respiratory support at baseline. With the living approach of this review, we will continue to update our search and include eligible trials and published data.

### Dexamethasone [^82274653]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PEDIATRIC USE

The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the pediatric population are based on the well-established course of effect of corticosteroids, which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome (patients > 2 years of age), and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (patients > 1 month of age). Other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroids, e.g., severe asthma and wheezing, are based on adequate and well-controlled trials conducted in adults, on the premises that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology are considered to be substantially similar in both populations.

The adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection, psychosocial disturbances, thromboembolism, peptic ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. Pediatric patients who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression (i.e., cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels). Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of pediatric patients treated with corticosteroids should be monitored, and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, pediatric patients should be titrated to the lowest effective dose.

GERIATRIC USE

Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. In particular, the increased risk of diabetes mellitus, fluid retention and hypertension in elderly patients treated with corticosteroids should be considered.

Glucocorticoids remain a valuable and necessary component of therapy for many diseases. Nonetheless, sustained glucocorticoid treatment increases potential for future cardiovascular disease through multiple pathways, resulting in a tradeoff between benefit and harm. This article explores the potential mechanisms of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. Interactions between glucocorticoids and other potential cardiovascular risk factors are also reviewed. Safe, alternate strategies for minimizing the need for glucocorticoids are urgently needed.

Corticosteroids, including TARPEYO, may exacerbate ocular herpes simplex virus infections; therefore, avoid TARPEYO use in the presence of such infections.

Kaposi's Sarcoma

Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi's sarcoma.

Immunizations

Corticosteroid therapy, including TARPEYO, may decrease the immune response to some vaccines.

5.3 Other Corticosteroid Effects

TARPEYO is a systemically available corticosteroid and is expected to cause related adverse reactions. Monitor patients with hypertension, prediabetes, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, glaucoma or cataracts, or with a family history of diabetes or glaucoma, or with any other condition where corticosteroids may have unwanted effects.

### Short-term systemic corticosteroids: appropriate use in… [^5bcf8b36]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

3 Prescribing oral corticosteroids in short courses may seem to be free from significant adverse effects; however, a large national data set of private insurance claims, which included approximately 1. 5 million people, showed that a short course of oral steroids was associated with an increased risk of sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and fracture in the five to 30 days after steroid initiation compared with those who had not received a short course of steroids. 1 The estimated number needed to harm after a short course of steroids was 140 for fracture, 454 for venous thromboembolism, and 1, 250 for sepsis. There are also case reports of avascular necrosis developing after even one course of systemic steroids. 4, 5 It is well understood that short-term systemic steroids can cause hyperglycemia, elevated blood pressure, immunocompromised state, mood and sleep disturbance, and fat necrosis when injected.

Acute Bronchitis Short-term systemic corticosteroids are often prescribed for patients with acute bronchitis. Acute Pharyngitis Short-term systemic corticosteroids may provide some benefit for patients with peritonsillar abscess. 13 Current allergy society guidelines do not recommend systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, especially because nasal steroids are effective for this condition and do not have systemic side effects. 14, 15 Before the wide adoption of nasal steroid use, a group in Denmark found a higher rate of diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis in patients who had received repeated steroid intramuscular systemic injections for allergic rhinitis compared with those who received allergy immunotherapy. 16 In summary, a short course of systemic steroids is not recommended for allergic rhinitis.

Corticosteroids could potentially increase the risk of secondary bacterial skin infection, which is a possible complication of herpes zoster. 33, 34 Steroids should not be used without antivirals, may help decrease acute pain for zoster when used concomitantly with antivirals, and do not reduce the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia. Research is needed to determine whether there is a role for steroid use after antiviral therapy in those with recalcitrant symptoms. Given the lack of clear effectiveness for steroids and possible adverse effects, routine steroid use for zoster is not supported by evidence.

### GLP-1 based therapies and disease course of inflammatory bowel disease [^fd296d0a]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic intestinal diseases affecting millions of individuals worldwide. The diseases often occur during early adulthood, and many patients experience a life-long disease course with relapsing and remitting inflammation of their gut. Although the aetiology is not fully understood, the development of both CD and UC is believed to be caused by uncontrolled inflammation and immune dysregulation in individuals who are genetically predisposed.

The prevalence of multimorbidity is increasing, and patients with IBD may experience coexisting conditions, such as diabetes. Management of multimorbidity is challenging on many levels. Regarding co-medication, treatment of one condition may be contraindicated for another condition (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use in patients with severe renal disease). However, it is also possible that treatment of one chronic condition will have a positive impact on a concurrent chronic condition (e.g. metoprolol treatment for hypertension and essential tremor).

Participants and methods

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), defined by fasting glycaemia ≥ 126 mg/dL, and free from cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory diseases, medication and/or any health condition that might affect the inflammatory markers, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), were recruited from primary healthcare centers in Gaza City, Palestinian Territories. Seven centers were approached in Gaza City via cluster random sampling to obtain the data concerning the study. Medical history was investigated by the physicians. From the 484 screened patients, 109 individuals (51 men, 58 women), aged between 28 and 60 years, were eligible to participate in the study. All participants had a stable weight, or no fluctuation of more than 2% of their weight, for at least 2 months prior to the study. The enrollment of the participants in the study was performed between November 2013 and May 2014.

Exclusion criteria include

Pre-existing cardiovascular diseases: Hypertension, atherosclerosis, coagulation, open heart surgery, coronary artery disease and/or any other major adverse cardiac event,
Inflammatory diseases: Autoimmune diseases,
Any health condition that might affect the inflammatory markers, interleukin 6 and CRP: Allergies, asthma, malignancies, as well as liver, renal, respiratory, thyroid and/or acute infectious diseases.
Using medication to treat cardiovascular and inflammatory conditions such as statin's cholesterol-lowering agent, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, and corticosteroids as anti-inflammtory drugs.
