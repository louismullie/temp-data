## Question

Monomeric prolactin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about monomeric prolactin, including its definition, biological activity, prevalence, clinical significance, and how to distinguish it from macroprolactin using laboratory methods and interpretation strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the molecular forms of prolactin and which is biologically active. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and prevalence of macroprolactin and why it causes pseudo-hyperprolactinemia. Next, I will review the clinical implications and guideline-based recommendations for screening. After that, I need to examine laboratory methods, including PEG precipitation and gel filtration chromatography, and how to interpret results. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like pregnancy, drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, and the hook effect, and close with a practical clinical algorithm and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the molecular forms of prolactin in circulation. Prolactin circulates as monomeric prolactin (approximately 23 kDa), dimeric or "big" prolactin (about 50 kDa), and polymeric "big-big" prolactin, also called macroprolactin (typically > 100 kDa), with monomeric prolactin accounting for roughly 80–95% of total immunoreactive prolactin in healthy individuals and carrying essentially all of the biological activity in vivo [^113uXCJw] [^112MtZia] [^114LdS4i].

> Wait, let me verify the biological activity claim before I proceed. I initially thought macroprolactin might be completely inactive, but I should be precise: macroprolactin has markedly reduced or negligible in vivo bioactivity due to its large size, impaired tissue access, and antibody complexing, even though it retains immunoreactivity and can appear falsely elevated on immunoassays; homologous human receptor bioassays and clinical observations support low in vivo activity despite occasional in vitro signals, so I should correct my earlier overstatement to "biologically inactive or minimally active in vivo" rather than "completely inactive" [^112fNvvk] [^114APjB3] [^114LdS4i].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology of macroprolactin. Macroprolactin is most commonly a prolactin–IgG complex driven by anti-prolactin autoantibodies, which slows renal clearance and prolongs half-life, leading to accumulation of high-molecular-weight complexes that are detected by immunoassays but have limited access to target tissues. This creates a biochemical hyperprolactinemia without the expected clinical syndrome of true hyperprolactinemia [^113uXCJw] [^114LdS4i] [^114woE79].

> Next, I should review prevalence to frame pretest probability. The prevalence of macroprolactinemia among hyperprolactinemic patients varies by population and method, with reports ranging from about 10% to 45%, and some large series suggesting approximately 20–25%; importantly, macroprolactinemia can also be found in a small proportion of apparently healthy individuals, reinforcing the need to verify elevated prolactin results before committing to imaging or therapy [^113vci6N] [^117FbkeK] [^113V8MhD] [^1122jAff].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptoms. I need to check how often macroprolactinemia is asymptomatic and whether clinical features can distinguish it from true hyperprolactinemia. Many patients with macroprolactinemia are asymptomatic or have mild, nonspecific symptoms, and clinical features alone cannot reliably distinguish macroprolactinemia from true hyperprolactinemia; long-term follow-up cohorts show no progression of hyperprolactinemic symptoms when monomeric prolactin is normal, supporting the benign nature of isolated macroprolactinemia [^113uXCJw] [^1154fnNT] [^1131btk9].

> Let me consider the clinical implications and guideline stance. Failure to recognize macroprolactinemia leads to unnecessary MRI, inappropriate dopamine agonist therapy, and patient anxiety; the Endocrine Society suggests assessing for macroprolactin in asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia, and contemporary reproductive endocrinology guidance similarly recommends macroprolactin evaluation in selected scenarios to avoid unnecessary imaging and treatment, with cost-effectiveness demonstrated when screening is implemented [^1122jAff] [^115qEEwo] [^115dXdb8] [^1131btk9].

> I should confirm the laboratory methods next. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation is the most widely used screening approach because it is simple, inexpensive, and correlates reasonably with gel filtration chromatography; typical protocols use 20–25% PEG 6000, mix serum 1:1 with PEG, centrifuge, and assay the supernatant, correcting for dilution, with recovery thresholds commonly set around 40–60% to flag macroprolactin; however, I need to ensure the lab has validated its own reference intervals and recovery cutoffs because inter-laboratory variability is substantial [^113DSKe3] [^1179xr7x] [^114LdS4i].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said PEG is the gold standard. Let me correct that. Gel filtration chromatography (GFC) remains the reference method for characterizing molecular forms and confirming macroprolactin, but it is labor-intensive, slow, and not widely available. When PEG recovery is borderline or results are discordant with the clinical picture, GFC should be used to resolve ambiguity [^114LdS4i] [^112MtZia].

> I need to ensure proper interpretation of results. A high post-PEG recovery, typically above 60%, argues against significant macroprolactin, whereas recovery below about 40–50% suggests macroprolactin predominance. However, relying solely on percent recovery can misclassify patients with mixed macroprolactin plus elevated monomeric prolactin, so the most rigorous approach is to report the absolute monomeric prolactin concentration after PEG against a lab-validated post-PEG reference interval, which improves specificity and avoids overtreatment [^117FbkeK] [^113kyuZK] [^1131btk9].

> But wait, what if the total prolactin is very high and the MRI shows a large sellar mass; could this be a hook effect? I should double-check for assay interference. In the setting of a large pituitary tumor with unexpectedly modest prolactin elevation, serial dilution of the serum sample is recommended to exclude a hook effect, which can artifactually lower immunoassay readings and obscure true hyperprolactinemia; conversely, in asymptomatic patients with mild prolactin elevations, screening for macroprolactin should precede imaging to avoid unnecessary MRI [^113KpDLA] [^115rhMjQ] [^1122jAff].

> Let me review special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, prolactin rises 10-fold and the contribution of macroprolactin is generally low, so routine macroprolactin screening is not indicated unless the clinical context is atypical. In drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, the first step is to reassess medications and consider substitution if feasible, reserving MRI for cases where medication cannot be withdrawn and the onset does not coincide with therapy. For incidental pituitary findings, measuring prolactin is essential, with attention to dilution to avoid a hook effect and to macroprolactin if results and imaging are discordant [^111a8Y4a] [^1178pcVQ] [^1115gKUp].

> I should confirm the practical clinical algorithm. When hyperprolactinemia is confirmed, assess symptoms and medications. If asymptomatic or the presentation is discordant, screen for macroprolactin with PEG precipitation and interpret using lab-validated post-PEG monomeric reference intervals. If monomeric prolactin is normal, macroprolactinemia is established and no further workup is needed. If monomeric prolactin is elevated, proceed with pituitary MRI and manage true hyperprolactinemia accordingly, including dopamine agonist therapy when indicated and follow-up per guidelines [^1122jAff] [^117C9ZiC] [^116p6gtU].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up and monitoring. Once macroprolactinemia is diagnosed and monomeric prolactin is normal, long-term follow-up studies show no symptomatic progression, so routine endocrine surveillance is generally unnecessary; however, if clinical features evolve or new medications are introduced, reassessment may be warranted, and repeating macroprolactin testing is rarely needed unless the clinical context changes substantially [^1154fnNT] [^1156h5Vk].

> In summary, monomeric prolactin is the 23 kDa, biologically active isoform that mediates reproductive and metabolic effects. Macroprolactin, a high-molecular-weight, largely inactive complex, commonly causes pseudo-hyperprolactinemia and cannot be distinguished clinically from true hyperprolactinemia, so PEG precipitation with reporting of monomeric prolactin against validated reference intervals is the recommended approach to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment [^113uXCJw] [^117FbkeK] [^1122jAff].

Monomeric prolactin is the **23 kDa, biologically active form** of prolactin that accounts for most circulating activity and is responsible for lactation and reproductive effects [^114LdS4i]. It is the key analyte for diagnosing true hyperprolactinemia, as macroprolactin (PRL–IgG complexes) is inactive and can cause assay interference [^116bHouj]. Routine screening for macroprolactin with polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation is recommended in asymptomatic or mildly elevated prolactin cases to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary imaging or treatment [^1122jAff] [^115qEEwo]. Monomeric prolactin is measured by immunoassays after PEG precipitation or by gel filtration chromatography, with PEG being the practical first-line screen [^117N9YYy] [^117FbkeK].

## Molecular structure and properties

- **Molecular weight**: Approximately 23 kDa [^112MtZia].
- **Structure**: Single-chain polypeptide with three intramolecular disulfide bonds [^112MtZia].
- **Biological activity**: Predominant active form; mediates lactation, reproductive regulation, and metabolic effects [^11233yxN].

---

## Physiological roles

Physiologically, monomeric prolactin **regulates lactation** by initiating and maintaining milk production postpartum and modulates reproductive function by inhibiting gonadotropin-releasing hormone, thereby affecting menstrual cycles and fertility [^114LdS4i]. It also influences metabolism, appetite, and fat deposition [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance

Clinically, monomeric prolactin is central to diagnosing **true hyperprolactinemia** — elevated levels cause galactorrhea, amenorrhea, infertility, and hypogonadism — and to distinguishing it from macroprolactin-related pseudohyperprolactinemia [^1122jAff]. Accurate measurement prevents misdiagnosis and inappropriate therapy [^1131btk9].

---

## Laboratory measurement

- **Immunoassays**: Commonly used but susceptible to interference from macroprolactin [^114LdS4i].
- **PEG precipitation**: Simple, inexpensive screening to remove macroprolactin; recovery > 60% suggests true hyperprolactinemia [^117N9YYy] [^113DSKe3].
- **Gel filtration chromatography**: Gold standard for differentiating monomeric from macroprolactin; not widely available [^115D4Tzq].

---

## Clinical guidelines

Guidelines recommend screening for **macroprolactin** in asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia or when results and symptoms conflict [^1122jAff] [^115qEEwo]. Management should be based on **monomeric prolactin** levels to guide therapy and avoid unnecessary imaging or dopamine agonists [^117FbkeK].

---

## Clinical implications of elevated monomeric prolactin

Elevated monomeric prolactin reflects **true hyperprolactinemia** and warrants evaluation for prolactinomas, medications, hypothyroidism, renal impairment, or idiopathic causes [^1137snxN]. Persistent elevation can cause hypogonadism, infertility, and bone loss; management may include dopamine agonists, surgery, or radiotherapy [^115chvtj].

## Monomeric vs. macroprolactin

| **Feature** | **Monomeric prolactin** | **Macroprolactin** |
|-|-|-|
| Molecular weight | ~23 kDa | > 100 kDa |
| Biological activity | High | Low/none |
| Clinical symptoms | Present in true hyperprolactinemia | Usually asymptomatic |
| Assay interference | Minimal | Significant |
| Detection method | Immunoassays after PEG precipitation | PEG precipitation or gel filtration |

---

Monomeric prolactin is the **active hormone** responsible for lactation and reproduction; accurate measurement and differentiation from macroprolactin are essential to diagnose true hyperprolactinemia and guide appropriate management [^114LdS4i].

### The impact of metformin on plasma prolactin levels in antipsychotics-treated men with hyperprolactinemia and early-onset androgenic alopecia [^114fmVP5]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Objective

Metformin decreases elevated levels of pituitary hormones. Little is known about the association between the reproductive axis and hormonal effects of this drug. The purpose of our study was to investigate whether activity of the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐gonadal axis determines metformin action on prolactin levels in men with prolactin excess.

Design/Subjects/Measurements

This prospective cohort study included two groups of men with drug‐induced hyperprolactinemia and type 2 diabetes or prediabetes: men with normal hair growth (group A, n = 23) and men with late‐onset androgenic alopecia (group B; n = 22). Both groups, matched for age, HOMA‐IR, and prolactin concentration, were treated for 6 months with metformin. The outcomes of interest included glucose homeostasis markers (fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin and HOMA‐IR), plasma prolactin (both total and monomeric), other pituitary hormones (gonadotropins, TSH and ACTH), and peripheral hormones (testosterone, DHEAS and IGF‐1).

Results

Before metformin treatment, group B was characterized by higher values of LH, LH/FSH ratio, testosterone (total, free and bioavailable) and DHEAS compared to group A. Six‐month metformin treatment reduced fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin and HOMA‐IR in both groups, though this effect was more pronounced in group A. The decrease in total and monomeric prolactin was observed only in group A. Their degree correlated inversely with total, free and bioavailable testosterone, positively with baseline prolactin levels, and positively with the impact on HOMA‐IR. Compared to baseline values, follow‐up LH was higher in group A and lower in group B.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that androgen excess may attenuate metformin action on overactive lactotrophs in men with early‐onset androgenic alopecia.

### PEG precipitation to detect macro-TSH in clinical practice: a systematic review [^116GSSYr]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study focused on the only use of PEG precipitation in clinical practice for the diagnosis of macro‐TSH. Strengths of the study are the rigorous selection criteria applied, the figures derived from a huge number of patients, the various clinical setting investigated, and the low risk of bias of the included studies. Limitations are the heterogeneity of the study design considered and the non‐homogeneity of the available data.

### Laboratory and clinical experience in 55 patients with macroprolactinemia identified by a simple polyethylene glycol precipitation method [^116nVBBx]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

PRL exists in different forms in human serum. The predominant form is little PRL (molecular mass 23 kDa) with smaller amounts of big PRL (molecular mass 50–60 kDa) and at times big big or macroprolactin (molecular mass 150–170 kDa). The frequency and clinical consequences of macroprolactinemia have not been clearly established, mainly because of difficulty in identifying these patients biochemically. This previously required the use of gel filtration chromatography, which could not be used routinely. Recently, a screening test using polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been used to identify macroprolactin in serum. Consequently, this study was designed to examine the use of PEG precipitation in the identification of patients with a predominance of macroprolactin and to establish the clinical characteristics of such a cohort. Over 12 months, 18,258 requests for serum PRL were received and of these 1225 patients had a serum PRL more than 700 mU/L. A total of 322 of these patients (26%) had a percentage recovery after PEG precipitation of less than 40%, thus indicating the presence of a predominance of macroprolactin. Fifty-five of these patients were referred for detailed clinical assessment. Symptoms typical of hyperprolactinemia were not common in this cohort. None had sustained amenorrhea and eight have had oligomenorrhea at age less than 40 yr. One had galactorrhea. All had pituitary imaging, and four had a microadenoma with none having a macroadenoma. PEG precipitation allows easy identification of macroprolactin in routine clinical practice. As the clinical consequences of this entity at this stage seem relatively benign, referral and intensive investigation of these patients may not be necessary. However, follow-up of a large cohort is required to ensure that the long-term outlook is likewise benign. This would have important implications for both patients and healthcare systems.

### Incidence and clinical significance of elevated macroprolactin levels in patients with hyperprolactinemia [^117Rn3mi]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of patients with macroprolactinemia in an endocrinology practice at a tertiary care military medical center in the United States.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records of 40 patients who had been referred for evaluation of hyper-prolactinemia between June 2003 and August 2004 in whom macroprolactin had been measured.

Results

Of the 40 patients, 18 (9 men and 9 women) (45%) had an elevated macroprolactin level (mean, 75% of the total prolactin). The demographic characteristics of these patients were similar to those of patients with elevated monomeric prolactin. Most of the men with macro-prolactinemia (78%) had erectile dysfunction as the presenting complaint, whereas the most frequent symptom in women was menstrual irregularities (56%). Fifty percent of patients had no identifiable cause for their presenting complaint other than macroprolactinemia. Of the 18 patients with macroprolactinemia, 16 underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary, of whom 56% had normal findings. Of the patients with abnormal MRI findings, 57% had a microadenoma, and 43% had either an atrophic anterior lobe or a prominent hypophysis. No significant relationship was detected between MRI findings or symptoms and the presence of elevated macroprolactin levels. Approximately 40% of patients in the macroprolactin group were treated with a dopamine agonist, 28% of whom had normalization of the total prolactin level.

Conclusion

Although macroprolactin is commonly found in patients with hyperprolactinemia, neither symptoms nor MRI findings are useful in predicting its presence. Patients with macroprolactinemia often have symptoms similar to those in patients with elevation in monomeric prolactin. The clinical significance of macro-prolactinemia remains uncertain.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111a8Y4a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society hyperprolactinemia — serum prolactin testing during pregnancy advises: In pregnant patients with prolactinomas, we recommend against performing serum prolactin measurements during pregnancy. During pregnancy, serum prolactin levels increase 10-fold, reaching levels of 150 to 300 μg/liter by term, and the pituitary gland increases in volume more than 2-fold; after dopamine agonists are discontinued at the start of pregnancy, serum prolactin levels increase and subsequent increases do not accurately reflect changes in tumor growth or activity, prolactin may not increase during pregnancy in all patients with prolactinomas, and postpartum levels are frequently lower than before conception with hyperprolactinemia sometimes resolving entirely after pregnancy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117C9ZiC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Prolactinoma — first-line therapy and when not to treat: We recommend dopamine agonist therapy to lower prolactin levels, decrease tumor size, and restore gonadal function for symptomatic prolactin-secreting microadenomas or macroadenomas, and we recommend using cabergoline in preference to other dopamine agonists because it has higher efficacy in normalizing prolactin levels and a higher frequency of pituitary tumor shrinkage. We suggest that clinicians not treat asymptomatic patients harboring microprolactinomas with dopamine agonists, and we suggest treatment with a dopamine agonist or oral contraceptives for patients with microadenomas who have amenorrhea. We suggest that with careful clinical and biochemical follow-up, therapy may be tapered and perhaps discontinued after at least 2 yr in patients who no longer have elevated serum prolactin and have no visible tumor remnant on MRI.

### Comparison of urinary prolactin and serum / urine prolactin ratio in hyperprolactinemic and macroprolactinemic patients [^1154RDm5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Biologically, the monomeric form of prolactin is the most active. In measurement methods, all forms of prolactin are included in the assay; therefore, the presence of macroprolactin, causes a false increase in prolactin and misdiagnosis of hyperprolactinemia. It seems that if an alternative method can be used to check macroprolactin, it would be helpful. The study aims to investigate the urinary level of prolactin and its relationship with serum levels in cases of suspected macroprolactinemia and determine whether these tests can serve as a novel, non-invasive, accessible, and cost-effective tool for diagnosing macroprolactinemia.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, patients who visited the Tabriz Imam Reza hospital clinic (2020–2021) with elevated prolactin levels. Prolactin and creatinine were checked in the urine and blood samples. After treating the serum with polyethylene glycol to precipitate macroprolactin, serum prolactin was measured again. The patients were divided into two groups. The first group, consisting of 19 individuals, with a recovery rate of more than 60%, formed the hyperprolactinemia group. The second group, comprising 36 individuals with a recovery rate of less than 60%, formed the macroprolactinemia group.

Results

The participants in this study were 50 individuals, comprising 10 men and 40 women. The mean urinary prolactin levels in the hyperprolactinemia group are 43.27 ± 15.53, and in the macroprolactinemia group, they are 32.58 ± 16.27. This difference was statistically significant. The median ratio of urinary prolactin to urinary creatinine is 0.03 in the hyperprolactinemia group and 0.02 in the macroprolactinemia group (p < 0.05). The median ratio of serum prolactin to urinary prolactin in the hyperprolactinemia group is 32.6, and in the macroprolactinemia group, it is 45.5 (p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Findings showed that the difference between urinary prolactin in true macroprolactinemic and hyperprolactinemic patients is significant, such that the amount of urinary prolactin in macroprolactinemic patients is less than in hyperprolactinemic patients, and the ratio of serum to urinary prolactin is higher. These parameters can be used to detect macroprolactin in cases of increased serum prolactin level, and this finding could provide a basis for the idea that these parameters can be used as an alternative to the PEG sedimentation test for diagnosing macroprolactin.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115LgqUX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society — diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia (Recommendation 1.1) states to establish the diagnosis, "we recommend a single measurement of serum prolactin; a level above the upper limit of normal confirms the diagnosis as long as the serum sample was obtained without excessive venipuncture stress", and "we recommend against dynamic testing of prolactin secretion" (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕). Evidence notes assay-specific normal values are generally lower than 25 μg/liter and that when the World Health Organization Standard 84/500 is used, 1 μg/liter is equivalent to 21.2 mIU/liter; dynamic tests using TRH, L-dopa, nomifensine, and domperidone are not superior to a single sample. A prolactin level greater than 500 μg/liter is diagnostic of a macroprolactinoma, whereas levels greater than 250 μg/liter usually indicate a prolactinoma but selected drugs can cause elevations above 200 μg/liter without evidence of adenoma. Remarks add that the initial determination should avoid excessive venipuncture stress and can be drawn at any time of the day.

Hyperprolactinemia — long-term outcomes with dopamine agonists in women indicate substantial biochemical control and tumor shrinkage: among 271 women observed for up to 29 yr, 240 received dopamine agonists, prolactin levels normalized in 71% and 80% exhibited total or partial tumor shrinkage; among 17 patients who underwent surgery, 53% exhibited long-term normalization without added medications.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115rhMjQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Pituitary macroadenoma–prolactin discrepancy and hook effect — when there is a discrepancy between a very large pituitary tumor and a mildly elevated prolactin level, the guideline states we recommend serial dilution of serum samples to avoid falsely low results due to the hook effect, and the assay should be repeated after a 1:100 serum sample dilution when values are not as high as expected. Supporting evidence notes that most patients with prolactin levels higher than 250 μg/liter will harbor a prolactinoma and that macroprolactinomas (> 10 mm in diameter) are typically associated with prolactin levels greater than 250 μg/liter, and that moderately elevated prolactin may occur with large nonfunctioning adenomas.

### Serum macroprolactin levels in pregnancy and association with thyroid autoimmunity [^112qjJxJ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Laboratory investigation

Following an overnight fast, blood samples were acquired in the morning from each subject. Serum was isolated by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until testing, if needed. The concentrations of serum TSH, FT3 and FT4 were detected by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay diagnostic kit (Advia Centaur XP Siemens, USA). TGAb and TPOAb levels were detected using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay diagnostic kit (Roche Diagnostics Ltd. Basel, Switzerland). The concentration of serum prolactin was detected by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay diagnostic kit (Immulite 2000, Diagnostic Products Corporation, LA, CA). After centrifugation, the supernatant containing the unprecipitated prolactin is tested for total prolactin level. A concentration of 25% PEG is added to an aliquot of serum specimen and the PEG-treated sample is incubated for a short period and then centrifuged to precipitate out macroprolactin. The supernatant containing the unprecipitated prolactin is tested for recovery of basal prolactin. The PEG-precipitable PRL (%), which represents the amount of macroprolactin, is calculated as follows: (total PRL-free PRL)/total PRL × 100. PEG-precipitation ratio greater than 60% (recovery less than 40%) is used as the cut-off value for the diagnosis of macroprolactinemia. Recovery of less than 40% after PEG is considered a diagnostic criteria for macroprolactin; recovery values around 40–60% are considered borderline, and values > 60% rule out macroprolactinemia. The unprecipitated percentage of basal prolactin is considered as recovery of monomeric prolactin.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using IBM-SPSS software (version 21.0; SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Comparisons between groups were performed using ANOVA for normally distributed variables, and the Mann–Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests for non-normal variables. All data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation or percentages, while p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Establishment of reference intervals of monomeric prolactin to identify macroprolactinemia in Chinese patients with increased total prolactin [^113kyuZK]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Reference intervals of post-PEG serum monomeric prolactin

Data were collected from eligible participants, including 120 females (age 18–55 years, median 31 years) and 120 males (age 18–60 years, median 34 years). The demographic characteristics, total prolactin, and post-PEG monomeric prolactin at baseline are presented in Table 1. Female and male total and monomeric prolactin data were non-normally distributed according to histograms. The 95% reference intervals for absolute levels of monomeric prolactin in females and males, respectively, ranged from 3.5 to 18.4 ng/mL and from 2.5 to 13.8 ng/mL. The reference values of total and post-PEG monomeric prolactin in male and female sera are illustrated in Table 2, along with manufacturer-provided reference intervals. There were no significant differences between the established total prolactin reference intervals and manufacturer range in either gender. In terms of post-PEG monomeric prolactin, we observed significant differences between females and males (P < 0.05).

Validation of the established monomeric prolactin reference intervals

Discriminated by GFC, 20 macroprolactinemia samples were analyzed and categorized by the monomeric prolactin reference intervals along with recovery cutoff method. We found that all macroprolactinemia sera (20/20) classified by the post-PEG monomeric prolactin reference intervals (Table 3) had initially elevated prolactin levels due to macroforms. Moreover, the monomeric reference interval method showed elevated discordant classification. A prolactin recovery cutoff of 60% following PEG precipitation detected 70% of specimens with macroPRL (defined as ≥ 50% macroprolactin as determined by GFC). Decreasing the post-PEG PRL recovery cutoff to 40% maintained only 80% detection (Table 3).

### Hyperprolactinemia [^114d4tBq]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

In several respects prolactin is unique among anterior pituitary hormones. The primary regulation of prolactin secretion is mediated through hypothalamic inhibition, and the diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia can be established without the use of stimulation or suppression tests. Documenting the presence of hyperprolactinemia is not difficult-the challenge is in identifying the cause of the hormone hypersecretion. With immunoradiometric assays falsely low levels of prolactin are occasionally seen in patients with macroadenomas and very high serum prolactin (the hook effect). Macroprolactin should be suspected when a patient with hyperprolactinemia does not present with typical clinical symptoms, and all hyperprolactinemic sera should be screened for macroprolactin. With prolactinomas, prolactin levels generally parallel tumor size. Prolactin secreting macroadenomas are typically associated with levels that exceed 250 microg/l and may exceed 1,000 microg/l. Large non-functioning adenomas also lead to hyperprolactinemia but levels virtually never exceed 94 microg/l. Acquired and isolated prolactin deficiency is rare.

### Serum prolactin concentrations as risk factor of metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes? [^115UTGXW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

However, given the inherent limitations of observational research, the definite role of serum PRL concentrations as a risk factor or risk marker can not be elucidated based on epidemiological data alone. Previous associations between serum PRL concentrations and disease risk observed in clinical study samples, but not in the general population, suggest PRL rather as specific disease marker than as causal risk factor for MetS and T2DM. Thus, its application and significance in daily clinical practice is very limited to date.

### Anti-prolactin (PRL) autoantibodies suppress PRL bioactivity in patients with macroprolactinaemia [^114APjB3]. Clinical Endocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Macroprolactinaemia, mainly caused by anti-prolactin (PRL) autoantibodies, is frequently found in patients with hyperprolactinaemia. Characteristically, these patients lack clinical symptoms of hyperprolactinaemia, but the serum bioactive PRL concentrations in vitro measured by the Nb2 bioassay are usually high. In this study, we investigated the causes of the discrepancy and the true biological features of macroprolactin.

Subjects and Methods

Sixteen patients with macroprolactinaemia due to anti-PRL autoantibodies were studied. PRL bioactivity was determined by the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)5 in T47D human breast cancer cells and the proliferation of Nb2 rat lymphoma cells.

PRL bioactivity by the T47D bioassay, expressed as the density of the band of phosphorylated Stat5/immunoreactive PRL, was significantly lower in sera containing anti-PRL autoantibodies (2.4 ± 1.1) than in control sera (7.2 ± 3.1). Dissociation of PRL from the autoantibodies by acidification resulted in an increase in phosphorylated Stat5. PRL bioactivity by the Nb2 bioassay was not significantly different between sera with and without anti-PRL autoantibodies, and free PRL in the medium gradually increased during the incubation in a time-dependent manner in sera containing anti-PRL autoantibodies.

Conclusions

We conclude that the level of bioactivity of macroprolactin in the Nb2 bioassay is normal due to dissociation of PRL from the autoantibodies as a result of the longer incubation and more dilute assay conditions than in the T47D bioassay. The bioactivity of macroprolactin is low in vivo due to anti-PRL autoantibodies, but monomeric PRL dissociated from the autoantibodies retains full biological activity in patients with macroprolactinaemia.

### The TSH response to domperidone reflects the biological activity of prolactin in macroprolactinaemia and hyperprolactinaemia [^115CUKas]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that patients with hyperprolactinaemia due to biologically inactive macroprolactin will not show the characteristically increased dopaminergic inhibition of TSH release seen in patients with microprolactinomas secreting biologically active monomeric PRL.

Design

Comparison of the TSH and PRL responses to dopamine antagonism with domperidone (10 mg i.v.) in patients with hyperprolactinaemia due to macroprolactinaemia or microprolactinomas.

Patients

Twenty-two patients referred for the investigation of their hyperprolactinaemia were studied: 11 patients with macroprolactinaemia and 11 patients with hyperprolactinaemia due to microprolactinoma.

Measurements

TSH and PRL levels were measured at baseline and 30 min following domperidone in both groups.

Results

Patients with macroprolactinaemia showed normal TSH and PRL responses to dopamine antagonism whereas patients with microprolactinomas showed exaggerated TSH responses and reduced PRL responses. Although there was considerable overlap between the PRL responses in the two groups, there was very clear separation between the PRL/TSH response ratios (normal > 1.0) of 4.0 ± 1.8 for the macroprolactinaemia group and 0.4 ± 0.2 for the microprolactinoma group (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

These data support the hypothesis that elevated circulating levels of macroprolactin, as opposed to biologically active monomeric PRL, do not exert increased positive feedback on the hypothalamic dopaminergic inhibition of TSH release.

### Clinical questions and uncertainty – prolactin measurement in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [^111SnFQw]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Many antipsychotic medications have the potential to raise prolactin levels leading to a range of negative consequences. In addition to symptoms such as gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea, menstrual irregularities and sexual dysfunction it is becoming clear that there are a number of important and potentially serious long-term consequences, including a loss of bone mineral density and a possible association with the development of breast cancer. It is clear, therefore, that the tendency to raise prolactin should be an important consideration in the use of antipsychotics but, to a large degree, this area has been neglected in clinical practice and research when compared with other potential adverse effects. We consider some of the practical clinical issues in prolactin measurement and the management of high results. We will identify the areas of uncertainty that remain for clinicians and consider the practical questions that future research should address.

### Comparison of urinary prolactin and serum / urine prolactin ratio in hyperprolactinemic and macroprolactinemic patients [^11233yxN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolactin is secreted from pituitary lactotroph cells. There are three forms of prolactin in blood circulation: monomer prolactin, prolactin dimer, or big prolactin, and macroprolactin, another form of big prolactin, that binds to immunoglobulins. The biological functions of monomeric form of this hormone, including its roles in reproduction, metabolism, immunity, and lactation, are essential and specific Prolactin levels increase in various physiological conditions such as pregnancy, stress, and exercise, as well as in pathological conditions including pituitary and hypothalamic tumors, systemic diseases like kidney failure, polycystic ovary syndrome, and cirrhosis. Prolactin levels also rise in response to certain medications, such as neuroleptic drugs. Measuring it to diagnose and treat diseases such as pituitary tumors, such as prolactinoma, reproductive problems, and amenorrhea is essential. In modern prolactin measurement methods, all forms of prolactin are included in the measurement. The presence of macroprolactin, which is biologically inactive and unrelated to the patient's symptoms, can cause a false increase in prolactin levels, leading to the misdiagnosis of hyperprolactinemia and inappropriate treatments. Therefore, all cases of hyperprolactinemia should be evaluated for the presence of macroprolactin to reduce the unnecessary use of imaging, avoid inappropriate dopamine agonist treatments, and save time and money.

### Establishment of reference intervals of monomeric prolactin to identify macroprolactinemia in Chinese patients with increased total prolactin [^111mUjVV]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study demonstrated that, while menstrual disturbances occurred more frequently in patients with true hyperprolactinemia, they also occurred in 38.1% of macroprolactinemic patients. Galactorrhea occurred less frequently in patients with macroprolactinemia compared to those with true hyperprolactinemia. Although this difference was statistically significant, it is clearly not sufficient to distinguish between the two groups. Out of a total of 30 macroprolactinemic patients who underwent MRI or CT scan, adenoma was detected in seven patients (23.3%) and microadenoma was detected in five patients (17%). Consistent with our observation, Hauache, OM et al. observed that abnormal pituitary CT scans occurred in 21% of macroprolactinemic patients. These results indicate that patients with macroprolactinemia can have microadenomas, and this should be evaluated with detailed clinical context and careful follow-up. And further based on our research results, the screening for macroprolactin should not be reserved for asymptomatic patients. Although this differs somewhat from the recommendations of the Endocrine Society Guidelines and guidelines published by the Spanish Society of Endocrinology and Nutrition and the Brazilian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism, we insist that it is necessary to perform macroprolactinemia screening for those with an apparent idiopathic hyperprolactinemia, no obvious cause for the hyperprolactinemia, atypical clinical picture, conflicting prolactin results in distinct assays or delayed decline of serum prolactin levels with the usual doses of dopamine agonists.

Our study has certain advantages compared to previous studies. First, a large cohort of big data was used in the present study. Secondly, the reference interval of monomer prolactin based on Chinese population was established for the first time.

### A combined computational and structural model of the full-length human prolactin receptor [^114EpBSJ]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Although high-resolution structures of multi-pass transmembrane proteins in connection with extra-membranous globular domains have been solved (for example, refs,), no such structures are available of single-pass transmembrane proteins, which have fewer stabilizing contacts in their membrane-embedded region. The structural characterization of the full PRLR is further hampered by the challenges associated with studies of a protein consisting of three structurally diverse domains: a soluble, folded domain, a membrane-embedded domain and an intrinsically disordered domain. Currently, no single high-resolution method is capable of describing the structural characteristics of a protein of this size and complexity. To overcome these inherent limitations in sample preparation and individual structure-determination techniques, we here apply a multidisciplinary divide-and-conquer approach in which we combine data acquired with different techniques on overlapping domain variants of the hPRLR with molecular modelling. In the centre of this endeavour lies the determination of the hPRLR-TMD structure, which we here solve in 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine (DHPC) micelles using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Combining this with previously published and new biophysical data of the soluble domains, we generate a structural model of the monomeric hPRLR, suggested to represent up to 70% of the PRLRs in the cell membrane. This hPRLR structure provides the first full molecular architecture of a class I cytokine receptor, exemplifying more than 40 different receptor chains, and reveals that the extracellular domain is merely the tip of a molecular iceberg.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116mbSh9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Pituitary tumor–related and idiopathic hyperprolactinemia — patients with large nonfunctioning pituitary tumors, craniopharyngiomas, or granulomatous infiltration of the hypothalamus can develop hyperprolactinemia because of pituitary stalk compression or dopaminergic neuronal damage, and in 226 patients with histologically confirmed nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas, a prolactin level greater than 94 µg/liter reliably distinguished between prolactinomas and nonfunctioning adenomas; dopamine agonist therapy lowers prolactin levels and improves symptoms in patients with stalk compression, but it is not definitive therapy for a nonfunctioning adenoma; fewer than 10% of patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia ultimately are found to harbor a microadenoma and progression from a microadenoma to a macroadenoma is rare; spontaneous normalization of prolactin levels occurs in approximately 30% of patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia; and it is important to determine whether patients with hyperprolactinemia also have acromegaly because prolactin is elevated in up to 50% of patients with GH-secreting tumors.

### Establishment of reference intervals of monomeric prolactin to identify macroprolactinemia in Chinese patients with increased total prolactin [^117N9YYy]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heterogeneity has been described in the molecular size of prolactin in the majority of serum samples from healthy individuals and patients with hyperprolactinemia. Three major prolactin variants can be characterized, including monomeric, dimeric, and polymeric isoforms. Immunological and biological activity of prolactin in vivo may be almost exclusively attributed to the monomeric form. Macroprolactin has a molecular weight > 100 kD and is a form of prolactin that is complexed with its autoantibody. Macroprolactinemia is mostly considered an extra-pituitary phenomenon. Patients with macroprolactinemia experience mild and nonspecific symptoms of hyperprolactinemia. In these patients, monomeric prolactin concentrations are within reference values and most macroprolactin is confined to the vascular system, where it is biologically inactive. Macroprolactin poses a major problem due to its interference with prolactin assays. This commonly results in misdiagnosis and mismanagement of patients, as well as wasted healthcare resources and unnecessary concern from both patients and clinicians. High concentrations of macroprolactin appears to result from reduced clearance of antigen-antibody complexes of monomeric prolactin and immunoglobulin G. These complexes interfere with the interaction between prolactin and the capture and detection antibodies involved in the sandwich reaction of prolactin immunoassays. Consequently, it is essential for clinical laboratories to establish screening methods to detect macroprolactin and the monomeric prolactin component in all hyperprolactinemic serum samples.

Macroprolactinemia is primarily defined by a circulating prolactin level that is made up of greater than 60% macroprolactin. The reference method for quantifying bioactive monomeric prolactin in sera is gel filtration chromatography (GFC). However, because this method is cumbersome and expensive, polyethylene glycol (PEG) serum precipitation is a simple, economical, and rapid method and has been widely used as a screening method to differentiate macroprolactinemia from true hyperprolactinemia. Moreover, the laboratory priority should be to quantitatively determine the bioactive monomeric prolactin level, rather than simply to measure the percentage of macroprolactin present.

Che Soh, NAA et al. reported the overall global prevalence of macroprolactinemia was 18.9% among patients with hyperprolactinemia, and the prevalence in the South-East Asian region was 12.7%. However, there have been no previous reports pertaining to the reference interval of monomeric prolactin based on the Chinese population. Therefore, we have undertaken this cross-sectional investigation to screen for macroprolactin with higher accuracy.

### A combined computational and structural model of the full-length human prolactin receptor [^115vhWt8]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The prolactin receptor is an archetype member of the class I cytokine receptor family, comprising receptors with fundamental functions in biology as well as key drug targets. Structurally, each of these receptors represent an intriguing diversity, providing an exceptionally challenging target for structural biology. Here, we access the molecular architecture of the monomeric human prolactin receptor by combining experimental and computational efforts. We solve the NMR structure of its transmembrane domain in micelles and collect structural data on overlapping fragments of the receptor with small-angle X-ray scattering, native mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. Along with previously published data, these are integrated by molecular modelling to generate a full receptor structure. The result provides the first full view of a class I cytokine receptor, exemplifying the architecture of more than 40 different receptor chains, and reveals that the extracellular domain is merely the tip of a molecular iceberg.

### Establishment of reference intervals of monomeric prolactin to identify macroprolactinemia in Chinese patients with increased total prolactin [^117RDRLU]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Macroprolactin is responsible for pseudohyperprolactinemia and is a common pitfall of the prolactin immunoassay. We aimed to determine the frequency of macroprolactinemia in Chinese hyperprolactinemic patients using monomeric prolactin discriminated by precipitation with polyethylene glycol (PEG).

Methods

Post-PEG monomeric prolactin gender-specific reference intervals were established for the Elecsys immunoassay method (Roche Diagnostics) using sera from healthy female (n = 120) and male (n = 120) donors. The reference intervals were validated using 20 macroprolactinemic (as assessed by gel filtration chromatography (GFC)) sera samples, and presence of monomeric prolactin was discriminated by GFC. Patients with high total prolactin were then screened by PEG precipitation to analyze macroprolactin. The demographic and biochemical details of patients with true hyperprolactinemia and macroprolactinemia were compared.

Results

Reference intervals for monomeric prolactin in females and males were 3.4–18.5 and 2.7–13.1 ng/mL, respectively. Among 1140 hyperprolactinemic patients, macroprolactinemia was identified in 261 (22.9%) patients while the other 879 (77.1%) patients were diagnosed with true hyperprolactinemia. Menstrual disturbances were the most common clinical feature in both groups. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and visual disturbances occurred more frequently in true hyperprolactinemic patients (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

The prevalence of macroprolactin in Chinese patients with hyperprolactinemia was described for the first time. Monomeric prolactin concentration, along with a reference interval screening with PEG precipitation, provides a diagnostic approach for hyperprolactinemia with improved accuracy.

### Should macroprolactin be measured in all hyperprolactinaemic sera? [^116wjimn]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Macroprolactin is a nonbioactive prolactin isoform usually composed of a monomer of prolactin and a IgG molecule which has a prolonged clearance rate similar to that of the immunoglobulins. Macroprolactinaemia, hyperprolactinaemia entirely accounted for by the presence of macroprolactin, is estimated to account for approximately 10% of all hyperprolactinaemia coming to clinical attention in the United Kingdom and the United States. Failure to recognize that macroprolactinaemia can explain hyperprolactinaemia, leads to unnecessary investigation, incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Screening of hyperprolactinaemic sera for the presence of misleading concentrations of macroprolactin is readily performed in biochemistry laboratories although the procedures have not been automated. The most widely employed method is to treat the hyperprolactinaemic sera with polyethylene glycol which precipitates out high-molecular weight constituents including immunoglobulins. Re-assay of the sera for prolactin will then identify those sera which yield values within the relevant normal range indicative of macroprolactinaemia and not true hyperprolactinaemia. The case for the routine screening of all hyperprolactinaemic sera for macroprolactin is compelling. The consequences of failure to recognize macroprolactinaemia are significant, the problem is frequently encountered, the means of addressing it are immediately available and it is cost effective.

### Raised serum prolactin in rheumatoid arthritis: genuine or laboratory artefact? [^112K8Ehr]. Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Serum prolactin concentrations have been reported as higher, similar or lower in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with control subjects. We investigated whether low biological activity macroprolactin (a prolactin antibody complex), which is detected variably in different prolactin immunoassays, could account for the discrepant total prolactin results reported in RA.

Methods

We compared serum total prolactin and free prolactin in 60 women with RA and 31 female controls.

Results

No subject had hyperprolactinaemia or macroprolactinaemia. Serum concentrations of total and free (monomeric) prolactin were higher (P < 0.05) in women with RA [mean (s.d.), 225.6 (104.6) and 201.6 (95.4) mU/l respectively] compared with controls [175.0 (68.5) and 154.0 (60.9) mU/l respectively].

Conclusions

We report higher serum free prolactin concentrations in women with RA compared with control subjects. This result indicates that the higher serum total prolactin levels in patients with RA are the consequence of increased free prolactin concentrations and are not due to macroprolactin.

### Ten-year clinical follow-up of a cohort of 51 patients with macroprolactinemia establishes it as a benign variant [^1154fnNT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Macroprolactinemia is a common finding in patients with hyperprolactinemia. There are no published long-term follow-up studies.

Objective

The aim of this study was to describe findings after prolonged follow-up in a previously published cohort of patients with macroprolactinemia.

Study Population

We studied 51 patients identified as having macroprolactinemia after polyethylene glycol precipitation.

Design

Clinical assessment and serum prolactin assay were repeated in 51 patients with macroprolactinemia after a median follow-up of 9.9 yr (range, 9–11 yr).

Results

Median age at presentation was 41 yr (range, 18–55 yr). Mean serum prolactin concentration at presentation was 1885 mU/liter, and after follow-up 1370 mU/liter. At follow-up, headache had been experienced in 12 patients (24%) and oligomenorrhea in five (10%). Galactorrhea was present in only two patients (4%). No visual deterioration was noted in 50 patients. One had a transient bitemporal hemianopia. No patients developed an autoimmune condition. Microadenoma had been identified in four patients at presentation with no new pituitary imaging abnormalities identified at follow-up.

Conclusions

During prolonged follow-up, no symptomatic progression was noted in any of our patients. This study suggests that patients with macroprolactinemia and normal concentrations of monomeric prolactin can be reassured, and extended endocrine review of such patients is not required.

### Technology insight: measuring prolactin in clinical samples [^114LdS4i]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Measurement of prolactin is one of the most commonly undertaken hormonal investigations in evaluating patients with reproductive disorders. Hyperprolactinemia is found in up to 17% of such cases. Diagnostic evaluation of hyperprolactinemia is difficult but is facilitated by a logical approach where a thorough patient history is obtained, secondary causes of hyperprolactinemia are excluded, and the limitations of current prolactin assays are appreciated. Once hyperprolactinemia has been confirmed, attempts to establish the underlying cause can start. Given current workloads, laboratories rely on automated platforms to measure prolactin, most of which employ two-site immunoassay sandwich methods. Although generally robust and reliable, such immunoassays are susceptible to interference, and good collaboration between clinicians and the laboratory helps to minimize problems. A major challenge facing laboratories is correct differentiation of patients with true hyperprolactinemia from those with macroprolactinemia. Macroprolactin is a high-molecular-mass, biologically inactive form of prolactin that is detected to varying degrees by all prolactin immunoassays. Conservative estimates suggest that the presence of macroprolactin leads to misdiagnosis in as many as 10% of all reported instances of biochemical hyperprolactinemia. In the absence of specific testing, macroprolactin represents a diagnostic pitfall that results in the misdiagnosis and mismanagement of large numbers of patients.

### Establishment of reference intervals of monomeric prolactin to identify macroprolactinemia in Chinese patients with increased total prolactin [^117FbkeK]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In individuals with macroprolactinemia and normal levels of monomeric prolactin, nonspecific symptomatic progression was found during a 10-year clinical follow-up study. Therefore, macroprolactinemia can be considered a benign variant of hyperprolactinemia. Failure to identify these individuals prior to or during laboratory prolactin assays leads to misdiagnosis, unnecessary investigation, inappropriate treatment, and ultimately an increased cost of management. Consequently, routine diagnostic macroprolactin screening in all hyperprolactinemic patients has been authoritatively recommended and financially justified due to reduced use of both imaging and dopamine agonist prescription in these patients.

It is difficult to differentiate between true hyperprolactinemia and macroprolactinemia based on clinical symptoms alone, as most of the patients with macroprolactinemia are also symptomatic. Without the use of PEG pretreatment, no commercial prolactin kits have been developed to accurately classify macroprolactin from true hyperprolactinemia. Only reporting with the recovery after PEG treatment lacks specificity, and may be inappropriate and misinterpreted in cases in which excess macroprolactin occurs simultaneously with supraphysiological concentrations of monomeric prolactin. Screening for macroprolactinemia by reporting a monomeric prolactin concentration along with a PEG-specific monomeric reference interval is a recommended good practice for laboratories because the presence of excess monomeric prolactin is of clinical concern. This approach would enable more rigorous definition of macroprolactinemia than recovery cutoff method, and would prevent confusion when excess biologically active prolactin is present along with macroprolactin. Furthermore, this may be more valuable and easier to interpret than the reporting of macroprolactin along with a recovered prolactin concentration.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hyperprolactinemia, more specifically with respect to serum prolactin levels, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to perform serial dilution of serum samples to eliminate an artifact that can occur with some immunoradiometric assays leading to a falsely low prolactin value ("hook effect") in patients with a discrepancy between a very large pituitary tumor and a mildly elevated prolactin level.

### Determination of ultrafilterable prolactin: elimination of macroprolactin interference with a monomeric prolactin-selective sample pretreatment [^114canR8]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Macroprolactin (macroPRL), present in as many as 25% of serum specimens with elevated serum prolactin concentrations, can cause apparent hyperprolactinemia in the absence of clinical features and lead to unnecessary clinical, laboratory, and neuroradiological workups.

Objective

To develop an ultrafiltration method that eliminates macroPRL interference from PRL immunoassays.

Design

The method involves centrifugation of undiluted serum in a Centricon-100 filter device followed by a PRL assay of the serum ultrafiltrate.

Results

Ultrafiltrates prepared by this technique are devoid of gamma globulins and contain (mean ± SE) 19% ± 7% of the albumin concentration of the original serum. These ultrafiltrates contain 85% ± 7% of the total PRL immunoreactivity of serum spiked with 23 kd recombinant human prolactin (rHuPRL) and less than 2% of the 50 kd big PRL (bPRL) of whole serum. The fractional recovery of ultrafilterable PRL (uPRL) from serum samples of 54 female patients was 0.78 (confidence interval 0.73–0.83) of the total. The run-to-run coefficient of variation of the uPRL assay was 4.3%. The uPRL concentration (mean ± SD) in a group of healthy female controls was 8.0 ± 3.1 ng/mL.

Conclusions

Ultrafiltration is a rapid and simple method for eliminating analytical interference by macroPRL. Ultrafiltrates can be analyzed by most, if not all, currently available PRL immunoassays and represent a practical and precise alternative to gel filtration chromatography for the estimation of the monomeric prolactin concentration of serum.

### Human macroprolactin displays low biological activity via its homologous receptor in a new sensitive bioassay [^112fNvvk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Macroprolactinemia is a frequent finding in hyperprolactinemic individuals, usually without clinical impact. Data on biological activity of macroprolactin (bbPRL) are controversial and mostly based on a heterologous rat Nb2 cell bioassay. Biological activity of bbPRL observed in vitro but not in vivo may be due to its high molecular weight, preventing its passage through capillary barrier. Alternatively, bbPRL bioactivity may differ depending on the prolactin (PRL) receptor (PRLR) species specificity.

Objective

The objective of the study was to characterize the bioactivity of bbPRL in a homologous bioassay: Ba/F-3 cells stably expressing the human PRLR.

Design/Setting/Patients

Chromatography-purified bbPRL from macroprolactinemic individuals (group I, n = 18) and monomeric PRL from hyperprolactinemic patients without macroprolactinemia (group II, n = 5) were tested in Nb2 and Ba/F-LLP bioassays. Both groups were followed up at the neuroendocrinology outpatients' clinic.

Main Outcome Measure

Biological activity of bbPRL presented in the two bioassays was measured.

Results

In group I, no patient had hypogonadism. Mean ratio bioactivity to immunoactivity of bbPRL in the Nb2 assay was 0.69. There was no dose-response in 15 of the 18 samples tested in Ba/F-LLP assay. In group II, three patients had galactorrhea and all five had hypogonadism. Mean ratio bioactivity to immunoactivity of monomeric PRL samples was 1.35 in Nb2 and 0.91 in Ba/F-LLP assay.

Conclusion

Whereas both bioassays achieve similar results with respect to monomeric PRL activity, our results indicate that the activity displayed by bbPRL toward the rat receptor may be inappropriate because it is not observed in the human PRLR-mediated assay, consistent with the apparent absence of bioactivity in vivo.

### Macroprolactinaemia: prevalence and aetiologies in a large group of hospital workers [^113V8MhD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Macroprolactinaemia is one of the causes of hyperprolactinaemia and often leads to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment, but the aetiologies are unclear. The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of macroprolactinaemia in a healthy population and to investigate the mechanisms underlying the development of macroprolactin.

Design

Observational study of the prevalence, causes, mechanisms and diagnosis of disease using excess sera after hepatitis B virus screening tests at a hospital in Japan.

Participants

A total of 1330 hospital workers (1010 women and 320 men) participated in this study.

Measurements

Macroprolactinaemia was screened using the polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method. Sera containing macroprolactin were further examined by binding studies for possible aetiologies.

Results

Of the 1330 subjects, 49 (3.68%) were diagnosed with macroprolactinaemia. The frequency of hyperprolactinaemia in untreated samples in subjects with macroprolactinaemia (30.6%) was significantly higher than in individuals without macroprolactinaemia (2.26%). Of the 49 subjects with macroprolactinaemia, all had a normal monomeric PRL concentration following PEG removal of macroprolactin. Of 44 hyperprolactinaemias found, 15 (34.1%) had macroprolactinaemia. IgG-bound prolactin was detected in all sera containing macroprolactin. The levels of IgG-bound prolactin positively correlated with those of macroprolactin, suggesting that IgG-bound prolactin forms macroprolactin. Approximately three quarters of the subjects with macroprolactinaemia had anti-prolactin autoantibodies. Glycosylation, aggregation and covalent/noncovalent binding were also involved in the formation of macroprolactin.

Conclusions

Macroprolactinaemia is a common disorder and causes hyperprolactinaemia in a healthy population. The major aetiology of macroprolactin in our subjects was complexes of prolactin-IgG comprising mainly anti-prolactin autoantibodies, and other minor complex prolactin species.

It is important for asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia patients but also for those with an apparent idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and atypical clinical picture to perform routine screening for macroprolactinemia.

### A combined computational and structural model of the full-length human prolactin receptor [^113bwsFV]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Parts of the PRL/PRLR receptor system have been structurally characterized including structures of the PRL, the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes of PRL:PRLR-ECDand the unliganded human (h) PRLR-ECD-D2 (ref.), as well as a recent characterization of the hPRLR-ICD as being intrinsically disordered throughout its length. However, despite substantial efforts, important structural and functional aspects of the PRLR remain uncharacterized. As no structure is available of neither the unliganded PRLR-ECD nor of the TMD, the overall structure and mechanism of signal transfer remains elusive. Signal transduction across the membrane following hormone binding is suggested to occur by subunit rearrangements or propagation of local structural changes, providing the TMDs with a key role. Furthermore, it has been shown for several class 1 cytokine receptors that the ligand-independent homodimerization takes place in the TMDs. Despite these significant roles, the TMDs remain largely understudied, although cellular reports on their characteristics and roles in signal transduction are now emerging. A recent study of the GHR proposed a model for signal transduction where the homodimer TMD conformation switches upon receptor activation from a parallel to a left-hand crossover structure, thereby separating the TMDs at the C-terminal end and eventually bringing the two JAK2s into productive positions. However, analogous alanine-insertion studies of the GHRand the PRLRsuggested that the activation mechanism of the two related receptors differs in a poorly understood manner.

### Chemiluminescence systems; do all lead to same results in prolactin analysis? [^112MtZia]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In the human genome prolactin (PRL) molecule is arranged in a single chain of amino acids with three intra-molecular disulfide bonds between six cysteine residues and is synthesized and secreted by the lactotroph cells of the anterior pituitary gland. Three major variant of PRL can be found in the blood: monomeric, big and macroprolactin. Multiple circulating variants of PRL are identifiable on Gel Filtration Chromatography. The monomeric form has a molecular mass of ~23 kDa and accounts for most of the PRL present in normal individuals. Prolactin is normally present in low amounts in both men and non-pregnant women and mainly its level is regulated by dopamine.

Regardless of hypersecretion of prolactin with idiopatic reasons that may lead to hyperprolactinemia due to macroprolactinemia, the most common cause of elevated PRL level (hyperprolactinemia) is prolactin-producing adenomas or prolactinomas. Adenomas occur in both men and women with abnormal reproductive function or with galactorrihea. However, it is more commonly diagnosed in women who are less than 50 years old. Furthermore, most adenomas occur sporadically and rarely in families as a condition called the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome.

The PRL level is measured in a blood serum sample and increased result can range from elevated to multiple times the upper limit of normal. Larger adenomas cause higher PRL levels and elevated concentrations are found in up to 17% of such cases. There are other causes of increased PRL level in serum such as use of various drugs, compression of the pituitary stalk, presence of macroprolactin, renal failure, cirrhosis or idiopathic hyperprolactinemia are diagnoses that may increase PRL level.

Different methods are used to measure PRL level. They are mostly immunoassay based such as RIA, ELISA, CLIA, ECL. Studies have indicated that Gel Filtration Chromatography is the gold standard for quantification of PRL molecular forms in serum. However, it is slow, costly and labour intensive.

Although precise laboratory techniques demonstrating hyperprolactinemia are essential for the accurate diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients during medical therapy or post surgery, the comparison of the measured values among different systems are difficult. Because the methods are not identical in different laboratories and the reference ranges are different for each. This is one of the main challenges in PRL measurements among laboratories.

In the present study we compared the results of two chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) methods to determine serum prolactin level in 44 female patients serum sample(age range 21–65 years).

### Gross variability in the detection of prolactin in sera containing big big prolactin (macroprolactin) by commercial immunoassays [^116bHouj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

A high molecular mass form of prolactin (PRL), macroprolactin, accumulates in the sera of some subjects. Although macroprolactin exhibits limited bioactivity in vivo, it retains immunoreactivity. We examined the frequency of macroprolactinemia in clinical practice and the ability of immunoassay systems to distinguish between macroprolactin and monomeric PRL. Of 300 hyperprolactinemic sera identified, 71 normalized following treatment of sera with polyethylene glycol, indicating that 24% of hyperprolactinemia could be accounted for by macroprolactin. Ten of these macroprolactinemic sera were circulated to 18 clinical laboratories. Two sets of PRL measurements of the 10 untreated sera were obtained from each of the nine most commonly used immunoassay systems. Across the nine assay systems, differences in the PRL estimates ranged from 2.3- to 7.8-fold. Elecsys users reported the highest PRL levels. Somewhat lower values were reported for DELFIA systems followed by Immuno-1, AxSYM, and Architect assays. The Immulite 2000 assay generated PRL levels equivalent to approximately 50% of those reported by the high-reading methods. The lowest PRL levels were reported by Access, ACS:180, and Centaur systems. To avoid confusion caused by the frequent presence of macroprolactin accounting for hyperprolactinemia, secondary screening for the presence of macroprolactin is recommended.

### Establishment of reference intervals of monomeric prolactin to identify macroprolactinemia in Chinese patients with increased total prolactin [^1179xr7x]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently, 25% PEG with molecular weight 6000 is commonly used in the precipitation of macroprolactin. Compared with PEG 8000, PEG 6000, with a relatively small degree of polymerization, can reduce the viscosity of the precipitant, increase the accuracy of sample loading and reduce damage to the analytical instrument. In terms of selecting the PEG concentration, a previous study reported a significant constant bias between the 20% and 25% PEG macroprolactin precipitation methods. Therefore, laboratories should establish the monomeric prolactin reference interval according to different concentrations of PEG 6000 carefully. This is an important clinical consideration if the presence of macroprolactin is based on absolute amounts of monomeric prolactin concentrations using post PEG reference interval.

In the present study, gender-specific monomeric prolactin reference intervals were established to avoid any confusion as to whether biologically active prolactin is also increased when excess macroprolactin is present. The application of a monomeric prolactin reference interval for the 25% PEG 6000 precipitation procedure allowed for the detection of two cohorts of patients: one with true hyperprolactinemia and the other in whom hyperprolactinemia could be accounted for entirely by macroprolactin. True hyperprolactinemia is defined by the presence of excess monomeric prolactin in serum. In our study, macroprolactinemia was characterized by the presence of excess serum macroprolactin together with monomeric prolactin concentration in the normal reference interval. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare unselected macroprolactinemic patients with true hyperprolactinemic patients among the Chinese population. A high incidence of macroprolactinemia in this study was identified to be 22.9%. Other studies have reported very different macroprolactinemia incidences ranging from 10 to 45%.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^115qEEwo]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Hyperprolactinemia evaluation — hyperprolactinemia may be associated with decreased E2 concentrations and amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, yet only approximately 1/3 of women with hyperprolactinemia will have galactorrhea; prolactin concentrations are higher in women with amenorrhea than in those with oligomenorrhea, and prolactin levels < 15–20 ng/mL in most clinical laboratories will exclude hyperprolactinemia, whereas mildly elevated values (20–40 ng/mL) should be repeated and confirmed, and if they remain mildly elevated (and the patient is otherwise asymptomatic), a macroprolactin level should be considered; macroprolactin has been reported to have a prevalence as high as nearly 20% of patients diagnosed with hyperprolactinemia, is biologically inactive compared with the predominant circulating form of prolactin (80%–95%) called monomeric prolactin, and macroprolactinemia is confirmed by having the laboratory pretreat the patient's serum with polyethylene glycol to precipitate macroprolactin; establishing this diagnosis avoids unnecessary and costly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging.

### Macroprolactinemia revisited: a study on 106 patients [^114z3T47]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

The predominance of high molecular weight PRL, or macroprolactinemia, has long been known in hyperprolactinemic patients with maintained fertility. Among 1,106 consecutive patients investigated for hyperprolactinemia in our center over a 10-yr period, serum PRL chromatography was performed in 368 cases because of discordant clinical, biological, or neuroradiological findings. We prospectively studied the 106 patients with macroprolactinemia (96 women, 6 men, 4 children) and compared them with the 262 hyperprolactinemic patients with a normal PRL elution pattern. We concluded the following: 1) the incidence of macroprolactinemia in our hyperprolactinemic population was at least 10%; 2) despite preserved fertility with uneventful pregnancies, some of the usual symptoms of hyperprolactinemia were present; 3) mean PRL values were 61 ± 66 microg/liter (range, 20–663) and exceeded 100 microg/liter in 8.5% of patients; 4) PRL levels usually remained stable over time; 5) on dopaminergic therapy, PRL returned to normal in 21 of 45 treated patients; 6) during follow-up of 7 pregnancies, PRL increased to supraphysiological levels in 5; and 7) pituitary magnetic resonance imaging was normal in 78% of patients or revealed diverse pituitary lesions, including adenomas (n = 5). A diagnostic method for macroprolactinemia should be available to all centers to avoid unnecessary hormonal or radiological investigations and treatments.

### The impact of metformin on plasma prolactin levels in antipsychotics-treated men with hyperprolactinemia and early-onset androgenic alopecia [^1142nSrR]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Metformin decreases elevated levels of pituitary hormones. Little is known about the association between the reproductive axis and hormonal effects of this drug. The purpose of our study was to investigate whether activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis determines metformin action on prolactin levels in men with prolactin excess.

Design/Subjects/Measurements

This prospective cohort study included two groups of men with drug-induced hyperprolactinemia and type 2 diabetes or prediabetes: men with normal hair growth (group A, n = 23) and men with late-onset androgenic alopecia (group B; n = 22). Both groups, matched for age, HOMA-IR, and prolactin concentration, were treated for 6 months with metformin. The outcomes of interest included glucose homeostasis markers (fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin and HOMA-IR), plasma prolactin (both total and monomeric), other pituitary hormones (gonadotropins, TSH and ACTH), and peripheral hormones (testosterone, DHEAS and IGF-1).

Results

Before metformin treatment, group B was characterized by higher values of LH, LH/FSH ratio, testosterone (total, free and bioavailable) and DHEAS compared to group A. Six-month metformin treatment reduced fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin and HOMA-IR in both groups, though this effect was more pronounced in group A. The decrease in total and monomeric prolactin was observed only in group A. Their degree correlated inversely with total, free and bioavailable testosterone, positively with baseline prolactin levels, and positively with the impact on HOMA-IR. Compared to baseline values, follow-up LH was higher in group A and lower in group B.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that androgen excess may attenuate metformin action on overactive lactotrophs in men with early-onset androgenic alopecia.

### Antipsychotics and hyperprolactinaemia: clinical recommendations [^117JamwL]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

A group of international experts in psychiatry, medicine, toxicology and pharmacy assembled to undertake a critical examination of the currently available clinical guidance on hyperprolactinaemia. This paper summarises the group's collective views and provides a summary of the recommendations agreed by the consensus group to assist clinicians in the recognition, clinical assessment, investigation and management of elevated plasma prolactin levels in patients being treated for severe mental illness. It also deals with the special problems of particular populations, gives advice about information that should be provided to patients, and suggests a strategy for routine monitoring of prolactin. The recommendations are based upon the evidence contained in the supplement 'Hyperprolactinaemia in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder: Clinical Implications' (2008). The guidance contained in this article is not intended to replace national guidance (such as that of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence), however, it does provide additional detail that is unlikely to be covered in existing guidelines, and focuses on areas of uncertainty and disagreement. We hope it will add to the debate about this topic.

### Serum macroprolactin levels in pregnancy and association with thyroid autoimmunity [^112ataB8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Pregnancy and breastfeeding are the most important periods of long-term physiological increase of prolactin levels. Absence of galactorrhea is mostly related with the high levels of estrogen during pregnancy despite hyperprolactinemia. On the other hand, a probable alternative explanation for the absence of galactorrhea may be heterogeneity of prolactin molecules. It is well known that high-molecular weight isoforms of PRL have low binding affinity to PRL receptors. In addition, it was shown that the relative proportion of little PRL increased in pregnant women as pregnancy progressed. In some studies, the presence of big, big PRL has been reported in a range of 8–38% of total PRL during pregnancy. However, Hattori et al. has found that the frequency of macroprolactinemia was 2.9% in women during the third trimester of pregnancy (3 of 105). We found the frequency of macroprolactinemia as 1.4% in women in the first and second trimester. Unlike the other studies, our results were similar to the results of Hattori et al. The small number of patients with macroprolactinemia suggested that the increase of prolactin is quite homogenous during pregnancy. Interestingly, regardless of thyroid status, patients with macroprolactinemia had the highest PRL levels (400 and 403 ng/mL) compared with other patients. Our results were also similar to Pascoe-Lira et al.'s study. They found that 3.8% of the pregnant women had significant macroprolactinemia and total PRL concentration was observed higher in those patients. Another probable explanation for the discrepancy of published results may be the detection method which is commonly used for macroprolactin measurement. Although the gold standard method for detecting prolactin homogeneity or macroPRL is gel filtration chromatography, precipitation with polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a widely used, inexpensive, and easy screening test. Therefore, if we were using the latter method, results could have been different. In general, however, this method is not widely used, or available everywhere and recommended if borderline measurement was obtained. In other words, gel filtration chromatography would be necessary if 40–60% of prolactin recovery was detected after PEG precipitation. Almost all of our patients have shown > 90% persistency from initial levels of monomeric prolactin after PEG precipitation despite the clinical and laboratory differences. These data have supported the strong homogeneity for PRL during pregnancy as well.

### Persistence of macroprolactinemia due to antiprolactin autoantibody before, during, and after pregnancy in a woman with systemic lupus erythematosus [^114iFyas]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

A woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with marked increases in circulating 150-kDa PRL was studied from before conception, throughout pregnancy, and after pregnancy. The clinical features of the patient included idiopathic hyperprolactinemia without clinical symptoms such as amenorrhea and galactorrhea before pregnancy. No clinical lupus activity was present during follow-up. Serum PRL increase during pregnancy in this patient was considerably higher at weeks 27 and 33 than in normal pregnant women. In contrast, serum-free PRL levels were considerably lower at weeks 20, 27, and 33 than in normal pregnant women. A 150-kDa PRL (big big PRL) species persisted as the predominant circulating form of PRL throughout each measurement in this woman with SLE. In contrast, the predominant form of PRL in serum from healthy pregnant women was little PRL (or monomeric PRL). The nature of big big PRL was due to the presence of anti-PRL autoantibodies forming an IgG-23 kDa PRL complex, in accordance with the studies by affinity chromatography for IgG and Western blot analysis. The IgG-PRL complex was fully bioactive in vitro (Nb2 rat lymphoma cell assay). Injection of the serum into the rats demonstrated that the IgG-PRL complex was cleared more slowly than serum containing predominantly monomeric PRL. The data suggest that the IgG-PRL complex has biological activity; the absence of symptoms in this woman may be attributed to the fact that due to its large molecular weight, big big PRL does not easily cross the capillary walls. Delayed clearance may account for increased serum PRL levels in this SLE patient with anti-PRL autoantibodies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1122jAff]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperprolactinemia — macroprolactin screening in asymptomatic patients is suggested, as the guideline states we suggest assessing for macroprolactin with rating (2|⊕⊕○○). Retrospective analyses report that approximately 40% of patients with hyperprolactinemia have macroprolactinemia, and among those with macroprolactinemia, galactorrhea is present in 20%, oligo/amenorrhea in 45%, and pituitary adenomas in 20%. Macroprolactinemia should be suspected when typical symptoms of hyperprolactinemia are absent; many commercial assays do not detect macroprolactin, and polyethylene glycol precipitation is an inexpensive way to detect macroprolactin in serum. Because macroprolactinemia is a common cause of hyperprolactinemia and clinical criteria do not reliably distinguish it from true hyperprolactinemia, routine screening for macroprolactin could eliminate unnecessary diagnostic testing and treatment, and screening for macroprolactin in investigation of asymptomatic hyperprolactinemic subjects is suggested.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1115gKUp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Pituitary incidentaloma — prolactin assessment and management: The evaluation for hypersecretion should include an assessment for prolactin, and evidence is strongest for the need to measure a serum prolactin level in all patients presenting with an incidentaloma; ideally, for patients with large macroincidentalomas, the laboratory should measure prolactin levels in diluted serum to ensure that levels are not falsely lowered by a hook effect in the assay. Reported findings include hyperprolactinemia in five of 42 microincidentalomas at initial evaluation with none of 22 developing a prolactin elevation on prospective follow-up, prolactinomas detected in seven of 46 incidentalomas, prolactin elevations in two of 16 macroincidentalomas, and in a large autopsy study 39.5% of adenomas stained positive for prolactin. Patients with hyperprolactinemia could receive a trial of dopamine agonist therapy, recognizing that mild/moderate elevations may be due to stalk compression; in these patients, tumor shrinkage is unlikely and growth is still possible, so continued follow-up with repeat imaging is warranted.

### Serum macroprolactin levels in pregnancy and association with thyroid autoimmunity [^117C44QB]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Prolactin, a protein hormone, is secreted from the anterior pituitary usually in response to physiological and rarely pathological stimuli. Prolactin concentrations begin to increase after 6 weeks of pregnancy and reach the highest level in late pregnancy to prepare the mammary glands of the breasts for the production of milk. It is well known that circulating prolactin is not homogenous and three different forms are defined according to molecular size: monomeric PRL (monoPRL), big PRL (bigPRL), and macroprolactin (macroPRL). Macroprolactin is described as a complex of PRL with immunoglobulin G (IgG) which is related to antiprolactin autoantibodies. This formulation of PRL may cause limited bioactivity, bioavailability and clearance from the glomerulus. Macroprolactinemia is usually asymptomatic, patients with macroprolactinemia do not need further therapy, and pregnancy is possible without any treatment for such hyperprolactinemia. Although the gold standard method for detecting macroPRL is gel filtration chromatography, precipitation with polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a widely used screening test. A low PRL recovery, < 40%, after PEG precipitation indicates the presence of macroPRL. In hyperprolactinemic states, the contribution of macroprolactin has been found to be 10 to 25% of prolactin and macroprolactinemia may be present in about 0.2–3.6% of the general population.

Normal maternal thyroid function is essential for both fetal and maternal health and many physiological alterations occur during pregnancy. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and estrogen are two pregnancy-related hormones responsible for increased thyroid hormone levels in the blood. Thyroid disorders, particularly those with autoimmune origin, are common in women of reproductive age and both hypo and hyperthyroidism were reported to be associated with poor pregnancy outcome. Therefore, different trimester-specific reference ranges were defined to distinguish physiological alterations from pathological states. It has been shown that the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) can stimulate the secretion of prolactin in experimental conditions; however its physiological influence is not so obvious. Hypothyroidism may cause pituitary and thyrotrophic hyperplasia which result in elevated TRH and prolactin release. The high levels of both hormones may return to normal after effective thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

### Don't perform prolactin testing as part of the routine… [^115UaefC]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

It has become common practice to obtain prolactin levels in the routine infertility evaluation. However, there is no reason to expect that a woman would exhibit clinically significant, elevated prolactin levels in the presence of normal menstrual cycles and without galactorrhea. Therefore, serum testing of prolactin levels in a normally menstruating woman without galactorrhea provides no benefit and would not impact clinical management.

### Comparison of urinary prolactin and serum / urine prolactin ratio in hyperprolactinemic and macroprolactinemic patients [^1111uPMw]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Measurements

Blood and urine samples were collected simultaneously in the morning after an overnight fast. The following tests were performed on them: Prolactin and creatinine levels were measured in the urine samples.

In the blood sample, after separating the serum, both creatinine and prolactin levels were checked. Subsequently, serum prolactin was re-measured using polyethylene glycol to precipitate macroprolactin. The recovery percentage of prolactin after polyethylene glycol treatment was calculated using the following formula:

Patients were then divided into two groups: those with hyperprolactinemia (predominantly involving monomeric prolactin) and those with macroprolactinemia. An extensive literature review was conducted to determine the optimal cutoff value for the study.

The results of the studies showed that a consistent cutoff value was not used for the PEG test. However, based on a broader consensus around the value of 60%, we adopted the same threshold in our study. Specifically, serum samples with more than 60% recovery were considered to contain monomeric prolactin (genuine prolactin). Samples with less than 60% recovery were classified as containing macroprolactin. Based on the 60% cutoff, they were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of 19 participants with more than 60% recovery, classified as having hyperprolactinemia. The second group consisted of 31 participants with less than 60% recovery, classified as having macroprolactinemia. This approach allows us to study and measure the effect of macroprolactin and dimeric prolactin on urinary prolactin secretion in the macroprolactinemia group compared to the hyperprolactinemia group, which mainly consists of monomeric prolactin. The urinary prolactin level was assessed by measuring the ratio of urinary prolactin to urinary creatinine (primary objective), as well as the ratio of serum prolactin to urinary prolactin, and the ratio of serum prolactin to the urinary prolactin-to-creatinine ratio (secondary objective). These ratios were investigated and compared between the two groups.

Materials and devices used

In this study, PEG (6000 g/mol) was used. Prolactin levels were measured using the LIAISON Prolactin (xt) 312,171 device (DiaSorin, Italy), which employs the sandwich chemiluminescence immunoassay method. The device follows the WHO 3rd International Reference Preparation standard (84/500). The normal reference range for this device is as follows: Reference Range (5th-95th percentile) mIU/L.

Men = 87–392, Woman = 132–498.

### The impact of metformin on plasma prolactin levels in antipsychotics-treated men with hyperprolactinemia and early-onset androgenic alopecia [^116WurbF]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Men with early‐onset androgenic alopecia differed from individuals with no evidence of hair loss in LH, LH/FSH ratio, testosterone and DHEAS. This finding supports previous observations of other authors and obtained in our laboratory that this condition is associated with increased production of both gonadal and adrenal androgens. More importantly, between‐group differences in pituitary and testicular function were observed despite relatively high mean prolactin levels, having an inhibitory effect on activity of the reproductive axis. There are two possible explanations for the obtained results. Firstly, increased LH and androgen secretion in early‐onset androgenic alopecia may be resistant to the inhibitory impact of hyperprolactinemia. Secondly, most clinical observations concerning consequences of prolactin excess come from studies including only or predominantly women, while the impact of prolactin excess on the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐testicular axis was found to be less expressed than that on the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐ovarian axis. No significant impact on prolactin in men with early‐onset baldness may explain why sexual dysfunction was less frequent in this group than in their peers with normal hair growth before but not after metformin treatment.

In men with normal hair growth, metformin treatment reduced prolactin levels, and the magnitude of this effect was proportional to the baseline hormone concentration, which suggests dependence on the degree of overactivity of lactotropic cells. Relatively high mean concentration before metformin treatment explains why the impact of metformin reached the level of statistical significance, and why the obtained results differed from previous findings of our research group. In the mentioned studies, metformin did not affect prolactin levels in men with only slight or moderate prolactin excess (46 ± 5 ng/mL) of various origin, and in normoprolactinemic subjects with normal hair growth. The decrease in total hormone levels resulted from a reduction in monomeric prolactin, which is in line with a neutral effect of this drug on macroprolactin content. Thus, metformin reduces the fraction of prolactin with full biological activity.

### Serum macroprolactin levels in pregnancy and association with thyroid autoimmunity [^1112tvr6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Bacground

To assess the contribution of macroprolactin to high serum prolactin levels and their association with thyroid status and thyroid autoimmunity during pregnancy.

Methods

138 pregnant women who suspected of having thyroid dysfunction were studied and divided into three groups according to the thyroid status; group 1; euthyroidism (n 40), group 2; hypothyroidism (n 54), and group 3; hyperthyroid (n 44). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method was used for detection of macroprolactin. A percentage recovery of 40% or less is considered as macroprolactinemia. If macroprolactin was negative, the percentage of monomeric prolactin recovery (monoPRL %) after PEG precipitation was used for comparison between the groups.

Results

Macroprolactinemia was found in two patients (1.4%) one from hypothyroid and other from euthyroid group. Basal prolactin levels in these patients were 400 and 403 ng/mL respectively. Referring to all patients, there was no correlation between PRL, macroPRL or monoPRL % with thyroid hormone status and also with the serum levels of thyroid antibodies (p > 0.05). A positive correlation was observed between the serum levels of PRL with TSH (p = 0.014 and r = 0.219), while a negative correlation was found with FT4 (p = 0.011 and r = −0.227).

Conclusions

Despite the fact that serum prolactin levels were found to be high during pregnancy, the contribution of macroprolactin was found to be insignificant in our study. Unlike other auto immune diseases, we could not find any relationship between thyroid autoimmunity and PRL, macroPRL or monoPRL %. These results confirmed that measured prolactin was quite homogeneous during pregnancy.

Hyperprolactinemia — cabergoline outcomes in micro- and macroprolactinomas show high biochemical and clinical response rates. In a placebo-controlled study, cabergoline treatment (0.125–1.0 mg twice weekly) for 12–24 months in prolactin-secreting microadenomas resulted in normalization of prolactin levels in 95% of patients and restored menses in 82% of women with amenorrhea. In a prospective study of 26 treatment-naive macroprolactinomas, normoprolactinemia was achieved within 6 months in 81% of patients receiving 0.25–2 mg cabergoline weekly, and 92% exhibited significant tumor shrinkage. In a retrospective series of 455 patients, cabergoline normalized prolactin levels in 92% of patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia or a microprolactinoma and in 77% of 181 patients with macroadenomas; additionally, 80% of men with macroadenomas or microadenomas experience prolactin normalization after dopamine agonist therapy.

Prolactin assay

All prolactin concentrations were measured using the Elecsys® Prolactin II assay from Roche Diagnostics (Cobas 8000; Mannheim, Germany). Prolactin immunoassays were calibrated against the World Health Organization (WHO) third international standard for prolactin (IS 84/500). The assay has an intra-assay imprecision (coefficient of variation; CV) of 5.8% and 2.9% at prolactin concentrations of 6.2 and 34.3 ng/mL, respectively. The inter-assay CVs in our experiments were 3.0% and 6.4%. All analyses were conducted using standardized laboratory procedures.

Demographic and biochemical details collection

All patient charts were reviewed to record clinical signs and symptoms associated with hyperprolactinemia, including galactorrhea, menstrual disturbances, visual disturbances and the evidence of pituitary adenoma by imaging studies.

Statistical analysis

Means and standard deviations (SD) were calculated for continuous variables. Serum prolactin concentrations were non-normally distributed and therefore were presented as medians (M) and quartiles (QR). Serum monomeric prolactin reference intervals were defined as 95% confidence limits. Patients were stratified under macroprolactinemia groups and true hyperprolactinemia groups, according to monomeric prolactin reference range after PEG treatment. The Chi-square test was used for categorical variables. Differences were considered statistically significant at a P value of less than 0.05. Data were analyzed using the SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).

### The impact of metformin on plasma prolactin levels in antipsychotics-treated men with hyperprolactinemia and early-onset androgenic alopecia [^114z2K6R]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Study Design

All participants were treated with metformin for 6 months. The starting dose (500 mg twice a day) was administered in the first week of treatment. Metformin was taken with meals or soon thereafter to improve its gastrointestinal tolerance. Then the dose was slowly (over 14–28 days) titrated upwards. The recommended dose (3 g daily) was administered in three divided doses for the remaining study period. No changes in the dose of ongoing antipsychotic were allowed throughout the study duration. Other treatments were allowed provided they were not listed as an exclusion criterion, their duration was no longer than a week, and the treatment was ceased at least 4 weeks before enrollment. Throughout the study, all participants were required to comply with the goals of lifestyle modification. Medication compliance was calculated by counting the number of pills left in the container. Good compliance was defined as taking at least 90% of the prescribed medications.

2.3 Laboratory Assays

The blood was collected in constant daily hours (between 8.00 and 9.30 a.m.) after an overnight 12‐h fasting, at the beginning of the study and 6 months later. All measurements were carried out in duplicate by persons unaware of the individual's affiliation to the study group. Because of a pulsatile secretion pattern and an increase in response to stress and venipuncture, prolactin concentration were assessed in three blood samples taken at 20‐min intervals, and the obtained results were averaged. Monomeric prolactin was isolated using the polyethylene glycol precipitation method. Fasting glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), total prolactin, monomeric prolactin, LH, FSH, total testosterone, DHEAS and sex hormone‐binding globulin were measured as previously described. The homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR), estimating insulin sensitivity, was calculated by multiplying fasting glucose (mg/dL) and insulin (mU/L) and dividing the product by 405. Free and bioavailable testosterone were calculated using the online calculator available at.

### PEG precipitation to detect macro-TSH in clinical practice: a systematic review [^116ALbwA]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

The revision has highlighted differences in terms of PEG concentrations used in the protocols and terminology for reporting the finding of a PEG precipitation procedure. These discrepancies were consistent with the different types of studies, in fact almost all observational studies were performed using a PEG concentration of 12.5% and reported results as PEG‐precipitable TSH, instead most of the case reports were addressed with a PEG concentration of 25% and the findings were reported as recoverable TSH after the procedure. Therefore, given the most robustness of the available data, it is reasonable to routinely use a PEG concentration of 12.5% and to express the relative findings in terms of PEG‐precipitable TSH. The latter observation is further supported by another issue. Currently, when laboratories investigate macro‐PRL in the samples, they use an indirect method to report an approximate concentration of "free" PRL that requires a PRL post‐PEG recovery value, because it is used to identify a post‐PEG monomeric PRL reference interval or a multiplication factor to correct PEG/dilution. This system is unfit for testing TSH because the recovery range of TSH is wider than that of PRL, which limits the usefulness of the test for calculating monomeric TSH. Thus, PEG precipitation measures are more accurate than the post‐PEG recovery values.

For a full understanding of the PEG precipitation technique and a proper interpretation of its results, it is necessary to note that also the non‐macro TSH samples used as controls showed per se a certain degree of PEG‐precipitable TSH up to ≈69%, which was significantly higher than those reported for PRL (≈30%). The high precipitation ratios of serum TSH may be attributable to the nature of the TSH molecule, which is prone to precipitation with PEG in the presence of γ‐globulin plus albumin. Therefore, this finding should not be considered pathological. Accordingly, this value is quite lower than the thresholds for precipitable TSH in macro‐TSH cases which are on average greater than 81% (> 75%, considering standard deviation). Therefore, a PEG precipitation cut‐off > 75% seems to be the threshold most consistent with the available evidence.

### Comparison of urinary prolactin and serum / urine prolactin ratio in hyperprolactinemic and macroprolactinemic patients [^115D4Tzq]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

In most healthy individuals, the monomeric form of prolactin accounts for 65–85% of the total prolactin in blood circulation, while the dimeric form comprises 10–20%, and macroprolactin naturally makes up less than 10%. The prevalence of macroprolactinemia has ranged from 15% to 46%. The gold standard method for determining macroprolactin is gel filtration chromatography (GFC). However, it is time-consuming, complex, expensive, and not widely available. Alternative techniques based on serum prolactin immunoassays before and after the removal of macroprolactin through ultrafiltration, IgG immunoabsorption using protein A or anti-human IgG, or polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation have been described. Studies have shown that PEG precipitation is superior, exhibiting the best correlation with gel filtration chromatography. Additionally, it has the advantage of precipitating dimeric prolactin and is 27 times less expensive than gel filtration chromatography. Different protocols for performing the PEG precipitation test exist, and variations in serum volume, type of PEG used, mixing time, and temperature/centrifugation/incubation times, can lead to differences in laboratory results. These protocols increase the potential for human error, thereby reducing the reproducibility of the test and its consistency in results. Nevertheless, PEG precipitation remains the most widely used method for detecting macroprolactin. There is a need for a convenient and inexpensive test to identify macroprolactin in cases of hyperprolactinemia.

Current methods, such as chromatography, are expensive and challenging, while the commonly used PEG test has limitations and lacks standardization. This study suggests a potential new method for diagnosing macroprolactinemia, based on the fact that macroprolactin, unlike monomeric prolactin, is not excreted in urine, resulting in lower urinary prolactin levels. This method would calculate the presence of macroprolactin by comparing serum and urinary prolactin levels. This approach could offer a non-invasive, accessible, and less expensive diagnostic tool for macroprolactinemia.

### Characterization of macroprolactin and assessment of markers of autoimmunity in macroprolactinaemic patients [^114woE79]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

It has been reported that macroprolactin is a complex of PRL and an immunoglobulin G (IgG). This study further characterizes macroprolactin and evaluates for other markers of autoimmunity using a cohort of macroprolactinaemic sera. PATIENTS AND NORMAL SUBJECTS: Following treatment of hyperprolactinaemic sera (n = 58) with polyethylene glycol (PEG), PRL values fell from 524–13 546 mU/l (Range) to 452–8455 mU/l, while in macroprolactinaemic sera (n = 41), PRL concentration fell from 525–5747 to 98–378 mU/l (PEG treated normoprolactinaemic reference range, 68–230 mU/l in males, 70–390 mU/l in females).

Design

PRL was measured in sera prior to and following gel filtration chromatography, ultrafiltration, treatment with protein A-sepharose, protein G-sepharose, antihuman IgG-agarose and sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN). The binding of radio-labelled PRL in macroprolactinaemic sera was also measured. Sera were assayed for antithyroid and antinuclear antibodies. C-reactive protein (CRP) and CD5 positive B cells were also measured. Comparisons were made between values obtained in normal, hyperprolactinaemic and macroprolactinaemic sera. Results Macroprolactinaemic sera indicated the presence of an IgG molecule and/or IgG fragments with one or more molecules of PRL. In 97% of the sera macroprolactin had a molecular weight of 204 kDa. Treatment of macroprolactinaemic sera with NaSCN caused dissociation of macroprolactin, releasing monomeric PRL. Macroprolactinaemic sera did not yield evidence of an increase in markers of autoimmunity when compared with hyperprolactinaemic or normal sera.

Conclusions

Comprehensive analysis of macroprolactin confirmed its composition as an IgG molecule or fragment with a PRL molecule. The occurrence of macroprolactin does not appear to be associated with autoimmunity.

### Screening for macroprolactinaemia and pituitary imaging studies [^1132md34]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Hyperprolactinaemia is caused by high levels of monomeric, dimeric or macro forms of prolactin in circulation, the monomeric form being predominant in patients with prolactinomas. Macroprolactinaemia, however, is common and is associated with asymptomatic cases. In this study, we reviewed our records regarding clinical and imaging investigations in patients who were found to have hyperprolactinaemia predominantly due to the presence of macroprolactin and compared them with the findings observed in patients whose prolactin molecular size consisted predominantly of the monomeric form.

Patients and Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of 113 consecutive patients (nine men and 104 women, aged 19–67 years, median age 39 years) with hyperprolactinaemia who were screened for the presence of macroprolactin by polyethylene glycol precipitation and/or chromatography and submitted to pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computerized tomography (CT).

Results

Fifty-two of 113 patients (46%) had hyperprolactinaemia due to macroprolactin, whereas the remaining 61 patients (54%) had their hyperprolactinaemia confirmed by the predominance of the monomeric form. Both groups shared similar mean prolactin levels (79.9 ± 63.6 micro g/l, median of 62.0 micro g/l, and 97.9 ± 155.4 micro g/l, median of 61.0 micro g/l, respectively). Of the patients with macroprolactinaemia, 46% had no symptoms of hyperprolactinaemia, whereas only 10% of the patients who screened negative for macroprolactin were asymptomatic. There was an association between macroprolactinaemia and negative pituitary imaging findings: normal pituitary images were found in 78.9% of patients who had macroprolactinaemia and in 25% of patients with monomeric hyperprolactinaemia. In addition, none of the patients with macroprolactinoma (seven cases) had macroprolactinaemia.

Conclusions

The presence of macroprolactinaemia does not exclude the possibility of a pituitary adenoma and consequently may not prevent pituitary imaging studies. However, our data demonstrate that all asymptomatic patients who screened positive for macroprolactin had normal pituitary imaging studies. Patient samples showing hyperprolactinaemia should be first tested for macroprolactin, before the patient is submitted to imaging studies. We suggest that imaging studies should be ordered in patients with macroprolactinaemia when indicated by clinically relevant features. As a result, unnecessary anxiety and costly medical procedures may be prevented.

### Approach to the patient with prolactinoma [^113uXCJw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Macroprolactin

Macroprolactin is an isoform of PRL with greater molecular weight and reduced biological activity. In patients with asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia, the assessment for macroprolactin can help endocrinologists in preventing incorrect diagnoses leading to inappropriate treatments, and in discriminating true hyperprolactinemia requiring a proper therapeutic approach. Although more than 80% of circulating PRL is monomeric (23 kDa), serum can also contain a covalently bound dimer and a larger polymeric form, known as "big prolactin" (50 kDa) and "big-big prolactin" (150 kDa), respectively. In most cases, macroprolactin is composed of a complex formed by an IgG and a monomeric PRL; consequent hyperprolactinemia results from low renal PRL clearance and reduced dopaminergic tone. Macroprolactin is quite common; it has been reported to cause hyperprolactinemia in approximately 20% of cases. Therefore, screening for macroprolactin with the use of polyethylene glycol should be routinely offered, before investigating alternative causes of PRL excess, in patients with asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia. The overall prevalence of signs and symptoms of PRL excess in patients with macroprolactin is generally lower than that observed in patients with monomeric hyperprolactinemia. Indeed, menstrual disturbances, including both oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea, as well as galactorrhea and a combination of menstrual disturbances and galactorrhea have been reported to occur in 24%, 13%, and 2% of patients with macroprolactin, respectively, presumably resulting from concomitant disorders, such as polycystic ovary syndrome and pituitary tumors, compared with 26%, 29%, and 34% of those with monomeric hyperprolactinemia, respectively. This suggests a potential overlap in the clinical presentation mainly in terms of infertility features. Of note, more than 60% of patients with macroprolactin reported no peculiar signs and symptoms of PRL excess. The coexistence of macroprolactin and pituitary incidentalomas may result in a further diagnostic pitfall leading to an improper diagnosis of prolactinoma, but the absence of a clinical syndrome specifically ascribable to hyperprolactinemia may assist in a better diagnostic definition.

Comparison of the demographic and biochemical characteristics of patients with true hyperprolactinemia and macroprolactinemia

The demographic and biochemical details of patients with true hyperprolactinemia and macroprolactinemia were compared (Table 4). Total prolactin was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in patients with true hyperprolactinemia compared to patients with macroprolactinemia, and this difference was maintained after treatment of serum with PEG.

Table 4
Comparison of demographic and biochemical characteristics of the patients

*MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; CT, computed tomography

The clinical presentations were diverse and varied between macroprolactinemic and true hyperprolactinemic patients (Fig. 2). Menstrual disturbances were the main clinical feature in macroprolactinemic and true hyperprolactinemic female patients (38.1% vs. 48.9%). Galactorrhea was significantly more common in true hyperprolactinemic patients (P = 0.02), as well as amenorrhea (P = 0.01) and visual disturbances (P = 0.01). There was no significant difference in the incidence of headache between the true hyperprolactinemic and macroprolactinemic patients. However, in the macroprolactinemic group, the most common clinical symptoms were heat intolerance due to thyroidal illness, infertility, and obesity, in addition to less common symptoms of headache and galactorrhea.

Imaging studies [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT)] were conducted in 201 true hyperprolactinemic patients. However, only 30 patients with macroprolactinemia were directed to further radiological examination. Medical data showed that 120 (59.7%) of the 201 true hyperprolactinemic patients were confirmed to have pituitary adenomas. In contrast, in the group of macroprolactinemia cases, only five patients (17%) were identified with pituitary microadenoma, as shown in Table 4.

Medication-induced hyperprolactinemia — management recommendations state: we suggest that clinicians not treat patients with asymptomatic medication-induced hyperprolactinemia (2|⊕⊕○○), and we suggest the use of estrogen or testosterone in patients with long-term hypogonadism (hypogonadal symptoms or low bone mass) related to medication-induced hyperprolactinemia (2|⊕⊕○○). No treatment is necessary in the asymptomatic patient, and if the drug cannot be discontinued or substituted and the patient has hypogonadal symptoms or low bone mass, estrogen or testosterone therapy should be considered; we suggest that the first step in treatment is to stop the drug if this is clinically feasible, substitute a drug with a similar action that does not cause hyperprolactinemia if stopping is not possible, and if this is not feasible we suggest considering the cautious administration of a dopamine agonist in consultation with the patient's physician (2|⊕⊕○○); some studies suggest that dopamine agonist therapy will normalize prolactin levels in only up to 75% of such patients but may lead to exacerbation of the underlying psychosis. In recommending against the use of dopamine agonists, we are placing a low value on avoiding the adverse consequences of hyperprolactinemia due to medications that cannot be replaced or discontinued, a low value on foregoing the potential benefits of dopamine agonists, and a high value on avoiding adverse effects of such therapy, including psychosis exacerbation.

Frequency of macroprolactin in hyperprolactinemia

Using PEG precipitation, 1140 patients with total prolactin levels above normal range were screened for macroprolactinemia. The median age of the patients was 33 years (interquartile range (IQR) = 27, 42) and the male/female ratio was 267/873 with female preponderance. The median total prolactin (ng/mL) was 29.1 (IQR = 21.3, 48.4) in males compared to 50.3 (IQR = 34.3, 88.7) in females. Macroprolactinemia was present in 22.9% (n = 261) of hyperprolactinemic patients with normal monomeric prolactin concentrations. True hyperprolactinemia was identified in 77.1% (n = 879) of patients. Based on serum total prolactin, all patients were divided into three groups. The prevalence of macroprolactinemia was 34.4%, 19.8%, and 6.4% in groups with total prolactin below 50.0, 50.0–100.0, and above 100.0 ng/mL, respectively. The frequency of macroprolactinemia was the highest in patients with total prolactin less than 50.0 ng/mL. A significantly higher proportion of macroprolactinemia patients had total prolactin below 100 ng/mL (P < 0.001). A summary of the prevalence is presented in Fig. 1.

### Clinical and radiological features of patients with macroprolactinaemia [^113JCv1i]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Macroprolactin is a complex of prolactin (PRL) and IgG and may account for a significant proportion of cases of 'idiopathic hyperprolactinaemia'. In this study, we sought to determine the prevalence and clinical features of macroprolactinaemia in patients diagnosed with hyperprolactinaemia in our region, with a view to determining how patients with macroprolactinaemia should be investigated and managed.

Patients and Methods

An Immuno-1 automated immunoassay system with polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation was used to identify macroprolactin, with a recovery of ≤ 50% taken as indicating significant macroprolactinaemia. Macroprolactin was found in 58 (21%) of 273 patients with a total PRL > 700 mU/l. The clinical records of 51 (44 female) were available for retrospective review.

Results

The mean (range) age of patients was 39.5 (18–82) years. The median (range) concentrations for the various forms of PRL were: total PRL 1130 mU/l (728–5116), monomeric PRL 240 mU/l (50–656) and macroprolactin 895 mU/l (381–4854). Classical symptoms of hyperprolactinaemia were present in 39% of patients, although in many there were other possible explanations for their symptomatology. Pituitary adenomas were identified in six out of 36 people who underwent neuroimaging. Five of these patients had a microadenoma and one had a 10-mm macroadenoma (although, in this patient macroprolactin was identified after the discovery of the tumour). There was no relationship between macroprolactin concentrations and the presence of hyperprolactinaemic symptoms or neuroimaging abnormalities.

Conclusions

Macroprolactinaemia is a common occurrence in patients with hyperprolactinaemia, but associated symptomatology may not necessarily be linked. The neuroimaging abnormalities were also probably incidental findings and it is questionable whether neuroimaging is necessary when significant macroprolactinaemia is identified and the concentration of monomeric PRL is not elevated (using the Immuno-1 assay system, following PEG precipitation).

### Comparison of urinary prolactin and serum / urine prolactin ratio in hyperprolactinemic and macroprolactinemic patients [^111hExF5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

The results of Pekkolay et al.'s studies also showed that an increased serum-to-urine prolactin ratio in hyperprolactinemia suggests the presence of more monomeric prolactins in the urine.

However, since urinary prolactin is in the denominator, an increase in urinary prolactin should lower the ratio.

In the current study, despite similar mean serum prolactin levels, the macroprolactinemia group had a higher ratio due to lower urinary prolactin levels. This difference could be attributed to the larger sample size. Additionally, the study introduced a new ratio comparing serum prolactin to the ratio of urinary prolactin to urinary creatinine, which was significantly higher in the macroprolactinemia group, but no other studies were found for comparison.

Given the significant difference in the mentioned variables between the two studied groups and their ability to distinguish macroprolactinemic from hyperprolactinemic individuals in cases of elevated serum prolactin levels, ROC curves were generated to determine the distinguishing values for these groups, and the sensitivity and specificity of these values were examined.

Based on the serum-to-urinary prolactin ratio, a cut-off point of > 34.65 was calculated, with a sensitivity of 0.71 and a specificity of 0.58. This indicates that in cases of increased serum prolactin, a ratio higher than 34.65 can detect macroprolactinemic individuals with relatively good sensitivity and moderate specificity. The ROC curve result of Pekkolay et al.'s study showed that simultaneous measurement of serum and urine prolactin could distinguish between normal individuals and patients with macroprolactinemia and hyperprolactinemia, which is consistent with the results of our study.

Although the sensitivity and specificity of the attained values were higher than in our study, they provided a more representative comparison between macroprolactinemic, hyperprolactinemic, and normal individuals. Investigating the difference in urinary prolactin levels among these groups is an appropriate approach. However, the primary goal of this study is to distinguish macroprolactinemic patients within groups with elevated serum prolactin levels, rather than identifying them among normal individuals. Our data helps identify macroprolactinemic patients in cases with raised serum prolactin levels, offering a more practical approach. Our goal is to develop a reliable method for diagnosing macroprolactinemia, bringing us closer to improving the diagnosis of true hyperprolactinemia.

### Establishment of reference intervals of monomeric prolactin to identify macroprolactinemia in Chinese patients with increased total prolactin [^113DSKe3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Reference intervals of monomeric prolactin establishment and validation

For the monomeric prolactin reference interval study, 240 blood samples (120 females, 120 males) from healthy donors between 18 and 60 years old were collected into serum gel tubes (Vacutainer 5.0 mL; BD). Females who were in hormone treatment for menopause or using estrogen-containing contraceptives were excluded. Samples were left to coagulate at room temperature for at least 30 min and were then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min within 2 h. The serum was then divided into aliquots and stored at -30 °C until analysis.

Hyperprolactinemia specimens

In total, 4520 patients 18 to 80 years of age were recruited from the Department of Endocrinology, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, between May and December 2020. The study included 1140 serum specimens from the 4520 cases with total prolactin levels above normal range (Males > 15.2ng/mL, females > 23.3ng/mL; this reference interval was validated by and used in the Department of Laboratory Medicine of Huashan Hospital). All samples were stored frozen at -30 °C until assay-specific prolactin measurements were carried out.

Gel filtration chromatography

The presence of monomeric prolactin was identified by gel filtration chromatography as described previously. Macroprolactinemia was defined when the content of macroprolactin components accounted for more than 50% of the total prolactin. By GFC, we identified 20 macroprolactinemia samples (15 female, five male) from 95 patients whose sera indicated the presence of biochemical hyperprolactinemia before PEG-precipitation.

PEG-precipitation

PEG-precipitation was performed by adding 200 µL of serum to an equal volume of 25% (w/v) PEG 6000 dissolved in 0.9% normal saline. After vortexing for 10 min at room temperature, specimens were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. The post-PEG monomeric prolactin level was determined by multiplying the prolactin concentration in the supernatant by two to correct for the dilution with PEG. Prolactin recovery was calculated by dividing the post-PEG monomeric prolactin concentration by the total prolactin result. If the post-PEG monomeric prolactin was more than 60% of total prolactin, the specimen was considered negative for macroprolactin. To validate the established post-PEG reference intervals, we compared the classifications of macroprolactinemia obtained using our reference interval to the those obtained using GFC.

### The impact on clinical practice of routine screening for macroprolactin [^1131btk9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Macroprolactin has reduced bioactivity in vivo and accumulates in the sera of some subjects, resulting in pseudo-hyperprolactinemia and consequent misdiagnosis.

Methods

We have audited our experience of routine screening for macroprolactin using polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation over a 5-yr period in a single center.

Results

Application of a reference range for monomeric prolactin (the residual prolactin present in macroprolactin-depleted serum) for normal individuals revealed that 453 of 2089 hyperprolactinemic samples (22%) identified by Delfia immunoassay were explained entirely by macroprolactin. The percentage of hyperprolactinemic samples explained by macroprolactinemia was similar across all levels of total prolactin (18, 21, 19, and 17% of samples from 700–1000, 1000–2000, 2000–3000, and greater than 3000 mU/liter, respectively). Application of an absolute prolactin threshold after polyethylene glycol treatment of sera, rather than the traditional method, i.e. less than 40% recovery, minimizes the opportunity for misclassification of patients in whom macroprolactin accounted for more than 60% of prolactin and the residual bioactive prolactin was present in excess. Macroprolactinemic patients could not be differentiated from true hyperprolactinemic patients on the basis of clinical features alone. Although oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and galactorrhea were more common in patients with true hyperprolactinemia (P < 0.05), they were also frequently present in macroprolactinemic patients. Plasma levels of estradiol and LH and the LH/FSH ratio were significantly greater in macroprolactinemic compared with true hyperprolactinemic subjects (P < 0.05). Reduced use of imaging and dopamine agonist treatment resulted in a net cost savings, offsetting the additional cost associated with the introduction of screening.

Conclusion

Routine screening of all hyperprolactinemic sera for macroprolactin is recommended.

### PEG precipitation to detect macro-TSH in clinical practice: a systematic review [^1123cqtX]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Another pituitary hormone that was also found to behave as a macro‐hormone is macro‐prolactin (macro‐PRL), which stands out as the most frequently detected macro‐hormone. It has been detected in 10%–25% of patients with hyperprolactinemia and 4% of the general population. Therefore, the knowledge and diagnostic procedures developed for macro‐PRL have subsequently been proposed for other macro‐hormones, including macro‐TSH.

Currently, gel filtration chromatography (GFC) is often considered as a key method for diagnosing macro‐TSH. GFC separates proteins on the basis of their molecular size, isolating the high‐molecular‐weight macro‐TSH complex from the smaller single TSH molecule. However, GFC is expensive, time‐consuming and not widely available in daily clinical practice. Additionally, macro‐TSH–Ig complexes are weakly bound and may dissociate during the gel filtration process, potentially confusing the estimation of the biologically active TSH concentration. This issue was also highlighted by Hattori et al. on the basis of the low affinity of the autoantibodies. Thus, they devised a radio‐labelled TSH binding assay that may be considered the new gold standard.

A more widespread and accessible technique is polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, which is routinely used for the diagnosis of macro‐PRL. PEG affects solvent accessibility reducing the solubility of some biomolecules. When PEG is added to a sample containing immunoglobulins, it makes them insoluble, causing precipitation of immunoglobulin‐hormone complexes and making uncomplexed hormone molecules detectable. This method has demonstrated high efficacy for the precipitation of IgG and IgM, however, the sensitivity for IgA is reduced, with only about 50% of IgA precipitable. Since macro‐TSH and macro‐PRL share a similar pathogenesis, PEG has been proposed for the identification of macro‐TSH. However, cross‐reactivity can occur and it is noteworthy that this is assay‐dependent, meaning that different methods may yield varying results. Unlike macro‐PRL, several aspects of PEG precipitation for macro‐TSH detection must be well defined, including terminology, application protocols, and thresholds of PEG‐precipitable TSH in "no macro‐TSH" samples (controls). This has limited the use of this technique in research.

### Hyperprolactinemia in asymptomatic patients is related to high molecular weight posttranslational variants or glycosylated forms [^114DskxZ]. Pituitary (2002). Low credibility.

Circulating human Prolactin (PRL) exists in different variants related to posttranslational modifications, dimerization or association with other serum proteins. Compared to monomeric prolactin these variants usually have little or no biologic activity and include BigBig (BB PRL), Big (B PRL), and Glycosylated forms (G PRL). The aim of the present study was to assess levels of BB PRL, B PRL, little PRL (L PRL) and G PRL in hyperprolactinemic patients with no menstrual alterations or galactorrhea. L PRL, B PRL, and BB PRL were identified by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-100; G PRL and NG PRL were identified by chromatography on Concanavalin A Sepharose. PRL was measured by IRMA DPC. Eleven women, aged 22–50 yrs, were studied for: breast dysplasia (1), controlled hypothyroidism (3), dysmenorrhea (3), microadenoma follow-up (2), and gynecological control (2). Pituitary MRI was normal in all but one patient, who had a microadenoma discovered by Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Six patients had normal L PRL levels, and their hyper PRL was due to excess BPRL or BB PRL. Five patients had increased L PRL levels, but excess G PRL. Patients harboring molecular PRL variants do not present the symptoms typical of the hyperprolactinemic syndrome. Furthermore in patients with clinically controlled prolactinomas the presence of PRL variants should be ruled out to avoid an unnecessary increase of dopamine agonist dosage.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology disease state clinical review: clinical relevance of macroprolactin in the absence or presence of true hyperprolactinemia [^116skS26]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the current literature regarding the prevalence of macroprolactin (macroPRL) in hyperprolactinemic patients and determine recommendations for testing.

Methods

An electronic United States National Library of Medicine PubMed search (through October, 2014) was conducted for search term "macroprolactin". Only English-language articles were considered.

Results

MacroPRL is an under-recognized cause of elevated prolactin (PRL) and is present in approximately 4% to 40% of hyperprolactinemic patients depending on the referral population. Clinical findings which could be due to hyperprolactinemia are the impetus for testing for PRL. Because of this there is significant overlap in the clinical presentation of patients with true hyperprolactinemia and those with macroPRL, differentiation cannot always be made on the basis of symptoms. A lack of recognition of the presence of macroPRL can lead to unnecessary laboratory investigations, imaging, and pharmacologic or surgical treatment.

Conclusion

Until there is a commercially available PRL assay that is not subject to interference by macroPRL, clinicians should consider the possibility of macroPRL, especially if the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and/or response to therapy reveal inconsistencies.

### The prolactin receptor is expressed in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis synovial tissue and contributes to macrophage activation [^112dSv4b]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Our findings may provide in part a biological rationale for known associations between PRL and RA: disease remission during pregnancy, with higher disease activity during lactation and an increased risk of developing RA after lactation. During pregnancy, PRL levels increase gradually and reaching the highest levels after delivery. During pregnancy, the disease activity of RA may be controlled by an increase of oestrogens and progesterone and the transient period of hypercortisolism, resulting in relatively less exacerbations of RA. We could not confirm a relationship between serum monomeric 23 kDa PRL levels and clinical signs and symptoms in two cohorts of RA patients (119 and 30 patients each). It is known that apart from the major isoform, monomeric 23 kDa PRL, two other isoforms (so-called big PRL and macroPRL) exist in the circulation, although only the 23 kDa PRL is predominantly biologically active. It has also been shown that different assays show variable accuracy in detecting 23 kDa PRL in the presence of macroPRL. Therefore, it is important in clinical cases of hyperprolactinaemia to use different assays and/or use polyethylene glycol immunoprecipitation to remove the macroPRL before measurement of PRL. Our cohort of RA patients, both male and female, was larger compared with a previously published cohort, in which 29, only male, RA patients were included. The findings of the previous cohort are based on a small cohort of RA patients and therefore caution is required regarding these conclusions. This may suggest that systemic levels of PRL (originating from the pituitary) may have a minor role in the pathology of RA, while an autocrine/paracrine loop of PRL acting in the ST may be more important. Of note, an autocrine loop of PRL could enhance the inflammatory response of activated monocytes at the site of inflammation.

### Macroprolactin over time: is there any point in rechecking it in people with a persistently elevated serum prolactin? [^1156h5Vk]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective and Design

Macroprolactinemia may influence the interpretation of serum prolactin levels-a recognised phenomenon since 1981. The degree of macroprolactinaemia over time is less well described. We determined how macroprolactin status (based on polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation) varied by analysing serial measurements in hyperprolactinaemic individuals over a period of 9 years.

Patients and Measurements

Results from 1810 individuals were included. All serum total prolactin results (measured using Roche Cobas 8000 analyser) were extracted from the laboratory information system for the period 1 January 2012 to 1 April 2021, along with relevant patient demographic/test data. Samples with a macroprolactin screening test performed (on samples with prolactin > 700miu/L) were included in the main analysis.

Results

During the study period, 2782 macroprolactin checks were performed (12.5% of all prolactin tests) in 1810 individuals (599 males/2183 females, median-age: 35, interquartile range: 25–47, range: 16–93 years). Multiple macroprolactin checks were carried out on 465 patients (1437 measurements) with 94 patients (141 measurements) screening positive (< 60% recovery). Only 19 patients (18 female) had at least one result above and one below the 60% screening cut-off, with 10 of these patients having results close to the 60% cut-off; in 9 patients, results were clearly different between repeat samples. In seven cases, the adjusted monomeric prolactin showed a potentially clinically significant difference.

Conclusions

In this study, only 19/465 patients appeared to change macroprolactin status based on a 60% PEG recovery cut-off. The majority of these 19 patients were on antipsychotic/antidepressant medication(s) or had a prolactinoma; in only 7 did monomeric prolactin change significantly. This suggests that once macroprolactin status has been determined, clinical decision making is rarely affected by repeating it.

### The impact of metformin on plasma prolactin levels in antipsychotics-treated men with hyperprolactinemia and early-onset androgenic alopecia [^1179fXYV]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Daily doses of antipsychotic drugs in the study population.

Before metformin treatment, groups A and B differed in LH, LH/FSH ratio, total testosterone, free testosterone, bioavailable testosterone and DHEAS. There were no differences in age, proportions of men with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, smoking habits, body mass index, blood pressure, fasting glucose, HbA 1c, HOMA‐IR, total prolactin, monomeric prolactin, FSH, TSH, ACTH and IGF‐1 (Tables 2 and 3). Metformin did not affect body mass index and blood pressure. In both groups, fasting glucose, HbA 1c and HOMA‐IR were lower after 6‐month metformin treatment than at study entry. In group A, but not in group B, follow‐up concentrations of total and monomeric prolactin were lower than baseline concentrations. The drug increased LH in group A, and reduced LH and LH/FSH ratio in group B. Metformin did not affect FSH, total testosterone, free testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, DHEAS, TSH, ACTH and IGF‐1. At the end of the study, glucose, HbA 1c HOMA‐IR, total and monomeric prolactin, total testosterone, free testosterone and bioavailable testosterone were lower in group A than group B (Table 2). There were differences in the percentage changes from baseline in fasting, glucose, HbA 1c, HOMA‐IR, total prolactin, monomeric prolactin, LH and LH/FSH ratio (Table 4). At the end of the study, sexual dysfunction was reported by five men in each group (25%).

### Serum macroprolactin levels in pregnancy and association with thyroid autoimmunity [^117Wr9Bi]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Correlation analyses of prolactin and monoPRL % with patients' characteristics and laboratory parameters are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2
Correlation analyses of prolactin and monoPRL % with patient's demographics and laboratory parameters

TSH thyroid stimulating hormone, FT4 free tetraiodotronin, FT3 free triiodotronin, TPOAb thyroid peroxidase antibody, TGAb thyroglobulin antibody, PRL prolactin, monoPRL% percentage of monomeric prolactin recovery after PEG precipitation

There was a positive correlation (p < 0.001, r = 0.532) between PRL with gestational week and a negative correlation (p < 0.05, r = −0.296) with number of pregnancies. Serum prolactin levels were also found positively correlated with serum TSH (p = 0.014 and r = 0.219) and negatively correlated with FT4 (p = 0.011 and r = −0.227). Because of the insufficient number of macroprolactin positive patients, correlation analyses were done between the percentages of monoPRL recovery instead of macroprolactinemia. However, no statistically significant correlation was found between monoPRL % and thyroid hormone levels. Also, there was no correlation between the serum levels of thyroid antibodies with PRL and monoPRL % (p > 0.05). There was a slightly significant negative correlation between PRL and monoPRL % (p = 0.043 and r = −0.181).

Hyperprolactinemia — dopamine agonist withdrawal after long-term therapy: We suggest that with careful clinical and biochemical follow-up, therapy may be tapered and perhaps discontinued in patients who have been treated with dopamine agonists for at least 2 yr, who no longer have elevated serum prolactin, and who have no visible tumor remnant on MRI; evidence notes dopamine agonist withdrawal may be safely undertaken after 2 yr with recurrence risk ranging from 26 to 69%, recurrences most likely in the year after withdrawal with 18% per millimeter of tumor mass in one study, and up to 28% may develop hypogonadism, and recommended follow-up includes measurement of serum prolactin every 3 months for the first year and then annually thereafter, with MRI if prolactin increases above normal levels; in women with microprolactinomas, it may be possible to discontinue dopaminergic therapy when menopause occurs, and surveillance for increasing tumor size should continue periodically.
