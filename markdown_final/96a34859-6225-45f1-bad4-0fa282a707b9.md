## Question

Risk factors of Fournier gangrene

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risk factors for Fournier's gangrene, organized by strength of evidence and clinical relevance, with explicit reasoning steps and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease definition and pathophysiology to anchor which risk factors make mechanistic sense. Then, I should verify demographic and non-modifiable risk factors. Next, I will examine modifiable comorbidities and lifestyle factors, followed by iatrogenic and pharmacologic contributors. After that, I need to consider anatomical portals of entry and microbiologic risk, including MDROs. Finally, I will synthesize a hierarchy of risk and note prognostic modifiers, while double-checking areas of controversy such as SGLT2 inhibitors and the paradoxical association of diabetes with outcomes in some datasets.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and pathophysiology, because risk factors should align with impaired host defenses and polymicrobial synergistic infection along fascial planes. Fournier's gangrene is a necrotizing soft-tissue infection of the perineum, genitalia, and perianal region, typically polymicrobial with mixed aerobes and anaerobes, spreading along Colles and Scarpa fasciae, and facilitated by microvascular compromise and immunosuppression, which explains why diabetes, obesity, renal failure, and immunocompromised states recur as risks [^111qzsFy] [^11319Rr9].

> I need to check demographic and non-modifiable risk factors next. Male sex predominates with a roughly 10:1 male-to-female ratio in many series, and the peak incidence occurs in middle-aged to older adults, with increasing age independently associated with higher mortality. Female patients may have slightly worse outcomes in some contemporary national datasets, though this is not universal across studies, so I should be cautious not to overstate this point [^117YXJ4f] [^115iWSsS] [^111k6Wq4].

> Hold on, let me verify the strength of evidence for diabetes mellitus as the leading modifiable risk factor. Multiple series consistently identify diabetes in roughly one-third to two-thirds of cases, and mechanistically it impairs neutrophil function and microcirculation. However, I should double-check the paradox that some large datasets show diabetes lowering mortality odds, likely reflecting detection and care-seeking behavior rather than true protective biology, so I will keep diabetes firmly in the risk column while acknowledging this counterintuitive finding [^116FksBs] [^114b4oEW] [^111k6Wq4].

> Next, I should review other systemic comorbidities that impair host defenses or perfusion. Obesity is frequently cited and plausibly contributes via poor perfusion and wound complications; chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease, liver cirrhosis, and alcohol use disorder all increase risk through immunosuppression and microvascular disease; malignancy and HIV similarly compromise immunity; cardiovascular disease and coagulopathy further worsen outcomes, reinforcing the link between systemic vulnerability and disease severity [^11319Rr9] [^116x5QRj] [^115iWSsS].

> I will now examine lifestyle and behavioral contributors. Smoking and alcohol use disorder repeatedly appear as risk factors, likely via impaired wound healing and immune function; poor hygiene and chronic moisture or skin maceration in the perineal area facilitate bacterial overgrowth and barrier breakdown, which can seed infection; importantly, diagnostic delay is a major, modifiable contributor to poor outcomes, with population data suggesting many patients have symptomatic visits in the weeks before diagnosis, underscoring the need for a low threshold to escalate evaluation when pain is disproportionate or crepitus is present [^11319Rr9] [^116TcfkX].

> But wait, what about iatrogenic and pharmacologic risks. I initially thought SGLT2 inhibitors clearly increase FG risk based on FDA warnings and case reports, but I should double-check the higher-quality evidence. Observational nested case-control studies and large cohorts have not shown a statistically significant increase versus active comparators, and DECLARE-TIMI 58 did not find an imbalance, so the signal remains uncertain and likely confounded by diabetes itself; nonetheless, regulators advise counseling and prompt cessation if symptoms suggest FG, so I will frame SGLT2 inhibitors as a potential, rare risk with a precautionary approach rather than a proven causal factor [^116x5QRj] [^111Reonc] [^114ksRyw] [^111DG432] [^1152wqAN].

> Next, I should review anatomical portals of entry and local factors that breach mucosa or skin. Anorectal sources such as perianal abscess, fistula-in-ano, and undrained sepsis are well recognized. Urogenital sources include urethral stricture, instrumentation, and urinary tract infection. Cutaneous trauma, insect bites, or even shaving can inoculate bacteria. In spinal cord injury patients, pressure ulcers are a major source, and radiation-related colorectal–genitourinary fistulae can act as occult conduits for infection, so I need to ensure I actively search for these sources when evaluating suspected FG [^11319Rr9] [^1155mFf2] [^112Myc9p].

> I should confirm microbiologic risk factors, especially multidrug-resistant organisms. Contemporary series document MRSA and ESBL-producing gram-negative rods in a meaningful minority, and guidelines suggest tailoring empiric therapy to local MDRO risk and considering cultures in high-risk hosts; CA-MRSA has been reported as a sole pathogen in FG, so I must not anchor on a polymicrobial model when clinical features suggest otherwise [^111NeYMq] [^113rNYof] [^1151VUrV].

> Let me synthesize a hierarchy of risk while acknowledging overlap. Tier 1 includes diabetes mellitus, advanced age, male sex, obesity, renal failure, liver cirrhosis, alcohol use disorder, immunosuppression including HIV, and diagnostic delay. Tier 2 includes smoking, malignancy, cardiovascular disease, malnutrition, and local portals such as anorectal sepsis, urethral stricture or instrumentation, and pressure ulcers. Tier 3 includes SGLT2 inhibitor exposure as a possible, rare risk requiring vigilance rather than avoidance in all patients, and extremes of age including neonates and infants where host factors differ and congenital anomalies or viral infections like varicella may be relevant [^11319Rr9] [^115iWSsS] [^116TcfkX] [^111MaKJC].

> Hold on, I should verify prognostic modifiers that are not strictly risk factors for acquisition but drive outcomes once FG develops. Extent of disease to the abdominal wall or lower extremities, septic shock, need for mechanical ventilation, high FGSI, and delays to surgical debridement consistently associate with higher mortality; interestingly, some series show that diabetes itself does not independently predict mortality, again likely reflecting case mix and care pathways rather than true absence of effect, so I will keep these prognostic markers distinct from predisposing risks while using them to triage urgency and level of care [^112fzCiP] [^117CYrTm] [^114b4oEW] [^111k6Wq4].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical implications are explicit. Because risk is multifactorial and often cumulative, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in older men with diabetes, obesity, renal or hepatic disease, or alcohol use who present with perineal pain, swelling, or disproportionate tenderness, and they should escalate rapidly to surgical consultation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and resuscitation when FG is suspected. I should double-check that guidelines align with this approach, and indeed IDSA, WSES, and EAU all emphasize early surgical source control, hemodynamic support, and appropriate empiric antimicrobial coverage pending cultures, with imaging reserved for stable patients to define extent rather than to exclude the diagnosis [^116bFZng] [^117JvKiS] [^115eAf3b] [^117KcWtE].

Fournier's gangrene is strongly associated with **diabetes mellitus** [^114j2S3K], **immunosuppression** (including HIV, malignancy, and immunosuppressive therapy) [^111qzsFy], and **chronic alcohol use** [^11319Rr9]. Other major risk factors include **obesity** [^11319Rr9], **malnutrition**, **renal failure** [^115iWSsS], and **liver cirrhosis** [^116x5QRj]. Male sex and older age increase risk [^116x5QRj], and recent surgery or trauma to the perineal or genital area can precipitate infection [^116x5QRj]. SGLT2 inhibitors [^111DG432] have been linked to rare cases, and poor hygiene or chronic skin conditions further elevate risk [^115n1gsX]. Early recognition and management are critical given the high mortality [^117JvKiS].

---

## Demographic risk factors

- **Age**: Older adults are at higher risk, with most cases occurring after age 50 [^11319Rr9] [^114j2S3K].
- **Sex**: Male predominance is reported, with a male-to-female ratio of approximately 10:1 [^117YXJ4f].
- **Race/ethnicity**: Non-White females have higher mortality odds than White females (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.07–2.07) [^111k6Wq4].

---

## Medical comorbidities

- **Diabetes mellitus**: The most common comorbidity, present in 32–66% of cases; uncontrolled diabetes increases risk and severity [^11319Rr9] [^115zB6zk].
- **Immunosuppression**: HIV/AIDS, malignancy, and immunosuppressive therapy significantly increase risk [^11319Rr9] [^116x5QRj].
- **Chronic alcohol use**: Strongly associated due to impaired immunity and liver disease [^11319Rr9] [^111qzsFy].
- **Obesity**: Increases risk through impaired circulation, poor wound healing, and infection susceptibility [^11319Rr9] [^116x5QRj].
- **Malnutrition**: Weakens host defenses and impairs tissue repair [^notfound].
- **Renal failure**: Associated with higher mortality and prolonged hospital stay [^115iWSsS].
- **Liver cirrhosis**: Impaired immunity and coagulation increase risk [^116x5QRj].

---

## Pharmacological risk factors

SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with rare but serious cases; the FDA has issued warnings, and patients should be counseled to seek urgent care for genital or perineal pain, erythema, or swelling [^111DG432] [^11716ihD].

---

## Anatomical and physiological risk factors

Recent surgery or trauma to the perineal or genital area — including urological, colorectal, or gynecological procedures — can precipitate infection [^11319Rr9] [^111qzsFy]. Chronic skin conditions such as **dermatitis, eczema, or psoriasis** disrupt barriers and increase susceptibility [^11319Rr9]. Poor hygiene, including inadequate perineal care, further elevates risk [^115n1gsX].

---

## Lifestyle and behavioral risk factors

Smoking impairs circulation and wound healing, increasing risk [^111gMuk8]. Intravenous drug use introduces pathogens and causes tissue damage, and **chronic alcohol consumption** impairs immunity and promotes liver disease [^11319Rr9] [^111qzsFy].

### Fournier gangrene: a review for emergency clinicians [^111qzsFy]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Fournier gangrene (FG) is a rare, life-threatening infection that can result in significant morbidity and mortality, with many patients requiring emergency department (ED) management for complications and stabilization.

Objective

This narrative review provides an evidence-based summary of the current data for the emergency medicine evaluation and management of FG.

Discussion

Although originally thought to be an idiopathic process, FG has been shown to have a strong association for male patients with advanced age and comorbidities affecting microvascular circulation and immune system function, most commonly those with diabetes or alcohol use disorder. However, it can also affect patients without risk factors. The initial infectious nidus is usually located in the genitourinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, or perineum. FG is a mixed infection of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora. The development and progression of gangrene is often fulminant and can rapidly cause multiple organ failure and death, although patients may present subacutely with findings similar to cellulitis. Laboratory studies, as well as imaging including point-of-care ultrasound, conventional radiography, and computed tomography are important diagnostic adjuncts, though negative results cannot exclude diagnosis. Treatment includes emergent surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasoactive medications.

Conclusions

FG requires a high clinical level of suspicion, combined with knowledge of anatomy, risk factors, and etiology for an accurate diagnosis. Although FG remains a clinical diagnosis, relevant laboratory and radiography investigations can serve as useful adjuncts to expedite surgical management, hemodynamic resuscitation, and antibiotic administration.

### Optimising the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors for type 1 diabetes [^115izZWF]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with an increased risk for Fournier's gangrene, an extremely rare but serious and potentially life-threatening bacterial infection of the external genitalia, perineum and perianal region. Between March 2013 and January 2019, 55 cases of Fournier's gangrene have been reported in people receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (16 of which were on dapagliflozin) compared with 19 cases reported over 35 years in people taking other diabetes drugs.

Another serious complication associated with SGLT2 inhibitors is DKA — a medical emergency that occurs when a severe lack of insulin leads to the use of alternative energy sources such as fat, resulting in the production of acidic ketone bodies. Despite DKA risk mitigation strategies in DEPICT, DKA rates in people receiving dapagliflozin were as high as 3–4% while rates in the placebo group were < 2%. The risk of DKA may be even higher in routine clinical settings where monitoring is likely to be less stringent than in clinical trials. It has been suggested that the increased risk of DKA is predominantly due to the failure of people receiving an SGLT2 inhibitor to promptly recognise early metabolic decompensation, which occurs at lower than usual glucose levels. Also, the reduction in insulin dose may trigger ketogenesis in some people. Important strategies in mitigating DKA risk with an SGLT2 inhibitor include appropriate education of both people with T1DM and healthcare professionals, concerning the risk of DKA and how to minimise this risk, and the selection of appropriate people for treatment.

Introduction

Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a rare, rapidly progressive, fulminant form of necrotizing fasciitis of the genital, perianal and perineal regions, which may extend up to the abdominal wall between the fascial planes. It is secondary to polymicrobial infection by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with a synergistic action. The cause of infection is identifiable in 95% of cases, mainly arising from anorectal, genito-urinary and cutaneous sources. Predisposing factors such as diabetes and Immunosuppression lead to vascular disease and suppressed immunity that increase susceptibility to polymicrobial Infection. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and physical examination. Radiological methods may help to delineate the extent of the disease but false negatives may happen. Dissemination of the disease was found to be a major determinant of patients' outcomes in previous reports. It may reflect the aggressiveness of the involved infectious agents or reflects the degree of patients' immunosuppression. Several reports tried to evaluate the usefulness of diverse scoring systems. Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI) has become a standard for researchers, being routinely published in FG literature and is considered as a good predicting tool. The mortality rate for FG is still high, at 20–50% in most contemporary series. Fortunately, it is a rare condition, with a reported incidence of 1.6/100,000 males with peak incidence in the 5th and 6th decades. However, the incidence is rising, most likely due to an increase in the mean age of the population, as well as increased numbers of patients on immunosuppressive therapy or suffering from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, especially in Africa. Early diagnosis, aggressive resuscitation of the patient, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive radical surgical debridement(s), are the key of successful treatment. In this study, we aimed to investigate patients with FG and to identify risk factors that affect mortality.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and the risk of hospitalization for Fournier's gangrene: a nested case-control study [^116nF5n1]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This observational study examined the effect of SGLT2i on the risk of hospitalization for FG among patients with T2D seen in routine clinical practice. The study did not find that treatment with SGLT2i, as compared with treatment with two or more non-SGLT2i AHAs or insulin alone, was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for FG (adjusted OR = 0.55; 95% CI 0.25–1.18). Similar results were obtained when male and female patients were analyzed separately, and the results were supported by all sensitivity analyses.

The findings of this study are consistent with the evidence from the prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, which found no association between dapagliflozin and the risk of hospitalization for FG. The findings are also consistent with the evidence from the observational study conducted by Petruski-Ivleva et al. which found no increased risk of FG among SGLT2i users compared to similar patients treated with other second-line AHAs, although the small number of events yielded wide confidence intervals in this observational investigation.

### Fournier's gangrene: our experience with 50 patients and analysis of factors affecting mortality [^114LD6UE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

The medical records of 50 consecutive patients admitted to the University Hospital Hassan II of Fez, Morocco, General Surgery Department, with a diagnosis of Fournier's gangrene during the 7-year period between January 2003 and December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. The inclusion criteria included patients undergoing wide surgical excision of scrotal and/or perineal necrosis along with other involved areas with a postoperative diagnosis of Fournier's gangrene. Excluded were patients who had a local superficial inflammation of the perianal or urogenital regions as they were treated in Urology Department. Mortality was defined as disease-related death during the hospital stay and survival was measured in days. The prognostic variables used in the outcome analysis were the patient's age, female gender, history of diabetes, the interval between the onset of symptoms and the initial debridement, renal failure, need for postoperative mechanical ventilation and occurrence of septic shock. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS® 10.0 for Windows®. Mortality was accepted as disease-related death during the hospitalization period. The correlation of prognostic variables and mortality were studied by univariate analysis using chi-squared test and Fisher's exact probability test. Statistically significant variables were entered into multivariate regression analysis using logistic regression. P values were reported as the result of two-tailed testing and P values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. The study was performed according to the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Local Ethical Committee.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Fournier's gangrene, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, AAST/WSES 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining the following laboratory tests to assess the status of patients with suspected Fournier's gangrene and signs of systemic infection or sepsis:

- CBC

- inflammatory markers (such as, CRP, procalcitonin)

- serum creatinine

- electrolytes

- blood gas analysis.

### Safety of ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: pooled analysis of seven phase 3 randomized controlled trials [^115iCbCg]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

An increased risk of GMI is established for the SGLT2 inhibitor class. In the current pooled analysis, ertugliflozin treatment was associated with an increased incidence of GMI AEs in both females and males, and few had complicated genital infections.

Recently, post-marketing cases of Fournier's gangrene have been reported in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. In earlier randomized clinical trials with SGLT2 inhibitors, including those with ertugliflozin, events of Fournier's gangrene were not pre-specified for identification. In the more recently completed DECLARE cardiovascular outcomes trial, there was no increase in reported cases of Fournier's gangrene with dapagliflozin, with five cases in placebo-treated patients and one in a dapagliflozin-treated patient. Recent observational studies have further brought the association into question. A retrospective cohort study examining the association of the risk of hospitalization for Fournier's gangrene with initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor compared with initiation of an incretin-based therapy found a non-statistically significant potential increase of approximately 1 case per 10,000 men treated. A nested case control study reported an odds ratio of 0.55 for Fournier's gangrene in patients receiving an SGLT2 inhibitor (generally considered second-/third-line therapy) compared with those receiving at least two antihyperglycemic agents or insulin alone. No cases of Fournier's gangrene were identified in ertugliflozin clinical trials.

### Fournier's gangrene with dapagliflozin in a rural hospital: a case report [^114LUuHv]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which are used for treatment of type 2 diabetes, are associated with risk of urogenital infections. FDA issued a black box warning about multiple case reports of Fournier's gangrene (FG) observed in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. FG is a type of necrotising fasciitis that occurs in the anogenital area. We report a case of a 71-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes on dapagliflozin, presenting with foul-smelling discharge and a large abscess in the perianal area. Her risk factors for FG included her advanced age, obesity, diabetes and trauma to the site. During her stay, dapagliflozin was discontinued and she received procedural debridement, wound care and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. Due to possible association between FG and SGLT2 inhibitors, patients presenting with signs and symptoms of FG who are taking SGLT2 inhibitors should be examined for infection in the urogenital area and treated promptly.

### Fournier's gangrene: a review and outcome comparison from 2009 to 2016 [^111zsD5E]. Advances in Wound Care (2017). Low credibility.

Objective: The outcome of Fournier's gangrene (FG) may be affected by comorbidities, demographics, and choice of treatment modality. We sought to evaluate our institution's management protocol of FG measured by mortality rate (MR) and length of hospital stay (LHS) in a retrospective cohort study. Approach: A database of 20 FG cases at our institution throughout the 2009–2016 study period was assembled by a retrospective review of medical records. A Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index Score (FGSIS) was calculated for each case. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using logistic regression. Results: The most common presentation of FG at our institution was a hyperglycemic diabetic male in his fifth decade of life with a second risk factor such as recent surgery or active malignancy. The average FGSIS was 9 overall and 14 for the mortalities. An increased FGSIS was predictive of having an increased MR or hospital stay above the median (> 25 days) (p = 0.0194). The average LHS was 32 days overall, 22 days for patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy and 40 days for patients treated with tangential hydrosurgery. Overall MR was 15%. Innovation: This is the second known study to characterize usage of tangential hydrosurgery in the management of FG. Conclusion: Treatment outcomes at our institution are comparable to those reported in recent literature, a significant decline from the historical MR of 50–60%.

### A contemporary case series of Fournier's gangrene at a Swiss tertiary care center-can scoring systems accurately predict mortality and morbidity? [^114i1Bcz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Mortality rate in our series was 15%. Two recent reviews reported mortality rates of 3–67%, with higher rates in underdeveloped countries. The high mortality rate that occurs despite major advances in healthcare in general and the implementation of the most modern treatment options and resources at a Swiss tertiary care center reflects the severity of the disease. Yet, with a median age of 66 years (range 46–73), our patients were rather old, as compared to a recent review that reported a median age of 51.8 years (range 47–63 years). In our series, we could only demonstrate a borderline significance for the correlation of age and mortality, even though it is well known that increasing patient age is a strong independent predictor of mortality. Interestingly, age is not part of the three scoring systems. As age as a variable is easy to assess, we would suggest to include age into scoring systems. Moreover, morbidity of FG is high. Multiple debridements resulted in significant tissue defects (Fig. 3). Therefore, VAC was required in 45% of patients and five patients eventually required reconstructive surgery. Generally, polymicrobial infections comprising a broad spectrum of aerobic and anaerobic pathogen are causative for FG, as it was the case in our series. Therefore, the combination of carbapenems and clindamycin is used as standard empiric antibiotic regimen at our institution, adapted from the guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), concerning skin and soft tissue infections.

The risk of fractures also appears to vary among the SGLT-2i class. Canagliflozin was associated with an increased risk of fractures compared with placebo in CANVAS (15.4 vs. 11.9 events per 1000 patient-years; HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.04–1.52]). However, in the CREDENCE trial, no increased risk of fracture was observed with canagliflozin versus placebo (11.8 vs. 12.1 events per 1000 patient-years; HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.70–1.37]). Empagliflozin and dapagliflozin showed no increase in the risk of fractures in EMPA-REG OUTCOME or DECLARE–TIMI 58, respectively. Furthermore, dapagliflozin demonstrated no increase in the risk of treatment-emergent fractures in a population-based cohort study. In a meta-analysis of the three CVOTs, significant heterogeneity (I² = 78.2%) was found for fractures, with an increased risk of fracture observed only in CANVAS.

Postmarketing reports of Fournier gangrene associated with SGLT-2i use led to the inclusion of a warning for Fournier gangrene in the US prescribing information for each SGLT-2i. Although cases of Fournier gangrene are rare, an analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System and published case studies reported 55 cases of Fournier gangrene among patients treated with SGLT-2is in the 6 years since their approval compared with 19 cases associated with other glucose-lowering therapies over 35 years. In DECLARE-TIMI 58, six cases of Fournier gangrene were reported, one with dapagliflozin treatment and five with placebo. EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS did not report any cases of Fournier gangrene. Due to the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with Fournier gangrene, clinicians should be alert to recognizing the early signs and symptoms, including systemic symptoms (fatigue, fever, and malaise), local symptoms (tenderness, erythema, and swelling), and pain that seems disproportionate to findings on physical examination.

As a result, evaluation of the outcome variables by univariate analysis demonstrated for statistically significant predictors of mortality, which were the advanced age, extension of the infection to the abdominal wall, renal failure and need of Mechanical ventilation (Table 3). However the presence of diabetes, female gender, interval between the symptoms and surgical intervention and repeated debridements did not appear as predictors of mortality. In the subsequent multivariate analysis, none of above studied variables was identified as independent predictors of mortality.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and the risk of hospitalization for Fournier's gangrene: a nested case-control study [^114riwCb]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

This study has several strengths. Having access to data from 1.9 million patients with T2D and 4.2 million person-years of observation, a large number of FG cases from two US claims databases were identified. The observed incidence rate of FG among male patients with T2D of 9.2 per 100,000 person-years is higher than the general population rate of 1.6 in 100,000 men per year, which is supportive of published literature indicating T2D as a risk factor for FG. Furthermore, the data are consistent with previously published literature with respect to the important known risk factors for FG, including obesity, diabetes severity, poor overall health, heart disease, and renal insufficiency.

Nesting the FG cases and controls within a cohort of T2D controlled the effect of T2D on the outcome. Although the study is observational in nature and thus susceptible to potential confounding, rigorous matching and statistical adjustment were used to minimize confounding. The choice of a primary reference group of patients receiving treatment with combinations of two or more non-SGLT2i AHAs or insulin alone provided a clinically relevant treatment comparison and helped reduce potential confounding by indication.

The study is observational in nature and thus susceptible to several limitations. The first relates to the validity of the diagnosis of FG. While there is a designated ICD-10-CM diagnosis code to help identify male FG cases, the ICD-10-CM code for female FG cases and ICD-9-CM code for both male and female FG cases are less specific. This may lead to misclassification of FG cases. However, to reduce bias due to misclassification in the absence of a designated diagnosis code, the search used for this analysis included terms for patients using both a diagnosis code and a genital or perineal debridement procedure code, as surgical management is the cornerstone of treatment for FG. A similar strategy was previously used to help identify FG cases in the US State Inpatient Databases. Further, a sensitivity analysis including only male FG cases identified after October 1, 2015, when ICD-10-CM codes were fully implemented and specifically captured a diagnosis of FG, produced results that were consistent with those of the primary analysis.

### Infection of genital area with SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetes… [^116amxKo]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Having diabetes is a risk factor for developing Fournier's gangrene; however, this condition is still rare among diabetic patients. Overall published literature about the occurrence of Fournier's gangrene for men and women is very limited. Publications report that Fournier's gangrene occurs in 1. 6 out of 100, 000 males annually in the U. S., and most frequently occurs in males 50–79 years. Data Summary Overall published literature about the incidence of Fournier's gangrene in men and women is very limited. Publications using the U. S. State Inpatient Database from 593 civilian hospitals of 13 states in 2001 and 21 states in 2004 reported that Fournier's gangrene occurs in 1. 6 out of 100, 000 males annually in the U. S., with the highest incidence occurring in males 50–79 years. 4–6 The patients ranged in age from 38–78 years. Seven cases were reported in men and five in women. The average time to onset was 9.

2 months. All drugs in the SGLT2 inhibitor class except ertugliflozin had associated Fournier's gangrene. Because diabetes is a known risk factor for Fournier's gangrene, we also searched FAERS for cases with several other classes of antidiabetic agents to help assess whether the cases of Fournier's gangrene with the SGLT2 inhibitors are more likely to be associated with the underlying condition of diabetes as opposed to the drug. In the 34 years between 1984 and 2018, we identified only six additional cases of Fournier's gangrene in FAERS). All six patients were males and their median age was 57 years. Five of these patients were hospitalized and one died. This contrasts with the findings for Fournier's gangrene with the SGLT2 inhibitors where more cases were reported over a shorter timeframe, and cases involved both males and females. FAERS data have limitations.

Many factors can influence whether or not an event will be reported.

### Fournier's gangrene: our experience with 50 patients and analysis of factors affecting mortality [^111sUXEB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Fournier's gangrene, caused by synergistic aerobic and anaerobic organisms, is a life-threatening disorder in which infection of the perineum and scrotum spreads along fascial planes, leading to soft-tissue necrosis. This infectious was initially described by Baurienne in 1764. Before in 1883 Jean Alfred Fournier, French dermatologist described a syndrome of unexplained sudden onset and rapidly progressing gangrene in the penis and scrotum of 5 young men with no other pathology basis of sudden onset and rapid progression. In its early reports Fournier's gangrene was described as an idiopathic entity, but in most cases a perianal infection, urinary tract and local trauma or skin condition at that level can be identified. The mortality rate for FG is still high, (20–50%) in most contemporary series, despite an increased knowledge of the etiology, diagnosis and treatment, and intensive-care techniques. The high mortality reflects both the aggressive nature of the infection and the destructive effects of accompanying predisposing factors. Several factors affecting the mortality were studied such as increasing age, primary anorectal infections, existence of diabetes, delay in treatment, evidence of systemic sepsis at presentation, extent and depth of involvement, a low haematocrit, a high leukocytosis and blood urea nitrogen, a high alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin, and many others. These and other studied variables that influence the outcome of patients with FG, in large part, remains controversial. In this purpose, the FGSI was developed to help clinicians predict the outcome of patients with FG and remains an objective and simple method to quantify the extent of metabolic aberration at presentation in patients with FG. It has been validated in several reported studies. The average age of the patients was 47.5 years, in most published series from 40.9 to 61.7 years. In a population based study of 1641 patients, Sorensen et al. found that an increasing patient age was the strongest independent predictor of mortality (aOR 4.0 to 15.0, p < 0.0001). Our results are in keeping with the study of Sorensen et al. as the survivors were significantly younger than the non-survivors in our series. With regard to gender, the male predominance is reported in 96%, so the female was present only in 4%. Czymek et al. compared mortality between male and female in a series of 38 patients (26 M vs 12 F). Authors found that mortality is significantly higher among female (50% F vs 7.7% M, p = 0.0011). We could not confirm this result, as female gender did not appear as predictor factor of mortality in our study (Table 4). Numerous factors have been implicated at the onset of FG, in particular, those involving the immune system. Diabetes mellitus was the most reported co-morbid disease associated with this pathology. Some authors estimate the prevalence of DM among FG patients between 50 and 70 percent. Despite of being a risk factor for FG and associated with a more progressive and fatal outcome (decreased phagocytic and intracellular bactericidal activity and neutrophil dysfunction), most reported studies along with our have failed to demonstrate the influence of DM on outcomes in FG. It is also suggested that renal failure on admission might be a noticeable factor for the prediction of the mortality rate. Among many laboratory parameters studied in FG, Clayton et al. reported that only a level of blood urea > 0.5 g/l on admission was statistically significant for mortality. In our study we also found that renal failure on admission is significantly higher in non survivors. Few articles have highlighted the poor prognosis of FG in patients with a delay between time of presentation and treatment. This factor has been reported in a study by Jeong et al. as a predictor of mortality. Along with other studies, we did not find delay this to be a major predictor of mortality. The extension of the disease and the mortality rate are controversial themes in the literature. Some studies have reported that the spread of the disease is related to a higher death rate, while other studies report that the extension of the gangrene does not relate to a poorer prognosis. In this field, extent to abdominal wall (Figure 1) has been reported to be directly related to mortality, which was confirmed in our series. Ultimately, occurrence of septic shock and need for postoperative mechanical ventilation, have been demonstrated as a powerful (even late) factors of mortality. Furthermore, Yanar et al. found that the presence of sepsis was as the only significant independent risk factor for mortality in FG. Our results join those reported in literature, although in multivariate analysis, these parameters have been not identified as independent predictors of mortality. Finally we acknowledge that our study has important limitations. Data collection was retrospective, the patient cohort is small, we focused on some variables but surely dismiss others not less important, we did not have access to important clinical and laboratory data so that we could not use and evaluate the performance of the Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index.

### A contemporary case series of Fournier's gangrene at a Swiss tertiary care center-can scoring systems accurately predict mortality and morbidity? [^1165o85o]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a life-threatening infection of the genital, perineal, and perianal regions with a morbidity range between 3 and 67%. Our aim is to report our experience in treatment of FG and to assess whether three different scoring systems can accurately predict mortality and morbidity in FG patients.

Methods

All patients that were treated for FG at the Department of Urology of the University Hospital Basel between June 2012 and March 2017 were included and assessed retrospectively by chart review. Furthermore, we calculated Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI), the Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC), and the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in every patient and assessed whether those scores correlate with the patients' morbidity and mortality.

Results

Twenty patients were included, with a median (IQR) age of 66 (46–73) years. Fifteen of twenty (75%) patients required treatment on an intensive care unit, and three died (mortality rate: 15%). The mean FGSI, LRINEC, and NLR scores were 13.0, 9.3, and 45.3 for non-survivors and 7.7, 6.5, and 26 for survivors, respectively. None of the risk scores correlated significantly with mortality; however, all three significantly correlated with infection- and surgically-induced morbidity.

Conclusions

In our series, Fournier's gangrene was associated with a mortality rate of 15% despite maximum multidisciplinary therapy at a specialized center. All risk scores were able to predict the morbidity of the disease in terms of local extent and the required surgical measures.

### Fournier's gangrene masking as perineal and scrotal cellulitis [^112eBQKA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a very serious and life threatening emergency. FG is a polymicrobial subset of necrotizing fasciitis affecting the genital region. Most cases have a perianal or colorectal focus; less often the gangrene originates from the urogenital tract or is preceded by trauma or a surgical procedure. FG is a surgical emergency that requires early intervention. Therefore, early recognition by emergency physicians is imperative. The diagnosis of FG during its early stages is often challenging and misdiagnosis is common. If FG is suspected, emergency department management should always include antimicrobial treatment with parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics, aggressive hemodynamic stabilization and surgical consultation. We report a case of FG in an elderly male with no major risk factors, who presented with right groin and perineal pain that was initially diagnosed as scrotal cellulitis. He was later diagnosed with FG and subsequently developed multi-organ failure, required multiple surgical debridements, and was later transferred to a long-term care facility with poor prognosis. This case is important because it calls attention to the challenges of diagnosing this potentially fatal disease. Emergency physicians must recognize the symptoms of FG because early diagnosis can improve outcomes.

Although routine cultures of drained pus are usually considered unnecessary, there are studies that highlight how the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in routine anorectal abscesses can be as high as 35%. For this reason, we suggest to consider sampling of drained pus in cases with risk factors for multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infection, in case of recurrent infections or non-healing wounds and in high-risk patients (e.g. HIV, immunocompromised patients, etc.).

We refer to the WSES guidelines for soft-tissue and intra-abdominal infections for a discussion of the appropriate antibiotics regimens.
2 Perineal necrotizing fasciitis (Fournier's gangrene) 2. A - in patients with suspected Fournier's gangrene, what is the role of clinical examination and biochemical investigations?

In patients with suspected Fournier's gangrene, we suggest to collect a focused medical history and a complete physical examination, including a digital rectal examination (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In patients with suspected Fournier's gangrene and signs of systemic infection or sepsis, we suggest to request complete blood count and the dosage of serum creatinine and electrolytes, inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein, procalcitonin) and blood gas analysis, to assess the status of the patient (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C). We also recommend to check serum glucose, hemoglobin a1c, and urine ketones to investigate an undetected diabetes mellitus (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C).

### Variables that predict hospital stay and the outcome of Fournier gangrene at king abdulaziz university hospital: a retrospective study [^115zB6zk]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

A multicenter study found that patients over 60 years of age were at risk for prolonged hospitalization, and the length of hospital stay was found to be proportional to an increase in the number of comorbidities. In a study of 80 patients, Eksi et al. discovered that age and gender had no effect on the length of hospital stay, which is consistent with the current findings.

The most common comorbidity among the patients studied was diabetes (88%), and the most common risk factor was uncontrolled diabetes (76%). Diabetes has been identified as a risk factor in 32–66% of FG cases but has been shown to have no effect on outcomes or mortality.

Diabetes mellitus was the most commonly reported comorbid disease associated with this pathology, consistent with other studies. Diabetes mellitus is estimated to affect 50 to 70% of Fournier's gangrene patients by some authors. Diabetes mellitus has been identified as a risk factor for Fournier's gangrene, with a more progressive and fatal outcome due to decreased phagocytic and intracellular bactericidal activity, as well as neutrophil dysfunction.

In the current study, a nonsignificant relationship was discovered between comorbidities as risk factors and LHS. A previous study found that the most common comorbidity in FG was diabetes, but no significant correlation could be found between diabetes and any other comorbidity and LHS. However, in a previous study. The presence of DM and HT, as well as the number of comorbidities, increased the length of hospital stay. In the Chalya et al. study, advanced age (> 60 years) and diabetes were associated with prolonged LHS.

Longer LHS (> 50 days) in the current study was significantly higher among patients who were alive. However, other studies found a significant difference between LOS and mortality rates.

This study found that the mean length of hospital stay (LHS) among studied patients was 54.56 ± 54.57 days. Shorter LHS was observed in previous studies. However, previous studies revealed that the reported length of hospital stay ranges from 2 to 276 days.

### Dangers of delayed diagnosis of perianal abscess and undrained perianal sepsis in Fournier's gangrene: a case series [^1132xnFG]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a rapidly progressing infective necrotising fasciitis of the perianal, perineal and genital region. It is characterised by its aggressive nature and high mortality rates of between 15% and 50%. While it has been commonly found to primarily develop from urological sources, there have been increasing reports of the role of colorectal sources as the underlying aetiology of FG. Presented is a case series of four FG presentations at a single institution during a 12-month period as a result of underlying untreated perianal disease highlighting its dangers in progressing to a deadly infection, advocating for early and aggressive surgical debridement, and the role of adjunct scoring systems, such as Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotising Fasciitis, in guiding clinical diagnosis.

Each patient with complex wounds usually manifests multiple risk factors for their development. This article focuses on complex wounds involved with traumatic and orthopedic blunt or penetrating injuries, particularly in the extremities, as well as massive soft tissue infections including necrotizing fasciitis, gas gangrene, and Fournier gangrene. The principles of management of complex wounds involve assessing the patient's clinical status and the wound itself, appropriate timing of intervention, providing antibiotic therapy when necessary, and planning and executing surgical therapy, including the establishment of a clean wound bed and closure/reconstructive strategies.

SGLT2i vs non-SGLT2i

We observed an increased risk of FG for SGLT2i initiators compared with initiators of non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemic medications when using FG diagnosis codes only, using all diagnostic settings (aHR 1.80; 95% CI 0.53 to 6.11) and inpatient diagnoses only (aHR 4.58; 95% CI 0.99 to 21.21) (figure 1). When requiring debridement, surgery, or antibiotics within 7 days of diagnosis, we observed zero FG events in the SGLT2i cohort arm. Expanded diagnosis definitions yielded aHR estimates closer to the null, ranging from 0.66 (95% CI 0.20 to 2.16) to 1.71 (95% CI 0.66 to 4.46).

### Less is more? Antibiotic duration and outcomes in Fournier's gangrene [^114X46GE]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic management of Fournier's gangrene (FG) is without evidence-based guidelines and is based on expert opinion. The effect of duration of antibiotic therapy on outcomes in FG is unknown.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of FG patients from 2012 to 2015 at a single institution. Patients were managed by our institutional practice of complete primary wound closure as possible, with antibiotic duration according to physician judgment. Patients were stratified into multiple durations of antibiotic administration.

Results

Overall, 168 patients with FG were included. When examining multiple stratifications of antibiotic therapy of 7 days or less, 8 days to 10 days, 11 days to 14 days, or 15 days or more of antibiotics, there was no significant difference in mortality (p = 0.11), primary closure (p = 0.75), surgical site infection (SSI) (p = 0.52), or Clostridium difficile infection (p = 0.63). There were no cases of recurrent FG in any antibiotic stratification. Mortality was not increased (p = 1.00) and ability to achieve primary closure was not decreased (p = 0.08) with initial antibiotic therapy exclusive of cultured organisms.

Conclusion

Shorter antibiotic courses for patients in whom source control is obtained and initial antibiotic selection exclusive of many resistant organisms were not associated with worse outcomes in FG.

### Fournier's gangrene: our experience with 50 patients and analysis of factors affecting mortality [^111uarSy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fournier's gangrene is a rare, rapidly progressive, necrotizing fasciitis of the external genitalia and perineum. Case series have shown a mortality rate of 20% to 40% with an incidence of as high as 88% in some reports. In this study we aimed to share our experience in the management of Fournier's gangrene and to identify risk factors that affect mortality.

Methods

The medical records of 50 patients with Fournier's gangrene who presented at the University Hospital Hassan II of Fez from January 2003 to December 2009 were reviewed retrospectively to analyze the outcome and identify the risk factors and prognostic indicators of mortality.

Results

Ten males and five females were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 54 years (range 23–81). The most common predisposing factor was diabetes mellitus (34%). E. coli was the most frequent bacterial organisms cultured. All patients were treated with a common approach of resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and wide surgical excision. The mortality rate was 24%. The advanced age, renal failure on admission, extension of infection to the abdominal wall, occurrence of septic shock and need for postoperative mechanical ventilation are the main prognostic factors of mortality. In multivariate analysis, none of these variables is an independent predictor of mortality.

Conclusions

Fournier's gangrene is still a very severe disease with high mortality rates. Early recognition of infection associated with invasive and aggressive treatment is essential for attempting to reduce these prognostic indices.

### Unusual cause of Fournier's gangrene: colorectal-genitourinary tract fistulae status post brachytherapy [^112Myc9p]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

There are few reports of radiation associated colorectal-genitourinary tract (CRGU) fistulae causing Fournier's gangrene (FG). We describe a case of FG in a patient with possibly two CRGU fistulae in the context of previous high-dose brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer. Unfortunately, CRGU fistulae are not well classified as significant risk factors for the development of FG. Our case demonstrates the rationale for maintaining a broad differential in patients presenting with recurrent urinary tract symptoms or necrotising soft tissue infections to include undiagnosed fistulae.

### A contemporary case series of Fournier's gangrene at a Swiss tertiary care center-can scoring systems accurately predict mortality and morbidity? [^112BD5nA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, our series is the first to report treatment outcomes of FG in Switzerland. Fournier's gangrene is a rare disease, which is displayed by our small sample size. In addition to the retrospective nature of the study, the small sample size represents the main limitation of this study. This might explain why we were not able to demonstrate the predictive ability of FGSI, LRINEC, and NLR for mortality. Nevertheless, our report is the first to demonstrate the predictive ability of the risk scores for the local extent of the disease and the required surgical methods in terms of orchiectomy and penectomy. Thus, the application of these risk scores can be a useful adjunct to clinical examination to aid diagnosis and can be helpful in predicting the course of disease. Furthermore, our results highlight that FG remains a potentially fatal disease despite most modern treatment at a Swiss tertiary care center.

### Fournier gangrene: a review of 41 patients and strategies for reconstruction [^111AyzoB]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Fournier gangrene is an acute and potentially fatal infection of the scrotum, perineum, and abdominal wall. It is characterized by necrotizing fasciitis with loss of subcutaneous tissue and skin. The aim of this study was to analyze the prognosis and treatment effectiveness of this fulminant infectious disease. Forty-one patients were admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of Fournier gangrene between January 1998 and December 2006. The patients' age, sex, predisposing factors, duration of symptoms and hospital stay, time to operation, size of the skin defect, bacteria isolated, treatment modalities, and outcomes were reviewed. The data were analyzed by χ² analysis and Student t test. A P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. The mean age of the patients was 57.2 years. The most common predisposing factor was diabetes mellitus in 21 patients (51.2%), followed by cirrhosis of the liver, uremia, alcoholism, and underlying malignancy. The most common symptoms were fever (87.8%) and pain or swelling over the genital region (85.4%). The initial treatment included extensive debridement and open drainage. Time to operation ranged from 1 to 10 days. Reconstructive surgery was performed for 22 patients. The mortality rate was 19.5%. Delayed debridement was a significant factor affecting the survival rate. Our study is a retrospective study of patients with Fournier gangrene undergoing debridement and reconstructive procedure. Because of the fulminant course of Fournier gangrene, it may be difficult to design a prospective study. Fournier gangrene is a severe infectious disease with a high mortality rate. Early and aggressive debridement is a significant prognostic factor in the management of Fournier gangrene. Several reconstructive modalities are useful to correct the tissue defect. Early debridement and reconstructive surgery for wound coverage improve the quality of life.

### Outcome analysis in patients with Fournier's gangrene: report of 45 cases [^114b4oEW]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2003). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite antibiotics and aggressive debridement, the mortality rate of Fournier's gangrene remains high. Attempts have been made to study factors that may affect prognosis; however, reliable criteria are still lacking.

Methods

The medical records of 45 patients with Fournier's gangrene who presented at the Ege University Medical Faculty Hospital from January 1990 to May 2001 were reviewed retrospectively to analyze the outcome and identify the risk factors and prognostic indicators of mortality. Univariate analysis was performed using the chi-squared test and Fisher's exact probability test, then multivariate analysis of statistically significant variables was performed using logistic regression.

Results

The most prominent associated disease was diabetes, affecting 55.6 percent of the patients. The overall mortality rate was 20 percent. However, the mortality rate among diabetics was 36 percent (P = 0.002). The other statistically significant predictors of outcome were the interval from the onset of symptoms to the initial surgical intervention (P = 0.001) and the need of fecal diversion (P = 0.009). Multivariate regression analysis disclosed that the interval from the onset of symptoms to the initial surgical intervention and diabetes were independent predictors of mortality (P = 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively).

Conclusion

The interval from the onset of clinical symptoms to the initial surgical intervention seems to be the most important prognostic factor with a significant impact on outcome. Given the significantly high mortality rate among diabetics, diabetes is also an independent prognostic factor. Despite the decreased number of idiopathic cases and extensive therapeutic efforts, Fournier's gangrene remains a surgical emergency, and early recognition with prompt radical debridement is the mainstays of management.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and the risk of hospitalization for Fournier's gangrene: a nested case-control study [^116x5QRj]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetes is the most common predisposing factor for FG; however, underlying disorders such as chronic alcoholism, renal failure, liver cirrhosis, and obesity have also been identified as risk factors. Possible etiologies include cutaneous, anorectal, urogenital, and retroperitoneal causes and iatrogenic or self-inflicted trauma, among others. Male sex, the extremes of age (very young and old), and immunocompromised individuals are at increased risk of FG compared with other populations. Reported mortality rates range from 3% to 45%, with factors such as underlying comorbidities, the source of infection, and the presence of severe illness or sepsis at the time of initial evaluation affecting this outcome.

Published literature describing the occurrence of FG in men and women is limited. It has been reported that FG occurs in 1.6 out of 100,000 men annually in the USA, and most frequently occurs in men aged 50–79 years (3.3 out of 100,000). The incidence of FG in women is extremely low, with 39 cases of FG identified from the 15.1 million women in the US State Inpatient Databases (SID, the largest US hospital care dataset). In the cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT) for the SGLT2i dapagliflozin (DECLARE-TIMI 58), which included 17,160 participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D), six cases of FG were reported, one in the dapagliflozin group and five in the placebo group. In the CVOTs for the SGLT2i empagliflozin (EMPA-REG) and canagliflozin (CANVAS program) and the canagliflozin renal outcome study (CREDENCE), which together included a total 21,563 participants, no cases of FG were reported. However, as a result of the low incidence of FG, data from these and other ongoing SGLT2i trials may be insufficient to robustly assess this issue because of the relatively limited numbers of participants.

### Understanding the prodromal period of necrotizing soft tissue infections of the genitalia (Fournier's gangrene) and the incidence, duration, and risk factors associated with potential missed opportunities for an earlier diagnosis: a population-based longitudinal study [^116TcfkX]. The Journal of Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this paper was to investigate patterns of health care utilization leading up to diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections of the genitalia and to identify risk factors associated with potential diagnostic delay.

Materials and Methods

IBM MarketScan Research Databases (2001–2020) were used to identify index cases of necrotizing soft tissue infections of the genitalia. We identified health care visits for symptomatically similar diagnoses (eg, penile swelling, cellulitis) that occurred prior to necrotizing soft tissue infections of the genitalia diagnosis. A change-point analysis identified the window before diagnosis where diagnostic opportunities first appeared. A simulation model estimated the likelihood symptomatically similar diagnosis visits represented a missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis. Patient and provider characteristics were evaluated for their associations with delay.

Results

We identified 8,098 patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections of the genitalia, in which 4,032 (50%) had a symptomatically similar diagnosis visit in the 21-day diagnostic window, most commonly for "non-infectious urologic abnormalities" (eg, genital swelling; 64%): 46% received antibiotics; 16% saw a urologist. Models estimated that 5,096 of the symptomatically similar diagnosis visits (63%) represented diagnostic delay (mean duration 6.2 days; mean missed opportunities 1.8). Risk factors for delay included urinary tract infection history (OR 2.1) and morbid obesity (OR 1.6). Visits to more than 1 health care provider/location in a 24-hour period significantly decreased delay risk.

Conclusions

Nearly 50% of insured patients who undergo debridement for, or die from, necrotizing soft tissue infections of the genitalia will present to a medical provider with a symptomatically similar diagnosis suggestive of early disease development. Many of these visits likely represent diagnostic delay. Efforts to minimize logistic and cognitive biases in this rare condition may lead to improved outcomes if they lead to earlier interventions.

Fournier's Gangrene

Fournier's gangrene (necrotising fasciitis of the perineum) is a rare adverse event. In 2019, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) estimated that experience with SGLT2i treatment in the UK had accumulated to reach 548,565 patient-years, with just six yellow card reports relating to Fournier's gangrene. Predisposing conditions for Fournier's gangrene include diabetes and associated comorbidities, such as obesity, CKD and congestive HF. Among the 17,160 people included in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, five incidents of Fournier's gangrene were reported in the placebo group and one in the dapagliflozin group. One case was reported in the empagliflozin arm of the EMPEROR-reduced study, which included 5988 participants. Patients treated with SGLT2is should be made aware of this very rare but serious infection and advised to seek urgent medical attention if they experience severe pain, tenderness, worsening redness or swelling in the genital or perineal area.

Foot Disease and Lower Limb Amputations

Among the numerous RCTs and real-world studies examining the efficacy and safety of SGLT2i therapies, excess amputations were reported in one randomised trial and low incidence has been shown across all published RCTs (0–2 additional events per 1000 person-years). Current ADA/EASD guidelines recommend that the relative risks should be discussed fully with people who have active foot disease or those at elevated risk for amputation, with the decision to prescribe an SGLT2i therapy being shared between the clinician and individual with T2DM. People with T2DM, including those treated with SGLT2is, must be educated regarding preventative foot care, and comprehensive checks should be conducted regularly. The individual must contact their HCP promptly in cases where wounds, discoloration or pain are identified and therapy ceased if significant problems occur (e.g. infection).

### Fournier's gangrene in childhood: a report of 3 infant patients [^111MaKJC]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Fournier's gangrene is uncommon in pediatric age group, and little is known about the disease in the newborn period and infancy. Three patients, aged 10 days, 14, and 17 months, with Fournier's gangrene, were treated in our hospital. The predisposing factors were prematurity, a diaper rash, and varicella infection, respectively. Especially, prematurity and diaper rash are rare predisposing factors in the pediatric population; therefore, high index of suspicion, prompt diagnosis, conservative surgery, and multidisciplinary approach are the mainstays of management in children with Fournier's gangrene.

### A contemporary update on Fournier's gangrene [^115W3xke]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2017). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in the evaluation, treatment, and pathophysiological understanding of necrotizing soft-tissue infections, Fournier's gangrene remains a life-threatening urological emergency. Although the condition can affect patients of any age and gender, it might be more prevalent in some high-risk groups with certain comorbidities. Several prognostic and diagnostic tools have been developed to assist with clinical decision-making once the diagnosis is made - primarily based on the physician's physical exam and potentially supported by laboratory and imaging findings. Expedited treatment with resuscitation, antibiotic administration, and rapid, wide surgical debridement are key elements of the initial management. These procedures must be followed by meticulous wound care and liberal use of planned subsequent surgical debridements. Once the patient has overcome the associated systemic illness, several reconstructive options for the genitalia and perineum can be considered to improve functionality and cosmesis.

### Fournier's gangrene with dapagliflozin in a rural hospital: a case report [^114W1ZNP]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which are used for treatment of type 2 diabetes, are associated with risk of urogenital infections. FDA issued a black box warning about multiple case reports of Fournier's gangrene (FG) observed in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. FG is a type of necrotising fasciitis that occurs in the anogenital area. We report a case of a 71-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes on dapagliflozin, presenting with foul-smelling discharge and a large abscess in the perianal area. Her risk factors for FG included her advanced age, obesity, diabetes and trauma to the site. During her stay, dapagliflozin was discontinued and she received procedural debridement, wound care and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. Due to possible association between FG and SGLT2 inhibitors, patients presenting with signs and symptoms of FG who are taking SGLT2 inhibitors should be examined for infection in the urogenital area and treated promptly.

### Fournier's gangrene: management and mortality predictors in a population based study [^115iWSsS]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

The Fournier's gangrene literature comes almost exclusively from tertiary referral centers. We used a population based database to evaluate variations in management and outcomes.

Materials and Methods

Inpatients with Fournier's gangrene who underwent surgical débridement or died were identified from select states in the State Inpatient Databases. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to evaluate patient and hospital related predictors of mortality.

Results

We identified 1,641 males with Fournier's gangrene treated at a total of 593 hospitals. At teaching hospitals more Fournier's gangrene cases were treated per year, and more surgical procedures, débridements and supportive care were reported. Patients treated at teaching hospitals had longer length of stay, greater hospital charges and a higher case fatality rate. Patient related predictors of mortality were increasing age (adjusted OR 4.0 to 15.0), Charlson comorbidity index (adjusted OR 1.20 per additional comorbidity), preexisting conditions, ie congestive heart failure (adjusted OR 2.1), renal failure (adjusted OR 3.2) and coagulopathy (adjusted OR 3.4), and hospital admission via transfer (adjusted OR 1.9), after adjusting for hospital factors and Fournier's gangrene experience. Teaching hospitals had higher mortality due primarily to more acutely ill patients (adjusted OR 1.9). Hospitals where more than 1 Fournier's gangrene case per year were treated had 42% to 84% lower mortality after adjusting for patient age, race, Charlson comorbidity index and admission via transfer (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Teaching and nonteaching hospitals differ substantially in the populations, case definitions, and severity and management of Fournier's gangrene. Hospitals where more patients with Fournier's gangrene were treated had lower mortality rates, supporting the rationale for regionalized care for this rare disease.

### Variables that predict hospital stay and the outcome of Fournier gangrene at king abdulaziz university hospital: a retrospective study [^1151i2tz]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fournier gangrene, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, is a rapidly progressing and aggressive form of necrotizing fasciitis that affects the genital, perineal, and perianal regions. Named after the French surgeon Jean-Alfred Fournier, who first described the condition in 1883.

Fournier gangrene is characterized by the destructive spread of infection through soft tissues, leading to severe tissue damage, necrosis, and potential systemic complications. While it predominantly affects adult males, it can also occur in females and children.

Rapid diagnosis, immediate medical intervention, and surgical debridement are crucial to prevent its progression and improve patient outcomes.

Over time, there has been an evident evolution in the clinical manifestation of Fournier gangrene. This progression has been marked by a rising incidence of occurrences among individuals presenting with underlying comorbidities.

These comorbidities, which may include chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, immunosuppression, and cardiovascular disorders, have emerged as significant contributing factors to the development and progression of Fournier gangrene.

The interaction between these underlying health issues and the aggressive infection characteristic of Fournier gangrene can lead to a more complex clinical course and potentially poorer outcomes.

Despite advancements in medical care and early intervention strategies, mortality rates in Fournier gangrene remain notable. Consequently, a scoring system has been formulated to assist in predicting patient prognosis. The Fournier Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI), created by Laor and colleagues, serves as a tool to evaluate the potential for mortality in individuals afflicted with Fournier gangrene.

This study aimed to assess factors that affect the length of hospital stay (LHS) and its relation to the outcome of Fournier gangrene patients.

In this article, the authors discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and mechanism of spread of necrotizing soft-tissue infections of the genitalia, including classification schemas. The authors then discuss the acute clinical management of the disease, including suggestions for ways to improve surgical debridements (such that eventual reconstructions are simpler), ways to predict disease severity using laboratory, vital sign, and physical examination findings, and suggestions for initial antimicrobial treatments. Finally, reconstructive techniques and algorithms to ensure that the reconstructive goals of coverage, function, and cosmesis are met, are discussed, including the management of postoperative complications.

### Pressure sores significantly increase the risk of developing a Fournier's gangrene in patients with spinal cord injury [^1155mFf2]. Spinal Cord (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review.

Objectives

The aim of our study was to evaluate the mortality rate and further specific risk factors for Fournier's gangrene in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).

Setting

Division of Spinal Cord Injury, BG-University Hospital Bergmannsheil Bochum, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany.

Methods

All patients with a SCI and a Fournier's gangrene treated in our hospital were enrolled in this study. Following parameters were taken form patients medical records: age, type of SCI, cause of Fournier's gangrene, number of surgical debridements, length of hospital and intensive care unit stay, co morbidity factors and mortality rate. In addition, laboratory parameter including the laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC) score and microbiological findings were analyzed. Clinical diagnosis was made via histological examination.

Results

A total of 16 male patients (15 paraplegic and one tetraplegic) were included in the study. In 81% of all cases, the origin of Fournier's gangrene was a pressure sore. The median LRINEC score on admission was 6.5. In the vast majority of cases, a polybacterial infection was found. No patient died during the hospital stay. The mean number of surgical debridements before soft tissue closure was 1.9 and after a mean time interval of 39.1 days wound closure was performed in all patients.

Conclusions

Pressure sores significantly increase the risk of developing Fournier's gangrene in patients with SCI. We reported the results of our patients to increase awareness among physicians and training staff working with patients with a SCI in order to expedite the diagnosis.

### Variables that predict hospital stay and the outcome of Fournier gangrene at king abdulaziz university hospital: a retrospective study [^113D5zV9]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Subjects and methods

This was a retrospective study performed at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Saudi Arabia, from May to August 2023. The inclusion criteria were patients diagnosed with Fournier gangrene between 2017 and 2023 in the study setting. The diagnosis and inclusion of the patient were based on the physical examination with the presence of erythema, subcutaneous crepitation, skin discolouration and necrosis.

A predesigned checklist was prepared to collect data about patients' LHS, age, BMI, symptom duration, presenting symptoms, comorbidity, risk factors, laboratory results, culture results, initial antibiotics and compatibility, inpatient surgical intervention, lesion location, site of skin debridement, inpatient complications, reconstruction and outcome.

The mean length of hospital stay (LHS) was 54.56 ± 54.57, thus the participants were divided into two categories (≤ 50 days and > 50 days) based on the mean LHS. The comparison between the two groups was performed according to patient' age, BMI, symptom duration, presenting symptoms, comorbidities, risk factors, culture results, initial antibiotics and their compatibility, inpatient surgical intervention, lesion location, site of skin debridement, inpatient complications, reconstruction, outcome and laboratory results.

The patients' condition information was taken from emergency department data based on the patient's history, clinical examination of the patients, and investigations. There is no specific hospital policy for this group of patients. The choice of empiric antibiotics was determined by the evaluation and recommendations of the infectious diseases team. Empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated for patients with septic shock while awaiting the results of sensitivity and specificity testing. Septic shock was diagnosed during this waiting period.

Data were statistically analysed using SPSS version 26. To investigate the association between the variables, the chi-squared test (χ²) was applied to qualitative data that were expressed as numbers and percentages. The association between the quantitative nonparametric variables that were expressed as the mean and standard deviation (mean ± SD) was examined using the Mann‒Whitney test. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated at a confidence interval (CI) of 95% to assess the risk factors (independent predictors) of prolonged LHS (> 50 days) among the studied patients in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. A p value of less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.

### Fournier's gangrene in a man on empagliflozin for treatment of type 2 diabetes [^111Luh4C]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SLGT2) inhibitors has been associated with an increased risk of genital infections secondary to increased glycosuria.

Case Report

We report a case of a 41-year-old man with type 2 diabetes treated with empagliflozin and metformin who presented with scrotal swelling. He described multiple preceding episodes of genital thrush for which he self-administered over-the-counter anti-fungal treatment. On examination, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Perineal examination revealed grossly swollen and indurated scrotum with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Investigations showed elevated inflammatory markers and HbA1c of 99 mmol/mol (11.2%). Computed tomography revealed features consistent with Fournier's gangrene. He underwent emergency exploration and debridement under anaesthetic with a later return to theatre for further exploration, washout and application of a vacuum dressing. He then received a split skin graft to his perineum. He required a 2-week course of intravenous antibiotics and was discharged home on oral antibiotics. Empagliflozin was ceased on admission and he was commenced on a basal bolus insulin regimen for glycaemic optimisation.

Conclusion

There is a wide clinical spectrum of genital infections associated with SGLT2 inhibitors with most being generally mild and easily treated. However, risk factors such as diabetes, obesity, immunosuppressed states, smoking, alcohol abuse and end-stage renal or liver failure may increase the risk of potentially more severe infections such as Fournier's gangrene. Timely cessation of SGLT2 inhibitors in individuals with multiple risk factors may help prevent progression to more severe genital infections.

### Community associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus causing Fournier's gangrene and genital infections [^1151VUrV]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

We identified an emerging infectious disease of the genitoperineum caused by community associated, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Materials and Methods

We report our experience with severe genital infections caused by community associated, methicillin resistant S. aureus occurring in 3 individuals who lacked any of the risk factors associated with traditional methicillin resistant S. aureus infection. Two cases were limited to scrotal abscesses that required only incision and drainage plus antimicrobial therapy. To our knowledge the third case represents the first and only reported case to date of Fournier's gangrene caused by community associated, methicillin resistant S. aureus.

Results

The prevalence of community associated, methicillin resistant S. aureus complicated skin and skin structure infections is increasing throughout the United States and other countries. Community associated, methicillin resistant S. aureus contains unique virulence factors but retains sensitivity to various nonbeta-lactam antibiotics. Historical risk factors associated with methicillin resistant S. aureus appear not to apply to infections associated with community associated, methicillin resistant S. aureus. Infections due to the latter cause have been identified in healthy individuals of all ages, races and ethnicities. Surgical and antimicrobial approaches to management are presented.

Conclusions

Community associated, methicillin resistant S. aureus infections of the genitoperineum are likely to increase in incidence, necessitating heightened awareness on the part of the urologist.

### Emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) causing Fournier's gangrene [^111NeYMq]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fournier's gangrene is an uncommon but often devastating infection. There are few contemporary data on the risk factors and evolving microbiologic trends including drug-resistant organisms implicated in these life-threatening infections.

Methods

A retrospective study of Fournier's gangrene from 2006 to 2015 at a large academic hospital was conducted. Cases were identified using ICD codes (ICD-9: 608.83, V13.89; ICD-10: N49.3, Z87.438), and a review of medical, radiographic, and pathology records was performed to confirm each case. Data collected included socio-demographics, medical conditions, bacterial pathogens and their resistance patterns, treatments, and outcome. Descriptive and univariate statistics were performed.

Results

A total of 59 cases were evaluated with an overall incidence of 31.8 cases per 100,000 admissions which remained stable over the study period. Mean age was 56 years (range 18–91), 71% were male, and 44% white. Risk factors included overweight/obesity (61%), diabetes (44%, with a mean A1c of 9.6%), immunocompromised state (34%), and illicit use (20%). A causative organism was identified in all except 2 cases; 12 patients (21%) had a multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) with MRSA being the most common pathogen (n = 8, 14% of all cases), followed by ESBL E. coli (n = 3) and MDRO Acinetobacter (n = 1). MRSA was the sole pathogen isolated in five (63%) of the eight cases involving this organism. Among those with an aerobic Gram-negative rod (GNR) isolated, 32% were fluoroquinolone-resistant. Overall, 30% of cases had a poor outcome (15% died and an additional 15% had loss of an organ/body part). Those with an MDRO were more likely to experience a poor outcome (42% vs. 28%), although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.48); of note, most (83%) MDRO cases were initially treated with an antibiotic that the organism was susceptible.

Conclusions

This report highlights the emergence of MDROs as an important cause of Fournier's gangrene including MRSA and drug-resistant GNRs. Antibiotics should be chosen with broad-spectrum, anti-MDRO activity given the high morbidity and mortality associated with these infections.

### Can the SIARI score be used at initial admission to predict testes involvement in patients with Fournier's gangrene; a single-centre, retrospective study [^112yj8rr]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fournier's gangrene (FG) is characterized by progressive necrotizing fasciitis (NF) involving the perineal, perianal and genital regions, the anterior abdominal wall muscles or medial compartment thigh muscles, and the subcutaneous and deep fascia. FG requires urgent intervention and can be fatal. It is a polymicrobial condition usually caused by aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, with multidisciplinary care required after emergency surgical debridement. FG is more common in men and in the elderly. Predisposing factors include age, diabetes, and conditions that lead to immunosuppression. Treatment consists of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, maintenance of serum electrolyte balance, and surgical debridement. Repeated surgical interventions are sometimes required. Effective dressing is also important for wound healing in FG. In addition to antibiotic therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) and vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) are also used in the care of wounds from FG. In a recent article, Wong et al. reported that the laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC) score was a valuable tool for distinguishing FG from other tissue infections. The LRINEC score is obtained by evaluating haemoglobin, white blood cell (WBC) count, and the levels of serum glucose, creatinine, sodium and C-reactive protein (CRP). In addition, the SIARI (Site other than the lower limb, Immunosuppression, Age ≤ 60 years, Renal impairment, Inflammatory markers) score can also be used to distinguish FG from other tissue infections.

Testicular involvement is sometimes observed in patients diagnosed with FG and aggressive debridement or orchiectomy is often performed in such patients. To date, testicular involvement in FG has not been formally investigated. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate whether the LRINEC and SIARI scores are predictive of testicular involvement in patients diagnosed with FG at initial admission.

### Variables that predict hospital stay and the outcome of Fournier gangrene at king abdulaziz university hospital: a retrospective study [^114szE8x]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The aggressive nature of Fournier gangrene and the associated health issues can result in a more complex clinical course and potentially a longer hospital stay. This study aimed to assess factors that affect the length of hospital stay (LHS) and its relation to the outcome of Fournier gangrene patients.

Methods

A retrospective study was performed at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Saudi Arabia, on patients diagnosed with Fournier gangrene between 2017 and 2023. Data about length of hospital stay (LHS), age, BMI, clinical and surgical data and outcome was obtained.

Results

The mean age of the studied patients was 59.23 ± 11.19 years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.69 ± 7.99 kg/m², and the mean duration of symptoms was 10.27 ± 9.16 days. The most common presenting symptoms were swelling or induration (64%), 88% had comorbidities with diabetes mellitus (DM) (84%), and 76% had uncontrolled DM. of patients, 24% had a poly-microbial infection, with E. coli being the most common (52%). The mean length of hospital stay (LHS) was 54.56 ± 54.57 days, and 24% of patients had an LHS of more than 50 days. Longer LHS (> 50 days) was associated with patients who did not receive a compatible initial antibiotic, whereas shorter LHS was associated with patients who received Impenem or a combination of vancomycin and meropenem as alternative antibiotics following incompatibility. Reconstruction patients had significantly longer LHS and a higher mean temperature. However, none of the studied variables were found to be predictors of long LHS in the multivariate regression analysis.

Conclusion

Knowledge of the values that predict LHS allows for patient-centered treatment and may be useful in predicting more radical treatments or the need for additional treatment in high-risk patients. Future multicenter prospective studies with larger sample sizes are needed to assess the needed variables and predictors of long LHS.

### Validation of the Fournier's gangrene severity index in a large contemporary series [^117CYrTm]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

In this study we identified prognostic factors for survival and validated the accuracy of the Fournier's gangrene severity index in patients with Fournier's gangrene.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients diagnosed with Fournier's gangrene between 1996 and 2006. Fournier's gangrene severity index scores were assessed using a receiver operating characteristic curve. Using an outcome variable of inpatient mortality, univariate analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney U, chi-square and Fisher exact tests.

Results

A total of 68 patients (79.4% male, mean age 55.8 ± 15.2 years) diagnosed with Fournier's gangrene met the criteria for review. The inpatient mortality rate was 10% (7 patients). The mean Fournier's gangrene severity index score for survivors was 5.4 ± 3.5 vs 10.9 ± 4.7 for nonsurvivors (p = 0.006). Isolated Fournier's gangrene severity index and individual laboratory parameters associated with mortality included heart rate (p = 0.05), respiratory rate (p = 0.02), serum creatinine (p = 0.03), serum bicarbonate (p = 0.001), serum lactate (p = 0.001) and serum calcium (p = 0.03). Although mean total body surface area was only suggestive of an association (p = 0.169), abdominal wall (p = 0.004) or lower extremity (p = 0.005) involvement was associated with increased mortality. Using a Fournier's gangrene severity index score threshold of 9 (sensitivity 71.4%, specificity 90%) there was a 96% survival rate in patients with a Fournier's gangrene severity index of less than 9 and a 46% mortality rate in those with a Fournier's gangrene severity index of 9 or greater (p = 0.001, OR 22, 95% CI 3.5–139.7).

Conclusions

The Fournier's gangrene severity index remains an objective and simple method to quantify the extent of metabolic aberration at presentation in patients with Fournier's gangrene. A Fournier's gangrene severity index threshold value of 9 is sensitive and specific for predicting mortality in this patient population.

### A contemporary case series of Fournier's gangrene at a Swiss tertiary care center-can scoring systems accurately predict mortality and morbidity? [^116vvNJN]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a life-threatening infection of the genital, perineal, and perianal regions with a morbidity range between 3 and 67%. Our aim is to report our experience in treatment of FG and to assess whether three different scoring systems can accurately predict mortality and morbidity in FG patients.

Methods

All patients that were treated for FG at the Department of Urology of the University Hospital Basel between June 2012 and March 2017 were included and assessed retrospectively by chart review. Furthermore, we calculated Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI), the Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC), and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in every patient and assessed whether those scores correlate with the patients' morbidity and mortality.

Results

Twenty patients were included, with a median (IQR) age of 66 (46–73) years. Fifteen of twenty (75%) patients required treatment on an intensive care unit, and three died (mortality rate: 15%). The mean FGSI, LRINEC, and NLR scores were 13.0, 9.3, and 45.3 for non-survivors and 7.7, 6.5, and 26 for survivors, respectively. None of the risk scores correlated significantly with mortality; however, all three significantly correlated with infection- and surgically-induced morbidity.

Conclusions

In our series, Fournier's gangrene was associated with a mortality rate of 15% despite maximum multidisciplinary therapy at a specialized center. All risk scores were able to predict the morbidity of the disease in terms of local extent and the required surgical measures.

Regarding medical management for Fournier's gangrene, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend to initiate broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic therapy (such as vancomycin or linezolid plus piperacillin/tazobactam or a carbapenem, or plus ceftriaxone and metronidazole) in patients with suspected or documented necrotizing fasciitis, including coverage for aerobes, anaerobes, group A streptococci, and MRSA.

Conclusions

No evidence of increased risk of FG associated with SGLT2i was observed in the most relevant comparison with the commonly used, branded second-line antihyperglycemic agent, DPP4i. However, uncertainty remains based on potentially higher risk in the broader comparison with all non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemic medications and the low absolute incidence of FG.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^11319Rr9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients with suspected Fournier's gangrene, we suggest to use Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotising Fasciitis (LRINEC) score for an early diagnosis and Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI) for prognosis and risk stratification (weak recommendation based on moderate quality evidence, 2B).

Perineal necrotizing fasciitis, also called Fournier's gangrene, is a rare and potentially life-threatening necrotizing infection involving the fascia and subcutaneous tissues of the external genitalia or perineum, with potential manifestations that may include septic shock and multiple organ failure. Debate on the precise definition of this condition is still ongoing, but the most commonly accepted was proposed by Smith et al. As "an infective necrotizing fasciitis of the perineal, genital, or perianal region". A large population-based epidemiological study from the USA found an overall incidence of 1.6 Fournier's gangrene cases per 100,000 males annually, accounting for less than 0.02% of all hospital admissions. Males are predominantly affected, with a male to female ratio of 42:1. The mean age of presentation is 51 years. Mortality rates reach 88% in some studies, but Sorensen and colleagues report a mortality rate of 7.5%. Patients affected tend to have comorbidities, with diabetes and obesity the most frequently associated pathologies, but all those conditions that result in an impaired host resistance from reduced cellular immunity (i.e. alcoholism, HIV, leukemia) are associated with increased risk of Fournier's gangrene. According to the original description, the etiology was idiopathic, but the increased knowledge of this disease has identified three possible sites of origin of the infection: the perineal skin (24% of the cases), the colorectal region (21%), and the genito-urinary tract (19%); an unknown origin still remains for the remaining 36% of the cases. The pathophysiology of the fasciitis starts with the presence of a localized infection that allows the entrance of normally commensal bacteria into the perineum (the infection is typically polymicrobial, with Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Escherichia coli commonly present); the subsequent inflammatory response results in an obliterative endarteritis, with thrombosis of the surrounding vessels and important reduction in blood flow to this region. The following tissue ischemia promotes further anerobic bacteria proliferation and fascial necrosis and digestion. Diagnosis is mainly clinical and a focused and detailed medical history as well as a complete physical examination including a careful inspection of the perineum is mandatory. The most common symptoms of Fournier's gangrene include perineal and/or scrotal pain, swelling, and erythema. Pain is usually intense even in the presence of scarce clinical findings at the perineal examination. Systemic features such as fever and tachycardia are often present. The examination may reveal purulent discharge, crepitus (subcutaneous emphysema), and patches of the necrotic tissue with surrounding edema. Cutaneous manifestations tend to appear later in the disease process as these patches progress to florid gangrene. The infection rapidly spreads cranially to the abdominal wall and caudally to the legs, following the course of the superficial perineal fascia that is in continuity with Colle's fascia and Scarpa's fascia. Interestingly, testicular involvement is rare and this has been attributed to their non-perineal blood supply.

### Fournier's gangrene: risk factors and strategies for management [^116FksBs]. World Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The prognosis of Fournier's gangrene (FG) depends on early diagnosis and management. In this study, our objective was to identify the distinct features of FG that may influence the clinical outcome.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed in patients with a diagnosis of FG between January 1999 and December 2003. Etiological and predisposing factors, causative microbiological organisms, and clinical outcome were investigated.

Results

Twenty-five men (71%) and 10 women (29%) were included in the study. Mean age was 59.7 ± 10.7 (range: 43–88) years. As a predisposing factor, diabetes mellitus (DM) was found to be in 46% of patients. All patients were treated by immediate debridement and wide-spectrum antibiotics. More than one bacterium was found in 75% of the patients' tissue cultures, and most frequently E. coli (43%) was identified. Although there were no etiological factors in 25 patients (71%), various etiological factors were found in 10 patients (29%). Multiple debridements were performed in the majority of the cases. The overall mortality rate was 40%. The mortality rates were found to be relatively higher in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM; 50%), with delayed admission to the hospital (45%), and in patients presenting with sepsis at the first admission to the hospital (78%) compared with others. In the logistic regression model, the presence of sepsis was as the only significant independent risk factor for mortality in FG.

Conclusions

Despite the use of contemporary effective antibiotic treatment, aggressive debridements, and state-of-the-art intensive care conditions, FG still has high mortality and morbidity rates. In our series mortality rates were found to be higher in patients with delayed admission to the hospital, those with DM, and those who initially presented with sepsis.

SGLT2i and Hospitalization for FG

Table 3 summarizes current exposure to AHAs (as defined in " Methods ") among 216 FG cases and 1296 matched controls in the three mutually exclusive categories of drug exposure. At the index date, 4.2% of FG cases used SGLT2i, 44.9% used two or more non-SGLT2i AHAs or insulin alone, and 50.9% used AHA monotherapy excluding insulin or were without current exposure; corresponding values for controls were 7.7%, 36.6%, and 55.7%, respectively. Approximately 93% of SGLT2i users were in combination with other AHAs or insulin (7/9 SGLT2i users among FG cases and 94/100 SGLT2i users among controls). The adjusted OR of FG in patients treated with SGLT2i compared to patients treated with two or more non-SGLT2i AHAs or insulin alone was 0.55 [95% CI 0.25–1.18], after adjusting for multiple confounding factors (Table 4).

Similar results were obtained when the study cohort was stratified by sex. Among the 201 male FG cases, 8 (4.0%) were current SGLT2i users, and among the 1206 matched controls, 85 (7.1%) were current SGLT2i users (Table 3). The adjusted OR of hospitalization for FG in current users of SGLT2i compared to users of two or more non-SGLT2i AHAs or insulin alone was 0.63 (95% CI 0.28–1.42) in male patients with T2D, after adjusting for multiple confounding factors (Table 4).

Approaches in Routine Clinical Practice

When using dapagliflozin in routine clinical practise there are a number of issues to consider to mitigate the risks associated with this treatment.

Education regarding the risks of minor adverse events such as mycotic genital infections and UTIs should be provided to people with T1DM when initiating dapagliflozin treatment. This may encourage people to self-monitor treatment efficacy and adverse effects and help them manage these infections. People should also be made aware of the risk of Fournier's gangrene, a rare but serious and potentially life-threatening infection, which has been associated with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, and they should be informed of additional risk factors that may increase their risk of this infection, including for example poor personal hygiene, alcohol abuse and obesity. People should be advised to seek urgent medical attention if they experience severe pain, tenderness, erythaema or swelling in the genital or perineal area, accompanied by fever or malaise. If Fournier's gangrene is suspected, clinicians are advised to stop dapagliflozin and urgently start appropriate treatment, including the administration of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and surgical removal of extensive areas of necrosis.

An increased risk of DKA has been associated with the use of dapagliflozin, with inadequate insulin dose being reported as the most common risk factor. Therefore, individuals who are relatively insulin deficient, have sudden reductions in insulin dose or have an increased requirement for insulin (due to illness, surgery or alcohol abuse) should be closely monitored. Education of both people with T1DM and healthcare professionals will play a crucial role in reducing the risk of DKA associated with dapagliflozin use. This should include the provision of relevant information in both oral and written forms. A person-centred information leaflet covering the key messages should be provided for the person to take away and refer to when needed. It is important for those with T1DM as well as healthcare professionals to be aware that DKA associated with the use of dapagliflozin may not present typically and that glucose levels may be relatively normal, a condition referred to as normoglycemic DKA or euglycemic DKA. Thus, we recommend testing for raised blood ketone levels when DKA symptoms are present, or during bouts of minor illness, even if blood glucose levels are within the normal range.

### Higher morbidity and mortality in females with Fournier gangrene compared with males: insights from national inpatient sample data [^111k6Wq4]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We compare Fournier gangrene in female and male patients and identify mortality-associated characteristics in both.

Materials and Methods

We used National Inpatient Sample data (2016–2020) to identify Fournier gangrene cases and extracted demographic, comorbidity, and procedural variables. Multivariable regression models were used to identify mortality risk factors for both cohorts.

Results

We identified 2875 female (31%) and 6451 male patients (69%) with Fournier gangrene corresponding to an estimated 14,375 (95% CI, 13,784–14,966) and 32,255 (95% CI, 31,390–33,120) cases, respectively. Female patients were more likely to die than male patients (7.1% vs 5.7%, P < .0001, respectively). The median incidence rates were 1.7 (interquartile range, 1.5–1.8) and 4 (interquartile range, 3.6–4.3) cases per 100,000 person-years for female and male patients, respectively. Female patients had higher median age, longer hospital stays, more charges, procedures, and fecal diversion rates, but lower routine discharges than male patients (P < .05). Non-White female patients had increased mortality odds compared with White female patients (odds ratio [OR], 1.49; 95% CI, 1.07–2.07; p = 0.019). Prolonged interval until initial perineal debridement correlated with higher mortality odds in both female and male patients (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1–1.04; p = 0.034 vs OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01–1.05; P < .0001). Diabetes lowered mortality odds in female and male patients (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47–0.99; p = 0.046 vs OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41–0.7; P < .0001).

Conclusions

In female patients, Fournier gangrene incidence surpasses previous reports, with slightly worse outcomes compared with male patients, emphasizing the need for precise clinical assessment and early intensive interventions.

### Impact of diabetes mellitus on the presentation and outcomes of Fournier's gangrene [^117SZgGg]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate, in a population of patients with very high risk of diabetes, the natural history of Fournier's gangrene (FG) and to characterize the differences in presentation and outcome.

Methods

Patients with FG were identified during a 6-year period at two tertiary care institutions in San Antonio, Texas. The impact of diabetes on presentation and outcome were evaluated and compared with previous series.

Results

We identified 26 patients with FG, of whom 20 (76.9%) had diabetes. Diabetes was the most common risk factor identified and was associated with a younger age. The average hospital stay was not affected by the diagnosis of diabetes. Of 26 patients treated for FG, 3 (11%) died, 1 of whom had diabetes. Although the extent of debridement required was greater among diabetics, the average number of debridements required was not increased (2.55 in diabetic and 2.4 in nondiabetic patients).

Conclusions

Although diabetes is a risk factor for FG, the outcome is not affected by this diagnosis.

Fournier's gangrene

Fournier's gangrene is a rapidly progressive, variant of necrotizing fasciitis involving the external genitalia and perineum. Due to the complexity of fascial planes, this infection may extend up to the abdominal wall, down into the thigh, into the perirectal and gluteal spaces, and occasionally, into the retroperitoneum.

It has a mortality rate that reaches the 20–50% in many contemporary series.

Fournier's gangrene is nearly universally poly-microbial in origin, and is often caused by aerobic and anaerobic gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The origin of the infection is identifiable in the majority of cases and is predominantly from anorectal, genito-urinary or local cutaneous sources.

Iatrogenic factors leading to Fournier's gangrene have been reported after injection sclerotherapy and banding of haemorrhoids, haemorrhoidectomy and stapled haemorrhoidopexy.

Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and physical examination. Imaging may be needed to confirm clinical suspicions and to help in identifying the extent of the soft tissue involvement, particularly in the peri-rectal and retroperitoneal planes.

Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI) is a standard score for predicting outcome in patients with Fournier gangrene and is obtained from a combination of physiological parameters at admission including temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, sodium, potassium, creatinine, leukocytes, haematocrit and bicarbonate. A FGSI score above 9 has been demonstrated to be sensitive and specific as a mortality predictor in patients with Fournier's gangrene.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^117JvKiS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients with Fournier's gangrene, we recommend surgical intervention as soon as possible (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C).

In patients with Fournier's gangrene, we suggest planning repeat surgical revisions (exploration and debridement) according to patient conditions (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In patients with Fournier's gangrene, we suggest seriated surgical revisions until the patient is free of necrotic tissue (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Fournier's gangrene is a rapidly spreading disease with a high mortality rate, especially in cases of delayed treatment. Cornerstones of treatment are represented by antibiotic therapy, appropriate hemodynamic resuscitation, and emergent surgical therapy, with drainage of fluid collection and complete debridement of necrotic tissue. It has been shown that early and aggressive surgical debridement improves survival and reduces the number of surgical revisions. Thus, surgical intervention should be performed as soon as possible in the presence of high suspicion for Fournier's gangrene and subsequent surgical revisions should be planned based on the patient conditions (ideally every 12–24 h). Surgical revisions should be continued until the patient is free of necrotic tissue.
2.D - in patients with Fournier's gangrene, what is the appropriate surgical approach?

In patients with Fournier's gangrene, we suggest to remove all the necrotic tissue (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In patients with Fournier's gangrene, we suggest a multidisciplinary and tailored approach based upon the extent of perineal involvement, the degree of fecal contamination, and the possible presence of sphincter or urethral damage (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In patients with Fournier's gangrene, we suggest to perform orchiectomy or other genital surgery only if strictly necessary and possibly based on a urologic consultation (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In patients with Fournier's gangrene, we suggest planning the surgical management of early and delayed surgical sequelae with a multidisciplinary and skilled team (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Recommendations for implementation: mycotic genital infections and fournier's gangrene

We recommend that all people are counselled on the risks of mycotic genital infections prior to initiation of SGLT-2 inhibitors (Grade 1D).
We recommend that all people are counselled on self-care to maintain good genital hygiene (Grade 1C).
We recommend that all people are counselled on the symptoms of mycotic genital infections and how to seek help including self-management (Grade 1D).
We suggest that for those individuals with a history of recurrent mycotic genital infections on SGLT-2 inhibition, consideration is given to offering prophylactic anti-fungal treatment, which should be reviewed after 6 months of therapy or earlier if clinically indicated (Grade 2D).
We suggest that SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy can be continued during the treatment of mycotic genital infections (Grade 2D).
We highlight the specific MHRA warning and suggest that all people are counselled on the symptoms of Fournier's gangrene and advised to stop SGLT-2 inhibitors and to seek urgent help if they develop such symptoms (Grade 2D).

Rationale

Mycotic genital infections are recognised to occur more frequently in people treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors (on average risk is about 3–4-fold higher) and particularly in those individuals with DM. These infections are usually mild and easily treated. Good clinical care should include ensuring that individuals prescribed SGLT-2 inhibitors are aware of this complication, how to reduce the risk of it occurring and appropriate actions should they develop symptoms consistent with mycotic genital infections.

In contrast to mycotic genital infections, Fournier's gangrene is a rare condition that results from bacterial infection and it requires prompt and intensive medical and surgical management. This disorder is identified in people with DM and whilst the evidence to suggest that it may be increased in people treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors is limited to post-marketing surveillance, all people starting SGLT-2 inhibitors should be advised on the symptoms of Fournier's gangrene and what to do if they develop such symptoms.

### What are the indications for a stoma in Fournier's gangrene? [^116ZrGvS]. Colorectal Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

This study examined the indications for a stoma in patients with Fournier's gangrene and its impact on outcome.

Method

Patients with Fournier's gangrene were retrospectively reviewed for indications for a stoma. Patients with and without a stoma were compared, based on demographics, disease severity, surgical therapy, length of hospital stay, clinical outcome and cost.

Results

Forty-four patients (median age 57 years, range 28–77 years) were evaluated. Eighteen had a temporary stoma and 26 did not. A stoma was 5 times more likely in males. Patients with Fournier's gangrene originating from an anorectal disorder received a stoma more often than patients with disease originating from an urogenital disorder. Clinical outcomes were similar for patients with or without a stoma. Stoma closure was associated with an extra cost of about $6650 per patient.

Conclusion

Stoma creation in the management of Fournier's gangrene was needed for selected patients. Having a stoma did not appear to affect outcomes and resulted in a significant increase in cost of care.

### A contemporary case series of Fournier's gangrene at a Swiss tertiary care center-can scoring systems accurately predict mortality and morbidity? [^111gMuk8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 20 male patients were evaluated. Seventeen patients survived and three patients succumbed to the disease (mortality rate 15%). Median (IQR) age of the patients was 66 (46–73) years. Median (IQR) age of survivors and of non survivors was 64 (43–72) and 84 (67–94) years, respectively. Median (IQR) BMI was 28 (24.8–33.8) kg/m². Predisposing factors like diabetes mellitus, smoking, and renal insufficiency were present in 6/20 (30%), 9/20 (45%), and 9/20 (45%) patients, respectively. Chest X-ray was performed in 8/20 (40%) patients; abdominal CT scan and thoraco-abdominal CT scan were performed in 6/20 (30%) and 3/20 (15%) patients, respectively. For 5/20 (25%) patients, no imaging was performed and diagnosis was based solely on clinical findings. Fifteen (75%) patients required treatment on an ICU with a median (IQR) duration of ICU stay of 3 (2–5) days. None of these parameters correlated significantly with mortality. Nine patients (45%) required mechanical ventilation, with a median (IQR) duration of 2 (1.5–3.5) days. Unilateral orchiectomy was performed in five (35.7%) patients, and one (5%) patient required bilateral orchiectomy. Penectomy was necessary in two (10%) patients due to complete necrosis (Fig. 2). Auxiliary procedures like cystostomy and colostomy were performed in three (15%) and five (25%) patients, respectively. The bacteria cultured from the wound mainly comprised a broad spectrum of aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen, identified in 10 (50%) patients. Polymicrobial infections were causative in 18 (90%) patients. Blood cultures were positive in two (12.5%) out of 16 patients with detection of Klebsiella species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. In 17 (85%) patients, the combination of carbapenem antibiotics and clindamycin was used as empiric antibiotic therapy and adjusted according to the cultured bacteria and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Median (IQR) duration of antibiotic treatment was 18 (15–23) days. Extensive and sequential debridements regularly resulted in significant tissue defects. Therefore, nine (45%) patients had to be treated with vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) and five (25%) patients eventually required reconstructive surgery with flaps or skin grafts. The median (IQR) number of required operations was 4 (2–6), and the median (IQR) time to restore the integrity of the body surface was 18 (14–39) days. The mean scores for FGSI, LRINEC, and NLR were 13.0, 9.3, and 45.3 for non-survivors and 7.7, 6.5, and 26.0 for survivors, respectively. Detailed results of the scoring systems are displayed in Table 1. None of the risk scores correlated significantly with mortality, the need of ICU treatment, mechanical ventilation, or the time to restore the integrity of the body surface (p > 0.05). However, FGSI (p = 0.01), LRINEC (p = 0.04), and NLR (p = 0.01) correlated significantly with the necessity to perform orchiectomy. We also found a significant correlation for LRINEC (p = 0.02) and a borderline significant correlation for NLR (p = 0.06) in terms of the need to perform cystostomy but no correlation with the need to perform colostomy. Furthermore, FGSI (p = 0.02), LRINEC (p = 0.04), and NLR (p = 0.03) significantly correlated with the necessity to perform penectomy.

### A contemporary case series of Fournier's gangrene at a Swiss tertiary care center-can scoring systems accurately predict mortality and morbidity? [^117YXJ4f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a life-threatening infection of the genital, perineal, and perianal regions first described by Fournier in 1883. The male to female ratio is reported as 10:1, with an incidence of 1:7500 to 1:750,000. Conditions leading to decreased host immunity and thus rapid spread of infection are considered predisposing factors. FG is a polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic infection caused by three or more pathogens and therefore classified as type 1 necrotizing tissue infection. Bacteroides fragilis is the most commonly isolated anaerobic bacterial pathogen, while Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis represent the most commonly isolated aerobic pathogens. In patients with diabetes mellitus, Streptococcus spp. Staphylococcus spp. and aerobic flora are regularly detected. The combination of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can lead to the production of several enzymes, such as collagenases and heparinases, which may result in tissue destruction and rapid progression of the infection. Thus, the combination of less pathogenic bacteria can develop high virulence in immunocompromised patients. The FG diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory findings. Patients usually present with classical signs of soft tissue infections of the scrotum, perineum, and/or perianal areas (Fig. 1). Additionally, gangrenous or necrotic tissue and skin areas may be visible. Leukocyte and C-reactive protein levels are usually elevated. Imaging can be helpful if the diagnosis is uncertain. Early diagnosis is essential for the outcome, yet diagnosis is often delayed in this relatively rare disease, which in turn results in a delayed treatment start. Optimal multimodal treatment consists of hemodynamic stabilization and supportive intensive care if necessary, broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, and extensive surgical debridement of the necrotic tissue. Modern reconstructive techniques, such as skin grafting and flaps, provide reliable coverage of significant tissue defects and acceptable cosmetic results. Despite the advancements in health care over the last decades, the mortality rates of FG still range between 3 and 67% even in developed countries. Several risk scores, like Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI), the Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC), and the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), have been developed to predict survival and prognosis in FG. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report our experiences in treatment of FG in a Swiss tertiary care center and to assess the capability of three different scoring systems (FGSI, LRINEC, and NLR) to predict not only mortality, but also morbidity.

### Fournier's gangrene with dapagliflozin in a rural hospital: a case report [^1149U5m9]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor used to lower blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes. In addition to their ability to lower blood glucose, SGLT2 inhibitors have beneficial effects on blood pressure and weight loss and have a low risk of hypoglycaemia. Emerging evidence has also demonstrated the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and heart failure (EMPA-REG (empagliflozin), CANVAS (canagliflozin) and DECLARE TIMI-58 (dapagliflozin), respectively). This class of antihyperglycaemic medications reduces blood glucose by increasing glucose excretion in the urine. Because of this glycosuric effect, bacterial growth resulting in genitourinary infections are commonly reported adverse effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. However, many prescribers continue to select dapagliflozin for its positive renal outcomes and cardiac benefits after carefully weighing it against the risk of urogenital infection and diabetic ketoacidosis.

Concerns that SGLT2 inhibitors may be associated with more serious infections emerged after the FDA issued a black box warning in 2018. This warning described twelve cases of Fournier's gangrene (FG) that occurred in patients taking the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin, canagliflozin and empagliflozin.FG, also known as necrotising fasciitis of the perineum, is a rare, rapidly progressing and potentially fatal urological emergency. Because FG is usually polymicrobial, treatment requires urgent surgical debridement and administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Prior to this, the FDA had issued a black box warning for canagliflozin regarding leg and foot amputation risk which was removed in 2020, but remained described in the "Warnings and Precautions" section of the prescribing information.

Risk factors for FG include diabetes, local trauma, male gender, obesity, older age, immunosuppression, HIV infection, end-stage renal or liver failure, smoking and alcohol abuse. The level of blood glucose control is important as uncontrolled diabetes has been linked to more severe infections requiring greater interventions and worse outcomes. Interestingly, although male gender is a risk factor for the development of FG, cases of FG occurring in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors have been observed in males and females at similar frequencies.

We present a case of FG that developed in a patient taking dapagliflozin. The patient was treated with multiple debridement procedures and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other case reports have described the development of FG associated with SGLT2 inhibitors. However, this is the first case report portraying a female patient who developed FG while taking dapagliflozin.
