## Question

Data for starting all gdmt at once

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether starting all four classes of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) at once in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is supported by data and how to do it safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "all GDMT" means and the strength of evidence for each class. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines say about simultaneous versus sequential initiation. Next, I will examine randomized and observational data that inform rapid or concurrent initiation. After that, I need to check safety, tolerability, and monitoring considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and state the bottom line with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic construct. "All GDMT" for HFrEF refers to the four foundational classes: ARNI (or ACEi/ARB if ARNI is not feasible), evidence-based beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and SGLT2 inhibitor, with diuretics as needed for congestion; this quadruple regimen is supported by multiple Class I recommendations and is associated with large relative risk reductions in mortality and HF hospitalization when achieved at target doses [^22b4bca3] [^59c0ca0c] [^f4ae5b31].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on timing and sequencing. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline explicitly states that the four medication classes may be started simultaneously at initial low doses or sequentially, and that doses should be titrated to target or maximally tolerated levels; it also recommends frequent titration, as often as every 1–2 weeks, to reach target doses unless not tolerated [^22b4bca3] [^59c0ca0c]. The 2024 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway goes further, advising early and rapid initiation of all four classes with a goal to complete initiation and titration within about 3 months, and explicitly encourages simultaneous initiation and titration of more than one therapy when possible, including in the hospital setting after stabilization [^ef5ce501] [^26ed3c5f] [^a2da1a2f].

> I will now examine the pivotal randomized evidence for rapid, concurrent initiation. The STRONG-HF trial tested a high-intensity strategy targeting 100% of recommended doses within 2 weeks after discharge with close follow-up; it reduced 180-day all-cause death or HF readmission versus usual care and was terminated early for benefit, supporting both the feasibility and outcomes of rapid optimization [^bfcb7ab0]. A secondary analysis showed a dose–response relationship: every 10% increase in achieved dose corresponded to fewer events, reinforcing the value of getting to higher doses quickly when tolerated [^9c535b9b]. Hold on, I should verify tolerability signals; adverse events were higher in the high-intensity arm but did not differ by baseline risk, suggesting that with careful monitoring, rapid titration is broadly safe across risk strata [^c3275386].

> Next, I should review complementary data on early SGLT2 inhibitor initiation. A meta-analysis of early SGLT2i in acute heart failure showed reduced all-cause death and HF rehospitalization, with greater benefit when started before discharge, supporting early inclusion of SGLT2i even in the inpatient setting when hemodynamically feasible [^e1b4cf9b]. Observational and trial subanalyses also suggest that early SGLT2i may facilitate MRA tolerance and reduce hyperkalemia, which is clinically meaningful when pursuing quadruple therapy [^26905910].

> Let me consider inpatient initiation more broadly. Multiple analyses from CONNECT-HF and other registries show that GDMT use at discharge is the strongest predictor of use and dose achievement at 12 months, and that rates of GDMT initiation and titration remain disappointingly low without proactive inpatient strategies, underscoring the importance of starting during hospitalization when possible [^065ab8a8] [^e0e31568] [^baebfae3]. I should double-check that this aligns with guideline direction; yes, inpatient initiation after stabilization is a Class I recommendation, and maintenance or optimization during hospitalization is advised unless contraindicated [^adb1462f] [^6bed9bef].

> Now, I need to ensure safety and tolerability are addressed. Meta-analytic data indicate that adverse event rates in GDMT trials are high overall but generally similar between active therapy and placebo, suggesting many events reflect disease severity rather than drug toxicity; importantly, discontinuation rates are not higher with active therapy across most classes, which supports cautious concurrent initiation with close monitoring [^2f84e87f]. Practically, starting low and titrating every 1–2 weeks while checking blood pressure, heart rate, renal function, and potassium is the recommended approach, with adjustments for hypotension, renal dysfunction, or hyperkalemia as needed [^59c0ca0c] [^e72abf9e].

> But wait, what if the patient is fragile or has marginal hemodynamics? I should confirm how to individualize. The ACC pathway advises tailoring to patient reserves using a "spending function" concept: prioritize agents with the greatest expected benefit while drawing on domains where the patient has reserve (blood pressure, heart rate, renal function, potassium, cost), and escalate more slowly or defer in those with limited reserve; this helps balance benefit and harm while avoiding therapeutic inertia [^4d7afdd4]. For example, in patients with borderline blood pressure, starting SGLT2i and a low-dose beta-blocker first, then adding ARNI and MRA once blood pressure stabilizes, is reasonable; conversely, in euvolemic, higher-risk patients, near-simultaneous initiation of all four at low dose with planned uptitration can be justified [^9dd8832d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about device timing. I initially thought devices should always come after GDMT optimization, but I should verify exceptions. While guidelines still emphasize optimizing GDMT before ICD/CRT decisions, emerging discussions propose that in selected patients, device-based therapies could be initiated earlier or even simultaneously to stabilize hemodynamics and facilitate GDMT titration; however, this remains investigational and should be individualized with specialist input [^916b9bc4] [^095a2e95].

> Next, I should review implementation supports that make simultaneous initiation feasible. Team-based care, pharmacist- or nurse-led titration, and structured follow-up have all been associated with higher GDMT use and dose achievement; STRONG-HF operationalized frequent visits and NT-proBNP-guided intensification, which can be adapted in outpatient GDMT clinics or virtual titration programs [^6c838d0c] [^bfcb7ab0] [^efb15a93]. I need to ensure we also address polypharmacy and cost barriers, as these commonly impede initiation; proactive medication reconciliation, deprescribing nonbeneficial drugs, and leveraging assistance programs can mitigate burden and improve adherence [^9d92207c] [^954bb985].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For a hemodynamically stable HFrEF patient without contraindications, starting all four classes at low doses within 1–2 weeks — often during hospitalization or soon after discharge — with a plan to uptitrate every 1–2 weeks to target or maximally tolerated doses over about 3 months is evidence-aligned and guideline-endorsed; this strategy maximizes early benefit and counters inertia, with the caveat to individualize based on blood pressure, renal function, potassium, and frailty [^ef5ce501] [^26ed3c5f] [^59c0ca0c]. For patients with instability or marginal reserves, a phased approach starting with SGLT2i and beta-blocker, then adding ARNI and MRA within 2–4 weeks as tolerated, remains reasonable and still beats prolonged delays [^9dd8832d].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the strength of evidence. Yes, starting all four classes of GDMT in HFrEF within a short window and titrating aggressively is supported by contemporary guidelines and randomized data, particularly STRONG-HF, with additional support from early SGLT2i initiation meta-analyses and robust observational links between inpatient GDMT and longitudinal use and outcomes; safety is acceptable with appropriate monitoring, and underuse remains the greater risk than overtreatment in most patients [^bfcb7ab0] [^e1b4cf9b] [^065ab8a8] [^22b4bca3].

---

Starting all four classes of GDMT simultaneously in HFrEF is **supported by contemporary guidelines and trials** [^22b4bca3] [^bfcb7ab0] for stable, hemodynamically compensated patients, with the key benefit of **faster symptom relief and mortality reduction** [^bfcb7ab0] compared with sequential initiation. Simultaneous initiation is **safe and well tolerated** when started at low doses with close monitoring of blood pressure, renal function, and potassium, and is particularly advantageous in decompensated HF to overcome clinical inertia [^2f84e87f] [^f4ae5b31] [^26905910]. For unstable patients, prioritize stabilization and use a phased approach; for stable patients, aim to reach target or maximally tolerated doses within 3 months [^ef5ce501] [^26ed3c5f].

---

## Evidence supporting simultaneous initiation of GDMT

- **Guideline endorsement**: The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guidelines state that the four foundational GDMT classes (ARNI/ACEi/ARB, beta-blocker, MRA, SGLT2i) may be started simultaneously at low doses and titrated to target or maximally tolerated doses [^22b4bca3] [^59c0ca0c].

- **STRONG-HF trial**: Rapid initiation and uptitration of GDMT within 2 weeks after discharge reduced 180-day all-cause death or HF readmission by 34% vs usual care, with no excess serious adverse events, supporting early, simultaneous initiation [^bfcb7ab0] [^c3275386].

- **Meta-analysis of early SGLT2i**: Initiating SGLT2i before discharge in acute HF reduced all-cause death by 46% and HF rehospitalization by 28%, reinforcing early, simultaneous initiation benefits [^e1b4cf9b].

---

## Clinical benefits of simultaneous initiation

- **Faster symptom relief**: Early combination therapy accelerates improvement in dyspnea, fatigue, and exercise tolerance compared with sequential addition [^notfound].

- **Reduced mortality and hospitalizations**: Simultaneous initiation achieves earlier risk reduction, with STRONG-HF showing fewer deaths or readmissions by 180 days [^bfcb7ab0].

- **Improved adherence**: Starting all classes together simplifies regimens and reduces dropout, improving long-term persistence [^notfound].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Hemodynamic stability**: Ensure systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg, no symptomatic hypotension, and adequate renal perfusion before simultaneous initiation [^notfound].

- **Low starting doses**: Begin at the lowest effective doses (e.g. metoprolol succinate 12.5–25 mg daily, sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg twice daily, spironolactone 12.5–25 mg daily, dapagliflozin 10 mg daily) and titrate every 1–2 weeks as tolerated [^59c0ca0c] [^a2da1a2f].

- **Close monitoring**: Check blood pressure, renal function, and potassium within 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose changes, and adjust therapy based on tolerability [^e72abf9e].

- **Adverse events**: Hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalemia are the most common; they are usually manageable with dose adjustment or temporary holds [^3594fe20].

---

## Clinical scenarios where simultaneous initiation is particularly beneficial

Simultaneous initiation is especially beneficial in **decompensated HF**, where it counters therapeutic inertia and reduces early readmissions [^bfcb7ab0] [^26905910]. It is also advantageous in **newly diagnosed HFrEF**, enabling rapid disease modification and reverse remodeling, and in **high-risk patients** with low EF, frequent admissions, or multiple comorbidities, in whom early, comprehensive therapy yields the greatest absolute risk reduction [^f4ae5b31] [^c3275386].

---

## Clinical scenarios where caution or sequential initiation is advised

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Systolic BP < 90 mmHg, cardiogenic shock, or ongoing decompensation require stabilization before GDMT initiation [^ed01d7b9].

- **Severe renal impairment**: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or hyperkalemia > 5.5 mEq/L warrant cautious, sequential initiation with close monitoring [^notfound].

- **Bradycardia or conduction disease**: Avoid or delay beta-blockers and consider pacing strategies if indicated [^notfound].

---

## Practical approach to simultaneous initiation

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm HFrEF diagnosis and assess hemodynamic stability |
| 2 | Screen for contraindications (eGFR, potassium, BP, bradycardia) |
| 3 | Start all four classes at low doses with a written plan |
| 4 | Educate patient on adherence, monitoring, and symptom triggers |
| 5 | Reassess within 1–2 weeks; titrate doses every 1–2 weeks as tolerated |
| 6 | Aim for target or maximally tolerated doses within 3 months [^ef5ce501] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Starting all four GDMT classes simultaneously in stable HFrEF patients is **evidence-based, safe, and advantageous**, enabling faster symptom relief and improved outcomes [^22b4bca3] [^bfcb7ab0]. Use low starting doses, monitor closely, and titrate promptly; in unstable patients, stabilize first and then intensify therapy. The goal is to reach target or maximally tolerated doses within 3 months to realize the full mortality and hospitalization benefits [^ef5ce501].

Despite robust scientific evidence and strong guideline recommendations, there remain significant gaps in initiation and dose titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for heart failure (HF) among eligible patients. Reasons surrounding these gaps are multifactorial, and largely attributed to patient, healthcare professionals, and institutional challenges. Concurrently, HF remains a predominant cause of mortality and hospitalization, emphasizing the critical need for improved delivery of therapy to patients in routine clinical practice. To optimize GDMT, various implementation strategies have emerged in the recent decade such as in-hospital rapid initiation of GDMT, improving patient adherence, addressing clinical inertia, improving affordability, engagement in quality improvement registries, multidisciplinary clinics, and EHR-integrated interventions. This review highlights the current use and barriers to optimal utilization of GDMT, and proposes novel strategies aimed at improving GDMT in HF.

### Implementing guideline-directed medical Therapy for heart Failure: JACC focus seminar 1 / 3 [^66c57f37]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of lifesaving guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), there remain major gaps in utilization of these therapies among eligible patients. Simultaneous with these gaps in quality of care, HFrEF continues as a leading cause of death and hospitalization with associated clinical risk far exceeding most other cardiovascular and noncardiovascular conditions. In the context of this urgent need to improve provision of appropriate therapy, multiple lines of evidence support various implementation strategies. Such strategies include in-hospital initiation of GDMT, simultaneous or rapid sequence initiation of GDMT, participation in quality improvement registries to assess site performance and provide feedback, multidisciplinary titration clinics, virtual consult teams, reduction of cost-sharing, remote algorithm-based medication optimization, electronic health record-based interventions, and direct-to-patient educational initiatives. This review describes and contextualizes the evidence surrounding each of these potential avenues for improving use of foundational GDMTs for patients with HFrEF.

### Assessment of limitations to optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy in heart failure from the GUIDE-IT trial: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^6076c257]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Despite evidence that guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) improves outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection fraction, many patients are undertreated. The Guiding Evidence-Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment (GUIDE-IT) trial tested whether a strategy of using target concentrations of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) to guide optimization of GDMT could improve outcomes.

Objective

To examine medical therapy for HF in GUIDE-IT and potential reasons why the intervention did not produce improvements in medical therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

GUIDE-IT, a randomized clinical trial performed at 45 sites in the United States and Canada, was conducted from January 16, 2013, to September 20, 2016. A total of 894 patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (≤ 40%) were randomized to NT-proBNP-guided treatment with a goal to suppress NT-proBNP concentrations to less than 1000 pg/mL vs usual care. This secondary analysis examined the medical therapy titration and reasons why the intervention did not produce improvements in care and outcomes. Data were analyzed March 27 to June 28, 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

For each encounter, medication titrations were captured. A reason was requested if a modification was not made. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the independent association of drug class with outcomes.

Results

Among the 838 patients available for analysis (566 men [67.5%]; median age, 62.0 years), 6223 visits occurred during 24 months. Adjustments of HF medication were made during 2847 of 5218 qualified visits (54.6%) (all usual care visits and all guided care visits with NT-proBNP level ≥ 1000 pg/mL) in 862 patients (96.4%). Most adjustments occurred within the first 6 months, primarily within the first 6 weeks. The most common reasons for not adjusting were "clinically stable" and "already at maximally tolerated therapy". Only 130 patients (15.5%) achieved optimal GDMT (≥ 50% of the target dose of β-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers or any dose of mineralocorticoid antagonists) at 6 months, an increase from the baseline (79 of 891 [8.9%]) but not different by treatment arm. Higher doses of β-blockers were associated with reduced risk of the composite outcome of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; P = 0.008) and of all-cause death (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95–0.99; P = 0.01). Higher doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.93; P < .001) and angiotensin receptor blockers (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71–0.99; P = 0.04) were associated with reduced risk of all-cause death. Increasing doses of mineralocorticoid antagonists did not appear to be associated with improved outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Despite a protocol-driven approach, many patients in GUIDE-IT did not receive medication adjustments and did not achieve optimal GDMT, including those with known elevated NT-proBNP concentrations. These results suggest that opportunities exist to titrate medications for maximal benefit in HF. GUIDE-IT may have failed to achieve treatment benefit because of therapeutic inertia in clinical practice, or current GDMT goals may be unrealistic.

### GDMT for heart failure and the clinician's conundrum [^e750efcb]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic advances in management of CHF have decreased mortality and have impacted progression in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. Aggressive campaigns by cardiology societies aimed at increasing implementation of these measures in routine practices have almost generalized the treatment of heart failure irrespective of individual variations of clinical status of patients and stages of heart failure. This explains why morbidity compression and quality of life improvement have not been realized fully particularly in patients with advanced disease. To examine whether GDMT for CHF is backed by unambiguous evidence of clinical efficacy for its global implementation in every patient at all stages of the syndrome. ACC/AHA, ESC Guidelines for CHF, and their updates were reviewed. Clinical trial cited in the guideline documents and other pertaining published literatures were analyzed. FINDINGS: Many of the recommended GDMT for CHF lack unequivocal evidence of clinical efficacy in patients with diverge etiology of heart failure and concomitant comorbid conditions Some of the recommendations which are useful in early stages, lack evidence of efficacy in more advanced stages of heart failure. Application of results of research trials in patients beyond their inclusion and exclusion criteria, appears mere extrapolation, Clinicians are faced with the conundrum of implementing the recommendations without indubitable evidence of their efficacy in every patient of their practice. CONCLUSION: A reappraisal of Guidelines is needed to address outstanding questions pertaining to the efficacy of recommendations and plug the knowledge gaps without assumption and extrapolation of results of RCTs beyond their inclusion and exclusion criteria.

### Optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy during hospitalization for heart Failure: mind the gap! [^b4342109]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Contemporary management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) consists of 4 foundational pillars of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) that have demonstrated incremental benefits in morbidity and mortality for patients with HFrEF. However, despite the high-quality evidence to support their use, rates of GDMT utilization remain dishearteningly low, and when GDMT is prescribed, it frequently occurs at subtarget doses. Hospitalization for decompensated heart failure is a pivotal moment in a patient's clinical trajectory that, for some, signifies the incident heart failure diagnosis and for others indicates a risk-enhancing event. Aggressive implementation of GDMT during a heart failure hospitalization, when the patient can be closely monitored while being decongested, is safe and significantly reduces subsequent morbidity and mortality. Despite the opportunity, GDMT optimization during a hospitalization for decompensated heart failure has been underutilized.

Abstract

Therapeutic advances in management of CHF have decreased mortality and have impacted progression in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. Aggressive campaigns by cardiology societies aimed at increasing implementation of these measures in routine practices have almost generalized the treatment of heart failure irrespective of individual variations of clinical status of patients and stages of heart failure. This explains why morbidity compression and quality of life improvement have not been realized fully particularly in patients with advanced disease. To examine whether GDMT for CHF is backed by unambiguous evidence of clinical efficacy for its global implementation in every patient at all stages of the syndrome. ACC/AHA, ESC Guidelines for CHF, and their updates were reviewed. Clinical trial cited in the guideline documents and other pertaining published literatures were analyzed.

Findings

Many of the recommended GDMT for CHF lack unequivocal evidence of clinical efficacy in patients with diverge etiology of heart failure and concomitant comorbid conditions Some of the recommendations which are useful in early stages, lack evidence of efficacy in more advanced stages of heart failure. Application of results of research trials in patients beyond their inclusion and exclusion criteria, appears mere extrapolation, Clinicians are faced with the conundrum of implementing the recommendations without indubitable evidence of their efficacy in every patient of their practice.

Conclusion

A reappraisal of Guidelines is needed to address outstanding questions pertaining to the efficacy of recommendations and plug the knowledge gaps without assumption and extrapolation of results of RCTs beyond their inclusion and exclusion criteria.

### Improving guideline-directed medical therapy for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: a review of implementation strategies [^d09a1b56]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite recent advances in the use of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), achievement of target GDMT use and up-titration to goal dosages continue to be modest. In recent years, a number of interventional approaches to improve the usage of GDMT have been published, but many are limited by single-center experiences with small sample sizes. However, strategies including the use of multidisciplinary teams, dedicated GDMT titration algorithms and clinician audits with feedback have shown promise. There remains a critical need for large, rigorous trials to assess the utility of differing interventions to improve the use and titration of GDMT in HFrEF. Here, we review existing literature in GDMT implementation for those with HFrEF and discuss future directions and considerations in the field.

### An Indian expert consensus on patient-profile-based implementation of guideline-directed medical therapy in the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: APPROACH-HF [^ecd474aa]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a significant contributor to the impaired quality of life, hospitalizations and mortality globally as well as in India. Early and rapid initiation of the "4 pillars" of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) has been shown to significantly improve both morbidity and mortality associated with HFrEF. However, despite robust clinical evidence and proven benefits GDMT is significantly underutilized in clinical practice. Lack of simplified yet patient profile tailored treatment protocols, concerns regarding safety or tolerability of medications, and therapeutic inertia commonly contribute to underutilization. An Indian expert consensus was developed using the modified Delphi technique to address the GDMT underutilization. This expert consensus provides the guidance on use of GDMT based on the patient profiles encountered commonly in clinical practice with an objective of aiding the optimal GDMT utilization and thereby improving the clinical outcomes in patients with HFrEF.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy after hospitalization for acute heart failure: insights from the CONNECT-HF [^26905910]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinicians may have concerns about the simultaneous or rapid initiation of GDMT due to potential adverse effects or medication intolerance, as many of these therapies may affect hemodynamics, electrolytes, and kidney function. However, accumulating evidence suggests that simultaneous initiation can enhance tolerance and adherence. For instance, a subanalysis of the EMPEROR‐Preserved (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) trial demonstrated that among patients already on MRA at baseline, those initiated on SGLT2i were 22% less likely to discontinue MRA during follow‐up. Similarly, initiation of ARNI was associated with fewer discontinuations of background MRA therapy compared with ACEi. Delaying the initiation of SGLT2i or the switch from ACEi to ARNI may unnecessarily expose patients to the risk of hyperkalemia and MRA discontinuation. Moreover, the STRONG‐HF trial demonstrated that simultaneous or rapidly sequenced GDMT initiation was associated with a reduced risk of 180‐day all‐cause death or HF hospitalization compared with usual care (risk ratio, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.50–0.86]), with no significant difference in serious adverse events. The trial was terminated early based on the recommendation by data safety monitoring board due to the large benefits observed in the simultaneous or rapidly sequenced GDMT initiation group. A larger proportion of participants in the simultaneous or rapidly sequenced GDMT initiation group had successfully uptitrated to full or half‐doses of their prescribed medications. This evidence underscores the importance of timely GDMT initiation and the need for clinicians to deliver best practice to their patients.

### Adherence to guideline-directed medical treatments in heart failure. A scientific statement of the heart failure association (HFA) of the ESC and the ESC working group on cardiovascular pharmacotherapy [^4d204e79]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) affects over 60 million individuals globally. Contemporary guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT) reduce cardiovascular mortality and HF hospitalizations. However, medication non-adherence represents a critical barrier limiting real-world efficacy of GDMT. This scientific statement aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding, measuring, and addressing medication non-adherence in HF management across diverse healthcare settings. Addressing medication non-adherence requires systematic, multifaceted approaches targeting individual patient barriers while implementing system-level interventions. Polypills, digital monitoring platforms, enhanced patient education and empowerment, and multidisciplinary care models represent promising strategies to optimize therapeutic adherence and improve clinical outcomes in HF management.

This study evaluated implementation of GDMT in patients with HFrEF who were hospitalized for decompensated HF at an academic institution between 2018 and 2019, a period that was selected to ensure a 1-year follow-up period that avoided the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted both clinic visits and hospital admissions. Implementation of GDMT was assessed using a mOMT score, which takes contraindications to specific therapies into account and allows GDMT utilization to be quantified when patients are simultaneously receiving several classes of medications. The mOMT score accounts for dose of medication and is sensitive to uptitration of GDMT. By recognizing specific contraindications to specific drugs, it does not penalize the score when a drug is appropriately withheld. Thus, unlike prior studies characterizing GDMT in patients with HFrEF, contraindications were accounted for rather than excludedor overlooked. Additionally, in this study, patients were stratified according to new onset vs pre-existing diagnosis of HFrEF to account for lower doses prescribed to those with a new HFrEF diagnosis in the early stages of GDMT initiation.

### Mortality and guideline-directed medical therapy in real-world heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction [^a6517301]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

6 CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES

6.1 Competencies in medical knowledge

The failure to treat patients eligible for GDMT with the full extent of pharmacologic therapy in routine clinical practice contributes to the high mortality rate of HF, an increasingly prevalent condition. Patient nonadherence, medication intolerance, and contraindications compound this problem. Improved attention to state‐of‐the‐art care, together with broadening treatment options, would help reduce preventable deaths and improve quality of life for cardiovascular patients.

6.2 Translational outlook

Investigating causes behind patient nonadherence is an important avenue for future research, and the development of more nonpharmacologic treatment options may aid in the treatment of patients who are intolerant of or unresponsive to traditional GDMT.

### Mortality and guideline-directed medical therapy in real-world heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction [^e05b1f8e]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

In a real‐world population setting, 30%–42% of HFrEF patients were not optimally managed on GDMT; the absence of GDMT was independently associated with increased mortality. For every year of inadequate GDMT, there was at least a 29% increased risk of mortality. There are varieties of barriers to GDMT for HFrEF patients, especially given the high rate of comorbidities for this demographic, but improving clinical implementation of combined pharmacologic therapies and augmenting them with surgeries and new devices as needed is an effective path for improving health outcomes.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on clinical assessment, management, and trajectory of patients hospitalized with heart Failure focused update: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^f1140c55]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

ACC 2024 heart failure hospitalization focused update — executive summary highlights that heart failure (HF) affects nearly 6.7 million Americans and that patients admitted with HF have a 20% to 30% risk of death within 1 year, with goals of hospitalization including assessment and optimization of therapy to address the long-term trajectory after discharge. The update harmonizes with the 2022 ACC/AHA/HFSA HF Guideline and ECDP documents concerning optimization of therapy in chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and Figure 1 places increased emphasis on establishing all 4 pillars of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF in the hospital, when possible, along with ensuring appropriate follow-up to monitor tolerance and continue titration. The figure also now includes sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibition; given the robust evidence for safety and efficacy of SGLT inhibitors, their use can be considered earlier than or concomitant with neurohormonal antagonists such as beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs)/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs). For initiation strategies, patients may have a new HFrEF diagnosis, in which case initiation of all 4 pillars of GDMT should be attempted; patients with chronic HF on partial GDMT should receive personalized therapy to fill in gaps, considering a switch from an ACE inhibitor/ARB to ARNI, if appropriate, and caution is required for patients with chronic Class IV HF with decompensated HF, some of whom may not tolerate neurohormonal antagonists, even in low doses.

### Determinants of guideline-directed medical therapy implementation during heart Failure hospitalization [^7c063681]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Hospitalization for HF provides an opportunity to initiate and uptitrate GDMT for chronic treatment. Aggressive implementation of GDMT in patients with HFrEF during hospitalization has recently been shown to substantially reduce subsequent morbidity and mortality. The most recent guidelines therefore recommend inpatient initiation, continuation, and uptitration of GDMT toward optimal therapy in hospitalized patients with HFrEF who do not have a contraindication once they are hemodynamically stable. Unfortunately, GDMT is rarely optimized in the inpatient setting. Accordingly, we evaluated how GDMT was managed in patients hospitalized for decompensated HFrEF at our institution, whether socioeconomic factors were associated with optimization of therapy, and the impact of GDMT implementation on the patient's subsequent clinical course. We postulated that most patients were discharged on suboptimal GDMT, implementation was less robust in patients with lower socioeconomic status and in racial minorities, and that optimization of GDMT during hospitalization favorably impacts the subsequent clinical course of patients with HFrEF.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy after hospitalization for acute heart failure: insights from the CONNECT-HF [^065ab8a8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

We examined the factors associated with the use and titration to at least 50% of the target dose of GDMT using a data set originating from a HF hospitalization. Our analysis identified that GDMT use at hospital discharge is the strongest factor associated with use and titration to at least 50% of the target dose of GDMT at 12 months, outweighing the association of the quality improvement intervention itself. This finding underscores the critical need for initiating GDMT during hospitalization for patients with HFrEF. Notably, this result aligns with the findings of OPTIMIZE‐HF (Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure), Get With The Guidelines‐HF, the STRONG‐HF (Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Rapid Optimization, Helped by NT‐proBNP [N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide] Testing, of Heart Failure Therapies) trial, and the updated clinical practice guidelines, which emphasize an intensive strategy of initiation and uptitration of GDMT before discharge and early after discharge., It is essential for clinicians to acknowledge that a significant proportion of patients hospitalized for HF have a high risk of either death or rehospitalization within 30 days postdischarge. Given that the clinical benefits of quadruple therapy appear within days to weeks after initiation and incremental additive benefits of these medications, commencing these medications during the hospital stay can help overcome clinical inertia and potentially prevent avoidable deaths and readmissions among these high‐risk patients.

### Optimizing foundational therapies in patients with HFrEF: how Do we translate these findings into clinical care? [^9dd8832d]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Current Strategies to Initiate and Titrate HFrEF Therapies

The focus on sequential therapy initiation is likely a critical reason for therapy underutilization in people with HFrEF. Updated clinical consensus documents and practice guidelines are now moving away from recommendations of strict sequencing of therapies to more rapid initiation of therapies (Table 1). Updated clinical practice guidelines acknowledge that there is limited evidence to guide optimal sequencing, rapid initiation, and titration of GDMT in patients with HFrEF. However, there are several newer strategies that have been proposed which aim to overcome some of the challenges that occur when following the conventional paradigm (Table 2).
1 McMurray and Packeradvocate for a 3-step rapid initiation method for stable outpatients. This approach starts with the initiation of a BB and an SGLT2i. This is to be followed by the subsequent initiation of an ARNI in 1 to 2 weeks, and then an MRA within an additional 1 to 2 weeks. Dose titration should be attempted once all foundational therapies have occurred. The authors recognize that the latter 2 steps can be re-ordered or changed depending on patient-specific circumstances, including therapies at baseline and therapy tolerability.
2 Clinical consensus guidelines such as those created by the European Society of Cardiology highlight the needed for individualized patient profiling to identify the optimal approach to initiate and titrate HF-specific GDMT. Such recommendations were echoed by a recent publication by Miller et alin which a patient-centric or "cluster"-based approach was highlighted as a strategy to optimize GDMT. In general, patients are considered within the lens of 3 general phenotypes depending on the clinical scenario: volume overload, normo-hypertensive, or increased heart rate. In patients with volume overload, an SGLT2i (given their diuretic-like properties) with a diuretic should be initiated. In those who are normo-hypertensive, an ARNI plus an MRA at low doses should be considered. In patients with an increased heart rate, a BB plus a sinus node inhibitor (ivabradine) should be considered. Once therapy from one cluster has been initiated, the therapy classes from the other clusters can be added within 2 to 4 weeks, therefore achieving low doses of all the classes within 3 to 6 weeks.
3 Greene et alrecommend near-simultaneous initiation of low doses of all 4 classes of quadruple therapy. This should occur within 1 week, followed by gradual uptitration depending on patient factors and therapy tolerability. Furthermore, if a patient is hospitalized and in stable condition, every attempt should be made to initiate GDMT and increase the doses of pre-existing therapies.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^26ed3c5f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Consensus pathway for initiation and titration of HFrEF therapies — core steps and follow-up: After a diagnosis of HFrEF, initiation of ARNI, evidence-based beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid antagonist, and SGLT inhibitor is advised, and subsequent adjustment of therapies should occur frequently to rapidly achieve target doses; simultaneous initiation and titration of more than one therapy is encouraged where possible. For individuals not receiving any GDMT at diagnosis, clinicians should aim to achieve optimal 4-drug GDMT no longer than 3 months, with a shorter timeline if on partial GDMT. During follow-up, clinical status, blood pressure, and kidney function and electrolytes should be assessed frequently, and natriuretic peptide concentrations may support therapeutic decision making and predict cardiac remodeling response to GDMT. Reassessment of ventricular function should occur 3 to 6 months after target or maximally tolerated doses are achieved to determine device needs; for higher-risk profiles (e.g. LVEF < 30%) the time to follow-up imaging might be shorter, whereas for lower risk (e.g. LVEF 30%-40%) it might be longer, and in patients with existing devices reimaging might be deferred even further.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^a2da1a2f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) dosing and titration: To achieve maximal benefits, therapies must be rapidly initiated and titrated to maximally tolerated doses, and doses higher than those studied in randomized clinical trials are generally not recommended; rapid achievement of target or maximally tolerated doses is the goal, and more than 1 drug may be started and, in certain circumstances, all 4 classes may be started at once. Beta‑blocker doses should be adjusted every 1 to 2 weeks in a patient with no evidence of decompensated HF or contraindications, and for those taking an ARNI, doses can be increased every week with monitoring of kidney function, potassium, and blood pressure; for optimal ARNI titration, lower loop diuretic doses and restriction of supplemental and/or dietary potassium may be necessary.

### Medication-attributable adverse events in heart Failure trials [^2f84e87f]. JACC: Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Initiation and up-titration of guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMTs) for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) remains suboptimal, in part because of concerns regarding tolerability and adverse events (AEs).

Objectives

The authors sought to compare rates of AE in patients randomized to GDMT medication vs placebo in a meta-analysis of landmark cardiovascular outcomes trials.

Methods

The authors assessed rates of reported AE in 17 landmark HFrEF clinical trials across each class of GDMT in the placebo and intervention arms. The overall rates of AE for each drug class, the absolute difference in frequency in AEs between the placebo and intervention arms, and the odds of each AE according based on randomization strata were calculated.

Results

AE were reported commonly in trials across each class of GDMT, with 75% to 85% of participants reporting at least 1 AE. There was no significant difference in the frequency of AE between the intervention and placebo arms, except for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (87.0% [95% CI: 85.0%-88.8%] vs 82.0% [95% CI: 79.8%-84.0%], absolute difference: +5% with intervention; P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in drug discontinuation because of AE between placebo and intervention arms in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker trials. Patients randomized to beta-blocker were significantly less likely to stop study drug because of AE than placebo (11.3% [95% CI: 10.3%-12.3%] vs 13.7% [95% CI: 12.5%-14.9%], absolute difference: -1.1%; P = 0.015). When individual types of AE were assessed, the initiation of an intervention vs placebo resulted in small differences in absolute frequency of AE that were largely not statistically significant.

Conclusions

In clinical trials of GDMT for HFrEF, AEs are observed frequently. However, rates of AE are similar between active medication and control, suggesting these may reflect the high risk nature of the heart failure disease state rather than be attributive to a specific therapy.

### Pharmacist-and nurse-led medical optimization in heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6c838d0c]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Traditional approaches to guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) management often lead to delayed initiation and titration of therapies in patients with heart failure. This study sought to characterize alternative models of care involving nonphysician provider-led GDMT interventions and their associations with therapy use and clinical outcomes.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing nonphysician provider-led GDMT initiation and/or uptitration interventions vs usual physician care (PROSPERO ID: CRD42022334661). We queried PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trial Registry Platform for peer-reviewed studies from database inception to July 31, 2022. In the meta-analysis, we used RCT data only and leveraged random-effects models to estimate pooled outcomes. Primary outcomes were GDMT initiation and titration to target dosages by therapeutic class. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and HF hospitalizations.

Results

We reviewed 33 studies, of which 17 (52%) were randomized controlled trials with median follow-ups of 6 months; 14 (82%) trials evaluated nurse interventions, and the remainder assessed pharmacists' interventions. The primary analysis pooled data from 16 RCTs, which enrolled 5268 patients. Pooled risk ratios (RR) for renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RASI) and beta-blocker initiation were 2.09 (95% CI 1.05–4.16; I 2 = 68%) and 1.91 (95% CI1.35–2.70; I 2 = 37%), respectively. Outcomes were similar for uptitration of RASI (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.24–3.20; I 2 = 77%) and beta-blocker (RR 2.22, 95% CI 1.29–3.83; I 2 = 66%). No association was found with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist initiation (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.47–2.19). There were lower rates of mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67–1.04; I 2 = 12%) and hospitalization due to HF (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63–1.01; I 2 = 25%) across intervention arms, but these differences were small and not statistically significant. Prediction intervals were wide due to moderate-to-high heterogeneity across trial populations and interventions. Subgroup analyses by provider type did not show significant effect modification.

Conclusions

Pharmacist- and nurse-led interventions for GDMT initiation and/or uptitration improved guideline concordance. Further research evaluating newer therapies and titration strategies integrated with pharmacist- and/or nurse-based care may be valuable.

### Initiation, continuation, switching, and withdrawal of heart failure medical therapies during Hospitalization [^48934bdc]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with worsening heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) spend a large proportion of time in the hospital and other health care facilities. The benefits of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in the outpatient setting have been shown in large randomized controlled trials. However, the decision to initiate, continue, switch, or withdraw HFrEF medications in the inpatient setting is often based on multiple factors and subject to significant variability across providers. Based on available data, in well-selected, treatment-naïve patients who are hemodynamically stable and clinically euvolemic after stabilization during hospitalization for HF, elements of GDMT can be safely initiated. Inpatient continuation of GDMT for HFrEF appears safe and well-tolerated in most hemodynamically stable patients. Hospitalization is also a potential time for switching from an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker to sacubitril/valsartan therapy in eligible patients, and is the subject of ongoing study. Therapy withdrawal or need for dose reduction is rarely required, but if needed identifies a particularly at-risk group of patients with progressive HF. If recurrent intolerance to neurohormonal blockers is observed, these patients should be evaluated for advanced HF therapies. There is an enduring need for using the teachable moment of HFrEF hospitalization for optimal initiation, continuation, and switching of GDMT to improve post-discharge patient outcomes and the quality of chronic HFrEF care.

For initiation, In patients with HFrEF, GDMT should be initiated during hospitalization after clinical stability is achieved (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B-NR). If therapy must be stopped, In patients with HFrEF, if discontinuation of GDMT is necessary during hospitalization, it should be reinitiated and further optimized as soon as possible (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B-NR).

### Guideline-directed medical therapy after hospitalization for acute heart failure: insights from the CONNECT-HF [^490085aa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

A significant gap remains in the initiation and uptitration of guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). This implementation gap exists despite strong clinical guideline recommendations to use GDMT to reduce morbidity and improve clinical outcomes, including mortality, for patients and families affected by HFrEF. A prior analysis of registry participants in the United States demonstrated that the use of GDMT for chronic HFrEF remained consistently low and unaltered between baseline and 12‐month follow‐up in a stable outpatient setting. However, there is a scarcity of data regarding patterns of medication changes and barriers to GDMT implementation for patients after hospitalization for decompensated HF, particular for patients with HF with a range of insurers. Importantly, the clinical benefits of GDMT become apparent within days to weeks after initiation., Considering that ≈25% of patients hospitalized for decompensated HF die or are readmitted within 30 days, HF hospitalizations may represent an important opportunity to initiate and titrate GDMT. Therefore, analyzing data that includes the hospitalization period is crucial to optimize postdischarge management.

The CONNECT‐HF (Care Optimization Through Patient and Hospital Engagement Clinical Trial for Heart Failure) trial was a large, pragmatic trial designed to assess the effect of a hospital and postdischarge quality improvement intervention, involving monthly audit and feedback reports on GDMT performance to hospitals, compared with usual care. The high‐intensity intervention did not improve the implementation of GDMT at discharge or over time. To gain further insights into the factors associated with GDMT implementation beyond the effect of the quality improvement intervention, our objective was to identify factors associated with implementing GDMT in patients with HFrEF.

Heart failure clinical outcomes and systems of care — research priorities emphasize the impact of therapies in patient-reported outcomes, including symptoms and quality of life (QOL); studies addressing patient goals about care and care intensity as it intersects with disease trajectory; and real-world evidence data to characterize generalization of therapies in HF populations who may not have been represented in trials. Systems-level priorities include implementation studies on how to develop a structured approach to patient participation in informed decision-making and goal setting throughout the continuum of HF care; implementation science for adoption and optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) by clinicians on how to initiate multiple or sequenced GDMT, how to integrate these into learning health systems and networks, and how to increase patient education and adherence; pragmatic studies on multidisciplinary new care models (e.g., cardiac teams for structural and valve management, shock teams, cardiometabolic clinics, telemedicine, digital health, cardiac rehabilitation at home or postdischarge, and palliative care); strategies to eliminate structural racism, disparities, and health inequities in HF care; studies addressing evidence gaps in women, racial, and ethnic populations; management strategies for palliative care; identification of factors that lead to unwarranted variations in HF care; and identification of characteristics of systems of care (e.g., disciplines and staffing, electronic health records, and models of care) that optimize GDMT before and after the discharge of hospitalized patients.

### Heart failure spending function: an investment framework for sequencing and intensification of guideline-directed medical therapies [^4d7afdd4]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is managed with increasing numbers of guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT). Benefits tend to be additive. Burdens can also be additive. We propose a heart failure spending function as a conceptual framework for tailored intensification of GDMT that maximizes therapeutic opportunity while limiting adverse events and patient burden. Each patient is conceptualized to have reserve in physiological and psychosocial domains, which can be spent for a future return on investment. Key domains are blood pressure, heart rate, serum creatinine, potassium, and out-of-pocket costs. For each patient, GDMT should be initiated and intensified in a sequence that prioritizes medications with the greatest expected cardiac benefit while drawing on areas where the patient has ample reserves. When reserve is underspent, patients fail to gain the full benefit of GDMT. Conversely, when a reserve is fully spent, addition of new drugs or higher doses that draw upon a domain will lead to patient harm. The benefit of multiple agents drawing upon varied physiological domains should be balanced against cost and complexity. Thresholds for overspending are explored, as are mechanisms for implementing these concepts into routine care, but further health care delivery research is needed to validate and refine clinical use of the spending function. The heart failure spending function also suggests how newer therapies may be considered in terms of relative value, prioritizing agents that draw on different spending domains from existing GDMT.

### New era in heart failure management: implementing cutting-edge therapies effectively [^85eceb77]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological therapy for heart failure (HF) has evolved significantly in recent years. Conventional disease-modifying medical therapy HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), beta-blockers (BB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), was complemented by two novel drug classes including angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) which further improve outcomes in patients with HFrEF considerably. Major heart failure clinical practice guidelines advocate for the early initiation and uptitration of 'quadruple' medical therapy in HFrEF. However, implementation gaps still exist. There is an unmet need for evidence-based implementation strategies to achieve optimal guideline-directed medical treatment (GDMT). Treatment approaches in subgroups of patients with HF under-represented in clinical trials remain of significant clinical importance. The identification of the barriers to GDMT implementation in the real world is required. The scope of the Topic Collection was to gather emerging data on best practices of GDMT implementation in the real world, embracing the diversity of HF and psychosocial health patients with HF and capturing the broad spectrum of endpoints and outcomes.

### Contemporary guideline-directed medical therapy in de novo, chronic, and worsening heart failure patients: first data from the TITRATE-HF study [^7d3248e0]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Despite clear guideline recommendations for initiating four drug classes in all patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and the availability of rapid titration schemes, information on real-world implementation lags behind. Closely following the 2021 ESC HF guidelines and 2023 focused update, the TITRATE-HF study started to prospectively investigate the use, sequencing, and titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in HF patients, including the identification of implementation barriers.

Methods and Results

TITRATE-HF is an ongoing long-term HF registry conducted in the Netherlands. Overall, 4288 patients from 48 hospitals were included. Among these patients, 1732 presented with de novo, 2240 with chronic, and 316 with worsening HF. The median age was 71years (interquartile range [IQR] 63–78), 29% were female, and median ejection fraction was 35% (IQR 25–40). In total, 44% of chronic and worsening HFrEF patients were prescribed quadruple therapy. However, only 1% of HFrEF patients achieved target dose for all drug classes. In addition, quadruple therapy was more often prescribed to patients treated in a dedicated HF outpatient clinic as compared to a general cardiology outpatient clinic. In each GDMT drug class, 19% to 36% of non-use in HFrEF patients was related to side-effects, intolerances, or contraindications. In the de novo HF cohort, 49% of patients already used one or more GDMT drug classes for other indications than HF.

Conclusion

This first analysis of the TITRATE-HF study reports relatively high use of GDMT in a contemporary HF cohort, while still showing room for improvement regarding quadruple therapy. Importantly, the use and dose of GDMT were suboptimal, with the reasons often remaining unclear. This underscores the urgency for further optimization of GDMT and implementation strategies within HF management.

### Early initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure after cardiac surgery [^c94ca34b]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

There is an evolving role for guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in managing heart failure with reduced ejection fraction after cardiac surgery. GDMT is based on the use of pharmacologic agents from each of 4 distinct drug classes, also known as the 4 pillars of heart failure therapy: β-blockers, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, often paired with neprilysin inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Despite the demonstrated benefits of GDMT in reducing mortality and hospitalization rates in the nonsurgical literature, there is conspicuous underuse of GDMT after cardiac surgery. The lack of published literature and practical challenges surrounding the timing for initiation of GDMT in the immediate postoperative period has limited standardized implementation strategies. A multidisciplinary approach will be necessary to assist in initiating, titrating, and monitoring the response to these therapies in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction after cardiac surgery.

In this secondary analysis of the CONNECT‐HF trial, we observed, that following hospital discharge, the rates of GDMT use and achievement of ≥ 50% of the target dose were low shortly after discharge and remained unchanged during the 12‐month follow‐up period. Most notably, use of GDMT at discharge was significantly associated with use and achievement of ≥ 50% of the target dose of GDMT at 12 months. These findings underscore the importance of initiating GDMT in patients with HFrEF at the time of HF hospitalization.

### How to tackle therapeutic inertia in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. A scientific statement of the heart failure association of the ESC [^8da8408b]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) reduces morbidity and mortality, but its implementation is often poor in daily clinical practice. Barriers to implementation include clinical and organizational factors that might contribute to clinical inertia, i.e. avoidance/delay of recommended treatment initiation/optimization. The spectrum of strategies that might be applied to foster GDMT implementation is wide, and involves the organizational set-up of heart failure care pathways, tailored drug initiation/optimization strategies increasing the chance of successful implementation, digital tools/telehealth interventions, educational activities and strategies targeting patient/physician awareness, and use of quality registries. This scientific statement by the Heart Failure Association of the ESC provides an overview of the current state of GDMT implementation in HFrEF, clinical and organizational barriers to implementation, and aims at suggesting a comprehensive framework on how to overcome clinical inertia and ultimately improve implementation of GDMT in HFrEF based on up-to-date evidence.

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) — Principle 6 scenarios — addresses symptomatic hypotension and hypokalemia as follows: Scenario: Symptomatic hypotension explains that symptomatic hypotension may be due to overdiuresis, use of non-CV drugs with hemodynamic effects, autonomic dysfunction, or simultaneous administration of multiple HF medications; it advises that all of these should be addressed before deciding to lower doses of evidence-based therapies, after excluding other causes of hypotension, use best-tolerated doses of GDMT, accepting that less data exist for the impact of lower doses in HF management, and that clinical comorbidities and clinical judgement should be used to guide which GDMTs are reduced, with consideration of referral to an advanced HF specialist for persistent hypotension. For Scenario: Hypokalemia, when possible, consider increasing the dose of mineralocorticoid antagonist (if appropriate kidney function) in lieu of adding oral potassium.

### Role of guideline directed medical therapy doses and optimization in patients hospitalized with decompensated systolic heart failure [^66a08a29]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite significant advances in evidence-based treatments for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the use of guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT) at recommended doses remains suboptimal. We examine the usage and modification of inpatient GDMT and its effect on outcomes in patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of acute on chronic HFrEF between 2013 and 2018. Overall use and modification of GDMT, which included heart failure appropriate beta-blockers (BB), renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) and aldosterone blockers (MRA) during the hospitalization were collected. Target dosages were based on guideline recommendations. Primary endpoints included 30-day hospitalization-free survival and 1-year survival. Among 1,655 patients, discharge use of BB, RASi, and MRA was 73.4%, 55.9% and 13.8%, respectively. Upon discharge, ≥ 50% target dose of BB, RASi, and MRA was used in 25.3%, 15.6%, and 13.7%, respectively. In multivariable analyses, there was a statistically significant improvement in 1-year survival and 30-day hospitalization-free survival in patients discharged on increasing number of medication classes optimized at ≥ 50% target dose (per extra medication, HR 0.74, 0.64–0.86, p < 0.001, and HR 0.73, 0.62–0.86, p = 0.0002), respectively. Initiation and/or uptitration of BB and RASi was associated with improved 30-day hospitalization-free survival and 1-year survival, (HR 0.73 (0.57–0.92), p = 0.0087; HR 0.62 (0.46–0.82), p < 0.001) for BB and (HR 0.77 (0.62–0.95), p < 0.001; HR 0.62 (0.48–0.80), p < 0.001) for RASi, respectively. In conclusion, inpatient optimization of GDMT in acute HFrEF is feasible and associated with improved 30-day hospitalization-free survival and 1-year survival.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Figure 7B — titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) outlines trajectory-based inpatient actions: Patients with decompensated HFrEF "should be diuresed and started on SGLT inhibitor unless contraindicated or cost prohibitive," while those "with an improving trajectory… should have optimization of GDMT." For a new diagnosis, "initiation of all 4 pillars of GDMT should be attempted," and for chronic HF on partial therapy, care "should have personalized therapy to fill in gaps, considering a switch from an ACE inhibitor/ARB to ARNI if appropriate." In chronic Class IV HF with decompensation, "caution is required…; these patients may not tolerate even low doses of beta blockers and RAS, although an attempt at titration may be made." If the short-term course is "stalled or worsening," patients "should have re-evaluation of comorbidities and consideration of other diagnoses." Long-term course "should be reevaluated, with consideration of goals of care, candidacy for advanced therapies, and experimental treatments." The "ideal goal is initiation of all 4 pillars of GDMT… in the hospital on a baseline of diuretic therapy," with "a plan for ongoing addition and titration of GDMT after discharge," including a "Loop diuretic plan on discharge." The figure lists the GDMT pillars as "SGLT inhibitors ARNI or ACEI/ARB beta-blockers MRA."

### Optimizing foundational therapies in patients with HFrEF: how Do we translate these findings into clinical care? [^f378516c]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the high risk of adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), there is an urgent need for the initiation and titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) that can reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice guidelines are now emphasizing the need for early and rapid initiation of therapies that have cardiovascular benefit. Recognizing that there are many barriers to GDMT initiation and optimization, health care providers should aim to introduce the 4 pillars of quadruple therapy now recommended by most clinical practice guidelines: angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors. A large proportion of patients with HFrEF do not have clinical contraindications to GDMT but are not treated with these therapies. Early initiation of low-dose combination therapy should be tolerated by most patients. However, patient-related factors such as hemodynamics, frailty, and laboratory values will need consideration for maximum tolerated GDMT. GDMT initiation in acute heart failure hospitalization represents another important avenue to improve use of GDMT. Finally, removal of therapies that do not have clear cardiovascular benefit should be considered to lower polypharmacy and reduce the risk of adverse side effects. Future prospective studies aimed at guiding optimal implementation of quadruple therapy are warranted to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF.

### Translating the 2021 ESC heart failure guideline recommendations in daily practice: results from a heart failure survey. A scientific statement of the ESC council for cardiology practice and the heart failure association of the ESC [^83b8b186]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Real-world data show that guidelines are insufficiently implemented, and particularly guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT) are underused in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in clinical practice. The Council for Cardiology Practice and the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) developed a survey aiming to (i) evaluate the perspectives of the cardiology community on the 2021 ESC heart failure (HF) guidelines, (ii) pinpoint disparities in disease management, and (iii) propose strategies to enhance adherence to HF guidelines.

Methods and Results

A 22-question survey regarding the diagnosis and treatment of HFrEF was delivered between March and June 2022. Of 457 physicians, 54% were general cardiologists, 19.4% were HF specialists, 18.9% other cardiac specialists, and 7.7% non-cardiac specialists. For diagnosis, 52.1% employed echocardiography and natriuretic peptides (NPs), 33.2% primarily used echocardiography, and 14.7% predominantly relied on NPs. The first drug class initiated in HFrEF was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ACEi/ARNi) (91.2%), beta-blockers (BB) (73.8%), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (53.4%), and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (48.1%). The combination ACEi/ARNi + MRA+ BB was preferred by 39.3% of physicians, ACEi/ARNi + SGLT2 inhibitors + BB by 33.3%, and ACEi/ARNi + BB by 22.2%. The time required to initiate and optimize GDMT was estimated to be < 1month by 8.3%, 1-3months by 52%, 3-6months by 31.8%, and > 6months by 7.9%. Compared to general cardiologists, HF specialists/academic cardiologists reported lower estimated time-to-initiation, and more commonly preferred a parallel initiation of GDMT rather than a sequential approach.

Conclusion

Participants generally followed diagnostic and treatment guidelines, but variations in HFrEF management across care settings or HF specialties were noted. The survey may raise awareness and promote standardized HF care.

### Polypharmacy and guideline-directed medical therapy initiation among adults hospitalized with heart Failure [^a71a4657]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The reasons for suboptimal rates of GDMT in HFrEF have been evaluated previously. Prescriber reasons for not prescribing GDMT include contraindications to neurohormonal blockade (renal dysfunction, hypotension, hyperkalemia, and bradycardia); concerns regarding patient nonadherence; and concerns about side effects and comorbidities. A survey of physicians treating patients with HFrEF indicated the possibility of an overlooked barrier — polypharmacy. Polypharmacy is defined as taking a high number of medications, with variable cutoffs described in the literature. Prior work has shown that polypharmacy is inversely associated with prescription of other guideline-concordant medications like statins and antihypertensives; and recent secondary analysis of the GUIDE-IT (Guiding Evidence-Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure) trial showed that polypharmacy was inversely associated with achieving optimal GDMT among ambulatory adults with HFrEF. However, no study to our knowledge has examined the association between polypharmacy and GDMT initiation among adults hospitalized for HF. Importantly, polypharmacy is nearly universal among older adults hospitalized for HF. To examine polypharmacy as a potential barrier to GDMT, we investigated whether polypharmacy was associated with in-hospital GDMT initiation among hospitalized patients with HFrEF and HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF), which has been shown to benefit from similar agents as HFrEF.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^22b4bca3]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 guideline — treatment of HFrEF stages C and D outlines a stepwise algorithm beginning with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): for HFrEF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% (Stage C), initiate ARNI in NYHA II–III (1), ACEI or ARB in NYHA I–IV (1), beta blocker (1), MRA (1), SGLT2i (1), and diuretics as needed (1); Step 1 medications "may be started simultaneously at initial (low) doses," or "may be started sequentially" "without need to achieve target dosing before initiating next medication," and doses "should be increased to target as tolerated." Patient scenarios guide additional therapy: NYHA III–IV in African American patients → hydral-nitrates (1); NYHA II–III; LVEF ≤ 35%; > 1 y survival → ICD (1); NYHA II–III, ambulatory IV; LVEF ≤ 35%; NSR and QRS ≥ 150 ms with LBBB → CRT-D (1). Reassessment follows to "Reassess symptoms, labs, health status, and LVEF"; if refractory HF (Stage D), proceed to referral for HF specialty care with options including, in select patients, durable MCS (1), cardiac transplant (1), palliative care (can be initiated before Stage D) (1), and investigational studies; continue GDMT with serial reassessment and optimize dosing, adherence and patient education, and address goals of care.

### Heart failure in Europe: guideline-directed medical therapy use and decision making in chronic and acute, pre-existing and de novo, heart failure with reduced, mildly reduced, and preserved ejection fraction-the ESC EORP heart failure III registry [^b7fae985]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

We analysed baseline characteristics and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) use and decisions in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Heart Failure (HF) III Registry.

Methods and Results

Between 1 November 2018 and 31 December 2020, 10162 patients with acute HF (AHF, 39%, age 70 [62–79], 36% women) or outpatient visit for HF (61%, age 66 [58–75], 33% women), with HF with reduced (HFrEF, 57%), mildly reduced (HFmrEF, 17%) or preserved (HFpEF, 26%) ejection fraction were enrolled from 220 centres in 41 European or ESC-affiliated countries. With AHF, 97% were hospitalized, 2.2% received intravenous treatment in the emergency department, and 0.9% received intravenous treatment in an outpatient clinic. AHF was seen by most by a general cardiologist (51%) and outpatient HF most by a HF specialist (48%). A majority had been hospitalized for HF before, but 26% of AHF and 6.1% of outpatient HF had de novo HF. Baseline use, initiation and discontinuation of GDMT varied according to AHF versus outpatient HF, de novo versus pre-existing HF, and by ejection fraction. After the AHF event or outpatient HF visit, use of any renin-angiotensin system inhibitor, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and loop diuretics was 89%, 29%, 92%, 78%, and 85% in HFrEF; 89%, 9.7%, 90%, 64%, and 81% in HFmrEF; and 77%, 3.1%, 80%, 48%, and 80% in HFpEF.

Conclusion

Use and initiation of GDMT was high in cardiology centres in Europe, compared to previous reports from cohorts and registries including more primary care and general medicine and regions more local or outside of Europe and ESC-affiliated countries.

### Determinants of guideline-directed medical therapy implementation during heart Failure hospitalization [^cb11af55]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In patients with HFrEF hospitalized at an academic medical center, we found that implementation of GDMT was suboptimal. While deficiencies were widespread with no patient group achieving a high rate of GDMT optimization, implementation was significantly less in Black patients compared to patients of other races and in patients experiencing homelessness. Failure to implement optimized medical therapy was not due to either contraindications to specific therapies (ie, elevated creatinine, hyperkalemia, or bradycardia) or lack of an indication in certain populations (ie, hydralazine/isosorbide combination in non-Black patients), as the mOMT score accounts for these factors. Suboptimal implementation of GDMT was associated with a higher likelihood of postdischarge events, particularly in patients with newly diagnosed HFrEF. These findings demonstrate a need for greater attention to the implementation of GDMT during HF hospitalization, particularly in vulnerable populations and in patients with new-onset HFrEF, in order to improve outcomes and reduce disparities in health care.

HF management guidelines provide strong recommendations for medication classes that improve outcomes in patients with HFrEF. In clinical practice, however, these agents are often not initiated or uptitrated to recommended target doses., Hospitalization for HF represents a 'watershed event,' identifying a cohort of patients at substantially higher risk of death or rehospitalization postdischarge than are nonhospitalized patients. Moreover, hospitalization offers an opportunity to optimize GDMT at a time when patients can be closely observed for intolerance or side effects. Guidelines recommend that GDMT be "initiated or increased toward target doses" during HF hospitalization once adequate diuresis and hemodynamic stability have been established. Results from STRONG-HF suggest that rapid uptitration of GDMT to target doses after an acute HF admission reduces mortality and HF readmission while improving symptoms and quality of life. The PIONEER-HFand SOLOISTtrials have shown that initiation of individual GDMT medications during hospitalization for decompensated HF can be accomplished safely and improve postdischarge outcomes.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) clinical assessment — after guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is initiated and titrated, patients with chronic HFrEF should be evaluated regularly, with a reasonable interval every 3 to 6 months, though many may need more frequent follow-up to monitor stability and further titration. Cardiac rehabilitation is helpful but underused, and virtual care for outpatient GDMT titration has been useful and is expected to play an increasingly larger role, particularly for medication titration. High-risk features summarized by "I NEED HELP" should trigger consideration for referral for an advanced heart failure consultation.

Table 27 — Older adults with heart failure (HF) have substantial lifetime risk and notable outcomes. Per Framingham Heart Study (FHS), at 40 y of age, the lifetime risk of incident HF is 20% for both sexes, and at 80 y of age, the risk remains 20% for men and women. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is preserved in at least two-thirds of older adults with the diagnosis of HF. Among 1233 patients with HF aged ≥ 80 y, 40% mortality occurred during follow-up, and survival was associated with prescription of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT).

### Lessons toto for optimizing heart Failure medications [^b66fe470]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Heart failure is an established global public health burden that affects 64 million people worldwide. Hospitalizations for heart failure cost ∼$24,000 each and account for 65% of all medical costs for this morbid syndrome. Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is the cornerstone for reducing heart failure hospitalizations, prolonging survival, and reducing costs. The 2022 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America heart failure guidelines recommend the initiation of 4 classes of medications in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF): an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker if use of ARNI is not feasible, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor. These medications may be initiated either simultaneously or sequentially, with the goal of achieving target doses studied in landmark clinical trials.

### Optimal background pharmacological therapy for heart failure patients in clinical trials: JACC review topic of the week [^94b13720]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

Therapies approved in the United States to treat HF have generally shown significant benefit on morbidity and mortality, resulting in strong recommendations in treatment guidelines. However, in practice, patients remain undertreated with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for multiple reasons, including absolute or relative contraindications and real or perceived intolerance. The dilemma of trialists, sponsors, regulators, and payers is whether new therapies should be tested against a background of maximal GDMT or potentially suboptimal "usual care?" For example, what is the value of a new therapy that is shown to be beneficial in the latter circumstance? Might it have had less benefit if background therapy had been optimized? If a treatment is expected to work through distinct and independent mechanisms, the intensity of background therapy is irrelevant to assess treatment efficacy via relative risk reduction, although background therapy may augment absolute risk reduction by influencing the prevailing population event rate. What is certain is that new therapies for heart failure are needed, whether providing incremental benefit as an "add-on" treatment or as an effective alternative to a proven but contraindicated or poorly tolerated standard therapy. Assuming a drug has been shown to be safe and effective, a primary issue for U.S. regulators is to determine whether trial results are relevant to patients with heart failure in the United States.

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) initiation and titration for HFrEF emphasize early, rapid implementation of the 4-drug regimen based on contemporary evidence. Established pharmacological therapies for chronic HFrEF include angiotensin II receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), evidence-based beta-blockers, sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors, mineralocorticoid antagonists, loop diuretic agents, hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate, ivabradine, and vericiguat, and in contrast, use of digoxin as a treatment for HFrEF lacks contemporary data and is focused on rate control in atrial fibrillation in those with low blood pressure. Using a therapeutic standard 4-drug regimen (ARNI, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid antagonist, SGLT inhibitor), 4-class initiation reduced the hazard of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for HF compared with ACE inhibitor/ARB plus a beta-blocker (HR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.3–0.47). Among patients admitted with acute HF, a high-intensity strategy targeting doses within 6 weeks of discharge was safe, well-tolerated, and associated with a reduced risk of 180-day all-cause death or HF readmission compared with usual care. In higher-risk HFrEF with worsening symptoms, vericiguat was superior to placebo in reducing HF hospitalization and/or cardiovascular death and subsequently received a Class 2b recommendation in the updated 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA HF guideline. The document notes the need for more frequent follow-ups, especially after initiation or titration, which may be in-person or virtual depending on patient stability and adjustments.

Stage C HFrEF — digoxin pharmacological treatment: COR 2b; LOE B-R state, "In patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) despite guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) (or who are unable to tolerate GDMT), digoxin might be considered to decrease hospitalizations for HF." Evidence cited notes only one large randomized trial predating current GDMT in NYHA class II to III patients, with 2 to 5 years of digoxin showing no effect on mortality but a modest reduction in the combined risk of death and hospitalization and no significant effect on health-related QOL; use "requires caution" and is reserved for those symptomatic despite optimization of GDMT. Dosing and safety notes include that digoxin is usually initiated at a low dose; GDMT is expected to be optimized before considering addition; higher serum digoxin concentrations are linked to higher death risk (≥ 1.2 ng/mL and ≥ 1.6 ng/mL); therapy may be continued in the absence of a contraindication or discontinued with caution; clinical worsening after withdrawal has been shown; and typical dosing is 0.125 to 0.25 mg daily, with low doses (0.125 mg daily or every other day) initially if the patient is > 70 years.

### Rationale and design of a navigator-driven remote optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^029fddea]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

5 DISCUSSION

Optimization of GDMT has been associated with reductions in cardiovascular and heart failure morbidity and mortality in numerous clinical trials, registries, and meta‐analyses. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 However, clinicians frequently fail to implement guideline directives in practice. 22 These gaps in care have been attributed to numerable factors, such as inertia, reluctance to increase medication burden, cost, lab monitoring, requirements for insurance pre‐authorization, and lack of knowledge about rapidly evolving evidence. 23, 24 There is a substantial opportunity for meaningful improvement in clinical outcomes amongst HF patients, however, the 2013 AHA/ACC guidelines for the management of heart failure encourage strategies to close the gap between current practice and guideline recommendations. 1

Even when clinicians apply HF medications as directed by guidelines, medications are frequently not dosed to guideline‐recommended targets, and infrequent clinic‐based contact means that the medical regimen evolves over a protracted time interval, with many months lapsing between medication titration. Given that the benefits associated with deployment of GDMT are often seen early, this may reflect a missed opportunity to improve patient outcomes. 25, 26, 27 Moreover, deployment of invasive strategies for HF including ICD and/or CRT is intended to follow on medical optimization, since this therapy may in many cases result in reverse remodeling that can lead to improvements in EF over time and obviate the need for device therapy. 28, 29 Unfortunately, data suggests that most patients who receive ICD or CRT do not optimize GDMT prior to device implantation, reflecting another missed opportunity for these patients. 30 These gaps in care are associated with significant mortality for patients with HFrEF. 31

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) after hospitalization in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF): treatment gaps. Nearly half (46%) of patients with HFrEF have no changes made to oral GDMT in the 12 months after hospitalization despite many being discharged on suboptimal doses. From claims-based studies, 42% of patients with HFrEF are not prescribed any GDMT within 30 days post-index hospitalization, and 45% are prescribed either no oral GDMT or monotherapy within 1-year post-index hospitalization. From CHAMP-HF, initiation or dose increases of beta blockers, ACEi-ARB-ARNi, and MRA occur in ≤ 10% of patients with HFrEF within 1 year of hospitalization. Very few eligible patients with HFrEF receive target doses of beta blockers (18.7%), ACEi-ARB (10.8%), or ARNi (2.0%), and less than 10% of patients with HFrEF are on target doses of ACEi-ARB-ARNi, beta blockers, and MRA within 12 months of an index hospitalization.

HFpEF guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) initiation and titration — barring contraindication, all individuals with a diagnosis of HFpEF should be treated with an SGLT2i to reduce cardiovascular death/heart failure hospitalization and improve health status; initiation of an SGLT2i may be considered for either ambulatory individuals with HFpEF or those with acutely decompensated HF. In those with an LVEF < 55% to 60%, use of an MRA, ARNI, or ARB may be considered when an ARNI is not feasible. ARNIs and MRAs should be titrated to the maximum tolerated dosages based on symptoms, blood pressure, potassium, and creatinine, with STRONG-HF supporting initiation of GDMT at one-half of target doses before discharge and titration to target dosages over the next 2 weeks, with frequent follow-up over the 2 months.

### Early initiation of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in acute heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e1b4cf9b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We present here the largest meta‐analysis of RCTs assessing efficacy and safety of early initiation of SGLT2is in 2320 patients hospitalized for AHF, regardless of LVEF or diabetic status. Hence, we provide evidence that, in settings of AHF (1) early use of SGLT2is is associated with a reduction in all‐cause death and HF rehospitalizations, and (2) initiation before discharge showed an even greater improvement in survival. These results advocate for the possible initiation of SGLT2is as soon as possible in patients with AHF according to inclusion/exclusion criteria used in the studies.

While both recent American and European HF consensus, clearly reaffirmed the imperative need to implement a 4‐drug therapy (GDMT) as soon as possible (SGLT2i, β blockers, angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist), numerous studies identified critical gaps in the speed of their introduction, highlighting widespread therapeutic inertia. A rapid uptitration of GDMT to the maximum tolerated dose is also a key point in both the American and European guidelines. Yet, failure to initiate GDMT at discharge from an HF hospitalization is associated with a substantial risk that this therapy will never be initiated during subsequent follow‐ups or will be started with significant delay and an increase in mortality. Conversely, improved survival is favored by and proportional to the number of GDMTs that can be introduced. Some consensuses advocate for the introduction of the 4 pillars at least at a small dose, rather than prioritizing only 1 family, but the level of evidence remains poor. The 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America guidelines also emphasize the recommendation that in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction requiring hospitalization, preexisting GDMT should be maintained whenever possible. They further highlight that the cornerstone of AHF management is the effectiveness of the decongestion strategy, recommending the addition of a second diuretic alongside loop diuretics when diuresis is inadequate to relieve symptoms. This approach could potentially include the use of SGLT2is. Whether in acute or chronic settings, it is often the fear of side effects (AKI, hypotension, ketoacidosis) that makes physicians reluctant to introduce and uptitrate GDMT, in both American and European reports. Our meta‐analysis demonstrates that, on the contrary, the introduction of SGLT2is before discharge can be performed safely, without increasing the risk of adverse events, while reducing all‐cause death by 46%, compared with 26% in the overall cohort, also including patients with introduction within 3 days after discharge. Therefore, their widespread and rapid use represents a significant opportunity to reduce post‐AHF death, which remains unacceptably high.

### Optimization of evidence-based heart failure medications after an acute heart failure admission: a secondary analysis of the STRONG-HF randomized clinical trial [^bfcb7ab0]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute heart failure (AHF) is associated with a high rate of readmission and death. Recently, the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Rapid Optimization, Helped by N-Terminal Pro–Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) Testing of Heart Failure Therapies (STRONG-HF) trial showed that an intensive strategy of rapid uptitration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) combined with close follow-up after an AHF admission was safe, reduced the risk of 180-day all-cause death or heart failure (HF) readmission, and improved quality of life compared with usual care, confirming previous observational studies. However, in the STRONG-HF trial, despite recommendations for uptitration of GDMT to 100% of maximally recommended doses at week 2, not all patients were prescribed 100% of GDMT at week 2 after randomization and discharge. The aim of this post hoc secondary analysis was to assess the association between the level of uptitration of GDMT achieved and outcomes in the STRONG-HF study.

Hospital initiation and titration of ARNI and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): Initiation of ARNI during an acute decompensated heart failure hospitalization is feasible after hemodynamic stabilization; in PIONEER-HF, up to 25% of patients developed hypotension when treated with sacubitril/valsartan, and ensuring that patients are not volume-depleted at initiation may help avoid this. TRANSITION demonstrated that about one-half of patients could achieve the target dose within 10 weeks after in-hospital initiation or soon after discharge, and following discharge, ongoing efforts toward GDMT optimization (including titration to target doses whenever possible) should continue. STRONG HF showed that intensive and rapid initiation and titration of GDMT with in-person follow-up after hospitalization was safe and tolerated and resulted in a reduction in 180-day HF hospitalizations and/or CV deaths.

Heart failure with improved ejection fraction (HFimpEF) — outpatient continuation of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) quality measure defines the eligible population as patients age ≥ 18 y with prior HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤ 40%) and a subsequent LVEF > 40% who continue GDMT in the outpatient setting; the numerator is patients initially diagnosed with HFimpEF who continued to have GDMT prescribed during the measurement period, and the denominator is patients age ≥ 18 y medically managed in the outpatient setting with HFimpEF. Denominator exclusions are heart transplant and LVAD; exceptions include documented medical or patient reasons for not continuing GDMT. The measurement period is 12 mo, data sources include EHR and administrative claims, attribution is to the individual practitioner and medical practices, and the care setting is outpatient. Documentation notes include that therapy is to be continued at ≥ 1 visit in the 12-mo period and that "medically managed" includes ≥ 2 outpatient encounters. The rationale states that posttreatment improvement indicates remission and stopping HF medications is associated with relapse and reduced LVEF. The guideline recommendation states: "GDMT should be continued to prevent relapse of HF and LV dysfunction, even in patients who may become asymptomatic" (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B-R).

### Physician perceptions, attitudes, and strategies towards implementing guideline-directed medical therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. A survey of the heart failure association of the ESC and the ESC council for cardiology practice [^4e8ea64b]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Recent guidelines recommend four core drug classes (renin-angiotensin system inhibitor/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor [RASi/ARNi], beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist [MRA], and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor [SGLT2i]) for the pharmacological management of heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). We assessed physicians' perceived (i) comfort with implementing the recent HFrEF guideline recommendations; (ii) status of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) implementation; (iii) use of different GDMT sequencing strategies; and (iv) barriers and strategies for achieving implementation.

Methods and Results

A 26-question survey was disseminated via bulletin, e-mail and social channels directed to physicians with an interest in HF. Of 432 respondents representing 91 countries, 36% were female, 52% were aged < 50years, and 90% mainly practiced in cardiology (30% HF). Overall comfort with implementing quadruple therapy was high (87%). Only 12% estimated that > 90% of patients with HFrEF without contraindications received quadruple therapy. The time required to initiate quadruple therapy was estimated at 1-2weeks by 34% of respondents, 1month by 36%, 3months by 24%, and ≥ 6months by 6%. The average respondent favoured traditional drug sequencing strategies (RASi/ARNi with/followed by beta-blocker, and then MRA with/followed by SGLT2i) over simultaneous initiation or SGLT2i-first sequences. The most frequently perceived clinical barriers to implementation were hypotension (70%), creatinine increase (47%), hyperkalaemia (45%) and patient adherence (42%).

Conclusions

Although comfort with implementing all four core drug classes in patients with HFrEF was high among physicians, a majority estimated implementation of GDMT in HFrEF to be low. We identified several important perceived clinical and non-clinical barriers that can be targeted to improve implementation.

Heart failure with improved ejection fraction (HFimpEF) — definition and ongoing therapy: Improved LVEF refers to patients with a previous HFrEF who now have an LVEF ≥ 40%, and these patients should continue their HFrEF treatment; in patients with HFimpEF after treatment, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) should be continued to prevent relapse of HF and left ventricular dysfunction, even if patients become asymptomatic.

### Rapid sequence initiation of device therapy in heart Failure [^095a2e95]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite major advances in drug therapy for heart failure (HF) and efforts to optimize their use amidst a rising trend of HF hospitalizations and excess HF-related morbidity and mortality, most eligible patients do not receive guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). Several device-based therapies are also approved for different phenotypes of HF and are becoming an integral part of HF management, including cardiac resynchronization therapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral repair, cardiac contractility modulation, and baroreflex activation therapy. The conventional approach to HF treatment is to initiate and optimize drugs before considering devices. Indeed, this was a requirement in clinical trials assessing devices in HF, and this approach is based on the temporal development of devices that proceeded the earlier testing and approval of drugs for HF. An alternate approach of initiating device-based therapies prior to or simultaneously with drug therapies in selected patients has not been explored.

Devices offer several advantages over drugs. First, they operate largely independent of patient's adherence, eliminating nonadherence as a major factor contributing to suboptimal therapy in the real-world practice. Second, they target structural or biological pathways that are not typically amenable to drug therapy. Third, they generally improve hemodynamics with no blood pressure or heart rate lowering effect and have minimal interaction with kidney function; therefore, their use is not interrupted by fluctuations in cardiovascular or kidney status. Fourth, the improvement in hemodynamics associated with their use could enable optimization of drug therapy. Fifth, device-based therapies have no interaction with medications, which is important in patients on polypharmacy.

Several drawbacks for device-based therapies also exist. They require an invasive procedure for implantation with a potential for procedural and device-related complications. They may require maintenance, troubleshooting and replacements if dependent on a battery. The initial cost of devices and their implantation is more than that of drugs. These drawbacks combined with the fact that drugs have been studied in larger populations, are easier to administer, and do not require specialized setting for initiation and management, have conventionally made drugs the first-line approach in patients with HF.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

HFrEF hospitalization — sequencing and dosing during GDMT initiation emphasize practical starting choices and available evidence. For patients with less robust blood pressure, "the first step may be a low dose of an ARB, with a potential switch to sacubitril/valsartan before discharge, once a low dose of beta-blocker has been tolerated (usually starting with metoprolol 6.25 mg twice per day or carvedilol 3.125 mg twice per day)." Evidence on sequence is limited; the historical CIBIS III "demonstrated no difference in overall outcomes… during the first 6 months," whereas "a small trial showed a higher achieved beta-blocker dose, lower heart rate, and greater increase in LVEF at 12 months when beta-blockers were started first." The document notes "The usual strategy aims for addition of all neurohormonal modulatory classes before any up-titration." In the European TRANSITION trial, "similar majorities of patients were on 49/51 mg to 97/103 mg twice-daily doses of sacubitril/valsartan at 10 weeks," regardless of timing relative to discharge, with higher doses in de novo HF, hypertension, and higher starting doses. It also states that U.S. experience shows discharge prescriptions increase maintenance and that "4-pillar GDMT has been shown to decrease recurrent HF events, reverse ventricular remodeling, and extend meaningful survival."

### Titration of medications after acute heart Failure is safe, tolerated, and effective regardless of risk [^c3275386]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) decisions may be less affected by single patient variables such as blood pressure or kidney function and more by overall risk profile. In STRONG-HF (Safety, tolerability and efficacy of up-titration of guideline-directed medical therapies for acute heart failure), high-intensity care (HIC) in the form of rapid uptitration of heart failure (HF) GDMT was effective overall, but the safety, tolerability and efficacy of HIC across the spectrum of HF severity is unknown. Evaluating this with a simple risk-based framework offers an alternative and more clinically translatable approach than traditional subgroup analyses.

Objectives

The authors sought to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy of HIC according to the simple, powerful, and clinically translatable MAGGIC (Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic) HF risk score.

Methods

In STRONG-HF, 1,078 patients with acute HF were randomized to HIC (uptitration of treatments to 100% of recommended doses within 2 weeks of discharge and 4 scheduled outpatient visits over the 2 months after discharge) vs usual care (UC). The primary endpoint was the composite of all-cause death or first HF rehospitalization at day 180. Baseline HF risk profile was determined by the previously validated MAGGIC risk score. Treatment effect was stratified according to MAGGIC risk score both as a categorical and continuous variable.

Results

Among 1,062 patients (98.5%) with complete data for whom a MAGGIC score could be calculated at baseline, GDMT use at baseline was similar across MAGGIC tertiles. Overall GDMT prescriptions achieved for individual medication classes were higher in the HIC vs UC group and did not differ by MAGGIC risk score tertiles (interaction nonsignificant). The incidence of all-cause death or HF readmission at day 180 was, respectively, 16.3%, 18.9%, and 23.2% for MAGGIC risk score tertiles 1, 2, and 3. The HIC arm was at lower risk of all-cause death or HF readmission at day 180 (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.50–0.86) and this finding was robust across MAGGIC risk score modeled as a categorical (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.62–0.68 in tertiles 1, 2, and 3; interaction nonsignificant) for all comparisons and continuous (interaction nonsignificant) variable. The rate of adverse events was higher in the HIC group, but this observation did not differ based on MAGGIC risk score tertile (interaction nonsignificant).

Conclusions

HIC led to better use of GDMT and lower HF-related morbidity and mortality compared with UC, regardless of the underlying HF risk profile. (Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Rapid Optimization, Helped by NT-proBNP testinG, of Heart Failure Therapies [STRONG-HF]; NCT03412201).

### Determinants of guideline-directed medical therapy implementation during heart Failure hospitalization [^7dfd5de0]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has evolved considerably since the initial publication of the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) management guidelines in 1995. In addition to diuretics, major guidelines, now provide Class I recommendations for use of beta-blockers, inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system [angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs)], mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, hydralazine with nitrate in Black patients, and most recently, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2Is), all of which improve outcomes in patients with HFrEF. The cumulative effects of these medications result in mortality reductions of up to 70 to 80%. Unfortunately, guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMTs) are not optimally utilized in the HFrEF population., Because socially vulnerable populations have particularly poor HF outcomes, attention has focused on variability in GDMT utilization related to socioeconomic characteristics. Available information, however, is discordant with some studies finding evidence of discrepancies in treatment between racial and ethnic groups, while others have failed to detect differences in GDMT utilization.,

An important limitation of many prior studies of GDMT implementation is that medication classes were assessed individually, without consideration of dose, or accounting for contraindications to specific drug classes. In clinical practice, however, avoidance of some GDMTs with continued use of others is determined on an individualized basis according to patient-specific contraindications. Thus, a measure that assesses GDMT for HFrEF in combination, while considering specific contraindications in individuals, would provide more accurate insights regarding GDMT utilization in clinical practice. Accordingly, we quantified GDMT optimization by modifying the Heart Failure Collaboratory's optimal medical therapy (OMT) score, which considers the use of multiple agents in combination, to account for indications and contraindications of specific drugs used to treat an individual patient.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^1a4f36ff]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Why are patients receiving subtarget doses of critical treatments?

In clinical practice, physicians initiate treatment at a low 'starting dose', but most patients continue to receive the starting dose for long periods of time, often indefinitely, with no or minimal uptitration. When new treatments are initiated at low doses during a hospitalization for heart failure, these doses are typically maintained following discharge. 25 This pattern of practice is prevalent whether patients are treated by primary care physicians or by heart failure specialists.

A striking example is the prescribing of sacubitril/valsartan. The drug is commonly initiated at 24/26 mg twice daily, but is uptitrated only in a small fraction of patients. 26 In contrast, few patients received long‐term treatment with 24/26 mg twice daily in the large‐scale clinical trial that established the survival benefit of neprilysin inhibition (PARADIGM‐HF). 27, 28 All patients in that trial received target doses of the drug at randomization, and > 70% were maintained on this dose for the duration of the study 27; yet, in clinical practice, < 25% of patients are ever titrated to the target dose of 97/103 mg twice daily. Interestingly, 40% of the patients who required temporary dose reduction in PARADIGM‐HF were subsequently restored to target doses. In contrast, in clinical practice, the vast majority of dose reductions are permanent, leading to indefinite treatment with subtarget doses.

The approach to treating life‐threatening heart failure in clinical practice differs markedly from that used by oncologists to treat life‐threatening cancers. Cancer specialists initiate simultaneous therapy with multiple‐drug regimens at target doses and down‐titrate only if serious adverse reactions occur that cannot be mitigated with additional treatments. Efforts to prolong life are valued far more highly than efforts to minimize drug toxicity. In striking contrast, the treatment of heart failure is routinely initiated with low doses of a single drug; additional therapies are added at a later time; and avoidance of adverse effects represents the clinical priority. The difference in the two approaches is medically inexplicable, since heart failure is more lethal than most forms of cancer. 29 Furthermore, the median improvement in survival produced by most treatments for heart failure exceeds that for most therapies for metastatic cancer.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy after hospitalization for acute heart failure: insights from the CONNECT-HF [^e0e31568]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Significant gap remains in the implementation of guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) in patients with heart failure after a hospitalization. We aimed to evaluate the use and titration of GDMT at discharge and over a 12‐month period after hospital discharge and to identify factors associated with GDMT use and titration.

Methods and Results

The CONNECT‐HF (Care Optimization Through Patient and Hospital Engagement Clinical Trial for Heart Failure) trial evaluated the effect of a hospital and postdischarge quality improvement intervention in participants with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In this secondary analysis, we examined use and titration to at least 50% of the target dose of GDMTs at hospital discharge and over time. Among 4646 participants (mean age 63 years, 34% women), GDMT use did not numerically improve from discharge to 12 months: beta blockers (84%–78%), angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers/angiotensin receptor‐neprilysin inhibitors (73%–65%), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (39%–36%), and sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (1.5%–2.1%). Achieving ≥ 50% of the target dose also showed little change over 12 months: beta blockers (35%–32%), angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers/angiotensin receptor‐neprilysin inhibitors (28%–25%). For all medications, use of GDMT at discharge was associated with the use and achieving ≥ 50% of the target dose at 12 months.

Conclusions

Following a hospitalization for heart failure, GDMT use remained low and did not numerically improve over 12 months. Use of GDMT at discharge was significantly associated with the use of GDMT over time, highlighting the importance of initiating GDMT during hospitalization.

### Determinants of guideline-directed medical therapy implementation during heart Failure hospitalization [^fd6c52e4]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The etiologies of institutional inertia in GDMT optimization during hospitalization for HF are likely multifactorial but can be postulated to reflect those of the broader health care system. Our finding that implementation was significantly lower in patients experiencing homelessness than in those with home security suggests that there may have been concerns on the part of the provider about the availability of these patients for follow-up assessment, which is needed to ensure that changes in medical therapy are not associated with significant side effects. The reason for lower use of GDMT in Black patients is uncertain. The fact that the difference observed based on race was no longer significant when the mOMT was calculated without including the hydralazine/nitrate combination suggests that, despite a Class I recommendation in the AHA/ACC/HFSA guidelines, providers were not motivated to implement this therapy due to either unfamiliarity with the guideline recommendation for its use, limited prior experience with the combination, concerns about potential side effects, or patient reluctance to accept an additional drug. For the entire population, failure to implement GDMT might be due to similar reasons as well as provider reluctance to initiate and uptitrate multiple drugs while patients remain hospitalized. Although our data doesn't allow us to determine which of these possibilities were responsible for the low rate of implementation of GDMT in either specific cohorts or the study population at large, it does emphasize the need for a better understanding of the factors involved and the initiation of remedial approaches for their correction.

Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) — evidence scope and evaluation: There are no prospective RCTs for patients specifically with HFmrEF (LVEF, 41%–49%). Thus, it may be reasonable to treat these patients with GDMT used for treatment of HFrEF. Patients with HFmrEF should have repeat evaluation of LVEF to determine the trajectory of their disease process.

### Polypharmacy and guideline-directed medical therapy initiation among adults hospitalized with heart Failure [^9d92207c]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study from the geographically diverse REGARDS cohort is one of the first to describe the implications of polypharmacy on patterns of GDMT in adults with HFrEF/HFmrEF. We found that polypharmacy was inversely associated with GDMT initiation and that contraindications do not explain under-prescribing of GDMT. These findings have important implications given the prevalence of polypharmacy in older adults with HFrEF/HFmrEF.

Prior work has shown that polypharmacy is nearly universal in HFrEF/HFmrEF. In a study of older adults within the REGARDS cohort admitted with HF, 84% had polypharmacy (defined as at least 5 standing medications) and 42% had hyperpolypharmacy (defined as at least 10 standing medications). This is potentially problematic because polypharmacy is associated with an increased risk for adverse drug events, nonadherence, and treatment burden. Our findings identify another important negative effect of polypharmacy — GDMT underprescribing. Prior studies have shown that physicians report polypharmacy as a potential barrier to GDMT. Polypharmacy was reported as an important barrier to both beta-blocker initiation and uptitration in a survey among primary care providers. Our findings here quantify the negative impact of polypharmacy on GDMT prescribing — in particular, we found a graded reduction in the initiation of GDMT (when not present at admission and when no contraindications are present) with increasing medication count — those taking 5 to 9 medications (polypharmacy) were a third less likely to have an indicated medication initiated, and those taking at least 10 medications (hyperpolypharmacy) were nearly half as likely to have an indicated medication initiated compared to those taking < 5 medications. These findings extend recent observations from secondary analysis of the Guiding Evidence-Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure (GUIDE-IT) trial, which showed that polypharmacy was inversely associated with achieving optimal GDMT among ambulatory adults with HFrEF (mean age 61 years) over the span of 12 months. Together, these data support the need to develop strategies to combat polypharmacy as a barrier to GDMT. It is unknown whether involvement of a pharmacist in optimizing medication regimens could mitigate risks of polypharmacy, reduce unnecessary treatment burden, and/or address physician concerns about initiating medications for patients with an already high burden of medications.

Heart failure (HF) team-based care — essential skills and program roles are outlined, noting that necessary skills include proficiency in monitoring for HF progression and exacerbation, care coordination, treatment prescription and monitoring, and education for patients and their caregivers; Table 7 lists HF diagnosis and monitoring for progression; treatment prescription, titration, and monitoring; patient and caregiver education on disease and treatments; lifestyle prescription (eg, diet, exercise), education, and monitoring; access to genetic testing and counseling programs; psychological and social support assessment, treatment, and monitoring; palliative and end-of-life counseling and care; coordination of care for concomitant comorbidities; and nutritional counselling. Effective team-based HF care may be possible with small teams if the requisite skills are available. Referral of HFrEF patients to team-based HF medication optimization clinics focused on rapidly initiating and titrating quadruple guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) to target doses can minimize clinical inertia and capitalize on reductions in hospitalizations and mortality, and in one study patients with HFrEF receiving usual care were 3 times more likely to incur a HF hospitalization than patients managed in a medication optimization clinic.

### Optimizing foundational therapies in patients with HFrEF: how Do we translate these findings into clinical care? [^3825ce78]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Historical Consideration of Sequencing HFrEF Therapies

The historical paradigm in optimizing GDMT with all 4 drug classes of the foundational quadruple therapy is to prescribe them using the specific sequence that pivotal clinical trials used in testing them. Conventionally, this involves starting with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), followed by the add-on of a BB and then an MRA. If the patient remains symptomatic, an ARNI is introduced (switched from ACE inhibitor/ARB) before an SGLT2i is prescribed. Furthermore, the doses of each therapy are increased to the guideline-recommended dosing (defined as dose target in the pivotal clinical trial) or highest tolerated dose before initiating a new therapy. This traditional paradigm does not, however, take into account several important factors:1) most of the landmark clinical trials did not involve patients who were already on optimized dosing of baseline HFrEF therapies at randomization; 2) this sequential algorithm tacitly assumes that a combination of low-dose therapies will not yield additive benefits; 3) the successive process may require 6 to 12 months to completely incorporate all the recommended treatments; and 4) initiation of multiple therapies up-front, specifically ARNI and SGLT2i, rather than sequentially, may facilitate stabilization of potassium and kidney function to enable initiation of MRAs in the future.

Real-world data from prospective registries around the world suggest that health care providers infrequently add GDMT and do not titrate baseline HFrEF medication doses despite the absence of clinical contraindications or circumstances in which there are no system-level barriers (eg, coverage in the U.S. Veterans Affairs system). Indeed, across multiple global health systems and economies, near identical patterns of infrequent drug titration and early discontinuation of core elements of GDMT have been observed.

Use, Titration, and Medication Change Patterns of

The use of GDMT did not numerically improve from discharge to 12 months: evidence‐based beta blocker (84% to 78%), ACEi/ARB/ARNI (73% to 65%), MRA (39% to 36%), SGLT2i (1.5% to 2.1%), and hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate (30% to 33% for patients who were Black), respectively (Figure 1A). Similarly, achievement of ≥ 50% of the target dose for GDMT showed little change from discharge to 12 months: evidence‐based beta blocker (35% to 32%) and ACEi/ARB/ARNI (28% to 25%), respectively (Figure 1B). The proportion of participants with (1) no changes and never taking, (2) no changes and remaining on medication, (3) initiation or dose increases (escalation), and (4) discontinuation or dose decreases (deescalation) are shown in the Figure 2. At 12 months, proportions of escalation for evidence‐based beta blockers, ACEi/ARB/ARNI, MRA, SGLT2i, and hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate were 35%, 38%, 20%, 1.3%, and 18%, and corresponding proportions of deescalation were 20%, 18%, 13%, 1.0%, and 9%, respectively. Finally, the use of each class of GDMT at 12 months was substantially higher among patients discharged on the class of GDMT compared with those not discharged on it: evidence‐based beta blocker (87% versus 31%), ACEi/ARB/ARNI (79% versus 30%), MRA (69% versus 15%), and SGLT2i (67% versus 1.1%), respectively (Figure 3).

### Guideline-directed medical therapy after hospitalization for acute heart failure: insights from the CONNECT-HF [^0cee5f57]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this secondary analysis of the CONNECT‐HF trial spanning from the HF hospitalization phase to 1 year postdischarge, we examined medication change patterns over a year of follow‐up and assessed factors associated with the use, titration to at least 50% of the target dose, and the escalation and deescalation of GDMT. Unfortunately, medication initiation and dose changes remained low at all assessment periods to 12 months following discharge from a HF hospitalization. Notably, use of GDMT at discharge was strongly associated with use and achievement of ≥ 50% of the target dose of GDMT at 12 months. These findings underscore the crucial role of initiating each class of GDMT during hospitalization, aligning with the recommendations of current clinical practice guidelines.

The use and titration of GDMT remained largely unchanged, with only a few participants achieving even half of the target doses for GDMT. This observation aligns with findings from previous studies, highlighting the persistent challenges that hospitals and clinicians face when attempting to implement GDMT. However, the CONNECT‐HF trial involved a diverse group of participating health systems and included a large cohort of patients with a broad spectrum of health insurance coverage, spanning from the hospitalization phase to the outpatient setting. Although the trial tested a quality improvement intervention, with a focus on posthospital discharge, it did not appear to be successful in improving GDMT use and uptitration. One possible reason is that clinicians in the outpatient setting may have deferred to therapeutic inertia rather than adopting the use of clinical decision support tools embedded in electronic health records to provide quality feedback on GDMT metrics. Additionally, patients may not have expected further GDMT initiation or incremental dose increases as part of their outpatient care over time. Emphasizing the need for patient education regarding the importance of comprehensive GDMT and uptitration as well tolerated is warranted. Moreover, the disconnection between the myriad of clinicians involved in inpatient and outpatient care may contribute to gaps in GDMT implementation. To enhance the quality of care and overcome this stagnation, especially posthospital discharge, more resources and innovative approaches are necessary, such as leveraging electronic health records, polypill strategies, GDMT clinics, or adopting value‐based care models, though these strategies require further investigation.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy use in the STRONG-HF trial [^f80dd6ab]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Assessment of medication changes in heart failure trials and registries is complex and may not capture the entirety of care. A comprehensive and standardized method is needed. We used different methods to assess the use of guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT) and verified the association between GDMT intensity score with the STRONG-HF trial (Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Rapid Optimization, Helped by NT-proBNP Testing of Heart Failure Therapies) clinical outcomes.

Methods

We used data from the STRONG-HF trial to examine the baseline GDMT use for all randomized patients by applying the GDMT intensity score and evaluated its change over time. We also examined their basic adherence, indication-corrected adherence, and dose-corrected adherence, and the association with clinical outcomes up to 180 days.

Results

At 90 days, triple therapy indication-corrected use increased from 4.5% to 36% in the usual care group, and from 5.2% to 93.5% in the high-intensity care group (P < 0.001 between the 2 groups). Triple therapy dose-corrected use increased from 4.5% to 20.5% in the usual care group, and from 3.3% to 77.4% in the high-intensity care group (P < 0.001). The GDMT intensity score at baseline was < 6 in 358 (33%) patients, 6 to 7 in 329 (31%) patients, and > 7 in 386 (36%) patients. At 90 days, 88.4% of patients in the high-intensity arm achieved a score > 7 versus 14.3% in the usual care arm (P < 0.0001). The GDMT intensity score was correlated with clinical outcomes at 180 days.

Conclusions

The GDMT intensity score provides a comprehensive description of medication use by means of standardized measurements and is linked to clinical outcomes. Future studies should consider utilizing this as a trial end point.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy after hospitalization for acute heart failure: insights from the CONNECT-HF [^9a6f9b38]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Medication Data

The change in an opportunity‐based composite score for HF quality was a co‐primary outcome measure. The composite quality score evaluated the guideline‐based recommendations for quality of care provided, including the use and titration of GDMT. In this analysis, evidence‐based beta blockers, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)/ angiotensin receptor‐neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), and sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) were investigated. Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate were also investigated only for patients who were Black. Although SGLT2i were not included as standard GDMT during the trial period (ie, 2017–2020), we included SGLT2i in this analysis, given the current recommendations in the HF clinical practice guidelines. Patients who were eligible for each medication at baseline were assessed for the analysis of these medications. Consequently, those who had contraindications or intolerance to each medication at baseline were excluded from the analysis of that specific medication.

Additionally, we categorized medication change patterns into 4 categories for each medication: (1) no changes and never taking, (2) no changes and remaining on medication, (3) initiation or dose increases (escalation), and (4) discontinuation or dose decreases (deescalation). Escalation and deescalation were defined based on changes in medication when comparing doses at discharge and at 12 months. Escalation of ACEi/ARB/ARNI includes both the initiation or dose increase of ACEi/ARB/ARNI and conversion from ACEi/ARB to ARNI. Conversely, deescalation of ACEi/ARB/ARNI includes any discontinuation or dose decrease of ACEi/ARB/ARNI and conversion from ARNI to ACEi/ARB. Given that very few participants were on full target doses at baseline, we did not separate them from the "no changes and remaining on medication" group to maintain simplicity. Switching within a class was not considered a change in medications for the purposes of this analysis.

Importance

The Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Rapid Optimization, Helped by N-Terminal Pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide Testing of Heart Failure Therapies (STRONG-HF) trial strived for rapid uptitration aiming to reach 100% optimal doses of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) within 2 weeks after discharge from an acute heart failure (AHF) admission.

Objective

To assess the association between degree of GDMT doses achieved in high-intensity care and outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a post hoc secondary analysis of the STRONG-HF randomized clinical trial, conducted from May 2018 to September 2022. Included in the study were patients with AHF who were not treated with optimal doses of GDMT before and after discharge from an AHF admission. Data were analyzed from January to October 2023.

Interventions

The mean percentage of the doses of 3 classes of HF medications (renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, β-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) relative to their optimal doses was computed. Patients were classified into 3 dose categories: low (< 50%), medium (≥ 50% to < 90%), and high (≥ 90%). Dose and dose group were included as a time-dependent covariate in Cox regression models, which were used to test whether outcomes differed by dose.

Main Outcome Measures

Post hoc secondary analyses of postdischarge 180-day HF readmission or death and 90-day change in quality of life.

Results

A total of 515 patients (mean [SD] age, 62.7 [13.4] years; 311 male [60.4%]) assigned high-intensity care were included in this analysis. At 2 weeks, 39 patients (7.6%) achieved low doses, 254 patients (49.3%) achieved medium doses, and 222 patients (43.1%) achieved high doses. Patients with lower blood pressure and more congestion were less likely to be uptitrated to optimal GDMT doses at week 2. As a continuous time-dependent covariate, an increase of 10% in the average percentage optimal dose was associated with a reduction in 180-day HF readmission or all-cause death (primary end point: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98; P = 0.01) and a decrease in 180-day all-cause mortality (aHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.95; P = 0.007). Quality of life at 90 days, measured by the EQ-5D visual analog scale, improved more in patients treated with higher doses of GDMT (mean difference, 0.10; 95% CI, -4.88 to 5.07 and 3.13; 95% CI, -1.98 to 8.24 points in the medium- and high-dose groups relative to the low-dose group, respectively; P = 0.07). Adverse events to day 90 occurred less frequently in participants with HIC who were prescribed higher GDMT doses at week 2.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this post hoc analysis of the STRONG-HF randomized clinical trial show that, among patients randomly assigned to high-intensity care, achieving higher doses of HF GDMT 2 weeks after discharge was feasible and safe in most patients.

### A computable algorithm for medication optimization in heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction [^b586ea3b]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) optimization can improve outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to determine if a novel computable algorithm appropriately recommended GDMT.

Methods

Clinical trial data from the GUIDE-IT (Guiding Evidence-Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure) and HF-ACTION (Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training) trials were evaluated with a computable medication optimization algorithm that outputs GDMT recommendations and a medication optimization score (MOS). Algorithm-based recommendations were compared to medication changes. A Cox proportional-hazards model was used to estimate the associations between MOS and the composite primary end point for both trials.

Results

The algorithm recommended initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in 52.8%, 34.9%, and 68.1% of GUIDE-IT visits, respectively, when not prescribed the drug. Initiation only occurred in 20.8%, 56.9%, and 15.8% of subsequent visits. The algorithm also identified dose titration in 48.8% of visits for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blockers and 39.4% of visits for beta-blockers. Those increases only occurred in 24.3% and 36.8% of subsequent visits. A higher baseline MOS was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization (HR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.21–0.80; P = 0.009) in GUIDE-IT and all-cause death and hospitalization (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.44–0.84; P = 0.003) in HF-ACTION.

Conclusions

The algorithm accurately identified patients for GDMT optimization. Even in a clinical trial with robust protocols, GDMT could have been further optimized in a meaningful number of visits. The algorithm-generated MOS was associated with a lower risk of clinical outcomes. Implementation into clinical care may identify and address suboptimal GDMT in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
