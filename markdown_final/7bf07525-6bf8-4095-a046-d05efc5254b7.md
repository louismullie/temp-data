## Question

Is etanercept appropriate for acute bacterial cellulitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking if etanercept is appropriate for acute bacterial cellulitis and, if not, the rationale and appropriate alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what cellulitis is pathophysiologically and how it is normally treated. Then, I should verify etanercept's mechanism, labeled indications, and infection warnings. Next, I will review infectious disease guidelines for cellulitis therapy and check for any role — if any — for TNF inhibitors. After that, I should examine evidence linking TNF blockade to cellulitis risk and any case reports. Finally, I will synthesize whether etanercept is appropriate, consider safety, and outline correct treatment and practical management steps, especially if a patient on etanercept develops cellulitis.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem. Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, most commonly due to streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus, and standard care targets bacterial eradication with antibiotics rather than immunosuppression, so I need to ensure I'm not conflating inflammatory mimickers with true infection [^117YVujD] [^116bYVTv] [^111zAoE9].

> I need to check etanercept's pharmacology and labeling. Etanercept is a soluble TNF-α receptor fusion protein that neutralizes TNF-α, indicated for autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, and plaque psoriasis; it is an immunosuppressant with no antibacterial activity, and its FDA labeling carries boxed warnings for serious infections, advising extreme caution in patients with chronic or recurrent infections, which immediately raises concern in the setting of an active bacterial cellulitis [^112p9GaR] [^112Pgf56] [^1121tctH] [^113TmtTX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify what the infectious disease guidelines actually recommend for cellulitis. The IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline recommends empiric antibiotics active against streptococci for nonpurulent cases, MRSA-active agents when specific risk factors are present, and broad-spectrum combination therapy, such as vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem, for severe infections, with typical durations around 5–6 days for uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis per ACP best-practice advice, and there is no role for TNF inhibitors as treatment for cellulitis in these guidelines [^116aZEV3] [^111zAoE9] [^113PjKu3] [^111gsSaf].

> Next, I should review safety data around TNF inhibitors and infections to ensure I'm not missing any exception. The etanercept label highlights increased risk of serious infections including bacterial sepsis and opportunistic infections; similarly, other TNF inhibitors like infliximab have documented higher serious infection rates including cellulitis, and concomitant biologic therapy such as anakinra with etanercept further raises serious infection risk, so initiating or continuing etanercept during an active bacterial cellulitis seems unsafe [^1121tctH] [^112Pgf56] [^1145eCXX] [^1179QRo1].

> I will now examine clinical evidence linking TNF blockade specifically to cellulitis. Case reports describe cellulitis occurring in patients on etanercept, such as Streptococcus canis cellulitis with bacteremia, and orbital cellulitis has been reported with infliximab; observational dermatology registries also associate TNF inhibitors with increased serious infection risk, and pediatric reports include infection-related deaths with anti–TNF-α agents, underscoring that these drugs can predispose to severe bacterial skin infections rather than treat them [^115vwjsb] [^117SbuPF] [^111Qo7SW] [^116CbaPh].

> But wait, what if one argues that suppressing inflammation with etanercept could reduce the redness and pain of cellulitis while antibiotics work in the background. Hmm, wait a minute — this would be a mechanistic mismatch because TNF blockade does not eradicate bacteria and may impair host defense, potentially worsening infection control; moreover, guidelines and labels provide no therapeutic rationale for adding TNF inhibition in acute bacterial cellulitis and instead warn about infection risks, so that line of thinking is not supported and I should not pursue it further [^111zAoE9] [^1121tctH].

> Let me now compare to appropriate alternatives to anchor the recommendation. For uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis, use antibiotics active against streptococci for 5–6 days when the patient can be closely followed; for purulent cellulitis or MRSA risk, choose agents active against MRSA and streptococci; for severe presentations, use vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem, and in ABSSSI settings, agents such as ceftaroline or delafloxacin have supportive FDA trial data, all of which align with antimicrobial therapy rather than immunosuppression [^116aZEV3] [^111gsSaf] [^113PjKu3] [^112VTmrB] [^111AUgcc] [^117NYyTq].

> I should double-check practical steps if the patient is already on etanercept and develops cellulitis. The prudent, label-consistent approach is to avoid starting or to hold etanercept during active infection, treat the cellulitis appropriately with antibiotics per guideline risk stratification, and only consider resuming etanercept after complete infection resolution and clinical stability, given the boxed infection warning and the absence of any role for TNF inhibitors in cellulitis therapy [^1121tctH] [^111zAoE9].

> Synthesis and conclusion: There is no evidence supporting etanercept for acute bacterial cellulitis; mechanistically it is an immunosuppressant without antibacterial activity, guidelines recommend antibiotics exclusively, and TNF inhibitors increase infection risk, including cellulitis, so etanercept is not appropriate and should be avoided or held during active infection while standard antibiotic therapy is administered [^1121tctH] [^111zAoE9] [^116aZEV3] [^111gsSaf].

---

No, etanercept is **not recommended** for acute bacterial cellulitis because it suppresses TNF-α [^114BrGjD], a cytokine essential for bacterial clearance, and increases the risk of serious infections [^1121tctH]. There is no evidence supporting its use in cellulitis, and it is **contraindicated in active infections**. Standard care is prompt empiric antibiotics with streptococcal and staphylococcal coverage [^116aZEV3], adding MRSA coverage when indicated [^111zAoE9]. Etanercept should be withheld during active infection and only resumed after full clinical resolution.

---

## Mechanism of action and immunological considerations

Etanercept is a recombinant fusion protein that **binds TNF-α** [^114BrGjD], a cytokine central to host defense against bacteria. TNF-α drives neutrophil recruitment, macrophage activation, and granuloma formation [^114BrGjD]; its blockade impairs bacterial clearance and increases infection risk [^1121tctH].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines regarding etanercept in cellulitis

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting etanercept for acute bacterial cellulitis. Major guidelines (IDSA, ACP) do not mention or recommend etanercept for cellulitis [^111zAoE9]; instead, they emphasize prompt empiric antibiotics covering streptococci and staphylococci, with MRSA coverage when risk factors are present [^116aZEV3].

---

## Risks and adverse effects associated with etanercept in cellulitis

Etanercept carries a **boxed warning** [^1121tctH] for serious infections, including bacterial sepsis, tuberculosis, and opportunistic infections. In cellulitis, TNF-α inhibition can worsen infection, delay resolution, and increase complications such as abscess, necrosis, or sepsis. Common adverse effects include injection site reactions, upper respiratory infections, and skin rash [^113TmtTX]; **serious infections** and rare severe cutaneous reactions (e.g. **Stevens-Johnson syndrome**) [^113yR5Zx] have also been reported.

---

## Clinical scenarios where etanercept may be considered

Etanercept is **not indicated for acute bacterial cellulitis** [^112p9GaR]. It is used for chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis) [^112p9GaR] and should be withheld during active infection, including cellulitis, resuming only after full clinical resolution [^1121tctH].

---

## Comparison with standard antibiotic therapies

Standard antibiotics are the cornerstone of cellulitis care and are highly effective and safe when appropriately selected and monitored [^111zAoE9]. Etanercept lacks antibacterial activity and is **not a substitute for antibiotics**; its use in active infection is contraindicated because of increased infection risk.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines and expert opinion uniformly **recommend against etanercept in acute bacterial cellulitis**. Management should focus on accurate diagnosis, prompt empiric antibiotics, and close monitoring of clinical response [^111gsSaf].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Etanercept is **not recommended for acute bacterial cellulitis** because of increased infection risk [^1121tctH] and lack of evidence of benefit. Management should prioritize prompt empiric antibiotics [^116aZEV3] and withholding etanercept during active infection, with resumption only after full clinical resolution.

### Cellulitis and erysipelas [^117YVujD]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common problem, caused by spreading bacterial inflammation of the skin, with redness, pain, and lymphangitis. Up to 40% of affected people have systemic illness. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis with marked superficial inflammation, typically affecting the lower limbs and the face. The most common pathogens in adults are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Cellulitis and erysipelas can result in local necrosis and abscess formation. Around a quarter of affected people have more than one episode of cellulitis within 3 years.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for cellulitis and erysipelas? What are the effects of treatments to prevent recurrence of cellulitis and erysipelas? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics and comparative effects of different antibiotics.

### True abscess formation is rare in bacterial orbital cellulitis; consequences for treatment [^111ox63U]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2016). Low credibility.

Pre- or retroseptal bacterial orbital cellulitis (pOC/rOC) is not an uncommon orbital disease. Treatment consists of antibiotics with or without surgical drainage. Several questions regarding the course, complications, and outcomes of treatment remain unanswered, and the indication for surgery is not well defined. The aim of this study is to describe the outcome of orbital cellulitis (OC) in a large cohort, assess the significance of Chandler's classification, assess the incidence of abscess formation in OC, and redefine criteria for surgery.

- **Methods**: Retrospective case series of patients with OC seen between January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2014, in a tertiary referral center.

- **Results**: Sixty-eight patients presented with (presumed) bacterial pOC. Two out of these 68 developed rOC, and all 68 patients had a full recovery. Forty-eight patients presented with rOC. Four out of 48 (8%) had intracranial extension of the infection at the time of admission. No admitted patient developed distant seeding. Only four (8%) patients with rOC had a true orbital abscess, while in the remaining 92% we found a diffuse orbital inflammation or a subperiosteal empyema. Forty-four (92%) patients with rOC had a full recovery.

- **Conclusions**: The prognosis of both pOC and rOC nowadays is generally favorable. Chandler's classification is of little use. True abscess formation in OC is rare. The indication for surgical intervention must be based on the clinical presentation and the assessment of true orbital abscess formation.

### Common bacterial skin infections [^113Mk8Jr]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Family physicians frequently treat bacterial skin infections in both the office and hospital settings. Common skin infections include cellulitis, erysipelas, impetigo, folliculitis, and furuncles and carbuncles.

- **Cellulitis**: An infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue characterized by poorly demarcated borders. It is usually caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus species.

- **Erysipelas**: A superficial form of cellulitis with sharply demarcated borders, caused almost exclusively by Streptococcus.

- **Impetigo**: This condition is also caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus and can lead to the lifting of the stratum corneum, resulting in the commonly seen bullous effect.

- **Folliculitis**: An inflammation of the hair follicles that is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus when the infection is bacterial rather than mechanical. If the infection is deeper and involves more follicles, it progresses to the furuncle and carbuncle stages, usually requiring incision and drainage.

All of these infections are typically diagnosed by clinical presentation and treated empirically. If antibiotics are required, those active against gram-positive organisms, such as penicillinase-resistant penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones, should be chosen. Children, patients with diabetes, or patients with immunodeficiencies are more susceptible to gram-negative infections and may require treatment with a second- or third-generation cephalosporin.

### Limited evidence for diagnosing bacterial skin infections in older adults in primary care: Systematic review [^113Yu8My]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Life expectancy is increasing, resulting in a growing population of older people. Individuals aged over 65 years make up approximately one-sixth of the population but account for one in three outpatient attendances. Due to a combination of factors, including immunosenescence, which is age-related immune dysfunction and inability to mount an adequate response to pathogenic insults, and age-related thinning of the skin, older adults are more susceptible to bacterial infections. Soft tissue and skin infections, such as cellulitis, are common in older adults. If these conditions are not treated promptly, sepsis may ensue. Each year in the United Kingdom (UK), there are 150,000 cases of sepsis, causing 44,000 deaths.

Cellulitis is the fourth leading cause of emergency hospital admissions in the UK for acute ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs), which are conditions that could effectively be managed in the community. Emergency hospital admissions for patients over the age of 65 years with ACSCs are on the rise. The reasons for the escalation in hospital admissions of older patients with these conditions are not clear. However, bacterial infections frequently present atypically in older adults, which can create a diagnostic conundrum for clinicians. Symptoms and signs typically associated with bacterial infections in younger adults, such as fever, might be absent in older people. Poor vascular supply, more common in old age, can reduce the signs and symptoms of erythema, warmth, and tenderness that are typically associated with bacterial skin infections.

### Authors' reply [^111K7CUN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

We appreciate the comments of Dr. Basyigit on our recent study showing that antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients can reduce recurrence of cellulitis mainly caused by gram-negative bacteria. Dr. Basyigit is concern regarding the increased gram-negative cellulitis found in our cirrhotic patients is based on a recent study that reported gram-positive bacteria as a common cause of cellulitis in the general population, and not particularly in cirrhotics. To support our findings, relevant literature has already been cited.

In a position statement based on the EASL special conference 2013, the role of bacterial translocation as a cause of infection in cirrhotic patients has clearly been pointed out. Dr. Basyigit posed the possibility that drug-resistant bacteria might emerge with the use of antibiotic prophylaxis. Though this might be true, antibiotic prophylaxis is still being used to prevent conditions such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, thereby reducing mortality.

Finally, Dr. Basyigit claimed that antibiotic prophylaxis will lead to resistant microorganisms rather than preventing skin infection. We strongly oppose this view because bacterial infection increases 3.75-fold the mortality of patients with decompensated cirrhosis, reaching a rate of 30% at 1 month and 63% at 1 year. If we can prevent the recurrence of bacterial cellulitis in cirrhotic patients as we have shown in our study, it might help reduce mortality. However, since we have not examined the benefit of cellulitis recurrence prevention on the mortality of cirrhotic patients, further studies are warranted to elucidate this aspect.

### Infliximab in hidradenitis suppurativa: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111hUL78]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Our findings support previous systematic reviews examining the efficacy of infliximab in HS. Haslund et al. reported an 87% response rate in 52 patients (20 studies), van Rappard et al. reported an 82% response rate in 114 patients (43 studies), and Blok et al. reported an 89% response rate in 147 patients (42 studies). Our study adds to the literature by providing an updated systematic review, including studies from the past decade, excluding case reports and series with fewer than five patients, and performing a meta‐analysis of the included studies. With over 300 patients included in this meta‐analysis, there is stronger evidence to support this high response rate for infliximab. We also examined reported side effects in this HS patient population and found them to be in line with the expected side effect profile for infliximab.

- **Limitations of this study**: Common to most systematic reviews on HS treatments, include the small number of prospective studies on infliximab in HS. All but one study took place in North America or Europe, potentially limiting the generalizability of our findings. Another limitation is the inability to compare response rates based on the presence of different comorbidities. Furthermore, substantial heterogeneity existed between studies with respect to study design, timing, and methods for outcome measurement. Thus, caution is warranted when attempting to directly compare the efficacy rate found in this review with that of other HS treatment options.

Future studies on the efficacy of infliximab in HS should include larger RCTs with more diverse study populations.

### Teflaro [^112VTmrB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients with a lesion size of ≥ 75 cm² and having one of the following infection types:

- **Major abscess**: With ≥ 5 cm of surrounding erythema.
- **Wound infection**: Accompanied by significant symptoms.
- **Deep/extensive cellulitis**: Requiring intervention.

The results of this analysis are informed by protocol-specified analyses, which included clinical cure rates at the test of cure (TOC) visit — conducted 8 to 15 days after the end of therapy — in the co-primary clinically evaluable (CE) and modified intent-to-treat (MITT) populations. Furthermore, clinical cure rates at TOC by pathogen were assessed in the microbiologically evaluable (ME) population. However, there are insufficient historical data to establish the magnitude of drug effect for antibacterial drugs compared with placebo at a TOC time point. Therefore, comparisons of Teflaro to vancomycin plus aztreonam based on clinical response rates at TOC cannot be utilized to establish non-inferiority.

Of the 693 patients in the MITT population in the Teflaro arm in the two acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) trials, 20 patients had baseline S. aureus bacteremia (nine with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and eleven with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA)). Thirteen of these twenty patients (65%) were clinical responders for ABSSSI at study day 3, and 18 out of 20 (90%) were considered clinical successes for ABSSSI at TOC.

The ABSSSI pediatric trial was a randomized, parallel-group active-controlled trial involving pediatric patients aged 2 months to less than 18 years.

### The inflation reduction act and etanercept [^115EJgWb]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

The CMS report notes that the manufacturer submitted study findings supporting etanercept's economic value, with etanercept reportedly having the lowest cost per effectively treated rheumatoid arthritis patient compared to therapeutic alternatives. Comparing clinical costs of etanercept and three therapeutic alternatives — infliximab and adalimumab (each is a TNFi) and abatacept (an inhibitor of the interaction between CD80/CD86 and CD28 on T cells) — one submitted study found that etanercept had the greatest effectiveness and lowest cost per effectively treated Medicare patient. That study reported adalimumab as being 114% more costly than etanercept for patients with rheumatoid arthritis on Medicaid.

One analysis of U.S. commercial claims found that etanercept had a lower cost per effectively treated patient compared to adalimumab, making it one of the most cost‐effective options in comparison to conventional DMARDs. In 2026, etanercept is projected to have a lower annual Medicare Part D cost compared to other therapeutic TNFi equivalents and JAK inhibitors:

- **Therapeutic TNFi equivalents**: abatacept ($174,090), adalimumab ($154,540), certolizumab pegol ($236,743), golimumab ($140,651), infliximab ($185,369)
- **JAK inhibitor**: tofacitinib ($130,501)

Etanercept's annual projected cost is $94,821, which is lower than those of the alternatives listed.

Other analyses reportedly found that persons starting etanercept as their first biologic tended to be more persistent and switched less, suggesting improved outcomes and avoiding additional costs, disruptions, and side effects associated with switching. Among persistent patients and those who switch, patients who started with etanercept…

### Renflexis [^111jKage]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

During the placebo-controlled portion across the three clinical trials up to Week 16, the proportion of patients who experienced at least one serious adverse reaction (SAE; defined as resulting in death, life-threatening, requiring hospitalization, or causing persistent or significant disability/incapacity) was 0.5% in the 3 mg/kg infliximab group, 1.9% in the placebo group, and 1.6% in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group.

Among patients in the two Phase 3 studies:

- **Study I**: 12.4% of patients receiving infliximab 5 mg/kg every eight weeks through one year of maintenance treatment experienced at least one SAE.

- **Study II**: 4.1% and 4.7% of patients receiving infliximab 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg every eight weeks, respectively, through one year of maintenance treatment experienced at least one SAE. One death due to bacterial sepsis occurred 25 days after the second infusion of 5 mg/kg infliximab. Serious infections included sepsis and abscesses.

- **Serious infections (Study I)**: 2.7% of patients receiving infliximab 5 mg/kg every eight weeks through one year of maintenance treatment experienced at least one serious infection.

- **Serious infections (Study II)**: 1.0% and 1.3% of patients receiving infliximab 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, through one year of treatment experienced at least one serious infection. The most common serious infection requiring hospitalization was an abscess (skin, throat, and peri-rectal) reported by five (0.7%) patients in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group.

Two active cases of tuberculosis were reported: six weeks and 34 weeks after starting infliximab.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^111CRrQw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant healthcare costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis play an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

- **Objective**: We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

- **Discussion**: Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision-making to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

- **Conclusions**: Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis, need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

### Baxdela [^111AUgcc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

In Trial 2, 423 patients were randomized to Baxdela, and 427 patients were randomized to vancomycin plus aztreonam. Patients had the following infections: cellulitis (48%), wound infection (26%), major cutaneous abscess (25%), and burn infection (1%). The overall mean surface area of the infected lesion, as measured by digital planimetry, was 353 cm². The average age of patients was 51 years (range 18 to 93 years). The cohort was predominately male (63%) and white (83%); 50% had a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m².

The population studied in Trial 2 included patients with associated comorbidities such as hypertension (31%), diabetes (13%), and renal impairment (16%; including 0.2% with severe renal impairment or ESRD). Recent history of drug abuse, including IV drug abuse, was reported by 30% of patients. Bacteremia was documented at baseline in 2% of patients.

- **Objective clinical response**: In both trials, objective clinical response at 48 to 72 hours post-initiation of treatment was defined as a 20% or greater decrease in lesion size as determined by digital planimetry of the leading edge of erythema. Table 7 summarizes the objective clinical response rates in both of these trials.

- **Investigator assessment**: In both trials, an investigator assessment of response was made at follow-up (Day 14 ± 1) in the ITT and CE populations. Success was defined as "cure + improved", where patients had complete or near resolution of signs and symptoms, with no further antibacterial needed. The success rates in the ITT and CE populations are shown in Table 8.

Six delafloxacin patients had baseline S. aureus bacteremia with ABSSSI.

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^115fP7Gu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

In this prospective study of cellulitis, several nonpharmacological factors were associated with a lack of early response. Such early nonresponse was rarely related to inappropriate therapy but was strongly predictive of early treatment escalation, suggesting that broadening antibiotic treatment often may be premature.

### New treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum and hidradenitis suppurativa: A review [^114BrGjD]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Biologics**:

	- **TNF inhibitors**: TNF‐α plays a pivotal role as a multifaceted proinflammatory cytokine, enhancing the activity of IL‐1β, IL‐6, and IL‐8. This, in turn, draws neutrophils and collaborates with TNF‐α itself to intensify the inflammatory state. Therapeutics like infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab have gained global utilization. Notably, etanercept targets only the soluble form of TNF‐α, whereas infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab engage both soluble and membrane‐bound TNF‐α forms, prompting the apoptosis of cells expressing TNF‐α. Distinctively, certolizumab, lacking an Fc domain, is unable to trigger apoptosis or induce complement‐dependent or antibody‐dependent cell‐mediated cytotoxicity.

- **Pyoderma gangrenosum**: Elevated levels of TNF‐α and its receptors have been observed in PG‐afflicted skin. A burgeoning body of evidence advocates for the prioritization of TNF‐α inhibitors, especially infliximab and adalimumab, as primary treatment modalities. The effectiveness of infliximab in addressing PG has been validated in a randomized, double‐blinded controlled trial. Furthermore, anti‐TNF‐α inhibitors present as viable alternatives to mitigate the prolonged adverse effects associated with corticosteroids and cyclosporine.

- **Hidradenitis suppurativa**: TNF‐α is believed to be at the forefront of driving the inflammatory cascade. Notably, its concentration in both serum and HS‐affected skin is markedly elevated compared to healthy individuals, coinciding with raised levels of IL‐1β, IL‐10, and IL‐1.

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^114FkQR8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Longer duration of symptoms before admission was among the factors related to early response. This association, to our knowledge, has not been previously demonstrated. Like the response seen after non-antibiotic treatment, this may be related to the natural course of the disease; many of those with longer duration may have passed the maximum intensity of infection and inflammation.

The impact of treatment choice on early response was demonstrated as early as the 1930s. However, recent clinical trials using early clinical response as the primary endpoint have not demonstrated significant differences between the drugs tested, apart from a difference in early response found in a study assessing this new outcome measure retrospectively. In our study, discordant treatment was infrequent due to the predominance of streptococcal etiology and rare resistance among these microbes. We found no correlation between discordant treatment and early non-response, but the effective sample size was small. Nonetheless, antibiotic choice may be important beyond its relation to in vitro sensitivity. A recent retrospective study demonstrating an association between early clinical response and higher vancomycin trough concentration illustrates that drug-specific factors are also important for early response. The paucity of reports showing significant associations between initial treatment and early response underscores that in cellulitis, discordant therapy or other pharmacological factors are not the major causes of early failure.

The relatively high frequency of treatment escalation in the pr

### Systemic therapy for psoriasis and the risk of cutaneous infections [^1173bMR9]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Bacterial infection**: Cutaneous bacterial infection occurred in 12 patients (1.37%). Cellulitis was the most common (8 out of 12 cases, 67%), followed by one case each of abscess, erythrasma, folliculitis, and infected epidermal cysts (1 out of 12 cases, 8.3%).

Univariate analysis revealed that in cutaneous bacterial infections, patients with pustular psoriasis and systemic treatment had a significantly higher odds ratio (OR) of 4.25 (95% confidence interval, 1.123–16.09) than those with other psoriasis phenotypes. Among systemic treatments, bacterial infections were more frequent in users of TNF‐α and IL‐17 inhibitors. Multivariate analysis revealed that cutaneous bacterial infections were frequently observed in patients treated with TNF‐α (OR 9.917, 95% CI, 2.069–47.572, p = 0.004) and IL‐17 (OR 10.798, 95% CI, 2.35–49.616, p = 0.002) inhibitors. Cellulitis alone, the most frequently occurring infection, showed results similar to those of the analysis of all bacterial infections.

### One health and Streptococcus canis in the emergency department: A case of cellulitis and bacteremia in an immunocompromised patient treated with Etanercept [^115vwjsb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

One Health is a biomedical approach that aims to optimize the health of humans, animals, and the environment through interdisciplinary collaboration. Cellulitis is an infection of the dermis and subcutaneous fat that may be caused by zoonotic streptococci species.

- **Case report**: We report a case of cellulitis caused by Streptococcus canis in a woman who was taking Etanercept. We frame the presentation within a One Health approach and urge emergency physicians to collaborate with veterinarians in the management of patients with zoonotic diseases who are discharged home.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: Pets are a source of zoonotic diseases, including resistant bacteria, that pose particular risks to immunocompromised patients. Emergency physicians often discharge patients with potential zoonotic infections, such as cellulitis, home without a long-term, holistic care plan according to a One Health approach. Physicians should then collaborate with veterinarians in caring for humans and animals.

### Likmez [^1162RgBo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients to report the use of any other medications while taking Likmez. The administration of any of the following drugs with Likmez may result in clinically significant adverse reactions or reduced effectiveness of the drug [see Contraindications (4.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1 to 7.7)]: disulfiram, warfarin and other oral anticoagulants, lithium, busulfan, cimetidine, phenytoin and phenobarbital.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including Likmez, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When Likmez is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that, although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Likmez or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### The effect of methotrexate on tumour necrosis factor concentrations in etanercept-treated rheumatoid arthritis patients [^112yNEBe]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Recently, we demonstrated that early low concentrations of circulating, adalimumab-bound TNF in RA patients treated with adalimumab were associated with future anti-drug antibody formation. Furthermore, low TNF was associated with less frequent baseline MTX use. This is remarkable because of the anti-inflammatory effects of MTX and a potential inhibiting effect on cytokine production. We hypothesized an indirect effect of non-MTX use on low TNF concentrations via immunogenicity. To investigate the effect of MTX on TNF concentrations independent of anti-drug antibody formation, we measured TNF in RA patients treated with etanercept, a drug with low immunogenicity.

- **Methods**: TNF was quantified in 186 consecutive etanercept-treated RA patients at baseline and at weeks 4, 16, and 28. The dynamics of TNF during etanercept treatment were compared with dynamics recently published for adalimumab.

- **Results**: We demonstrated that TNF concentrations at week 4 did not associate with baseline MTX or remission after 28 weeks. Furthermore, median (interquartile range) TNF increased from < 112 (< 112- < 112) pg/ml at baseline to 548 (344–688) pg/ml at week 4 and remained stable at week 16 and 28 [598 (442–756) and 568 (444–755) pg/ml, respectively].

- **Conclusion**: Circulating TNF did not associate with MTX usage in etanercept-treated patients. This implies that MTX does not have a direct effect on TNF concentrations in circulation and that the association between early low TNF and non-use of MTX for adalimumab is thus most likely due to anti-drug antibody formation.

### Systemic and localized extra-central nervous system bacterial infections and the risk of dementia among US veterans: A retrospective cohort study [^113gBL2j]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2016). Low credibility.

We used subcohorts of individuals whose first infection was or included urinary tract infection (UTI) or cellulitis, along with controls, to conduct several sensitivity analyses. First, we determined the impact of other concurrent or subsequent extra-CNS bacterial infections on the UTI and cellulitis-associated risk for dementia, separately. Results showed that both UTI and cellulitis significantly increased the risk for dementia even after adjustment for potential confounders and other concurrent or subsequent extra-CNS bacterial infections, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44–1.60) and 1.28 (95% CI: 1.21–1.34), respectively.

Second, we examined the associations between recurrent UTIs and cellulitis with the risk for dementia. Infections were considered recurrent if they occurred more than 60 days after the previous infection. After adjusting for potential confounders, results indicated that the risk for dementia increased significantly with an increasing number of UTI and cellulitis episodes, with HR of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.16–1.20) and 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01–1.06), respectively.

### Infection-related death among persons with refractory juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^116CbaPh]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Monitoring the safety and reporting the side effects, including severe infections and deaths, of new biological DMARDs is a priority of national and international patient registries and multicenter, international collaborative research consortiums. These include the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance, Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation, Pediatric Rheumatology Collaborative Study Group, and Single Hub and Access Point of Care for Pediatric Rheumatic Diseases in Europe. However, reporting of deaths is still inconsistent.

In children with JIA treated with multiple DMARDs alongside anti–TNF-α biologicals, a systematic review from 2013 reported four deaths, three of which were associated with severe infections: two treated with etanercept (group A Streptococcus–related purpura fulminans) and one with adalimumab (bacterial sepsis); for one treated with infliximab, the infection cause was not given.

However, Hashkes et al. commented on six deaths, all in children treated with combined DMARDs, including anti–TNF-α agents, and associated with serious infections: three treated with etanercept (one each with suspected sepsis, MAS, and tuberculosis [previously treated with infliximab]); two with infliximab (sepsis); and one with adalimumab (MAS and interstitial pneumonia).

Furthermore, neither Woerner and Ritz nor Swart et al. referred to severe infections and infection-related deaths associated with biological DMARDs from two clinical trials reported in 2012. Six deaths were reported in trials of the anti–IL-6 agent tocilizumab, including one each from probable streptococcal sepsis.

### Spontaneous Escherichia coli cellulitis in a child with nephrotic syndrome [^116Ndkvf]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is the most common infectious complication of childhood nephrotic syndrome, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the predominant bacterial pathogen. Spontaneous bacterial cellulitis, particularly of the lower extremities, is another frequent infection in this patient group, as chronic edema serves as a potential culture medium. Gram-positive bacteria, including streptococci and staphylococci, are the most common causes of bacterial cellulitis. We report a case of spontaneous Escherichia coli cellulitis in a patient with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome.

### Orbital cellulitis in a patient receiving infliximab for ankylosing spondylitis [^117SbuPF]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to describe a case of orbital cellulitis arising in a patient treated with an anti-TNFalpha agent. This is a single interventional case report.

A 42-year-old man developed severe unilateral orbital cellulitis while receiving infliximab (Remicade, Centocor) treatment for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) as part of the open-label phase of a trial conducted at our tertiary referral center. Cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus.

Infliximab treatment was stopped, and the patient made a full recovery after receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy. Infliximab therapy was resumed after three weeks.

Clinical vigilance is warranted when treating patients with anti-TNFalpha agents, as these are associated with a diverse and growing number of ophthalmic complications. Resolved infection does not preclude the use of such agents.

### Cellulitis and erysipelas: Prevention [^116LAGsJ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common problem caused by spreading bacterial inflammation of the skin, characterized by redness, pain, and lymphangitis. Up to 40% of affected individuals experience systemic illness. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis with marked superficial inflammation, typically affecting the lower limbs and the face. The most common pathogens in adults are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Cellulitis and erysipelas can lead to local necrosis and abscess formation. Approximately one quarter of affected individuals experience more than one episode of cellulitis within three years.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic overview with the aim of answering the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments to prevent recurrence of cellulitis and erysipelas? Our search included Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other significant databases up to February 2015. Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically, so please check our website for the most current version of this overview.

- **Results**: At this update, searching electronic databases retrieved 323 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 184 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 170 studies and the further review of 14 full publications. Of the 14 full articles evaluated, one systematic review was added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for one PICO combination.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic overview, we categorized the efficacy of two interventions based on available information regarding their effectiveness and safety.

### Localized eosinophilic cellulitis treated with topical ruxolitinib: A case report [^1125kqeZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic cellulitis, also known as Wells syndrome, is a rare inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology. It often presents with episodes of pruritus, erythema, and edema that can mimic bacterial cellulitis or autoimmune blistering disorders. Skin biopsy typically demonstrates an abundance of eosinophils, sometimes forming characteristic "flame figures" of eosin-staining granules around collagen. The natural course of eosinophilic cellulitis is unpredictable but can progress through acute, subacute, and chronic phases. Eosinophilic cellulitis is challenging to diagnose and treat.

Standard treatment for eosinophilic cellulitis often includes systemic corticosteroids; however, relapse is common and side effects limit prolonged use. More recently, the use of systemic Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors has been studied to treat eosinophilic cellulitis. This case describes successful management of localized eosinophilic cellulitis with topical ruxolitinib cream.

### Risk factors of cellulitis in cirrhosis and antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing recurrence [^112mK4g8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Our study has certain strengths and limitations. This is the first study to assess the role of antibiotics in preventing the recurrence of cellulitis in cirrhosis and is one of the very few case-control studies that looked into the risk factors for cellulitis in cirrhotic patients. The study has demonstrated the novel finding that antibiotic prophylaxis is useful in preventing the recurrence of cellulitis. This finding has important clinical implications because it may help to reduce repeated hospital admissions in these patients.

The limitation of the study is that, as the data are collected from inpatients of a tertiary care center, the sample may not exactly represent the general population of cirrhotic patients. The number of patients in group 2 in the follow-up phase was lower. Since most of the patients had indications for the initiation of SBP prophylaxis (primary or secondary prophylaxis) based on AASLD recommendations, we were bound to start antibiotics. Also, many patients had HE, for which antibiotics were needed. Thus, patients in the non-prophylactic group became fewer in number. Even though the number is small, the statistical significance suggests that the association is relevant. Another limitation of our study is that we could not retrieve the data regarding antibiotic exposure prior to the development of cellulitis.

In conclusion, our study demonstrated that hypoalbuminemia and a high MELD score are the risk factors for cellulitis in cirrhosis. Antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with cellulitis will help prevent the recurrence of cellulitis.

### Efficacy, effectiveness and safety of etanercept in monotherapy for refractory psoriatic arthritis: a 26-week observational study [^116pzxNh]. Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

To investigate the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of etanercept, a soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor, a prospective observational cohort of patients with refractory psoriatic arthritis and polyarticular involvement was studied.

Twenty patients with psoriatic arthritis refractory to conventional anti-rheumatic drugs received etanercept 25 mg subcutaneously twice a week for 26 weeks. Efficacy and safety were recorded at weeks 2, 6, 10, 16, 20, and 26. Effectiveness, defined as clinical remission, reduction of 50% in clinical parameters, and reduced concomitant NSAID use, was evaluated at 26 weeks.

Etanercept therapy proved efficacious in this cohort, with 85% of the patients meeting the Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criterion at week 26. Effectiveness was further demonstrated as at least 50% of the patients had a 90% improvement in swollen joint count, an 85% improvement in tender joint count, and a 71% improvement in the Health Assessment Questionnaire by week 26. Four patients showed complete remission, and NSAID use was discontinued in 10 out of 15 patients. The most common adverse events were upper respiratory tract infections. Interestingly, psoriasis worsened in two patients during the study, although this was unrelated to the course of arthritis. Etanercept administration was interrupted in three patients due to adverse events: one case each of septic bursitis, myocardial infarction, and tooth abscess. After resolution of these adverse events, etanercept was successfully reintroduced.

Etanercept monotherapy is efficacious and effective in managing refractory psoriatic arthritis, although it may be associated with certain adverse events.

### Severe bacterial infections of the skin: Uncommon presentations [^116eCE3n]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Although most bacterial infections of the skin prove to be minor in nature, a few such dermatologic entities are significant, to the point of even being fatal. Their course can be extremely rapid and can lead to dreadful complications. The mortality rate is usually up to 30% to 50% and depends upon the type of infection, underlying disease, and immune status. Patients suffering from these infections usually need to be hospitalized, sometimes in intensive care or burn units. They should be treated systemically with appropriate antimicrobial therapy and aggressive supportive care. The two life-threatening skin infections most commonly experienced are toxin-mediated staphylococcal and streptococcal disorders; one could overlap the other. Several other related entities will also be discussed.

### Medical management of orbital cellulitis [^117Aszxj]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

To determine the appropriate early management of orbital cellulitis and the bacterial etiology, and to evaluate the clinical usefulness of orbital computed tomographic imaging for this infection, a prospective study of orbital cellulitis was conducted from 1999 to 2000. This study followed the introduction of a conservative medical management plan designed by our pediatric infectious diseases, ophthalmology, and otolaryngology services. Patients did not undergo surgical intervention unless there was progressive involvement of the optic nerve after 24 to 36 hours of intravenous antimicrobial therapy.

Nine patients presented with orbital cellulitis and subperiosteal abscesses; only one required surgical drainage due to progressive disease, and this case was culture-negative. One patient had a blood culture positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae, while conjunctival cultures showed moderate to heavy growth for S. pneumoniae in this patient and two others. However, the bacterial etiology was not otherwise defined. Haemophilus influenzae was not recovered from any of their blood or conjunctival cultures. This experience, during the computed tomography scan and Haemophilus vaccine era, supports an initial medical management approach for most patients with subperiosteal or retrobulbar abscesses resulting in orbital cellulitis.

A total of 1,510 adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) were randomized in two multicenter, multinational, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority trials.

- **Trial 1**: Compared BAXDELA 300 mg via intravenous infusion every 12 hours to the comparator. In this trial, 331 patients with ABSSSI were randomized to BAXDELA and 329 patients were randomized to vancomycin plus aztreonam. Patients had the following infections: cellulitis (39%), wound infection (35%), major cutaneous abscess (25%), and burn infection (1%). The overall mean surface area of the infected lesion, as measured by digital planimetry, was 307 cm². The average age of patients was 46 years (range 18 to 94 years). Patients were predominately male (63%) and white (91%); 32% had a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m². The population studied included a distribution of patients with associated comorbidities such as hypertension (21%), diabetes (9%), and renal impairment (16%; 0.2% with severe renal impairment or ESRD). A recent history of drug abuse, including IV drug abuse, was reported by 55% of patients. Bacteremia was documented at baseline.

- **Trial 2**: Patients received BAXDELA 300 mg via intravenous infusion every 12 hours for six doses, then made a mandatory switch to oral BAXDELA 450 mg every 12 hours. In both studies, the comparator was the intravenous combination of vancomycin, 15 mg/kg actual body weight, and aztreonam. Aztreonam therapy was discontinued if no gram-negative pathogens were identified in the baseline cultures.

### Clinical implications of microbial biofilms in chronic rhinosinusitis and orbital cellulitis [^1144g4UM]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

In view of the aforementioned observations relating to biofilm and microbial virulence in various systemic infections, we explored similar occurrences in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and orbital cellulitis. It was justifiable to study these two disease entities together because they are clinically interrelated, with the pathogenesis of orbital cellulitis often developing as a complication of CRS, frequently ethmoidal sinusitis.

Cryer et al. first suggested the presence of biofilms on the sinus mucosa of CRS patients. This short study of 16 CRS patients, who had failed to respond to both surgical and medical treatments, utilized scanning electron microscopy to analyze specimens of sinus mucosa. The researchers found four specimens with a thicker coating than what is found in a normal muco-ciliary blanket. Further studies on the pathogenesis of various bacterial infections suggested that bacteria could adhere to solid surfaces and form a slimy, slippery coat. These so-called bacterial biofilms were prevalent on most wet surfaces, and bacterial cells embedded inside biofilms were resistant to antimicrobial agents and the host immune defense mechanism.

Ferguson and Stolz demonstrated the presence of bacterial biofilms in two of four patients with CRS. Also, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Sanclement et al. noted a prevalence of biofilms in 80% of the mucosal biopsies of CRS patients. Further electron microscopic research revealed the presence of biofilms in silast…

### Kineret [^1179QRo1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Infections

In Studies 1 and 4 combined, the incidence of infection was 39% in the Kineret-treated patients and 37% in placebo-treated patients during the first 6 months of blinded treatment. The incidence of serious infections in Studies 1 and 4 was 2% in Kineret-treated patients and 1% in patients receiving placebo over 6 months. The incidence of serious infection over 1 year was 3% in Kineret-treated patients and 2% in patients receiving placebo. These infections consisted primarily of bacterial events such as cellulitis, pneumonia, and bone and joint infections. The majority of patients (73%) continued on the study drug after the infection resolved. No serious opportunistic infections were reported. Patients with asthma appeared to be at higher risk of developing serious infections when treated with Kineret (8 of 177 patients, 4.5%) compared to placebo (0 of 50 patients, 0%).

In open-label extension studies, the overall rate of serious infections was stable over time and comparable to that observed in controlled trials. In clinical studies and postmarketing experience, cases of opportunistic infections have been observed and included fungal, mycobacterial, and bacterial pathogens. Infections have been noted in all organ systems and have been reported in patients receiving Kineret alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents.

In patients who received both Kineret and etanercept for up to 24 weeks, the incidence of serious infections was 7%. The most common infections consisted of bacterial pneumonia (4 cases) and cellulitis (4 cases).

Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance. Consequently, this will mean that infections will not be treatable by Hiprex or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### Acute bacterial, nonnecrotizing cellulitis in Finland: Microbiological findings [^116bYVTv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Bacterial, nonnecrotizing cellulitis is a localized and often recurrent infection of the skin. The aim of this study was to identify the beta-hemolytic streptococci that cause acute nonnecrotizing cellulitis infection in Finland.

- **Methods**: A case-control study of 90 patients hospitalized for acute cellulitis and 90 control subjects was conducted during the period of April 2004-March 2005. Bacterial swab samples were obtained from skin lesions or any abrasion or fissured toe web. Blood culture samples were taken for detection of bacteremia. The patients, their household members, and control subjects were assessed for pharyngeal carrier status. Beta-hemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated and identified. Group A and G streptococcal isolates were further analyzed by T serotyping and emm and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing.

- **Results**: Beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from 26 (29%) of 90 patients. Two isolates were blood-culture positive for group G streptococci, and 24 patients had culture-positive skin lesions. Group G Streptococcus (Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis) was found most often and was isolated from 22% of patient samples of either skin lesions or blood, followed by group A Streptococcus, which was found in 7% of patients. Group G streptococci were also carried in the pharynx of 7% of patients and 13% of household members but were absent from control subjects. Several emm and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types were present among the isolates. Six patients (7%) experienced reinfections.

### Risk factors for acute cellulitis of the lower limb: a prospective case-control study [^116kAcwu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial cellulitis is a potentially serious infection that commonly recurs. The identification of preventable risk factors could reduce infection-related morbidity and costs and improve patient management. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors associated with lower-limb cellulitis, including both analysis of risk factors associated with cellulitis in either limb and risk factors in a single limb associated with cellulitis in the same limb. Particular emphasis was placed on dermatophytic infections of the foot and bacterial infection and colonization of the toe webs.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective case-control study of 100 subjects with cellulitis and 200 control subjects, matched for age and sex, who were admitted to a university hospital during the period October 2000-February 2004. Data were obtained with a questionnaire and from examination of lower limbs and microbiological analyses of samples from the feet.

- **Results**: The median age of the participants was 66.5 years (interquartile range, 48.8–77.0). The following risk factors were strongly and independently associated with cellulitis: previous history of cellulitis (OR, 31.04; 95% CI, 4.15–232.20), the presence of Staphylococcus aureus and/or beta-hemolytic streptococci in the toe webs (OR, 28.97; 95% CI, 5.47–153.48), presence of leg erosions or ulcers (OR, 11.80; 95% CI, 2.47–56.33), and prior saphenectomy (OR, 8.49; 95% CI, 1.62–44.52). Tinea pedis interdigitalis was associated with cellulitis only when toe web bacteria were excluded from the analysis (OR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.32).

### Interventions for hidradenitis suppurativa: A Cochrane systematic review incorporating GRADE assessment of evidence quality [^112aRBxx]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

More than 50 interventions have been used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa, making therapy decisions challenging. The objective of this review was to summarize and appraise randomized controlled trial evidence for interventions in adults. Searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, five trials registers, and abstracts from eight dermatology conferences until August 13, 2015. Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and evaluated methodological quality.

The primary outcomes were the quality of life and adverse effects of the interventions. Twelve trials, conducted between 1983 and 2015 and investigating 15 different interventions, met the inclusion criteria. The median trial duration was 16 weeks, with a median of 27 participants. Adalimumab 40 mg weekly improved the Dermatology Life Quality Index by 4.0 points, equating to the minimal clinically important difference for the scale, compared with placebo (95% confidence interval −6.5 to −1.5 points). The evidence quality was rated as 'moderate' due to reliance on a single study. Adalimumab 40 mg administered every other week was ineffective in a meta-analysis of two studies comprising 124 participants. Infliximab 5 mg/kg improved the score by 8.4 points after 8 weeks in a moderate-quality study completed by 33 of 38 participants. Etanercept 50 mg twice weekly was found to be ineffective. The inclusion of a gentamicin sponge prior to primary closure did not improve outcomes. Other interventions, including topical and oral antibiotics, were investigated by relatively small studies, preventing definitive treatment recommendations.

### Penicillin to prevent recurrent leg cellulitis [^115Frr3o]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Cellulitis of the leg is a common bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissue. We compared prophylactic low-dose penicillin with placebo for the prevention of recurrent cellulitis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving patients with two or more episodes of cellulitis of the leg who were recruited from 28 hospitals in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Randomization was performed according to a computer-generated code, and study medications (penicillin [250 mg twice a day] or placebo for 12 months) were dispensed by a central pharmacy. The primary outcome was the time to a first recurrence. Participants were followed for up to 3 years. Because the risk of recurrence was not constant over the 3-year period, the primary hypothesis was tested during the prophylaxis phase only.

- **Results**: A total of 274 patients were recruited. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. The median time to a first recurrence of cellulitis was 626 days in the penicillin group and 532 days in the placebo group. During the prophylaxis phase, 30 of 136 participants in the penicillin group (22%) experienced a recurrence, compared with 51 of 138 participants in the placebo group (37%). This results in a hazard ratio of 0.55 (95% confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.86; P = 0.01), yielding a number needed to treat to prevent one episode of recurrent cellulitis of 5 (95% CI, 4 to 9). During the no-intervention follow-up period, there was no difference between groups in the rate of a first recurrence, with 27% in both groups. Overall, participants in the penicillin group had fewer recurrences.

### Efficacy and safety of adalimumab in conjunction with surgery in moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa: The SHARPS randomized clinical trial [^111AD7cB]. JAMA Surgery (2021). High credibility.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients at week 12 who achieved HS clinical response (HiSCR), defined as a reduction of 50% or more in AN count with no increase in the count of abscess and draining fistula relative to baseline across all body regions.

- **Secondary endpoints**: The four ranked secondary endpoints included:
	1. Proportion of patients achieving HiSCR excluding the surgical site at week 12
	2. Proportion of patients achieving HiSCR excluding the surgical site at week 24
	3. Percentage change in surface area of the HS surgical site from baseline to week 12
	4. Proportion of patients at week 12 who required less extensive surgery than the surgical plan (as determined at baseline) or required no surgery as determined by the designated surgeon

- **Other efficacy endpoints**: Change from baseline in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, Dermatology Life Quality Index, HS Patient's Global Assessment of Skin Pain, HS Impact Assessment, and HS Symptom Assessment. Additionally, the proportion of patients who experienced a flare (defined as a ≥ 25% increase in AN count with a ≥ 2 increase relative to baseline) at each study visit was recorded.

- **Safety assessments**: Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, laboratory variables, and vital signs were monitored. A treatment-emergent AE was defined as any AE with onset or worsening after the first study drug administration and with an onset date no more than 70 days after the last dose of study drug.

### Effect of dermatology consultation on outcomes for patients with presumed cellulitis: A randomized clinical trial [^1114XDHs]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). High credibility.

Each year, cellulitis leads to 650,000 hospital admissions and is estimated to cost $3.7 billion in the United States. Previous literature has demonstrated a high misdiagnosis rate for cellulitis, which results in unnecessary antibiotic use and increased health care costs.

The objective was to determine whether dermatologic consultation decreases the duration of hospital stay or intravenous antibiotic treatment duration in patients with cellulitis. This randomized clinical trial was conducted in a large urban tertiary care hospital between October 2012 and January 2017, with a 1-month follow-up. Patients were randomized to the control group, which received the standard of care (i.e. treatment by the primary medicine team), or the intervention group, which received dermatology consultation. Medical chart reviews of demographic information and hospital courses were performed. Adult patients hospitalized with a presumed diagnosis of cellulitis were eligible. A total of 1300 patients were screened, 1125 were excluded, and 175 were included. Statistical analysis was employed to identify significant outcome differences between the two groups.

- **Interventions**: Dermatology consultation within 24 hours of hospitalization.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Length of hospital stay and duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment.

Of 175 participants, 70 (40%) were women and 105 (60%) were men. The mean age was 58.8 years. Length of hospital stay was not statistically different between the two groups. The duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment (< 4 days: 8…

### A prospective clinical trial of open-label etanercept for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa [^117KR3NM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Medical therapies for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) are often ineffective, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors may be a potential treatment for patients with moderate to severe HS.

- **Objectives**: We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of etanercept for patients with severe HS.

- **Methods**: We conducted a phase II clinical trial of etanercept (50 mg/week subcutaneously) in patients with moderate to severe HS. Efficacy was measured using a Physician Global Assessment and several secondary physician- and patient-reported outcome measures. Responders were classified as those achieving at least a 50% reduction on the Physician Global Assessment score at week 12 compared with baseline.

- **Results**: Only 3 of the 15 patients who entered the study were classified as responders (response rate of 20%; 95% confidence interval: 4.3–48.1) based on the intention-to-treat analysis. Dermatology Life Quality Index scores improved slightly from a median of 19 to 15 (P = 0.02). Comparison of baseline with week-12 Physician Global Assessment scores, and secondary outcome measures of lesion counts and patient pain scores, failed to show statistically significant improvement. Etanercept was generally well tolerated; however, two patients discontinued the study as a result of skin infections at the site of hidradenitis lesions requiring oral antibiotics.

- **Limitations**: Lack of a control group and a small number of participants are limitations.

- **Conclusions**: Our study demonstrated minimal evidence of clinically significant efficacy of etanercept (50 mg/week subcutaneously) in the treatment.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors are potent anti-rheumatic drugs; however, there is evidence that the high level of immunosuppression they provide may lead to a higher risk of infections. At our institution, three patients with inflammatory arthritis treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors developed mycobacterial soft tissue infections following routine hand surgery. All three patients required multiple surgical procedures, inpatient hospitalizations, and prolonged multidrug antibiotic therapy to clear the infections.

### Risk factors of cellulitis in cirrhosis and antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing recurrence [^112MsQnh]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a commonly encountered bacterial infection among cirrhotic patients, aside from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, urinary tract, and respiratory infections. This study aimed to determine the risk factors of cellulitis in cirrhosis and whether antibiotic prophylaxis helps prevent recurrence.

- **Methods**: The study was conducted in two phases. In phase 1, all cirrhotic patients admitted with cellulitis from August 2011 to August 2013 were taken as cases (n = 70), and cirrhotic patients without cellulitis were included as controls (n = 73). Baseline demographic data, comorbidities, and investigations were noted and compared. In phase 2, the cases from phase 1 were divided into two groups based on the initiation of antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of discharge and were followed up for six months for recurrence of cellulitis.

- **Results**: The main etiology of cirrhosis was alcohol, and 68% of cases were Child C. Factors which showed significance in univariate analysis were the presence of diabetes mellitus, hepatic encephalopathy, platelet count, albumin level, and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Using logistic regression, hepatic encephalopathy (OR 2.95, CI 1.01–8.45), and albumin level (OR 2.95, CI 1.39–6.27) emerged as significant factors associated with cellulitis. Cellulitis recurred in 20% of cases, and recurrence was significantly low among the antibiotic prophylaxis group (15% vs. 50%, P = 0.048).

- **Conclusions**: Hypoalbuminemia and high MELD score are the risk factors for cellulitis in cirrhosis. Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the recurrence rate of cellulitis in this patient population.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: A review and update on new therapies [^111z39Db]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare and often painful skin disease that can be unpredictable in its response to treatment. There is currently no gold standard of treatment or published algorithm for the choice of therapy. The majority of data comes from case studies that lack a standard protocol not only for treatment administration but also for the objective assessment of lesion response to a specific therapy. This review provides an update on the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum, with a particular focus on new systemic therapies.

### Computer-aided drug design to generate a unique antibiotic family [^115wwgJw]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We also performed an in vivo study in a cellulitis mouse model to further examine the ability of DNM0547 to treat infection. Cellulitis is an infection that occurs in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Mice were infected intradermally with MRSA for one day and then treated for 7 days with a cream containing DNM0547 (2%) or vehicle control. Results demonstrate that DNM0547 resulted in a 4-fold reduction in wound size and reduced bacterial load by > 98%.

- **Spectrum of DNM0547 antibacterial utility**: To further determine the utility of DNM0547 in the treatment of broad-spectrum Gram-positive multi-drug resistant infections, we determined MICs against 102 ATCC strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus, Streptomyces, and Enterococcus. DNM0547 was compared to mupirocin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin. DNM0547 displayed an MIC of ≤ 2 μg/mL against all but seven of the strains tested, compared to 37 for vancomycin, 26 for mupirocin, 64 for ciprofloxacin, and 76 for erythromycin. Of the seven strains that had an MIC ≥ 2 μg/mL against DNM0547, four were 4 μg/mL, two were 8 μg/mL, and one was 32 μg/mL. This demonstrates that DNM0547 can be used to effectively treat clinically relevant drug-resistant strains.

- **Bacteriostatic or bactericidal properties**: We also sought to determine if DNM0547 was bacteriostatic or bactericidal. Time kill experiments were carried out using increasing doses of DNM0547 against two different strains of MRSA. There was a three log drop in surviving bacteria at 2 h against 4x and 8x MIC, and at 2 h and 6 h for 2x MIC.

### Renflexis [^1145eCXX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In infliximab clinical studies, infections were reported in 36% of infliximab-treated patients (average of 51 weeks of follow-up) and in 25% of placebo-treated patients (average of 37 weeks of follow-up). The infections most frequently reported were respiratory tract infections, including sinusitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, and urinary tract infections. Among infliximab-treated patients, serious infections included pneumonia, cellulitis, abscess, skin ulceration, sepsis, and bacterial infection.

In clinical trials, seven opportunistic infections were reported: two cases each of coccidioidomycosis (one case was fatal) and histoplasmosis (one case was fatal), and one case each of pneumocystosis, nocardiosis, and cytomegalovirus. Tuberculosis was reported in 14 patients, four of whom died due to miliary tuberculosis. Other cases of tuberculosis, including disseminated tuberculosis, have also been reported post-marketing. Most of these cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first two months after initiation of therapy with infliximab and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In the one-year placebo-controlled studies RA I and RA II, 5.3% of patients receiving infliximab every eight weeks with MTX developed serious infections compared to 3.4% of placebo patients receiving MTX. Of 924 patients receiving infliximab, 1.7% developed pneumonia and 0.4% developed TB, compared to 0.3% and 0.0% in the placebo arm, respectively. In a shorter 22-week placebo-controlled study of 1082 RA patients randomized to receive placebo, 3 mg/kg.

### Systemic therapy for psoriasis and the risk of cutaneous infections [^111Qo7SW]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Dermatologists usually encounter various cutaneous infections in the treatment of psoriasis. Modern therapeutics have enabled extended intervals between visits for as long as three months; therefore, capturing minor signs or symptoms is sometimes difficult until they become intolerable. Cutaneous infections usually modify the clinical appearance of psoriasis and can mislead dermatologists into selecting inappropriate treatment options. Our study demonstrated that patients with psoriasis receiving systemic therapy had a risk of cutaneous infections, and the incidence differed based on pathogens and therapeutic modalities.

Severe infections that are life-threatening or require hospitalization have been extensively investigated in patients with psoriasis. The Spanish Registry of Adverse Events for Biological Therapy in Dermatological Diseases (BIOBADADERM registry) suggested that the adjusted risk ratio of overall infection significantly increased in groups treated with adalimumab + methotrexate, infliximab, cyclosporine, ustekinumab + methotrexate, and etanercept compared with those treated with methotrexate alone. Additionally, the cohort study from the French National Health Data System indicated that the risk of severe infections was higher for new users of adalimumab or infliximab than for users of etanercept, whereas ustekinumab was associated with a lower risk of severe infections. Therefore, while several studies have reported that systemic therapy, particularly TNF inhibitors, increases the risk of severe infection, others have suggested that the risk of severe infections is independent of these factors.

### Risk factors of cellulitis in cirrhosis and antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing recurrence [^111CSWJr]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a commonly encountered bacterial infection among cirrhotic patients, apart from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, urinary tract, and respiratory infections. This study aimed to determine the risk factors of cellulitis in cirrhosis and whether antibiotic prophylaxis helps prevent recurrence of cellulitis.

- **Methods**: The study was conducted in two phases. In phase 1, all cirrhotic patients admitted with cellulitis from August 2011 to August 2013 were taken as cases (n = 70) and cirrhotic patients without cellulitis were included as controls (n = 73). Baseline demographic data, comorbidities, and investigations were noted and compared. In phase 2, the cases from phase 1 were divided into two groups based on the initiation of antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of discharge and were followed up for six months for recurrence of cellulitis.

- **Results**: The main etiology of cirrhosis was alcohol, and 68% of cases were Child C. Factors which showed significance in univariate analysis were the presence of diabetes mellitus, hepatic encephalopathy, platelet count, albumin level, and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Using logistic regression, hepatic encephalopathy (OR 2.95, CI 1.01–8.45), and albumin level 15 (OR 2.95, CI 1.39–6.27) emerged as significant factors associated with cellulitis. Cellulitis recurred in 20% and recurrence was significantly lower among the antibiotic prophylaxis group (15% vs. 50%, P = 0.048).

- **Conclusions**: Hypoalbuminemia and high MELD scores are risk factors for cellulitis in cirrhosis. Antibiotic prophylaxis appears to reduce recurrence rates.

### Treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis and concurrent COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory syndrome with systemic corticosteroids and etanercept [^117T113W]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Clinical findings**: Coalescing red papules on the anterior chest with a positive Nikolsky sign on the right upper back were observed on initial presentation (day 1). By day 2, there were coalescing red macules and patches covering > 95% body surface area (BSA) with multiple large flaccid bullae and erosions on the anterior chest. Significant re-epithelialization was noted after 2 doses of etanercept as demonstrated on the anterior chest by day 11.

- **Histopathological findings**: Acute basket-woven stratum corneum and widespread, confluent keratinocyte necrosis with focal adnexal involvement and modest inflammation were observed at 2× and 200× magnification.

The diagnosis, based on clinicopathological correlation, was toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as the suspected drug culprit. The patient was initially treated with a single dose of methylprednisolone 125 mg IV (2 mg/kg prednisone equivalent) and etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously. On day 2, the patient became febrile with a temperature of 39.3°C. By day 4, he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction. Laboratory testing revealed a C-reactive protein of 276.5 mg/L (normal < 10 mg/L) and ferritin of 1465 ng/mL (normal 30–400 ng/mL). On day 5, he began a 5-day course of dexamethasone 6 mg and received a second etanercept dose. On day 6, he received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg IV and started a 5-day course of remdesivir 100 mg. On day 7, the patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to agitated delirium necessitating sedation. While intubated, he required low positive end-expiratory pressures and a low fraction of inspiratory oxygen.
