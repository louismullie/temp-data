## Question

Does fluid overload lead to decreased renal perfusion, thereby increasing creatinine levels?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fluid overload leads to decreased renal perfusion and thereby increases serum creatinine, and how to interpret that clinically and diagnostically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hemodynamic determinants of renal perfusion and glomerular filtration. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology by which fluid overload could reduce effective renal blood flow despite higher intravascular volume. Next, I will examine the evidence linking fluid overload to AKI and creatinine rises, including observational and interventional data. After that, I need to check for confounders and competing mechanisms, including dilutional effects on creatinine and the bidirectionality of the fluid–kidney relationship. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious conclusion and outline practical clinical implications for fluid management and AKI interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the hemodynamic framework. Renal perfusion pressure is determined by the difference between mean arterial pressure and renal venous pressure, and glomerular filtration is additionally modulated by intrarenal arteriolar tone and interstitial pressure; importantly, the kidney is encapsulated, so rising interstitial pressure from edema can compress intrarenal structures and reduce perfusion even when systemic blood pressure is adequate [^1132M4Y2] [^115xaZFm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify the specific mechanisms by which fluid overload could impair renal perfusion. Elevated central venous pressure transmits backward to the renal veins, increasing renal interstitial and tubular hydrostatic pressure, which reduces transglomerular filtration pressure and net glomerular filtration; in addition, renal congestion and interstitial edema distort architecture, compress capillaries and lymphatics, and can create a renal compartment syndrome within the non-distensible capsule, all of which reduce effective renal blood flow and GFR despite higher intravascular volume [^1132M4Y2] [^115xaZFm] [^116e21Jv].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical evidence that fluid overload associates with AKI and rising creatinine. Multiple observational cohorts in ICU populations show that fluid accumulation and positive fluid balance independently associate with AKI incidence, non-recovery of renal function, and mortality; for example, fluid overload at RRT initiation and higher cumulative fluid accumulation correlate with worse kidney outcomes, and pediatric data similarly link fluid overload with adverse outcomes, supporting a dose–response relationship between fluid accumulation and renal dysfunction [^114wv1mb] [^111pY21B] [^111z8zig] [^1139gojC].

> I need to check whether this relationship is bidirectional and confounded. Fluid overload can be both a cause and a consequence of AKI: oliguria from AKI promotes positive balance, while over-resuscitation can worsen congestion and kidney injury; moreover, creatinine kinetics complicate interpretation because volume expansion can dilute plasma creatinine and mask true GFR decline, so a "stable" creatinine in the face of fluid overload may actually hide worsening kidney function, and conversely, decongestion can transiently raise creatinine even as renal perfusion improves [^113roGn8] [^112gvZAp] [^114W8Qzw].

> Let me consider interventional signals that test causality. In heart failure, aggressive decongestion with diuretics or ultrafiltration often produces a modest, transient creatinine rise yet is associated with improved longer-term renal outcomes and survival, suggesting that relieving venous congestion improves renal perfusion despite short-term functional biomarker changes; similarly, in perioperative and critical care settings, both overly liberal and overly restrictive fluid strategies can increase AKI, reinforcing that the goal is perfusion-oriented balance rather than indiscriminate filling or restriction [^116e21Jv] [^114W8Qzw] [^116x9NpP] [^115yVJke].

> But wait, what if the creatinine increase during decongestion reflects true injury rather than hemodynamic improvement? I should double-check the biomarker literature. Urinary injury biomarkers such as NGAL and KIM-1 rise with tubular injury and can help distinguish hemodynamic, congestion-driven creatinine changes from structural tubular damage; in heart failure decongestion, biomarker profiles often indicate tubular stress even when creatinine is unchanged, and conversely, a creatinine rise with decongestion may be hemodynamic and reversible rather than injurious, which aligns with improved longer-term outcomes when congestion is treated [^1178PUbM] [^114W8Qzw].

> Next, I should review guideline and expert consensus positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with best practice. Contemporary guidance emphasizes careful hemodynamic optimization with fluids and vasopressors to avoid both hypoperfusion and fluid overload, recognizes venous congestion as a key modifiable driver of AKI in cardiorenal syndromes, and advises individualized, dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness rather than static pressure targets; importantly, decisions to initiate RRT should incorporate the degree of fluid overload and organ impact rather than creatinine alone [^115WnXbc] [^1147Cvx6] [^114ccsXT] [^117973fd].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, fluid overload can lead to decreased effective renal perfusion via venous congestion, increased interstitial and intracapsular pressures, and reduced transglomerular filtration, which manifests as rising creatinine and AKI; however, the relationship is bidirectional and creatinine kinetics can obscure or delay recognition, so clinical interpretation must integrate fluid balance, hemodynamics, and, when available, injury biomarkers to guide safe decongestion and perfusion-targeted therapy [^1132M4Y2] [^115xaZFm] [^113roGn8] [^112gvZAp].

Fluid overload reduces renal perfusion by increasing **renal venous pressure** and **intra-abdominal pressure**, which lowers renal perfusion pressure and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [^115xaZFm] [^116e21Jv]. This hemodynamic effect can cause a **prerenal AKI pattern** with rising creatinine, even as total body fluid increases [^1133HscU]. Creatinine may also appear falsely low due to hemodilution, masking true injury [^113roGn8] [^112gvZAp]. Management should focus on **timely decongestion** and **perfusion optimization** to restore renal function and prevent progression [^1143CLut] [^1147Cvx6].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking fluid overload to reduced renal perfusion

Fluid overload impairs renal perfusion through **venous congestion** and **intra-abdominal hypertension**, which reduce effective perfusion pressure and GFR [^115xaZFm].

---

### Increased renal venous pressure and congestion

- **Venous congestion**: Elevated central venous pressure (CVP) from fluid overload is transmitted to the renal veins, reducing renal perfusion pressure and GFR [^116e21Jv] [^114LxEZg].

- **Intrarenal congestion**: Higher renal venous pressure raises intrarenal hydrostatic pressure, compresses capillaries, and reduces blood flow, causing ischemia and tubular dysfunction [^1132M4Y2] [^115xaZFm].

- **Renal compartment syndrome**: The non-distensible renal capsule limits expansion, so interstitial edema increases intrarenal pressure and further reduces perfusion [^1115tQZe] [^115xaZFm].

---

### Increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP)

Intra-abdominal hypertension from fluid overload compresses renal vessels, reduces perfusion, and promotes **diuretic resistance** [^115aPfaT] [^115xaZFm].

---

### Neurohormonal activation

Fluid overload activates the **RAAS** and **SNS**, causing renal vasoconstriction, sodium/water retention, and reduced perfusion [^113nbxCh] [^115BWjRw].

---

## Evidence linking fluid overload to increased creatinine levels

Multiple studies show fluid overload associates with **higher creatinine** and **AKI**, reflecting reduced GFR from congestion [^1138vdtb] [^111pY21B].

- **Cardiac surgery**: Fluid overload independently predicted AKI and higher creatinine in postoperative patients [^116x9NpP].

- **Critical illness**: Positive fluid balance was independently associated with AKI and higher creatinine in ICU cohorts [^1138vdtb] [^111pY21B].

- **Heart failure**: Venous congestion from fluid overload is a major driver of worsening renal function and rising creatinine [^116e21Jv] [^114W8Qzw].

## Clinical evidence and observational studies

| **Study** | **Population** | **Key findings** |

| Legrand et al. (2013) | Septic ICU patients | Elevated CVP strongly associated with AKI, supporting venous congestion as a mechanism [^112zdfqS] |

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Recognizing fluid overload as a cause of rising creatinine guides **targeted therapy** to improve perfusion and outcomes [^112SPgM7].

---

### Fluid management

- **Restrictive approach**: Avoid excessive fluids after initial resuscitation; aim for neutral or negative balance once stable [^115WnXbc] [^1147Cvx6].

- **Diuretics**: Use loop diuretics to relieve congestion and improve renal perfusion; monitor for electrolyte disturbances [^117U7GYm] [^112XKf7a].

- **Ultrafiltration**: Consider for refractory fluid overload, especially in heart failure or diuretic resistance [^116e21Jv] [^115yKvmh].

---

### Hemodynamic optimization

Hemodynamic optimization includes **vasopressors** to maintain MAP > 65 mmHg and preserve renal perfusion pressure, and **goal-directed therapy** using dynamic measures (e.g. passive leg raise, stroke volume variation) to guide fluids and avoid overload [^112SPgM7] [^116bbdj9].

---

### Monitoring and biomarkers

Monitoring should include **urine output** — closely tracked as an early indicator of reduced perfusion — and **biomarkers** such as NGAL or KIM-1 to distinguish hemodynamic AKI from tubular injury during decongestion [^1178PUbM] [^11633vue].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Hemodilution**: Fluid overload can lower measured creatinine, masking true GFR decline [^113roGn8] [^113Xwwis].

- **Bidirectionality**: AKI can cause fluid overload, complicating causality assessment [^114CnEfu] [^117DfbaX].

- **Patient factors**: Comorbidities and illness severity confound the fluid overload–creatinine relationship [^115XvJvA] [^1178PUbM].

---

Fluid overload reduces renal perfusion via venous congestion and intra-abdominal hypertension, causing a **prerenal AKI pattern** with rising creatinine; creatinine may be falsely low from hemodilution, so management should prioritize **decongestion** and **perfusion optimization** to restore renal function [^115xaZFm] [^116e21Jv] [^113roGn8] [^1133HscU].

Conclusions

Fluid overload, AKI and poor outcomes are clearly associated. However, whether AKI has caused fluid overload or vice versa can be difficult to determine. Better tools are necessary to measure intravascular volume status. Until then, fluid therapy needs to be personalised with physiological end-points, guided by dynamic tests like PLR manoeuvre, and monitored by using cumulative fluid balance coupled, where possible, with daily weights to avoid the adverse outcomes associated with fluid overload.

There is increasing evidence that fluid overload and acute kidney injury (AKI) are associated but the exact cause-effect relationship remains unclear. Wang and colleagues analysed patients admitted to 30 intensive care units in China and found that fluid accumulation was independently associated with an increased risk of AKI and mortality. This commentary focuses on the close pathophysiological link between AKI and fluid overload and discusses the implications for clinical practice. It outlines some of the challenges, including the difficulty in diagnosing fluid overload reliably with current methods, and stresses the importance of personalised fluid therapy with physiological end-points to avoid the deleterious effects of fluid overload.

Discussion

The role of fluid therapy in the development of fluid overload

In critically ill patients, adequate fluid resuscitation is essential to the restoration of cardiac output, systemic blood pressure and renal perfusion in patients with cardiogenic or septic shock. Prompt and adequate treatment with intravenous solutions can also prevent or limit subsequent AKI. Achieving an appropriate level of volume management requires knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology, evaluation of volume status, selection of appropriate solution for volume repletion, and maintenance and modulation of the tissue perfusion.

The administration of crystalloids solutions that are recommend for the initial management of patients with or at risk of AKI, and also in patients with sepsis expands the extracellular compartment, but over time since critically ill patients have a increased capillary leak intravenous solutions will leave the circulation and distribute in the extracellular volume leading to edema and to fluid overload. These results in impaired oxygen and metabolite diffusion, distorted tissue architecture, obstruction of capillary blood flow and lymphatic drainage, and disturbed cell to cell interactions that may then contribute to progressive organ dysfunction (Table 1). These effects are prominent in encapsulated organs (liver and kidneys). Fluid overload is not only a consequence of fluid therapy but also occurs during severe sepsis secondary to the release of complement factors, cytokines and prostaglandin products and altered organ microcirculation. In this context, edema is attributed to a combination of increased capillary permeability to proteins and increased net trans-capillary hydrostatic pressure through reduced pre-capillary vasoconstriction.

### Fluid overload is an independent risk factor for acute kidney injury in critically ill patients: results of a cohort study [^115xaZFm]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Fluid overload is postulated to cause renal dysfunction in a number of ways. Renal congestion and interstitial edema lead to distortion of the renal architecture and impaired metabolite diffusion, compromised tissue oxygenation. Capillary and lymphatic obstruction ensues with further organ congestion. The renal capsule limits the kidney's ability to accommodate increasing hydrostatic interstitial pressures and eventually leads to reduce renal perfusion and glomerular filtration. Decapsulation, in an animal model of resuscitation, has been described to protect the kidney from injury Increased intra-abdominal pressures from fluid loading compromise renal blood flow and contribute further to fluid overload by reduced salt and water excretion.

An association between fluid overload and renal dysfunction however does not prove causality. It is possible that fluid overload represents an epi-phenomenon and is a reflection of the severity of hypoperfusion and the resuscitative response. Our findings are limited by our observational design and the observed associations may be subject to bias from selection, confounding or random error. We attempted to control for confounders by using regression analysis. Another limitation is the external validity or generalizability of our results to other critically ill patients since we collected data only from a single institution. Possible biases are also parameters followed for fluid administration and blood transfusion. Currently our ICU protocols attempt goal-directed fluid resuscitation using inferior vena cava ultrasound measurements to guide fluid administration. Blood transfusion triggers are serum hemoglobin values < 7 mg/dl. Since these are universally accepted parameters by most ICU physicians, we believe that the fluid administration and transfusion practices at our institution may cause limited bias.

### Acute kidney injury: a guide to diagnosis and management [^117E4SRg]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is characterized by abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output. The spectrum of injury ranges from mild to advanced, sometimes requiring renal replacement therapy. The diagnostic evaluation can be used to classify acute kidney injury as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. The initial workup includes a patient history to identify the use of nephrotoxic medications or systemic illnesses that might cause poor renal perfusion or directly impair renal function. Physical examination should assess intravascular volume status and identify skin rashes indicative of systemic illness. The initial laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum creatinine level, complete blood count, urinalysis, and fractional excretion of sodium. Ultrasonography of the kidneys should be performed in most patients, particularly in older men, to rule out obstruction. Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia; volume overload; intractable acidosis; uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, or pleuritis; and removal of certain toxins. Recognition of risk factors (e.g., older age, sepsis, hypovolemia/shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, liver failure) is important. Team-based approaches for prevention, early diagnosis, and aggressive management are critical for improving outcomes.

Purpose Of Review

There is growing clinical evidence of adverse effects of fluid overload on kidney outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease who are not yet receiving kidney replacement therapy. In this review, we discuss the patient populations most at risk for fluid overload, the pathophysiology associated with fluid overload, and finally treatment options.

Recent Findings

The severity of fluid overload is an independent risk factor for both an increased risk of rapidly declining kidney function and increased risk for the need of kidney replacement therapy. High venous pressure within the kidney secondarily causes a decrease in kidney perfusion, which in turn signals salt retention and the resulting increase in plasma volume completes a vicious cycle propagating ongoing kidney injury. Fluid overload has also been identified as a risk factor for the combined outcome of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. This increased risk in some studies has been identified as more important than hypertension in predicting both the increased risk of kidney disease progression and morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Once fluid status is accurately assessed, a combination of salt restriction and effective diuretic therapy is the first-line therapy to manage this complication. In those patients who require additional therapy, use of a V2 receptor antagonists can be considered. Finally, some patients may benefit from peritoneal dialysis to bring about volume removal even if they do not yet require dialysis for uremic complications.

Summary

Excess fluid or fluid overload appears to enhance chronic kidney disease progression and its treatment and resolution is a potential disease-modifying intervention.

### Combining creatinine and volume kinetics identifies missed cases of acute kidney injury following cardiac arrest [^113roGn8]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

In an ICU setting, the cost of adjusting for fluid balance and creatinine kinetics is minimal given that urine output is normally recorded and creatinine regularly sampled. For most of the Cr decrease patients, creatinine concentration decreased within 4 hours. We suggest that if plasma creatinine has not decreased after 4 hours in clinical practice, kidney injury biomarker(s) be measured. This obviates the expense of screening all patients and is probably within a clinically meaningful time frame with respect to early intervention.

To the best of our knowledge, the hypothesis that volume loading, often described as resuscitation, reverses loss of renal function in AKI remains to be tested in a randomized control trial. In a recent meta-analysis of goal-directed therapy versus standard fluid administration in surgery, improved renal outcomes after AKI could not be ascribed to administration of greater fluid volumes. The conventional paradigm of fluid administration to maintain kidney perfusion in AKI has been challenged by evidence suggesting that even a small positive fluid balance contributes to increased mortality. Payen and colleagues noted that mean positive fluid balance within 2 days of entry to the ICU was associated with increased mortality in patients with diagnosed AKI. Similarly, the percentage of fluid accumulation was lower in survivors than non-survivors both at AKI diagnosis and at peak creatinine in the study by Bouchard and colleagues. Duration of fluid overload (> 10% fluid accumulation) was also associated with increased mortality. It was noted that patients with fluid overload had lower urine output and plasma creatinine at AKI diagnosis. Thus, a possible contributing cause to both of these findings is that patients with fluid overload on diagnosis of AKI had, on average, a greater loss of GFR than those without but that this was masked by dilution of plasma creatinine.

### Acute kidney injury [^114DQC2P]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by a sudden decrease in glomerular filtration rate, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine concentration or oliguria, and classified by stage and cause. This type of injury occurs in approximately 20% of hospitalized patients, with major complications including volume overload, electrolyte disorders, uremic complications, and drug toxicity. Management includes specific treatments according to the underlying cause and supportive treatment to prevent and manage complications. Kidney replacement therapy is used when complications cannot be managed with medical therapy alone. Despite advances in care, the mortality rate in patients requiring kidney replacement therapy remains approximately 50%.

### Fluid overload is an independent risk factor for acute kidney injury in critically ill patients: results of a cohort study [^111SbZqk]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute Kidney injury (AKI) develops in 55–66% of critically ill patients with an attributable mortality of 15–80%, dependent on the severity of renal dysfunction. The ICU physician has no influence over the usually described AKI risk factors; severity of illness, hemodynamic instability, comorbid illnesses, heart failure, cirrhosis and emergency surgery, however if potentially modifiable factors can be identified there is a real potential to reduce either the incidence or the severity of any renal injury.

Fluid overload is related to an increase in overall mortality with critical illness. In patients with established AKI, further fluid overloading has been linked with lower survival and lesser renal recovery.

There is emerging evidence that suggest a role for fluid overlcoad as a causative factor for AKI. It is biologically plausible that volume loading leads to organ congestion and a resultant decrease in renal blood flow. Whether fluid overload leads to cellular dysfunction from reduced perfusion, tissue hypoxia or by direct disruptions in cellular function is still not clear. Interestingly the renal capsule itself may cause a 'compartment syndrome' by its inability to distend when renal congestion occurs. Previous investigators have shown that a capsule 'ectomy' improves renal blood flow. An additional risk factor for AKI appears to be chloride — liberal intravenous fluids that contain 'supra-physiological' concentrations of chloride, such as 0.9% saline, a routine intravenous solution in most intensive care units (ICUs). Recent work has linked chloride — liberal intravenous solutions with AKI.

The objectives of this study were to determine whether the potentially modifiable risk factors of Fluid overload and Fluid Type (chloride — liberal versus chloride — restrictive) are risk factors for AKI in critically ill patients. We hypothesized that patients admitted to the ICU may be at a higher risk of AKI if they had a net positive fluid balance or received chloride — liberal fluids for both resuscitation and as maintenance therapy.

### Acute kidney injury: diagnosis and management [^111NmB7g]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate and resultant accumulation of metabolic waste products. Acute kidney injury is associated with an increased risk of mortality, cardiovascular events, and progression to chronic kidney disease. Severity of acute kidney injury is classified according to urine output and elevations in creatinine level. Etiologies of acute kidney injury are categorized as prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal. Accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause is key to successful management and includes a focused history and physical examination, serum and urine electrolyte measurements, and renal ultrasonography when risk factors for a postrenal cause are present (e.g., older male with prostatic hypertrophy). General management principles for acute kidney injury include determination of volume status, fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid, treatment of volume overload with diuretics, discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications, and adjustment of prescribed drugs according to renal function. Additional supportive care measures may include optimizing nutritional status and glycemic control. Pharmacist-led quality-improvement programs reduce nephrotoxic exposures and rates of acute kidney injury in the hospital setting. Acute kidney injury care bundles are associated with improved in-hospital mortality rates and reduced risk of progression. Nephrology consultation should be considered when there is inadequate response to supportive treatment and for acute kidney injury without a clear cause, stage 3 or higher acute kidney injury, preexisting stage 4 or higher chronic kidney disease, renal replacement therapy, and other situations requiring subspecialist expertise.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^112gvZAp]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

It remains unclear how to best determine baseline kidney function. What constitutes a baseline serum creatinine level is controversial and inconsistently defined. It would be ideal to have prior serum creatinine or GFR measurements widely available through electronic medical records, but this is not current practice in many parts of the world. Prior serum creatinine or GFR measures may also further elucidate the risk of AKI in patients considered at high risk on the basis of either comorbidity or an intervention. There is controversy about whether an acute decrease in serum creatinine level indicates AKI that has already occurred, and more research is needed in this area. For example, small declines in serum creatinine level need to be interpreted with caution because they may be the result of acute changes in creatinine production or volume of distribution. After a timed insult (e.g. coronary angiography, elective surgery, nephrotoxic drug exposure), serum creatinine level should be measured at an appropriate time, allowing for AKI to manifest. After AKI onset, serum creatinine level should be measured during follow-up as necessary for clinical management and care transitions (e.g. transfer to and from intensive care) and for determining changes in AKI staging and classification (AKI vs. AKD), including onset of CKD at 90 days.

How urine output should be evaluated is also an area that needs further investigation to avoid variability in reporting of AKI incidence (i.e. use of actual or ideal body weight, strict time period vs. time-averaged values). Future guidelines should address how differences in body composition (overweight, fluid overload) affect the interpretation of urine output, and whether these differences need to be considered in regard to the thresholds for AKI. Similarly, fluid status should be considered when evaluating for AKI. Fluid overload is associated with increased mortality and AKI, and it may impact the diagnosis of AKI through its impact on the volume of distribution of serum creatinine. Although there are research methods to define fluid overload, these are not routinely used in clinical practice, and it is unclear whether there is sufficient evidence to define a clinical threshold for fluid overload. In the next AKI guideline, fluid overload should be defined operationally through a rigorous literature review.

### Impact of liberal versus restrictive fluid management on acute kidney ı njury after nephrectomy: a randomised controlled trial with cystatin C evaluation [^116Vu16c]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study critically assessed serum creatinine and cystatin C as indicators of renal damage. Cystatin C is regarded as a more sensitive biomarker for early glomerular dysfunction owing to its low molecular weight and independence from muscle mass. While both indicators were assessed 48th hours postoperatively, the delta shift in cystatin C was markedly more substantial in the restrictive group, indicating heightened tubular stress or damage. This underscores the potential value of cystatin C as an adjunct marker to creatinine, especially in cases of suspected mild renal damage.

The more significant decrease in eGFR in the restriction fluid group highlights the impact of intraoperative hypovolaemia and decreased renal perfusion. While avoiding fluid overload is a desirable goal, an overly conservative approach looks to have a large renal penalty. For example, MAYDAY trial found that patients on restrictive fluid regimens had greater levels of urine biomarkers associated with renal tubular stress, implying subclinical kidney impairment even in the absence of overt clinical indications. These findings underline the importance of tailored, perfusion-oriented fluid regimens, particularly in procedures like nephrectomy where kidney fragility is heightened.

### Fluid overload and changes in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery: predictors of mortality and longer intensive care stay. A prospective cohort study [^114LxEZg]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac surgery is the surgical procedure most frequently associated with acute kidney injury (AKI). Kidney dysfunction during the perioperative period has also been associated with increased length of hospital stay and with a mortality rate as high as 50%, regardless of the underlying disease. Therefore, research has been carried out with various biomarkers in order to determine their prognostic value.

Creatinine is the most widely used marker of kidney function in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. According to Lassnigg, a small increase in serum creatinine (0 to 0.5 mg/dL) has been associated with 30-day mortality. On the other hand, fluid overload has also been linked with worse prognosis in several situations, including heart failure. Due to this close interaction, fluid overload has been identified as a new biomarker of heart and renal function. Cardio renal syndrome combines kidney dysfunction and heart failure in many clinical conditions. In kidney and in heart dysfunction, fluid overload is generally regarded as an important clinical condition. Fluid overload exerts greater venous pressure on the kidney, reducing kidney perfusion and glomerular filtration. However, fluid overload often remains symptomless for several days until clinical symptoms set in, when treatment is usually initiated.

Classically, creatinine has been used to identify kidney dysfunction; however, serum creatinine may remain within the normal range until about half of the kidney function is lost. Hence, clinical diagnosis of kidney dysfunction might be dangerously delayed, as might renal and heart protective procedures. Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and pro BNP are widely used biomarkers for heart failure, but when the glomerular filtration rate is less than 60 ml/minute their levels become very high, reducing their potential diagnostic accuracy. However, there is no evidence of the relative importance of fluid overload detection and/or changes in serum creatinine in terms of their relative sensitivity as markers of the risk of early mortality in the postoperative period following cardiac surgery.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF FLUID OVERLOAD

Compared with normal subjects, asymptomatic patients with heart failure have decreased sodium excretion in response to volume expansion. Abnormal fluid handling leads to physiological abnormalities in multiple organ systems. Increased myocardial water can lead to ischemia and decreased contractility in animals and humans. Deranged hemodynamics, neurohormonal activation, excessive tubular sodium reabsorption, inflammation, oxidative stress, and nephrotoxic medications are important drivers of harmful cardiorenal interactions in patients with heart failure.

Elevation of central venous pressure is rapidly transmitted to the renal veins, causing increased interstitial and tubular hydrostatic pressure, which decreases net glomerular filtration. An increased central venous pressure is independently associated with renal dysfunction and unfavorable outcomes in both acute and chronic heart failure. Venous congestion itself can produce endothelial activation, up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines, hepatic dysfunction, and intestinal villi ischemia. Bacterial endotoxins can then enter the circulation, magnifying the inflammatory milieu created by venous congestion and neurohormonal activity.

Three recent studies suggest that failure to adequately reduce fluid excess in patients with acutely decompensated heart failure trumps increases in serum creatinine in predicting poor outcomes. Thus, the foremost goal in managing acutely decompensated heart failure is to effectively resolve fluid overload. Therefore, if a decrease in intravascular volume by fluid removal causes small transient increases in serum creatinine, effective decongestion may still be essential to protect the kidney in the long term. Withdrawal of diuretic agents in 30 euvolemic patients with heart failure resulted in increases in urinary levels of kidney injury molecule-1, which returned to baseline with resumption of diuretic agents. Thus, in heart failure, even subclinical fluid overload can be associated with biological evidence of tubular dysfunction. An unresolved challenge is the ability to discern whether increase in serum creatinine during fluid removal is driven primarily by hemodynamic decreases in glomerular filtration rate or by development of acute tubular damage, which can progress to chronic kidney disease.

### Fluid accumulation, survival and recovery of kidney function in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury [^114wv1mb]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Fluid accumulation is associated with adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. Here, we sought to determine if fluid accumulation is associated with mortality and non-recovery of kidney function in critically ill adults with acute kidney injury. Fluid overload was defined as more than a 10% increase in body weight relative to baseline, measured in 618 patients enrolled in a prospective multicenter observational study. Patients with fluid overload experienced significantly higher mortality within 60 days of enrollment. Among dialyzed patients, survivors had significantly lower fluid accumulation when dialysis was initiated compared to non-survivors after adjustments for dialysis modality and severity score. The adjusted odds ratio for death associated with fluid overload at dialysis initiation was 2.07. In non-dialyzed patients, survivors had significantly less fluid accumulation at the peak of their serum creatinine. Fluid overload at the time of diagnosis of acute kidney injury was not associated with recovery of kidney function. However, patients with fluid overload when their serum creatinine reached its peak were significantly less likely to recover kidney function. Our study shows that in patients with acute kidney injury, fluid overload was independently associated with mortality. Whether the fluid overload was the result of a more severe renal failure or it contributed to its cause will require clinical trials in which the role of fluid administration to such patients is directly tested.

### The role of the kidney in heart failure [^115XvJvA]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Renal dysfunction is common in patients with heart failure and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Cardiac and renal dysfunction may worsen each other through multiple mechanisms such as fluid overload and increased venous pressure, hypo-perfusion, neurohormonal and inflammatory activation, and concomitant treatment. The interaction between cardiac and renal dysfunction may be critical for disease progression and prognosis. Renal dysfunction is conventionally defined by a reduced glomerular filtration rate, calculated from serum creatinine levels. This definition has limitations as serum creatinine is dependent on age, gender, muscle mass, volume status, and renal haemodynamics. Changes in serum creatinine related to treatment with diuretics or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are not necessarily associated with worse outcomes. New biomarkers might be of additional value to detect an early deterioration in renal function and to improve the prognostic assessment, but they need further validation. Thus, the evaluation of renal function in patients with heart failure is important as it may reflect their haemodynamic status and provide a better prognostic assessment. The prevention of renal dysfunction with new therapies might also improve outcomes although strong evidence is still lacking.

### Fluid overload and changes in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery: predictors of mortality and longer intensive care stay. A prospective cohort study [^114eJ29E]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

We also found a significant and independent association between fluid overload and length of ICU stay, similar to those previously found in patients undergoing general surgery, with cardio renal syndrome and acute kidney diseases. In our data, fluid overload seemed to play a much greater role than creatinine in the length of ICU stay (Table 4).

The association between classic risk factors, such as CPB, EuroSCORE and preoperative renal dysfunction, and a higher rate of postoperative complications and longer length of hospital stay has been widely reported in the medical literature. However, when we analyzed the independent contribution of variables to account for the length of ICU stay, we found that only fluid overload and changes in serum creatinine were related to length of ICU stay.

The early identification of fluid overload is essential to establish adequate management in cardiac patients, since this is regarded as the most important hemodynamic factor in the worsening of renal function in patients with congestive heart failure. When cardiac dysfunction occurs, it is not unusual to find that renal function suddenly worsens and that the adjustment of volume and sodium is out of control. Fluid overload may be associated with myocardial edema, which, together with inflammatory changes and the activation of the renin-angiotensin system, increases the consumption of myocardial oxygen, leading to an unfavorable clinical situation. It may also alter renal function due to diminished perfusion secondary to venous congestion, so reducing glomerular filtration.

Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

Patients at increased risk for AKI and particularly those with manifest AKI require careful monitoring of their haemodynamic status, in order to balance the risk of renal hypoperfusion on the one hand and fluid overload on the other. Cardiac output and blood pressure should be kept within optimal limits to ensure the best possible kidney perfusion. However, as recently reported, hazardous fluid overload must be avoided, particularly in anuric patients with AKI. Available therapies to manage hypotension should integrate fluid and vasopressor therapy in protocols with appropriate haemodynamic goals. When volume resuscitation is deemed necessary, there is sufficient evidence to support the recommendation that there is no additional advantage of (more expensive) colloid over crystalloid solutions; therefore ERBP upgraded the strength of this recommendation. However, ERBP wants to stress that this rule does not apply in patients in whom a decrease in the circulating volume is present, e.g. in haemorrhagic shock. In these conditions, the use of colloids can be warranted; iso-osmolar solutions, with low molecular branching coefficients should be preferred. ERBP also wants to point out that the use of large quantities of isotonic saline can potentially lead to metabolic acidosis.

As renal perfusion pressure is more important than renal blood flow per se, and as the action of vasopressors is immediate and directly reversible, ERBP recommends using vasopressor therapy rather than extra fluid in volume-resuscitated patients. Here, norepinephrine has advantages over dopamine, because of fewer side-effects and lower costs, but vasopressin may be used as an alternative. Several meta-analyses have pointed out that dopamine failed to improve outcomes in patients with AKI. Finally, protocol-based goal-directed therapy is advocated in the early hours of sepsis. Such goal-directed therapy includes avoiding hypotension, optimizing oxygen delivery and careful fluid and vasopressor management when indicated. Some clinical studies have highlighted the need to keep mean arterial blood pressure above 65 mmHg in critically ill patients, but the speed of intervention seems to be very important as well.

### Fluid management for the prevention and attenuation of acute kidney injury [^1147Cvx6]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

In patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), optimization of systemic haemodynamics is central to the clinical management. However, considerable debate exists regarding the efficacy, nature, extent and duration of fluid resuscitation, particularly when the patient has undergone major surgery or is in septic shock. Crucially, volume resuscitation might be required to maintain or restore cardiac output. However, resultant fluid accumulation and tissue oedema can substantially contribute to ongoing organ dysfunction and, particularly in patients developing AKI, serious clinical consequences. In this Review, we discuss the conflict between the desire to achieve adequate resuscitation of shock and the need to mitigate the harmful effects of fluid overload. In patients with AKI, limiting and resolving fluid overload might prompt earlier use of renal replacement therapy. However, rapid or early excessive fluid removal with diuretics or extracorporeal therapy might lead to hypovolaemia and recurrent renal injury. Optimal management might involve a period of guided fluid resuscitation, followed by management of an even fluid balance and, finally, an appropriate rate of fluid removal. To obtain best clinical outcomes, serial fluid status assessment and careful definition of cardiovascular and renal targets will be required during fluid resuscitation and removal.

Third, fluid overload may result from overzealous fluid administration or oliguria or a combination of the two. The differentiation is important since fluid overload caused by excessive fluid therapy is potentially avoidable whereas fluid overload as a result of oliguria may reflect AKI and may not be easily modifiable without RRT. Most studies have not distinguished between the two. In a recent retrospective analysis, it was demonstrated that fluid administration, rather than low urine output, was independently associated with progression from AKI stage I to stage III. Clearly, more detailed work is necessary to identify the exact factors responsible for fluid overload.

Finally, the fact that fluid overload is associated with AKI does not prove causality. One key problem is that the effects of volume overload and the effects of AKI are similar. Both lead to multi-organ dysfunction. They also often have the same denominator, including endothelial dysfunction due to inflammation or ischaemia/reperfusion injury with decay and shedding of the glycocalyx and subsequent capillary leakage. Patients with more severe endothelial dysfunction tend to develop both fluid overload and AKI following fluid administration. Importantly, hypervolaemia may stretch the vascular wall and worsen vascular permeability, possibly by atrial natriuretic peptide-induced damage to the glycocalyx (Fig. 1). Unpicking this vicious circle can be very difficult.

Nevertheless, the study by Wang et al. does confirm what other studies have shown previously that a positive fluid balance is associated with worse outcomes. The crucial question for clinical practice is how to ensure appropriate and timely correction of hypovolaemia without causing fluid overload. Unfortunately, the tools to guide fluid management and to inform the clinical team when fluid administration is no longer beneficial are inadequate. Central venous pressure (CVP) or dynamic techniques like fluid responsiveness or echocardiography are often used. However, the CVP does not accurately reflect intravascular volume status and can be misleading. Measuring changes in pulse pressure and stroke volume may provide very useful information for assessing preload and fluid responsiveness but does not diagnose or quantify fluid overload either. Crucially, these techniques are not readily available outside critical care areas. Cumulative fluid balance gives an indication about the fluid input–output relationship but does not correct for non-measurable losses, is often inaccurate and does not indicate whether a patient is intravascularly hypovolaemic, euvolaemic or overloaded.

### Fluid balance and acute kidney injury [^114sfsAy]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Intravenous fluids are widely administered to patients who have, or are at risk of, acute kidney injury (AKI). However, deleterious consequences of overzealous fluid therapy are increasingly being recognized. Salt and water overload can predispose to organ dysfunction, impaired wound healing and nosocomial infection, particularly in patients with AKI, in whom fluid challenges are frequent and excretion is impaired. In this Review article, we discuss how interstitial edema can further delay renal recovery and why conservative fluid strategies are now being advocated. Applying these strategies in critical illness is challenging. Although volume resuscitation is needed to restore cardiac output, it often leads to tissue edema, thereby contributing to ongoing organ dysfunction. Conservative strategies of fluid management mandate a switch towards neutral balance and then negative balance once hemodynamic stabilization is achieved. In patients with AKI, this strategy might require renal replacement therapy to be given earlier than when more-liberal fluid management is used. However, hypovolemia and renal hypoperfusion can occur in patients with AKI if excessive fluid removal is pursued with diuretics or extracorporeal therapy. Thus, accurate assessment of fluid status and careful definition of targets are needed at all stages to improve clinical outcomes. A conservative strategy of fluid management was recently tested and found to be effective in a large, randomized, controlled trial in patients with acute lung injury. Similar randomized, controlled studies in patients with AKI now seem justified.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to RRT, choice of modality, UKKA 2019 guidelines recommend to decide on the choice of modality based on the condition of the patient as a whole, the severity of the underlying disease, the degree of fluid overload and its impact on other organs, rather than on isolated creatinine or urea values.

### Management of acute kidney injury: core curriculum 2018 [^1174XRkG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous disorder that is common in hospitalized patients and associated with short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. When AKI is present, prompt workup of the underlying cause should be pursued, with specific attention to reversible causes. Measures to prevent AKI include optimization of volume status and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. Crystalloids are preferred over colloids for most patients, and hydroxyethyl starches should be avoided. Volume overload in the setting of AKI is associated with adverse outcomes, so attention should be paid to overall fluid balance. Currently there are no targeted pharmacotherapies approved for the treatment of AKI. The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with AKI is unclear, but is an area of active investigation. Recent studies suggest that AKI is not a "self-limited" process, but is strongly linked to increased risk for chronic kidney disease, subsequent AKI, and future mortality.

BIOMARKERS

The use of natriuretic peptides to assess volume status and guide decongestive therapies cannot be recommended because fluid overload is not the sole cause of increases in the levels of these biomarkers. The removal of fluid to achieve pre-specified natriuretic peptide levels is untested in acute heart failure. Serum creatinine is the sole biomarker used to guide fluid removal because of the belief that its level reflects both renal filtration function and tubular status. However, serum creatinine was established and validated as a measurement of renal function only at the point of steady-state (constant production from the metabolism of muscle creatine phosphate and unchanging glomerular filtration and urinary flow to excrete creatinine at a constant rate). Therefore, it is unfortunate that serum creatinine is the only widely available measurement of renal function in patients with acute illnesses, such as acutely decompensated heart failure, where the rates of creatinine production and excretion may be altered. Gene expression analysis has shown differences in the genes expressed in acute kidney injury due to different processes, even if the magnitude of rise in creatinine is the same. Conversely, serum creatinine concentration can be normal with documented tubular injury due to the delayed achievement of detectable changes of this analyte. Generally, hemodynamically driven increases in serum creatinine resolve with treatment in 24 to 72 h, whereas the cellular derangements due to acute tubular damage, or even necrosis, may last for weeks. Therefore, the duration of the elevation in serum creatinine has a greater predictive effect on morbidity and mortality than the extent of this biomarker's elevation. Indeed, the use of increases in serum creatinine as an endpoint for acutely decompensated heart failure trials has been challenged. Evaluation of the relationship between changes in serum creatinine and 60-day outcomes in DOSE subjects revealed that increases in serum creatinine from baseline to 72 h (DOSE's coprimary endpoint) was associated with lower risk for the composite outcome of death or heart failure events. Conversely, there was a strong relationship between improved renal function and unfavorable 60-day outcomes. Thus, serum creatinine changes are an unreliable surrogate endpoint in trials of fluid removal therapies. After the discovery by Mishra et al. of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), which is secreted in the urine and the plasma by a damaged kidney, it was shown that the expression/secretion of urine NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) occurred within 3 h of the event (sepsis, nephrotoxins, obstruction, ischemia); and that the amount of secreted protein (from 20 ng/ml to 5 mg/ml) was proportional to the severity and time of resolution of the stimulus. A growing body of evidence suggests NGAL is not expressed when serum creatinine increases due to volume stressors. A systematic study of thousands of genes encoding for several biomarkers including NGAL, kidney injury molecule-1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and clusterin, found that these molecules were detectable after a brief dose of ischemia, yet none of these genes were expressed after near-fatal volume depletion, despite the rise in serum creatinine in both models. Although this method is not yet widely available, in the setting of any method of fluid removal, the levels of urine NGAL and other biomarkers of tubular injury could potentially help distinguish a rise in serum creatinine due to a hemodynamically mediated decrease in glomerular filtration rate or actual tubular injury. Numerous genes are differentially expressed depending upon the presence and type of acute kidney injury. The levels of NGAL rise faster than those of other indicators of renal injury, making this biomarker better suited to distinguish between hemodynamically, versus tubular injury-driven increases in serum creatinine that may occur during fluid removal therapies.

### Emerging individualized approaches in the management of acute cardiorenal Syndrome with renal Assist Devices [^111dWqgt]. JACC: Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Growing insights into the pathophysiology of acute cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) in acute decompensated heart failure have indicated that not every rise in creatinine is associated with adverse outcomes. Detection of persistent volume overload and diuretic resistance associated with creatinine rise may identify patients with true acute CRS. More in-depth phenotyping is needed to identify pathologic processes in renal arterial perfusion, venous outflow, and microcirculatory-interstitial-lymphatic axis alterations that can contribute to acute CRS. Recently, various novel device-based interventions designed to target different pathophysiologic components of acute CRS are in early feasibility and proof-of-concept studies. However, appropriate trial endpoints that reflect improvement in cardiorenal trajectories remain elusive and highly debated. In this review the authors describe the variety of physiological derangements leading to acute CRS and the opportunity to individualize the management of acute CRS with novel renal assist devices that can target specific components of these alterations.

Pathophysiology of a heterogeneous syndrome

The pathophysiology of AKI has been insufficiently elucidated not in the least because kidneys are complex and rather inaccessible organs. Animal models poorly reflect human pathophysiology (where comorbidities play an important role) and the AKI syndrome is heterogenous, illustrated by recent studies demonstrating different genomic responses in volume depletion, ischemic and septic animal models of AKI. In clinical practice, it is likely that there are distinct, but overlapping pathophysiological paradigms of AKI that may require individualized treatments, explaining in part the failure of many interventions in clinical trials. With the exception of specific intrinsic renal disease, AKI pathology can range from decreased GFR, mediated purely by systemic or local hemodynamic alterations through reversible tubular stress/injury to frank tubular necrosis. Histologic changes in AKI of critical illness are generally focal and modest. Within this complex pathophysiology, a number of common themes emerge with patterns of inflammatory, ischemic and nephrotoxic kidney injury that can occur sequentially and concomitantly and may be differently influenced by underlying diseases (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3

Green indicates functional/reversible processes; red indicates acute and chronic tissue injury. Yellow boxes indicate etiological factors in AKI pathogenesis, blue boxes diagnostic tests indicative of underlying pathophysiological processes

Identification of clinical phenotypes with different pathophysiology and outcome is essential to identify new therapeutic targets. The importance of clinical context is illustrated in cardiorenal syndrome due to acute decompensation of chronic heart failure, where renal congestion is the predominant driver of worsening kidney function. Although successful resolution of fluid overload with diuretics or ultrafiltration may induce an increase of Scr, it is, however, associated with improved longer term kidney function, even in patients with elevated renal injury markers. This suggests that the benefit of decongestion outweigh the modest increase of Scr and, for instance, that NT-proBNP might be a more useful prognostic biomarker than markers of kidney damage in this specific setting. It is important to note, however, that often numerous AKI risk factors and clinical settings co-exist or follow sequentially so that clear clinical inferences are difficult to draw, which emphasizes the importance of further research to identify underlying dominant AKI phenotypes to guide therapeutic intervention.

### Fluid overload and acute kidney injury: cause or consequence? [^116bbdj9]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

In the absence of any sophisticated tools to confirm euvolaemia or diagnose fluid overload, initial fluid resuscitation should be guided by an assessment of fluid responsiveness followed by fluid therapy titrated against individualized end-points. The passive leg raising (PLR) manoeuvre (i.e. internal fluid loading which is reversible) coupled with real-time stroke volume monitoring has been recommended to assess the need for fluid therapy.

There is some prospect that novel biomarkers may also have a role to prevent fluid overload. Mekontso Dessap et al. randomly assigned 304 mechanically ventilated patients to a strategy driven by B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or usual care. Patients in the BNP-led cohort received diuretics and fluid restriction on days when their BNP was at least 200 pg/ml. Fluid balance was more negative and time to successful extubation was shorter in this group.

### Fluid overload and changes in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery: predictors of mortality and longer intensive care stay. A prospective cohort study [^116Hy7VX]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Once renal insufficiency occurs in the setting of heart failure, the prognosis becomes poor. There is a gap in the knowledge regarding the clear distinction between pre-renal and established acute renal failure associated with decreasing compensatory mechanisms and subclinical episodes of heart and kidney dysfunction. Filling this gap is critical for the adequate management of the afflicted patients.

Serum creatinine levels can also undergo changes during the postoperative period after cardiac surgery due to extracorporeal circulation and hemodilution. However, in our data, we found no relationship between the decreased change in creatinine and mortality, because no patient in this group died, in contrast to what was observed by Lassnigg.

Due the fact that only 66 patients stayed more than four days in the ICU, in our data it was impossible to detect an expressive temporal profile. However, we found none of the surviving patients had fluid overload four days after cardiac surgery. Interaction between the heart and kidneys is intense. It is also well established that renal and cardiac function are closely related to fluid control and maladjustment in one of the organs may trigger an alteration in the other. Fluid accumulation may have a bidirectional association with renal dysfunction and may account for this rather direct relationship between heart and kidney, the cardio renal syndrome. In order to establish adequate cross-talk between them, it is necessary to maintain an adequate blood volume and hemodynamic stability. This is so important that several authors have identified fluid overload as a new biomarker of dysfunction of the cardio renal syndrome.

### The interactive effects of input and output on managing fluid balance in patients with acute kidney injury requiring continuous renal replacement therapy [^111Kki2Q]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Adequate fluid resuscitation is essential to restore tissue perfusion in critically ill patients with AKI, and fluid administration contributes to improve glomerular filtration. Moreover, fluid administration is aimed to restore systemic blood pressure, a major determinant of renal perfusion pressure and cardiac output. In particular, patients with severe sepsis need adequate fluid resuscitation within 1 to 3 h of disease onset to overcome their hemodynamically unstable state. Thus, clinicians may try to administer more fluid to restore tissue perfusion and to improve disease course. However, fluid overload and tissue edema physiologically result in impaired diffusion of oxygen and metabolites, distorted tissue architecture, obstruction of capillary blood flow or lymphatic drainage, and disturbed cell-cell interactions. These processes subsequently contribute to progressive organ dysfunction. The patients in the current study were more likely to be overhydrated at CRRT start, and their severity scores (SOFA and APACHE II score) were higher than those in other studies. Thus, more removal of patient output seems to be more effective for a decrease in mortality compared with lower cumulative input, and interpretation of the current study should be made with caution. Generally, most AKI patients who require CRRT are critically ill and in an overhydrated condition. Moreover, effective circulating volume appears to be low in these patients. Thus, we surmise that it might be more helpful to increase fluid removal than to decrease input. Furthermore, Murugan et al. recently showed that higher ultrafiltration intensity (> 25 mL/kg/day) was associated with lower risk for mortality compared with lower ultrafiltration intensity (≤ 20 mL/kg/day) among critically ill patients with fluid overload who were undergoing CRRT. The authors suggested several reasons for the benefit of intensive removal. First, increase in cumulative output may reduce the risk of subsequent edema-related organ dysfunction. Second, the increase in cumulative output by intensive net ultrafiltration may lead to better clearance of unknown molecules and contribute to better survival independently of fluid balance.

### Fluid overload and acute kidney injury: cause or consequence? [^115MFw2s]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Fluids are the second most common intervention in acutely ill patients (after oxygen). Whilst the benefits of early fluid resuscitation in patients with shock and acute kidney injury (AKI) have been accepted, uncertainty remains about the optimal type, volume and timing of fluid delivery. There is growing evidence that fluid administration beyond the correction of hypovolaemia is associated with increased morbidity, a longer hospital stay and mortality. In a recent article in Critical Care, Wang et al. analysed the data of 2526 patients admitted to 30 intensive care units (ICUs) in China and showed that even relatively small degrees of fluid overload were independently associated with an increased risk of AKI and mortality. Others have shown associations between fluid overload and poor outcomes in patients with acute lung injury, congestive heart failure, and AKI receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) and patients undergoing major surgery.

Although there is now little doubt that fluid overload is associated with AKI, it is difficult to disentangle the cause-effect relationship. Furthermore, translating the results into clinical practice is very challenging, especially since some important issues are still unresolved.

First, defining fluid overload is not straightforward. By convention, most studies in the literature, including the study by Wang et al. defined fluid overload by a percentage increase in body weight from day of admission to the ICU. However, this assumes that patients were intravascularly replete on admission (which is often not the case). It also ignores any insensible losses as well as fluid administration in the pre-ICU setting.

Second, whether the consequences of fluid overload depend on the specific type of fluid has not been studied. It is plausible that fluid overload as a result of excessive crystalloid administration has a different impact compared with fluid accumulation following infusion of colloids or massive transfusion of blood products. More data are necessary. The timing of volume administration may also be relevant. A positive fluid balance of 5 litres over an initial 24-hour period followed by no further fluid gain may have a different outcome compared with the same net balance over a period of days.

Volume of Fluid

The major goals of intraoperative fluid resuscitations are optimizing intravascular volume to increase cardiac output and perfusion pressure in order to improve renal blood flow and glomerular function. Excessive fluid has also been shown to be associated with AKI; however, the cause-and-effect relationship between the two remains unclear. A further complexity is that positive fluid balance can be caused by a combination of increased administration, which is potentially modifiable, and decreased urine output, which could only be addressed through renal replacement therapy. Finally, the definitions of "liberal", "restrictive", and "traditional" fluid administration have evolved and can overlap across trials, requiring careful review of specific interventions when interpreting study results.

The Restrictive versus Liberal Fluid Therapy in Major Abdominal Surgery (RELIEF) trial demonstrated that restrictive fluid resuscitation (goal, net zero fluid balance) protocol had a significantly higher rate of AKI when compared to the group receiving liberal fluid resuscitation (goal, reflective of traditional practice). This contrasts with the results from a randomized trial showing that restrictive fluid resuscitation (in combination with pre-emptive norepinephrine infusion) reduced postoperative complications (which included both renal failure and transient creatinine increase) and hospitalization after radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. In light of this clinical evidence, providers need to recognize that both hypovolemia and hypervolemia may be associated with AKI and adopt personalized management guided by physiologic endpoints. Assessment of euvolemia can be guided by judicious fluid challenges with frequent assessment of fluid responsiveness, hemodynamic homeostasis, and clinical signs of hypoperfusion. Intraoperative positional changes can function like a passive leg raise maneuvers, potentially revealing fluid responsiveness. Furthermore, assessment should prioritize dynamic markers (stroke volume, pulse pressure variation) rather static metrics (central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) — which have been shown to be an unreliable predictor of fluid responsiveness.

Venous Congestion and Management of Central Venous Pressure

A variety of factors in the perioperative environment, including (1) positive pressure ventilation, (2) intravenous fluids, (3) transfusion, and (4) cardiopulmonary bypass, impact venous congestion and central venous pressure. While optimal volume status remains a complex topic, venous congestion has been associated with cardiac surgery–associated AKI in patients from the Statin AKI Cardiac Surgery trialand the Aortic To RAdial Pressure (ATRAP) Gradient Study. Furthermore, venous congestion was found to more accurately predict AKI than arterial hypotension in the latter population, although prospective studies are necessary to assess whether treatment strategies to alleviate venous congestion alter the development of postoperative AKI.

### Management of patients at risk of acute kidney injury [^115WnXbc]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a multifaceted syndrome that occurs in different settings. The course of AKI can be variable, from single hit and complete recovery, to multiple hits resulting in end-stage renal disease. No interventions to improve outcomes of established AKI have yet been developed, so prevention and early diagnosis are key. Awareness campaigns and education for health-care professionals on diagnosis and management of AKI-with attention to avoidance of volume depletion, hypotension, and nephrotoxic interventions-coupled with electronic early warning systems where available can improve outcomes. Biomarker-based strategies have not shown improvements in outcome. Fluid management should aim for early, rapid restoration of circulatory volume, but should be more limited after the first 24–48 h to avoid volume overload. Use of balanced crystalloid solutions versus normal saline remains controversial. Renal replacement therapy should only be started on the basis of hard criteria, but should not be delayed when criteria are met. On the basis of recent evidence, the risk of contrast-induced AKI might be overestimated for many conditions.

Prevention of AKI

Diuretics may be used to manage volume overload secondary to AKI and increase potassium excretion. Administration of loop diuretics has been shown to reverse oligo-anuria, revealing patients with less severe renal injury or adequate renal reserve, but has not been shown to prevent AKI, need for renal replacement therapy, or overall mortality. Judicious fluid administration combined with loop diuretics (i.e. "matched hydration") may increase tubular flow of filtrate without volume depletion and associated renal hypoperfusion –; however, further randomized control trials are necessary before this strategy can be broadly recommended in the prevention of postoperative AKI.

Despite initially promising studies, neither preoperative aspirin nor clonidine reduced the risk of postoperative AKI in the POISE-2 randomized trial of noncardiac surgery patients. Dexamethasone potentially attenuates the systemic inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass and reducing inflammatory mediators, but the Dexamethasone in Cardiac Surgery (DECS) trial and the Steroids in Cardiac Surgery (SIRS) trial failed to support prophylactic use of steroids during cardiac surgery. Finally, a meta-analysis found no evidence that N-acetylcysteine improved renal outcomes after major surgery; therefore, the KDIGO management guidelines recommend against using oral or intravenous N-acetylcysteine for prevention of postsurgical AKI.

Management of Postoperative AKI

The Acute Disease Quality Initiative and PeriOperative Quality Initiative consensus report recommends determining and resolving the underlying cause of postoperative AKI. Mainstays of management include removal or avoidance of nephrotoxic exposure and hemodynamic optimization. Renal perfusion can be maintained through a combination of fluids and vasopressors, with protocol-based management to prevent worsening AKI in high-risk perioperative patients. Diuretics should not be used in the treatment of AKI, except to manage volume overload. A number of agents including dopamine, fenoldopam, atrial natriuretic peptide, insulin-like growth factor-1, and diuretics have failed to improve the course of AKI and do not have a role in the management of AKI.

### AKI in the ICU: definition, epidemiology, risk stratification, and outcomes [^112h8swj]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has emerged as a major public health problem that affects millions of patients worldwide and leads to decreased survival and increased progression of underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent consensus criteria for definition and classification of AKI have provided more consistent estimates of AKI epidemiology. Patients, in particular those in the ICU, are dying of AKI and not just simply with AKI. Even small changes in serum creatinine concentrations are associated with a substantial increase in the risk of death. AKI is not a single disease but rather a syndrome comprising multiple clinical conditions. Outcomes from AKI depend on the underlying disease, the severity and duration of renal impairment, and the patient's renal baseline condition. The development of AKI is the consequence of complex interactions between the actual insult and subsequent activation of inflammation and coagulation. Contrary to the conventional view, recent experimental and clinical data argue against renal ischemia-reperfusion as a sine qua non condition for the development of AKI. Loss of renal function can occur without histological signs of tubular damage or even necrosis. The detrimental effects of AKI are not limited to classical well-known symptoms such as fluid overload and electrolyte abnormalities. AKI can also lead to problems that are not readily appreciated at the bedside and can extend well beyond the ICU stay, including progression of CKD and impaired innate immunity. Experimental and small observational studies provide evidence that AKI impairs (innate) immunity and is associated with higher infection rates.

Conclusions

Meticulous fluid management is vital in critically ill children with cardiac disease. Fluid therapy is important to maintain adequate blood volume and perfusion pressure in order to support cardiac output, tissue perfusion, and oxygen delivery.

KEY POINTS

Question: Does individualized goal-directed fluid therapy (IGDT) improve early renal function in pigs subjected to renal transplantation?
Findings: IGDT did not improve early renal function but may reduce tissue inflammation and lead to better preservation of the glycocalyx.
Meaning: IGDT takes resources, and its introduction in the clinic should be preceded by further studies on long-term renal graft function because our primary end point early graft function was not positively affected.

Fluid management during renal transplantation is important for optimal organ perfusion. It reduces the risk of renal graft thrombosis, delayed graft function (DGF), and postoperative complications such as pneumonia and heart failure. Sufficient intravascular fluid is required for maintenance of an adequate cardiac output, blood pressure, and thus initial graft perfusion during anesthesia. Conversely, fluid overload may not only cause heart failure but also affect the microcirculation due to damage of the vascular endothelium leading to increased permeability and transport of fluids from the vascular bed to the interstitium. The vascular endothelium is lined with the glycocalyx, which plays a fundamental role in the regulation of vascular endothelial permeability, coagulation, and leukocyte adhesion and inflammation. –

In renal transplantation, the glycocalyx is disrupted through various mechanisms, including ischemia–reperfusion injury and the presence of proinflammatory cytokines. Inflammatory changes in the glycocalyx disrupt the microcirculation causing edema and loss of antioxidative properties. In addition, disturbance in the microcirculation can affect the tissue oxygenation. The complex interactions of these mechanisms, however, are poorly understood, and it is not clear whether more restrictive fluid therapies affect these parameters.

Fluid infusion during kidney transplantations has previously been done using a continuous high-volume fluid infusion therapy (HVFT) 10–15 mL/kg/h. Recently, individualized goal-directed fluid therapy (IGDT) is suggested to be the preferred method for optimizing the fluid infusion during various surgical procedures such as pancreaticoduodenectomiesand colorectal cancer surgery. Interestingly, IGDT has recently been suggested to reduce the incidence of DGF and the level of serum creatinine after 7 and 30 days when compared to HVFT.

### Diagnostic value of urinary sodium, chloride, urea, and flow [^1133HscU]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Up to 30% of hospitalized critically ill patients may have a rise in serum creatinine concentration. In addition to history and physical examination, there is diagnostic value in assessing urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in these patients. The correct interpretation of these urinary parameters can avoid unnecessary volume overload and mechanical ventilation, risk factors for increased mortality in patients with rising serum creatinine. The present article also discusses the role of arterial underfilling in causing prerenal azotemia in the presence of an increase in total body sodium and extracellular fluid expansion. As with extracellular fluid volume depletion, arterial underfilling secondary to impaired cardiac function or primary arterial vasodilation can delay or prevent recovery from ischemic or toxic acute tubular necrosis. The present brief review discusses the various aspects of the correct interpretation of urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in the setting of a rising serum creatinine concentration.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: evaluation and management [^116ryNTJ]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fluid overload is frequently found in acute kidney injury patients in critical care units. Recent studies have shown the relationship of fluid overload with adverse outcomes; hence, manage and optimization of fluid balance becomes a central component of the management of critically ill patients.

Discussion

In critically ill patients, in order to restore cardiac output, systemic blood pressure and renal perfusion an adequate fluid resuscitation is essential. Achieving an appropriate level of volume management requires knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology, evaluation of volume status, and selection of appropriate solution for volume repletion, and maintenance and modulation of the tissue perfusion. Numerous recent studies have established a correlation between fluid overload and mortality in critically ill patients. Fluid overload recognition and assessment requires an accurate documentation of intakes and outputs; yet, there is a wide difference in how it is evaluated, reviewed and utilized. Accurate volume status evaluation is essential for appropriate therapy since errors of volume evaluation can result in either in lack of essential treatment or unnecessary fluid administration, and both scenarios are associated with increased mortality. There are several methods to evaluate fluid status; however, most of the tests currently used are fairly inaccurate. Diuretics, especially loop diuretics, remain a valid therapeutic alternative. Fluid overload refractory to medical therapy requires the application of extracorporeal therapies.

Summary

In critically ill patients, fluid overload is related to increased mortality and also lead to several complications like pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, delayed wound healing, tissue breakdown, and impaired bowel function. Therefore, the evaluation of volume status is crucial in the early management of critically ill patients. Diuretics are frequently used as an initial therapy; however, due to their limited effectiveness the use of continuous renal replacement techniques are often required for fluid overload treatment. Successful fluid overload treatment depends on precise assessment of individual volume status, understanding the principles of fluid management with ultrafiltration, and clear treatment goals.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^1178DFgo]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

The decision to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) and the optimal timing for commencement is a difficult decision faced by clinicians when treating acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care setting. Without clinically significant ureamic symptoms or emergent indications (electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload) the timing of RRT initiation remains contentious and inconsistent across health providers. Current trends of initiating RRT in the ICU are often based on isolated blood urea levels without clear guidelines demonstrating an upper limit for treatment. Although the appropriate upper limit remains unclear, it is reasonable to conclude that a blood urea level less than 40 mmol/L is not in itself an indication for RRT, especially in the absence of supporting evidence of kidney impairment (anuria, elevated serum creatinine), presenting a welcome reminder to treat the patient and not a number.

Fluid overload is a common and important complication encountered in the care of patients with end-stage kidney failure receiving hemodialysis. Fluid overload not only causes unpleasant symptomatology for patients on dialysis, but also leads to increased incidence of hospitalization and mortality. Given the association of fluid overload with adverse outcomes in patients with end-stage kidney failure on hemodialysis, it is paramount that we identify effective and reliable methods to determine fluid status in such patients.

Fluid management

Much of the evidence on fluid management in ABI is derived from TBI guidelines. A negative fluid balance has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients with TBI, whereas fluid overload can cause systemic complications or cerebral edema and increased ICP. A multicenter study evaluating variable fluid management in patients with TBI found that incrementally positive fluid balance was associated with increased ICU mortality (OR, 1.10 per 0.1 L increase; 95% CI 1.07–1.12) and poor functional outcomes (OR, 1.04 per 0.1 L increase; 95% CI 1.02–1.05). Notably, these data likely represent confounding by indication, as sicker patients are more likely to receive additional volume. While the study did not assess renal outcomes, patients receiving a mean daily fluid balance of ≥ 0.37 L were more likely to undergo RRT than those with < 0.37 L (4% vs. 2%; P = 0.021). Reports on the association between fluid balance and renal outcomes in ABI are scarce. However, in non-neurological critically ill patients, the relationship between fluid overload and AKI is well-established due to factors like venous congestion, increased renal interstitial pressure, and decreased renal blood flow and GFR as observed in patients with cardiorenal syndrome.

### Should chloride-rich crystalloids remain the mainstay of fluid resuscitation to prevent' pre-renal'acute kidney injury? con [^1115tQZe]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Saline infusions have been shown to cause a greater increase in interstitial fluid volume (and, hence, edema) than balanced crystalloids and this may lead to a relatively greater increase in renal volume. Even small increases in the volume of an organ enclosed by a relatively non-expansible capsule may lead to intracapsular hypertension, which may further compromise tissue perfusion, reduce microvascular blood flow, and impair organ function. Increase in renal intracapsular pressure may decrease the pressure gradient across the renal arterioles and, in keeping with Poiseuille's law, may have an additional impact on decreasing flow velocity. Improvement in renal function and increased urine output have been demonstrated in kidneys subjected to capsulotomy following massive preoperative volume replacement with blood and crystalloids in hypovolemic monkeys.

Furthermore, just as the increased interstitial fluid overload caused by large volumes of saline infusions can result in peripheral edema, it may also cause splanchnic edema, intestinal stretch increased abdominal pressure, ascites, and even the abdominal compartment syndrome, which can further compromise renal and gastrointestinal function.

### Renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury: controversy and consensus [^115yKvmh]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Renal replacement therapy in other conditions

Cardiac failure and cardiorenal syndromes

Patients with cardiac failure have reduced cardiac output and arterial underfilling but also venous congestion. Both of these aspects may cause AKI by reducing renal perfusion pressure. Mechanical ultrafiltration may be useful to resolve fluid overload by achieving better sodium removal per unit volume than diuretic therapy, thus resulting in better improvement of cardiovascular function. In the UNLOAD study, ultrafiltration compared with diuretics in patients with cardiac failure and impaired renal function resulted in lower rates of re-hospitalization, but the subsequent CARRESS (Effectiveness of Ultrafiltration in Treating People With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure and Cardiorenal Syndrome) study, in a similar population, was discontinued early with no evidence of benefit from ultrafiltration. However, in the CARRESS study, ultrafiltration was applied without clear evidence of diuretic resistance and fluid removal was set at a fixed rate for all patients and without the same level of hemodynamic support allowed in the pharmacological arm. Finally, in a case series of 63 chronic heart failure patients with diuretic-resistant fluid overload, treatment with slow continuous ultrafiltration was associated with an improvement in central pressures and cardiac index after 48 hours of treatment. Outcomes were favorable in patients who did not require transition to RRT for solute clearance; however, only 8 of 37 who received RRT survived with recovered renal function. Thus, diuretic resistance and the need for RRT may be markers of the severity of chronic disease and of poor outcome where treatment options may be limited. Furthermore, HF, but not ultrafiltration, may allow sodium and water removal to be dissociated, with specific homeostatic benefits in acute cardiorenal syndromes.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: evaluation and management [^116XbSvE]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fluid overload is frequently found in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Increasing fluid overload should not merely be considered an expected consequence of fluid resuscitation or severe AKI, it should be seen as a probably mediator of adverse outcomes. In critically ill patients, recent studies have highlighted the role of fluid overload on adverse outcomes. Observational studies in pediatric patients who required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) have shown an association between fluid overload and mortality. Restrictive fluid management strategies are beneficial during acute respiratory distress syndrome and following major surgery since they reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and the rate of cardiopulmonary complications. In concert with these data, the control and optimization of fluid balance is a key element of critically ill patients management, since inadequate fluid removal is associated with peripheral edema and pulmonary edema, which can retard weaning from mechanical ventilation, or compromise wound healing. We will focus on the evaluation and management of fluid overload in the intensive care unit (ICU).

### Fluid balance as a biomarker: impact of fluid overload on outcome in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury [^112YdvwU]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Fluid therapy is fundamental to the acute resuscitation of critically ill patients. In general, however, early and appropriate goal-directed fluid therapy contributes to a degree of fluid overload in most if not all patients. Recent data imply that a threshold may exist beyond which, after acute resuscitation, additional fluid therapy may cause harm. In patients with acute kidney injury and/or oliguria, a positive fluid balance is almost universal. Few studies have examined the impact of fluid balance on clinical outcomes in critically ill adults with acute kidney injury. Payen and coworkers, in a secondary analysis of the SOAP (Sepsis Occurrence in Acutely Ill Patients) study, now present evidence that there is an independent association between mortality and positive fluid balance in a cohort of critically ill patients with acute kidney injury. In this commentary, we discuss these findings within the context of prior literature and propose that assessment of fluid balance should be considered as a potentially valuable biomarker of critical illness.

### Science and fiction in critical care: established concepts with or without evidence? [^111tzhKu]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Dogma #1: Give fluids, diuretics, and vasopressors if urinary output decreases

Most oliguric intensive care unit (ICU) patients receive fluids, diuretics, and/or vasopressors with the goal to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI). This treatment, however, is based on the belief that AKI in critically ill patients results from renal ischaemia. Whereas fluids and vasopressors are usually administered to increase renal blood flow and in proportion oxygen delivery, diuretics are given to reduce the osmolarity in the renal medulla. This is expected to increase glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and ultimately improve renal function.

Oliguria, however, is a clinical symptom rather than a disease. The underlying mechanisms include, but are not restricted to, hypovolaemia, physiologic stress response, tubular damage, post-renal obstruction or a combination of these factors. If hypovolaemia is not the cause of oliguria, it does not make sense to administer fluids for its treatment. Giving fluids to patients who are not hypovolaemic may in fact harm the kidneys by increasing intracapsular pressure, thereby further reducing urinary output. Hence, administering fluids to these patients may lead into a vicious cycle of infusing more and more fluids to treat oliguria, which is eventually a result of over-hydration. Furthermore, if functional renal damage is present, e.g. due to ischaemia or nephrotoxins, treating oliguria with fluids or diuretics is unlikely to improve renal function. In this context, it is also noteworthy that the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for AKI recommend neither fluid therapy beyond the correction of hypovolaemia nor diuretics for the treatment of AKI. This is supported by the fact that clinical evidence for a sustained increase in urine output or improvement in renal blood flow secondary to fluids and/or diuretics is lacking. Conversely, indiscriminately giving fluids to oliguric patients increases the risk of fluid overload with negative consequences on morbidity. Although fluid overload has been identified as independent risk factor for AKI in critically ill patients, "fill and spill" ("fill" the circulation and urine will "spill") is still a dogma in many ICUs. Likewise, the concept of "squeeze and diurese" is commonly applied. It aims to increase mean arterial blood pressure with vasopressors ("squeeze") and at the same time administer loop diuretics to paralyse the medulla and avoid ischaemia ("diurese"). Interestingly, no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) support the latter treatment strategies.

### Fluid overload is an independent risk factor for acute kidney injury in critically ill patients: results of a cohort study [^1138vdtb]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute Kidney injury (AKI) is common and increases mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU). We carried out this study to explore whether fluid overload is an independent risk factor for AKI.

Methods

Single-center prospective, observational study. Consecutively admitted, ICU patients were followed for development of AKI. Intravenous fluid volumes, daily fluid balances were measured, hourly urine volumes, daily creatinine levels were recorded.

Results

Three hundred thirty nine patients were included; AKI developed in 141 (41.6%) patients; RISK in 27 (8%) patients; INJURY in 25 (7%); FAILURE in 89 (26%) by the RIFLE criteria. Fluid balance was significantly higher in patients with AKI; 1755 ± 2189 v/s 924 ± 1846 ml, p < 0.001 on ICU day 1. On multivariate regression analysis, a net fluid balance in first 24 h of ICU admission, OR 1.02 (95% CI 1.01,1.03 p = 0.003), percentage of fluid accumulation adjusted for body weight OR1.009 (95% CI 1.001,1.017, p = 0.02), fluid balance in first 24 h of ICU admission with serum creatinine adjusted for fluid balance, OR 1.024 (95% CI 1.012,1,035, p = 0.005), Age, OR 1.02 95% CI 1.01,1.03, p < 0.001, CHF, OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.16,8.32, p = 0.023), vasopressor requirement on ICU day one, OR 1.9 (95% CI 1.13,3.19, p = 0.014) and Colistin OR 2.3 (95% CI 1.3, 4.02, p < 0.001) were significant predictors of AKI. There was no significant association between fluid type; Chloride-liberal, Chloride-restrictive, and AKI.

Conclusions

Fluid overload is an independent risk factor for AKI.

### Identification of candidate serum biomarkers for severe septic shock-associated kidney injury via microarray [^115QhZVo]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Septic shock leads to significant morbidity and mortality in critically ill adult and pediatric patients. Meanwhile, acute kidney injury (AKI) is also known to be independently associated with mortality and morbidity in critically ill patients. The treatment of sepsis costs the US population over $15 billion/year for adults and over $2 billion/year for children, while the costs for AKI approach $10 billion/year for adults alone. Sepsis is the most common precipitant for AKI in both populations, and the development of kidney injury in the context of sepsis is a poor prognostic sign. Together the two disease processes carry up to 75% mortality.

Effective therapies for septic-shock-associated acute kidney injury (SSAKI) are lacking. Detection schemes for SSAKI have been and still are dependent on serum creatinine, a flawed real-time marker of AKI. Diagnoses of SSAKI based upon changes in creatinine, therefore, are considerably varied and create heterogeneity between studies investigating AKI therapy. Biomarker research seeking to identify more robust markers of AKI has yielded promising results. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), IL-18, and cystatin C have all demonstrated encouraging efficacy for predicting ischemic or nephrotoxic AKI and its severity. Sepsis intrinsically induces increased expression of some AKI biomarkers (for example, NGAL), and studies of NGAL levels in patients with SSAKI often demonstrate high sensitivity with modest specificity.

Importantly, the pathophysiology of SSAKI may be unique from that of ischemic or nephrotoxic AKI. Therapies aiming to restore renal perfusion in ischemic AKI have not been demonstrated to be particularly effective and may be even less effective in SSAKI, a process that may not be secondary to impaired glomerular preload. Persistent SSAKI may fall into the class of fluid-unresponsive AKI. Renal replacement therapy has been used as therapy for AKI and data exist demonstrating that initiation prior to accumulation of excessive fluid overload may improve outcomes. The aggregate data, however, show that patients with SSAKI have consistently increased mortality, even with early renal replacement therapy initiation. The modest efficacy of biomarkers at identifying SSAKI also underscores the notion that the pathophysiology of SSAKI is unique from other etiologies of AKI. There is a need to identify novel candidate biomarkers of SSAKI, which would expedite early treatment aimed at preventing the effects of this highly morbid complication of sepsis.

Regarding inpatient care for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to hemodynamic monitoring, ADQI 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain additional monitoring in patients with persistent AKI to reevaluate hemodynamic and volume status, adequacy of kidney perfusion, and to identify complications of AKI, such as fluid overload, acidosis, and hyperkalemia, as these could indicate a need for RRT.

### Effects of fluid administration on renal perfusion in critically ill patients [^117RuEf8]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The poor ability of systemic hemodynamic variables to predict an increase in urine output following fluid challenge was notable. Although renal responders had higher baseline MAP, changes in MAP and PP were not associated with renal response to fluids. This observation is consistent with previous investigations by Bourgoin et al. and LeDoux et al. which showed the lack of correlation between changes in MAP and response in urine output or serum creatinine concentrations using norepinephrine to increase MAP from 65 to 85 mmHg. However, Deruddre et al. observed an increase in urine output when MAP was increased from 65 to 75 mmHg using norepinephrine infusion but not when it was increased further from 75 to 85 mmHg. A possible deleterious effect of norepinephrine was considered to explain the observations in the high MAP range. Interestingly, the norepinephrine infusion rate was higher in non-responders than in responders in our renal responsive 0.2 and 0.3 ml/kg/hour groups. Nevertheless, the norepinephrine infusion rate was not correlated with changes in urine output or in RI. The impact of MAP may be affected by individual factors and, although a minimal MAP is required, further increases in MAP are often not associated with improved urine output, creatinine level or renal hemodynamics.

In apparent contrast to our observations, Schnell et al. did not observe significant changes in RI in septic patients who responded to a fluid challenge. However, these authors defined the response to fluid challenge as an increase in descending aortic blood flow evaluated by esophageal Doppler, which is thus a systemic response to fluid challenge, while we preferred to define the response to fluids as an increase in urine output. Hence, their study and ours concur to underline the dissociation between the systemic and the renal response to fluid challenge. Our study further emphasizes that an improvement in renal hemodynamics is essential for the increase in urine output to occur. In addition, we show that changes in MAP and PP, routinely used as surrogates of improved renal hemodynamics, are poorly associated with RI and ineffective at predicting an increase in urine output.

### Perioperative fluid management in kidney transplantation: a black box [^114wzBMR]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Perioperative intravascular fluid assessment

The assessment of a patient's intravascular volume for achievement of appropriate fluid management is a major challenge for the clinician and has been shown to improve postoperative outcomes. Understanding of the following four definitions is essential in perioperative care:
Euvolemia: a state in which the vascular volume is adequate for filling of the heart and maintenance of an appropriate CO to generate the appropriate oxygen supply for tissue needs.
Fluid responsiveness: a state in which an increase in vascular volume increases the stroke volume (SV) and CO. The notion of fluid responsiveness does not necessarily mean that the patient will benefit from or need fluid therapy. Parameters of perfusion should guide the decision to assess the fluid response rather than responsiveness in a compromised patient.
Fluid overload: a state in which excessive accumulation of fluid in the vascular system is caused by excessive parenteral infusion or deficiencies in cardiovascular or renal fluid volume regulation.
Hypovolemia: a state in which effective circulatory volume is decreased and there is insufficient oxygen delivery to tissues, possibly resulting in organ dysfunction.

Despite a clear definition, there is no gold standard for the diagnosis and treatment of hypovolemia. Both acute and chronic conditions interact with fluid homeostasis, and medical history must always be considered. Progressive loss of renal function results in various adaptive and compensatory changes to maintain homeostasis with glomerular filtration rates below 10 ml/min, and these abnormalities typically have clinical consequences. A patient with end-stage renal disease has a disturbed acid–base and electrolyte balance and compromised hemodynamic autoregulation. Inflammatory mediators can alter renal hemodynamics and cause glomerular, tubular and interstitial damage, if uncontrolled.

In addition to the uncertainty associated with the patient's volume state, appropriate targets remain unclear. To determine which monitoring method provides the most accurate information in the context of kidney transplantation, and which target to rely on, we will review previously implemented methods, their advantages and disadvantages, and their relative utility in predicting fluid responsiveness and tissue perfusion. Methods range from conventional techniques such as clinical history and physical examination, measurement of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), urine output (UOP), CVP and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), to novel technologies such as echocardiography, cardiorespiratory interactions and dynamic analyses of flow parameters.

### Influence of progressive renal dysfunction in chronic heart failure [^115EZaaZ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic heart failure (CHF) is often associated with impaired renal function due to hypoperfusion. Such patients are very sensitive to changes in renal perfusion pressure, and may develop acute tubular necrosis if the pressure falls too far. The situation is complicated by the use of diuretics, ACE inhibitors and spironolactone, all of which may affect renal function and potassium balance. Chronic renal failure (CRF) may also be associated with fluid overload. Anaemia and hypertension in CRF contribute to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which carries a poor prognosis, so correction of these factors is important.

### Year in review 2013: critical care-nephrology [^117VWcbq]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Risk factors and hemodynamics of acute kidney injury

Kellum and Lameire proposed the concept of risk factors and susceptibility. The main external stressors that may cause AKI include sepsis, shock, burns, trauma, cardiopulmonary bypass, nephrotoxic drugs, radiocontrast agents, and poisonous plants and animals. However, the chances of developing AKI after exposure to the same insult depend on a number of 'susceptibility factors' that vary widely from individual to individual. For susceptibility factors we may consider advanced age, dehydration or volume depletion, female gender, black race, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer and anemia. Therefore, it is important to screen patients who have undergone an exposure and to continue monitoring them until the risk has subsided. To better interpret the pathophysiology of AKI and its interplay with several hemodynamic variables, a retrospective study including 137 septic ICU patients was performed: AKI was defined as occurrence of a novel AKI case or an increase in the stage of previously diagnosed AKI during the first 5 days following ICU admission based on the AKIN criteria. Central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output, mean arterial pressure (MAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2) or mixed venous oxygen saturation were analyzed. One-half of patients in the study had new or persistent AKI. MAP, ScvO 2 and cardiac output were not significantly different between AKI and non-AKI patients. The development or progression of AKI, regardless of the level of fluid balance and positive end-expiratory pressure, was strongly associated with the CVP level. This suggests participation of venous congestion in the physiopathology of AKI in severe sepsis and septic shock. Patients with AKI had lower DAP and higher CVP (P = 0.0003). Although the role of renal hypoperfusion (low cardiac output or hypovolemia) is believed to contribute to the development of sepsis-induced renal dysfunction, AKI appears to be only partially reversible after the optimization of systemic hemodynamics. Fluid resuscitation and pressure optimization is a landmark treatment for septic patients in order to improve renal perfusion pressure. For some patients, the induced CVP elevation may overcome the DAP increase, reducing renal perfusion with harmful effects on renal function. This aspect is supported by the recently reported association between fluid overload and mortality in critically ill patients, especially in patients with AKI or septic shock. The creation of a vicious circle with oliguria and fluid-loading may then aggravate AKI. Therefore, targeting a pre-defined CVP as a therapeutic target might not be suitable in septic patients. Legrand and colleagues suggested instead that hemodynamic targets are best achieved at low CVPs (that is, a CVP less than 8 to 12 mmHg). The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines mention that 'in mechanically ventilated patients or those with known preexisting decreased ventricular compliance, a higher target CVP of 12–15 mmHg should be achieved to account for the impediment in filling'. The results of this study suggest, instead, that such targets might be too high from a 'renal' perspective. Therefore, a strategy of fluid restriction in these patients is an important option to be considered.

### A glimpse into the future of transcatheter interventional heart Failure Therapies [^113nbxCh]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Renal Perfusion in Decompensated HF

Acute decompensated HF is the cause for a majority of hospitalizations for patients with chronic HF. Factors considered to contribute to a decline in renal perfusion include decreased cardiac output, increased central venous pressure (CVP), and renal arterial vasoconstriction due to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to decreased urine output and diuretic resistance. Based on current mechanistic understanding of determinants of urine output and fluid balance in HF, multiple new catheter-based technologies have been developed to treat volume overload not responding adequately to intravenous diuretics. In general, these technologies fall into several categories, including devices that induce venodilation, remove fluid from the vasculature or interstitial space, increase renal artery pressure, decrease renal vein pressure, or selectively dilate the renal arteries. Only the devices relevant to catheter-based interventions, those that enhance renal artery pressure, and those that decrease renal vein pressure are summarized subsequently (Figure 2).

### Euvolemia – A critical target in the management of acute kidney injury [^1168dazj]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

It has been clearly established that critically ill patients with sepsis require prompt fluid resuscitation. The optimal amount of fluid and when to taper this resuscitation is less clear. There is a growing evidence that fluid overload leads to acute kidney injury, and increased morbidity and mortality. A clinician's best intentions in resuscitating a patient can lead to too much of a good thing. Currently, there are several bedside tools to aid in determining a patient's response to a fluid challenge as well as in the assessment of the current volume status. Guidelines are not available on the exact rate of fluid overload removal and what medicinal or mechanical modality is most favorable. We discuss our experience and an examination of the literature on the problems with fluid overload, and how a patient may benefit from forced fluid removal.

### Fluid balance and mortality in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury: a multicenter prospective epidemiological study [^111pY21B]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Early fluid resuscitation to expand intravascular volume and maintain organ perfusion is a core concept in the management of critical illness. However, fluid administration increases the risk of fluid overload (FO). Clinically, FO manifests as an expansion of interstitial space and increased venous pressure, resulting in tissue edema, organ dysfunction, and adverse outcomes.

Congestion and increased venous pressure lead to increased renal subcapsular pressure and lowered renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The association between FO, the development of the abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), and the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) is well known. Some investigators have observed that FO remained independently associated with adverse outcomes in patients with AKI after accounting for the confounding effects of illness severity and hemodynamic instability.

In a study done by the Program to Improve Care in Acute Renal Disease (PICARD) group, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for mortality was 2.07 in patients with FO at initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). In this population, survivors who were taken off RRT showed significantly less FO than did patients who remained on RRT. Recently, a reanalysis of the data from the Randomized Evaluation of Normal vs. Augmented Level of Replacement Therapy study demonstrated that, in patients with AKI requiring RRT in the intensive care unit (ICU), a negative mean daily fluid balance was independently associated with a decreased risk of death and with more ICU-free and hospital-free days. FO is probably a severity marker or an independent factor for higher mortality in critically ill patients.

To date, there has been no multicenter study conducted on patients with AKI of Chinese descent. Thus, in our present study, we evaluated the impact of fluid balance on mortality in Chinese adult ICU patients with AKI.

### Fluid overload and kidney injury score: a multidimensional real-time assessment of renal disease burden in the critically ill patient [^114G59Bz]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Interruptive acute kidney injury alerts are reported to decrease acute kidney injury-related mortality in adults. Critically ill children have multiple acute kidney injury risk factors; although recognition has improved due to standardized definitions, subtle changes in serum creatinine make acute kidney injury recognition challenging. Age and body habitus variability prevent a uniform maximum threshold of creatinine. Exposure of nephrotoxic medications is common but not accounted for in kidney injury scores. Current severity of illness measures do not include fluid overload, a well-described mortality risk factor. We hypothesized that a multidimensional measure of renal status would better characterize renal severity of illness while maintaining or improving on correlation measures with adverse outcomes, when compared with traditional acute kidney injury staging.

Design

A novel, real-time, multidimensional, renal status measure, combining acute kidney injury, fluid overload greater than or equal to 15%, and nephrotoxin exposure, was developed (Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score) and prospectively applied to all patient encounters. Peak Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score values prior to discharge or death were used to measure correlation with outcomes.

Setting

Quarternary PICU of a freestanding children's hospital.

Patients

All patients admitted over 18 months.

Intervention

None.

Results

Peak Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score ranged between 0 and 14 in 2,830 PICU patients (median age, 5.5 yr; interquartile range, 1.3–12.9; 55% male), 66% of patients had Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score greater than or equal to 1. Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score was independently associated with PICU mortality and PICU and hospital length of stay when controlled for age, Pediatric Risk of Mortality-3, ventilator, pressor, and renal replacement therapy use (p = 0.047). Mortality increased from 1.5% in Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score 0 to 40% in Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score 8+. When urine output points were excluded, Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score was more strongly correlated with mortality than fluid overload or acute kidney injury definitions alone.

Conclusion

A multidimensional score of renal disease burden was significantly associated with adverse PICU outcomes. Further studies will evaluate Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score as a warning and decision support tool to impact patient-centered outcomes.

Consensus statement

In addition to the recommendations by KDIGO, no proven specific interventions exist to prevent or treat AKI complicating critical illness in the context of ARF/ARDS.

Rationale

Current recommendations for the care of patients with, or at risk of, AKI are based on the recommendations by the KDIGO expert committee in 2012, suggesting several interventions based around mitigating risk of further renal injury, including regular monitoring of urinary output, careful evaluation of fluid balance, optimization of haemodynamic status and review of potentially nephrotoxic medications. There is no strong evidence for any specific intervention affecting the course of AKI arising in the context of respiratory disease, although the early recognition of systemic or pulmonary infection followed by timely treatment with antibiotics is key, as is attention to adequate fluid status.

Recommendations for practice

We recommend treating patients with ARF/ARDS according to the KDIGO guidelines who are at risk of or with AKI (Grade 1C).
We recommend at least daily measurement of serum creatinine and regular monitoring of urine output in patients with severe ARF/ARDS to detect development of AKI (Grade 1B).
We recommend the implementation of adequate screening measures for early recognition of pulmonary infections, followed by early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy, which is associated with lower risk of AKI (Grade 1C).

Recommendations for research

As a sentinel organ failure associated with worsening prognosis, renal outcomes should be reported in studies of interventions for ARF/ARDS in the ICU.
Further research should aim at refining fluid management strategies and haemodynamic management that might favourably affect both kidney and lung function.

Question: What are the interventions or modifiable risk factors to mitigate AKI among patients with ARF/ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation?

Consensus statements

There is limited evidence that lung protective ventilation is associated with reduced risk of AKI in patients with ARF/ARDS.
There is evidence that certain adjunctive measures used for ARF/ARDS treatment may be detrimental to kidney function and that some ICU care processes may modify the risk of AKI.
There is insufficient evidence that non-invasive respiratory support is associated with lower risk of AKI compared with IMV.
There is insufficient evidence that specific weaning strategies from IMV impact the risk of AKI.
Fluid overload should be avoided in ARF/ARDS patients.

Extracorporeal therapies

Fluid overload refractory to medical therapy requires the use of extracorporeal therapies such as continuous renal replacement therapies since critically ill patients often show hemodynamic instability and/or multiple organ dysfunctions. Accurate management of fluid balance becomes obligatory with the ultimate goal of improving pulmonary gas exchange and organ perfusion while maintaining stable hemodynamic parameters. The optimal renal replacement therapy for patients with AKI and fluid overload has not been defined yet and there is still an ongoing debate. Choice of the initial modality needs to be based on the availability of resources, local expertise; the individual needs of the patients, and finally on patient's hemodynamic status.

In patients with fluid overload, CRRT provides a slower fluid removal over intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) resulting in more hemodynamic stability and better fluid balance control, other advantages of CRRT over IHD include: a slower control of solute concentration avoiding large fluctuations and fluid shifts, which reduce the risk of cerebral edema, the great flexibility in terms of treatment adjustment to patient's needs at anytime, and finally CRRT allows to perform the treatment with relatively simple and user friendly machines. Some large observational studies have suggested that CRRT is an independent predictor of renal recovery among survivors.

In the absence of definite data to support the use of particular type of renal replacement therapy, one should consider CRRT and IHD as complementary therapies. Therefore, during the treatment of critically ill patients with AKI and fluid overload transitions between CRRT and IHD are frequent, and are frequently driven by patients' hemodynamic status.

Slow continuous ultrafiltration (SCUF) is a type of continuous renal replacement therapy that is usually performed with low blood flow rates (50 to 100 ml/min), and ultrafiltration rates between 100 and 300 ml/h according to fluid balance necessities. Relatively small surface-area filters can be employed with reduced heparin doses since low ultrafiltration and blood flow rates are required.

Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is another CRRT technique that allows meticulous, minute-to-minute control of fluid balance by providing continuous fluid, electrolyte, and toxin clearance.

Key messages

Fluid challenge results in reduced intrarenal vasoconstriction in hemodynamically impaired ICU patients.
In hemodynamically impaired patients, changes in MAP after a fluid challenge cannot predict an increase in urine output.
However, changes in renal interlobar artery resistivity index in these patients can predict an increase in urine output.
Nevertheless, interlobar resistivity index cannot be recommended for routine use, because of the relatively limited magnitude of the changes and need for experienced ultrasonographers.

KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) guideline states that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are "appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials", but concludes "there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States". The panel "generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI", while emphasizing "the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations" and "the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI". For clinical context, AKI "represents the sudden loss of kidney function, generally occurring over the course of hours to days and resulting in the retention of metabolic waste products and the development of volume overload and electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities".

### Improving awareness of kidney function through electronic urine output monitoring: a comparative study [^11633vue]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The goal of intensive and automated monitoring of vital signs and physiological parameters in the intensive care unit (ICU) is to provide timely information and support appropriate intervention by healthcare providers. Additionally, databases of these vital signs are crucial for retrospective studies of illness progression and to bring about protocol changes for better patient-directed care. Unfortunately, urine output (UO) remains one of the few parameters monitored manually.

Over the past two decades, UO has been validated as a vital biomarker for acute kidney injury (AKI). The current classification for AKI recommended by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for AKI, integrates both serum creatinine (SCr) and UO in their severity score for AKI. The KDIGO guidelines suggest use of a "bundle" of supportive measures in patients at high risk for AKI. This bundle includes, inter alia, maintenance of volume status and monitoring of SCr and UO. UO monitoring is necessary to detect decreases in renal blood flow and/or a decline in renal perfusion pressure.

In a study examining UO monitoring, with or without AKI, patients who had intensive UO monitoring (defined as a manual measurement at least every 3 h), had significantly less cumulative fluid volume and fluid overload. They were also significantly less likely to receive vasopressors over the first 72 h of their ICU stay. Intensive UO monitoring was shown to be independently associated with improved 30-day survival among patients developing AKI.

A recent study reviewed surgical ICU patient UO monitoring protocols. Only 66% showed any UO monitoring as part of their routine care. Most reports on AKI claim to use KDIGO guidelines but use only the SCr criterion in their definition of AKI, i.e. they fail to include the UO criterion. UO monitoring is a simple, sensitive, and easily available biomarker. Emphasizing its strict use could allow for earlier detection of AKI. Inconsistent UO measurements and the nature of manual monitoring alters the reported incidence and may delay the diagnosis of AKI. This can lead to underestimation of the association between AKI and ICU mortality. In a recent review of the impact of integrating biomarkers for patient care for AKI, the authors presented evidence of improvement of patient outcomes when close monitoring of functional biomarkers for AKI (such as SCr and UO) was performed. Specifically, when using electronic health monitoring and real-time data, these biomarkers, used alongside patient risk factors and renal reserve tests, help target care bundles to optimize patient care.

### Optimal perfusion targets in cardiogenic Shock [^115BWjRw]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Urine output and renal markers

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by an abrupt decrease in kidney structure and/or function and is seen in 15% to 55% of patients with CS. Diagnosis is most often made based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria, which include rises in serum creatinine and reductions in eGFR and urine output. The eGFR can be difficult to interpret when the plasma creatinine is changing, as it may be in states of shock, and so the concept of kinetic eGFR has gained momentum, as it gives us the power to estimate kidney function in a dynamic and rapidly changing clinical state. The relationship between the heart and kidneys is complex, with Ronco et alfirst proposing the 5-part classification of cardiorenal syndrome: type 1 refers to abrupt worsening of cardiac function producing renal injury; type 2 refers to chronic heart failure progressively eroding renal function and causing chronic kidney disease; type 3 is sudden worsening of renal function leading to acute cardiac decompensation; type 4 refers to chronic kidney disease leading to decreased cardiac function/increased risk of cardiovascular events; and type 5 refers to systemic conditions that result in both cardiac and renal dysfunction. AKI among patients with CS is usually due to a type 1 cardiorenal syndrome, a consequence of decreased cardiac output and renal perfusion, with subsequent oliguria. AKI may also be mediated by venous congestion, as central venous pressure is a reliable predictor for AKI in CS. Several compensatory mechanisms in CS can further worsen renal function: an elevated sympathetic tone can produce severe systemic vasoconstriction, ultimately overcoming renal autoregulation, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system produces sodium and water retention, further increasing cardiac afterload. The development of AKI in CS is associated with poor outcomes, including need for long-term dialysis, prolonged hospitalization, and both short- and long-term mortality. In fact, the retrospective review of 118 patients with CS by Koreny et alfound that one-third of patients developed AKI in the first 24 hours of CS, conferring a significant mortality risk of 87% compared to 53% in those patients who did not develop AKI. Beyond strategies to protect the kidneys from further insults during CS, there are limited therapeutic interventions, and it is still unknown if the use of renal replacement therapy (RRT) improves outcomes in patients, and if so, what the optimal timing and strategy is in CS. It is evident from the literature that the need for RRT for CS-associated AKI is associated with a marked increased risk of in-hospital mortality, need for temporary MCS, and bleeding requiring blood transfusion. Further risks from dialysis catheters themselves must also be considered and include vascular complications, acquired infections, catheter-associated thrombus formation, and central venous stenosis, which may impact long-term venous access. The STARRT-AKI (Standard vs Accelerated Initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy) trial demonstrated no mortality reduction in the accelerated use of RRT in critically ill patients; the authors found that early dialysis increased the risk of long-term dialysis dependence, evoking concern for dialysis-induced kidney injury. As only a small proportion of patients ultimately died from refractory CS (approximately 5% of total deaths), these findings support the need for dedicated large clinical trials examining RRT timing and strategies in CS. RRT can be considered in cases of refractory volume overload, marked disruption in acid-base homeostasis, or electrolyte abnormalities, in line with the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines. The goal with continuous RRT is to reverse life-threatening biochemical abnormalities and support end-organ function while awaiting evidence of renal recovery. There are no specific creatinine or eGFR thresholds yet established, but decisions around RRT initiation should be tailored to individual patients. Finally, while several novel biomarkers have been studied, the prognostic value of serum creatinine on short- and long-term mortality in CS remains greater than that of cystatin C, kidney injury molecule 1, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin.

### Differential effect on mortality of the timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy according to the criteria used to diagnose acute kidney injury: an IDEAL-ICU substudy [^116Rt52A]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Endpoints

The primary outcome was death from any cause at 90 days after randomization.

Secondary endpoints included ICU and hospital mortality, ICU and hospital length of stay, RRT-free days, RRT dependence at hospital discharge, and renal function in surviving patients who were not RRT dependent at hospital discharge (creatinine absolute values and creatinine progression, expressed as percentage change in creatinine values from baseline values).

In the present analysis, we evaluated the criteria for emergency renal replacement therapy within 7 days after randomization in all 3 groups, notably: severe metabolic acidosis (defined as a pH less than 7.15 and a base deficit of more than 5 mmol per liter or a bicarbonate level of 18 mmol or less per liter), severe hyperkalemia (defined as a potassium level of more than 6.5 mmol per liter with characteristic electrocardiographic changes) and fluid overload (defined as extravascular fluid overload that was refractory to diuretics, with pulmonary edema).

### Fluid overload associates with major adverse kidney events in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury requiring continuous renal replacement therapy [^111z8zig]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We examined the association between fluid overload and major adverse kidney events in critically ill patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

ICU in a tertiary medical center.

Patients

Four-hundred eighty-one critically ill adults requiring continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Fluid overload was assessed as fluid balance from admission to continuous renal replacement therapy initiation, adjusted for body weight. Major adverse kidney events were defined as a composite of mortality, renal replacement therapy-dependence or inability to recover 50% of baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (if not on renal replacement therapy) evaluated up to 90 days after discharge. Patients with fluid overload less than or equal to 10% were less likely to experience major adverse kidney events than those with fluid overload greater than 10% (71.6% vs 79.4%; p = 0.047). Multivariable logistic regression showed that fluid overload greater than 10% was associated with a 58% increased odds of major adverse kidney events (p = 0.046), even after adjusting for timing of continuous renal replacement therapy initiation. There was also a 2.7% increased odds of major adverse kidney events for every 1 day increase from ICU admission to continuous renal replacement therapy initiation (p = 0.024). Fluid overload greater than 10% was also found to be independently associated with an 82% increased odds of hospital mortality (p = 0.004) and 2.5 fewer ventilator-free days (p = 0.044), compared with fluid overload less than or equal to 10%.

Conclusions

In critically ill patients with acute kidney injury requiring continuous renal replacement therapy, greater than 10% fluid overload was associated with higher risk of 90-day major adverse kidney events, including mortality and decreased renal recovery. Increased time between ICU admission and continuous renal replacement therapy initiation was also associated with decreased renal recovery. Fluid overload represents a potentially modifiable risk factor, independent of timing of continuous renal replacement therapy initiation, that should be further examined in interventional studies.

### Combining creatinine and volume kinetics identifies missed cases of acute kidney injury following cardiac arrest [^1144CPvP]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The model accounts for fluid input and urine output and helps avoid misdiagnosis of AKI and AKI severity. Creatinine and volume kinetics were combined to quantify dynamic changes in GFR in the critically ill, providing insight into disease progression. The model enabled diagnosis of AKI in a cohort of cardiac arrest patients despite maintenance of a normal plasma creatinine concentration. This highlights that plasma creatinine alone cannot be relied upon to diagnose AKI after cardiac arrest and suggests caution in interpreting AKI epidemiology and trials that rely solely on plasma creatinine to define outcomes. This suggests that injury biomarkers are essential for identifying AKI in some clinical scenarios. Volume kinetic modeling could also enhance our understanding of the effects of fluid loading as a mediator of poor clinical outcomes by quantifying the effects of fluid loading on different compartments.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: evaluation and management [^112pE19F]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Several complications like congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, delayed wound healing, tissue breakdown, and impaired bowel function are associated with fluid overload. Fluid overload has also been related to increased mortality. The optimal assessment of volume status in critically ill patients is of vital importance particularly during the early management of these patients. One key aspect of fluid overload management is to maintain hemodynamic stability and optimize organ function. Loop diuretics are frequently used as the initial therapy to treat critically ill patients with fluid overload; nevertheless, diuretics have limited effectiveness due to several factors such as underlying acute kidney injury that contribute to diuretic resistance. Renal replacement therapies are often required for optimal volume management in critically ill patients with fluid overload. In this setting, successful volume management depends on an accurate estimation of patients' fluid status, an adequate understanding of the principles of fluid overload treatment with ultrafiltration, and clear treatment goals.

Kidney donor — fluid resuscitation strategy: Most studies investigating renal graft function in resuscitated brain-dead organ donors are either retrospective case series or uncontrolled observational studies, but appropriate management of DI, restoration of adequate intravascular volume, and correction for acidosis were all associated with lower rates of delayed graft function and improved serum creatinine levels prior to organ recovery. IV fluids should be administered to maintain euvolemic volume status and addressing ongoing fluid losses and electrolyte disturbances associated with DI.

### Acute kidney injury in acute heart failure-when to worry and when not to worry? [^114W8Qzw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury is common in patients with acute decompensated heart failure. It is more common in patients with acute heart failure who suffer from chronic kidney disease. Worsening renal function is often defined as a rise in serum creatinine of more than 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 µmol/L) which, by definition, is acute kidney injury (AKI) stage 1. Perhaps the term AKI is more appropriate than worsening renal function as it is used universally by nephrologists, internists and other medical practitioners. In health, the heart and the kidney support each other to maintain the body's homeostasis. In disease, the heart and the kidney can adversely affect each other's function, causing further clinical deterioration. In patients presenting with acute heart failure and fluid overload, therapy with diuretics for decongestion often causes a rise in serum creatinine and AKI. However, in the longer term the decongestion improves survival and prevents hospital admissions despite rising serum creatinine and AKI. It is important to realize that renal venous congestion due to increased right-sided heart pressures in acute heart failure is a major cause of kidney dysfunction and hence decongestion therapy improves kidney function in the longer term. This review provides a perspective on the acceptable AKI with decongestion therapy, which is associated with improved survival, as opposed to AKI due to tubular injury related to sepsis or nephrotoxic drugs, which is associated with poor survival.

### Some biomarkers of acute kidney injury are increased in pre-renal acute injury [^115H1KWk]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Although patients were vigorously hydrated in accordance with ICU practice, our study was limited by a lack of fluid balance data to rule out volume depletion or objectify the response to deliberate fluid loading. Similarly, we lack data on diuretic use. By normalizing the biomarkers to urinary creatinine, we account, at least in part, for any potential differences in fluid loading. Although the largest study of its kind, the study remains limited by size; nearly 8% of patients were excluded because of insufficient follow-up plasma creatinine measurements or death before 48 h after admission. NGAL results were unavailable in another 4% of patients. Consequently, the modest number of patients in each group after stratification for duration and FENa means that the conclusions require validation in larger studies.

In summary, in critically ill patients, urinary biomarkers of injury increase in concentration with duration of AKI regardless of whether there is preservation of tubular function, as typified by a low FENa. This suggests that pre-renal AKI is simply a mild form of structural AKI rather than a unique functional form of AKI. Early return of renal function, as demonstrated by a decrease in creatinine, probably represents recovery, not reversibility, of a unique 'physiological' increase in serum creatinine. Although it remains theoretically possible that GFR may decrease in the absence of renal tubular injury, until there are studies demonstrating that urinary biomarkers of renal injury are absent in such cases, we suggest that the term 'pre-renal mechanisms' be used for classifying etiology but not type of AKI. Perhaps in the future AKI may be categorized according to extent of injury (biomarker concentration), extent and duration of glomerular functional change, and preservation or otherwise of sodium reabsorption or other tubular functions.

### Preventing acute kidney injury and its longer-term impact in the critically ill [^115yVJke]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Kidney preventive strategies

AKI prevention remains challenging, as current treatments typically begin only after a significant renal function decline. This reactive approach, based on the KDIGO definition of AKI (oliguria or elevated SCr), often delays intervention until kidney damage has already occurred. To mitigate AKI risk, KDIGO guidelines recommend proactive measures for high-risk patients, including consideration of advanced hemodynamic monitoring, meticulous volume management, blood pressure optimization, and avoidance of nephrotoxins, radiocontrast agents, and hyperglycemia — collectively referred to as the kidney prevention strategy. However, adherence to these recommendations in clinical practice remains suboptimal. It has been acknowledged that the complete AKI prevention strategy cannot be applied to every patient at high risk for AKI, because sometimes the use of nephrotoxic drugs is inevitable. The guideline recommends to avoid nephrotoxic drugs when possible, emphasizing that a risk–benefit assessment is always necessary.

Optimizing the hemodynamic situation is another component of the kidney preventive strategy, recognizing that hemodynamic instability may cause AKI. Therefore, advanced hemodynamic monitoring is recommended to optimize the mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and the fluid status.

The optimization of the fluid status is important because observational studies have shown an association between both excessive and insufficient fluid administration during the preoperative period and increased length of hospital stay and morbidity. A large RCT including 3000 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery compared a liberal with a restrictive fluid approach. Patients assigned to the liberal fluid group had a body weight increase of 1.6 kg compared with 0.3 kg in the restrictive fluid group within the first 24 h after surgery. The primary outcome, disability-free survival at 1 year, was similar in both groups. However, the occurrence of AKI was significantly higher in the restrictive balance group (8.6% vs. 5.0%, p < 0.001). Therefore, a mildly positive fluid balance (+ 1–2 L) by the end of surgery should be aimed to prevent the development of AKI.

### Perioperative acute kidney injury [^1134WCr8]. Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Perioperative organ injury is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality of surgical patients. Among different types of perioperative organ injury, acute kidney injury occurs particularly frequently and has an exceptionally detrimental effect on surgical outcomes. Currently, acute kidney injury is most commonly diagnosed by assessing increases in serum creatinine concentration or decreased urine output. Recently, novel biomarkers have become a focus of translational research for improving timely detection and prognosis for acute kidney injury. However, specificity and timing of biomarker release continue to present challenges to their integration into existing diagnostic regimens. Despite many clinical trials using various pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic interventions, reliable means to prevent or reverse acute kidney injury are still lacking. Nevertheless, several recent randomized multicenter trials provide new insights into renal replacement strategies, composition of intravenous fluid replacement, goal-directed fluid therapy, or remote ischemic preconditioning in their impact on perioperative acute kidney injury. This review provides an update on the latest progress toward the understanding of disease mechanism, diagnosis, and managing perioperative acute kidney injury, as well as highlights areas of ongoing research efforts for preventing and treating acute kidney injury in surgical patients.

### Assessment of the independent and synergistic effects of fluid overload and acute kidney injury on outcomes of critically ill children [^1139gojC]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Evaluate the independent and synergistic associations of fluid overload and acute kidney injury with outcome in critically ill pediatric patients.

Design

Secondary analysis of the Acute Kidney Injury in Children Expected by Renal Angina and Urinary Biomarkers (NCT01735162) prospective observational study.

Setting

Single-center quaternary level PICU.

Patients

One-hundred forty-nine children 3 months to 25 years old with predicted PICU length of stay greater than 48 hours, and an indwelling urinary catheter enrolled (September 2012 to March 2014). Acute kidney injury (defined by creatinine or urine output on day 3) and fluid overload (≥ 20% on day 3) were used as outcome variables and risk factors for ICU endpoints assessed at 28 days.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Acute kidney injury and fluid overload occurred in 19.4% and 24.2% respectively. Both acute kidney injury and fluid overload were associated with longer ICU length of stay but neither maintained significance after multivariate regression. Delineation into unique fluid overload/acute kidney injury classifications demonstrated that fluid overload patients experienced a longer ICU and hospital length of stay and higher rate of mortality compared with fluid overload patients, regardless of acute kidney injury status. Fluid overload/acute kidney injury patients had increased odds of death (p = 0.013). After correction for severity of illness, ICU length of stay remained significantly longer in fluid overload/acute kidney injury patients compared with patients without both classifications (17.4; 95% CI, 11.0–23.7 vs 8.8; 95% CI, 7.3–10.9; p = 0.05). Correction of acute kidney injury classification for net fluid balance led to acute kidney injury class switching in 29 patients and strengthened the association with increased mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay on bivariate analysis, but reduced the increased risk conferred by fluid overload for mortality.

Conclusions

The current study suggests the effects of significant fluid accumulation may be delineable from the effects of acute kidney injury. Concurrent fluid overload and acute kidney injury significantly worsen outcome. Correction of acute kidney injury assessment for net fluid balance may refine diagnosis and unmask acute kidney injury associated with deleterious downstream sequelae. The unique effects of fluid overload and acute kidney injury on outcome in critically ill patients warrant further study.

Table 4
Assessment of risk of acute renal failure and other complications

In general, serial physical and laboratory examinations are necessary to manage patients with ERM appropriately. In the acute phase, treatment should be aimed at preserving renal function and restoring metabolic derangements. Early and adequate volume replacement with isotonic sodium chloride solution 0.9% (no potassium-containing or lactate-containing solutions) may directly prevent renal injury by aiding clearance of toxic substances and increasing renal perfusion pressure. Volume expansion increases renal blood flow and, consequently, glomerular filtration and urination. A common goal of treatment is to achieve a urine output of 300 mL/hour. This may require infusion of intravenous fluids by 1–2 L/hour until urine output is stable. Intravenous fluid should preferably be continued until serum CK activity in plasma has declined to 1000 IU/L or below. In patients with little or no urine output despite aggressive hydration, profound acidosis or severe hyperkalaemia, consider peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis and consult a nephrologist. Aggressive hydration may not be appropriate in patients with other comorbidities such as heart failure. Furthermore, if kidney injury is already established, overly aggressive hydration in a patient with already established renal failure may lead to volume overload and pulmonary oedema.

Mannitol leads to an increase in blood flow and glomerular filtration, which reduces the obstruction by myoglobin casts. It must only be given after volume replacement and must be avoided in patients with oliguria. It is not routinely recommended, but may be administered if the target urine output cannot be achieved by other means. Loop diuretics have also been investigated, but published data are too limited to support recommending them routinely. Although not proven by randomised control trials, some experts recommend the addition of bicarbonate. Alkalisation of the urine (target pH 6.5) promotes myoglobulin washout and corrects the metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. A recent systematic review has shown that sodium bicarbonate should only be administered to patients with systemic acidosis.

Monitoring for and treating rhabdomyolysis-related electrolyte abnormalities is an important part of managing patients with ERM. Hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia and hyperuricaemia are common in patients with rhabdomyolysis, and should be treated with standard therapy. Although hypocalcaemia is common in early rhabdomyolysis, hypercalcaemia can occur later. Calcium supplementation should only be prescribed for patients with symptomatic hypocalcaemia or severe hyperkalaemia. More research is needed to determine whether allopurinol may be useful for preventing ERM and acute renal damage.

### Paradigms of acute kidney injury in the intensive care setting [^117WwW58]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that has multiple aetiologies, variable pathogenesis and diverse outcomes. However, these heterogeneities are not reflected in current approaches to the diagnosis and, to some degree, treatment of AKI. For example, congestive heart failure and dehydration can produce identical changes in serum creatinine level and urine output (parameters that are used to define AKI); however, they differ vastly in their physiological contexts and demand completely opposite treatments. AKI is often still considered to be a homogeneous clinical entity, which implies a uniform pathogenesis and a well-defined prognosis. As a consequence, efforts to find effective AKI treatments have been hampered by a lack of clear clinical classifications for various types of AKI. In addition, subclassification of AKI into subclinical phenotypes - for example, on the basis of protein biomarkers and other in vitro diagnostics that take into account disease aetiology and underlying pathogenesis - might be necessary to develop therapeutic approaches that effectively target the widely differing pathomechanisms of AKI. In this Review, we discuss the major subtypes of AKI that are associated with sepsis, major surgery, renal hypoperfusion and nephrotoxin exposure -situations that are typically seen in the intensive care setting. We consider differences and similarities in their phenotype, pathogenesis and outcomes and how this information might be used to guide treatment.

### Loop diuretics in acute heart failure: beyond the decongestive relief for the kidney [^116FEqnE]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Beyond hemodynamic derangement, there are systemic mechanisms that substantially contribute to congestion status, including neurohormonal activation which works to maintain organ perfusion and systemic pressure while enhancing sodium and water retention. Combined, increased vascular stiffness and reduced vein capacitance enhance both preload and afterload with a consequent rise in cardiac filling pressure that reflects on the pulmonary circulation. Arterial vasoconstriction associated with increased venous pressure affects the kidney, causing hemodynamic and parenchymal alterations: renal blood flow redistribution, tubuloglomerular feedback, tubule obliteration, and efferent arteriolar constriction which leads to reduced salt and water excretion. Slow plasma refill from extravascular to intravascular bed and overhydrated interstitium is another component: the intravascular volume decreases only marginally by diuretic treatment; in contrast, the interstitial volume has substantial reduction.

Given the combination of hemodynamic and neurohormonal factors, each patient has an individual risk of AKI or type 1 cardiorenal syndrome after the first few doses of intravenous loop diuretics. A strong clinical clue for risk of AKI is increased central venous pressure and therefore intra-abdominal and renal congestion. Elevated intra-abdominal pressure has recently been debated as a causal contributor in congestion development. Raised intra-abdominal pressure reduces abdominal compliance, leading to intra-abdominal organ compression due to reduced venous return and parenchymal congestion. Moreover, elevated intra-abdominal pressure may raise central venous pressure, which consequently increases cardiac preload (Fig. 1). If the degree of diuresis exceeds the rate of plasma refill from the extravascular space, then transient decreases in forward flow to the kidney can occur with the same amount of venous back pressure, precipitating tubuloglomerular feedback and a reduction of glomerular filtration combined with augmented sodium reabsorption. This causes an abrupt reduction in urine output and then a rise in the plasma pool of creatinine, urea, and other filtered substances.

The physical exam and traditional laboratories are poor tools in assessing this complex and dynamic pathophysiology in each patient. Futuristic approaches involve the use of non-invasive abdominal compartment monitoring, bioimpedance, or real-time assessments of glomerular filtration to establish the correct loop diuretic dosing and management of other drugs.

### Early introduction of tolvaptan after cardiac surgery: a renal sparing strategy in the light of the renal resistive index measured by ultrasound [^115asGr4]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this preliminary investigation, we focused on the serial changes of renal RI values in patients requiring continuous IV diuretics post-cardiac surgery, who were treated with the co-administration of tolvaptan for early discontinuation of IV diuretics and renal functional preservation. Based on the fact that a high RI is reported to be indicative of a decrease in renal perfusion which would elicit renal functional deterioration, we considered starting tolvaptan but not oral loop diuretics in patients who showed RI elevations and/or those with fluid overload associated with hyponatremia.

We have shown that, (i) the renal RI values decreased in patients treated with tolvaptan administration, while the values did not change in patients treated with oral loop diuretics; (ii) not only serum sodium concentrations but total protein and albumin levels also increased after tolvaptan administration, suggesting that tolvaptan effectively reduces "excessive" body fluid; (iii) tolvaptan would be useful for shortening the duration of continuous IV diuretics requirement after cardiac surgery, although we failed to prove it statistically due to an insufficient number of studied patients.

Renal dysfunction is a serious complication following cardiac surgery, which has a strong impact on short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) usage during cardiac surgery is associated with an increased risk of acute renal dysfunction. This is due to a decrease in renal blood flow caused by hypotension under extracorporeal circulation and low cardiac output immediately after weaning from CPB, in addition to the inflammatory cytokines and ischemic reperfusion injury. We recently reviewed over 1500 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at our institution and found that CPB was a strong risk factor for the postoperative requirement of renal replacement therapy. Therefore, we believe that keeping sufficient renal perfusion after cardiac surgery is important in protecting renal function, especially from the possible damage caused by CPB. Indeed, all patients whom we treated with tolvaptan in order to avoid further deterioration of renal function caused by prolonged IV loop diuretics in the present study underwent cardiac surgery using CPB.

### Acute kidney injury: short-term and long-term effects [^112cjziN]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Short-term effects of AKI

Classically, the short-term effects of AKI can be thought of as those reflecting an acute deterioration in renal function per se, and include disturbances in acid-base and electrolyte homeostasis, uraemia and the consequences thereof, as well as volume overload through salt and water retention complicating AKI in many patients. This is outlined in Fig. 2. Increasingly, the effects of AKI, especially with regard to distant organ function (so called "organ cross-talk"), is being elucidated as is the increased susceptibility to other conditions, although it can be difficult to determine the exact relationship between cause and effect. An example of this is sepsis, where the presence of AKI, through effects on the innate immune system, predisposes to an episode of sepsis; this may in turn exacerbate the severity of AKI.

Fig. 2
Classical short-term effects of AKI. Short-term effects have always been considered those that occur as a consequence of the acute deterioration in renal function. AKI acute kidney injury

AKI is often associated with volume overload and this seems to be a major contributing factor to both morbidity and mortality. Indeed, a retrospective analysis of post-operative percentage fluid overload (PFO) in patients at AKI stage 3 after cardiac surgery illustrated this with a PFO > 7.2% throughout the intensive care unit (ICU) stay being significantly associated with reduced 90-day survival (P < 0.001). As a consequence, instigation of RRT, at least in the ICU setting, is often triggered by oliguria and volume overload despite a paucity of data supporting this approach. Further support for this approach comes from a prospective multi-centre observational study in patients with AKI where a positive fluid balance at initiation of RRT of > 3 L/24 h (odds ratio (OR) 2.3, 95% CI 1.2–4.5) and PFO > 5% (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2–4.7) was associated with higher mortality. Therefore, it would appear that limiting volume overload is associated with improved outcomes, and that early initiation of RRT may confer a survival benefit. To date there is no evidence from randomised controlled studies that such an approach, albeit attractive, is advantageous. Also, early instigation of treatment must be balanced against the risks associated with commencing such an invasive technique.

29. Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication of trauma, affecting up to 30% of patients admitted to the ICU. AKI is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and length of stay in the ICU. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a life‐saving intervention that can restore fluid and electrolyte balance, remove toxins, and support renal recovery in patients with AKI. However, the optimal indications and timing of RRT initiation for trauma patients with AKI remain controversial and depend on several factors, such as the severity of AKI, the presence of other organ failures, the risk of complications, and the availability of resources.

Indications of RRT for trauma patients with AKI are similar to those for other critically ill patients with AKI. The most common indications are volume overload, refractory acidosis, hyperkalemia, uremic complications, and intoxications. However, specific considerations for trauma patients include: (1) the potential for ongoing hemorrhage and coagulopathy, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications from RRT; (2) the need for aggressive fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion, which may exacerbate volume overload and worsen AKI; (3) the presence of rhabdomyolysis, which may cause severe hyperkalemia, acidosis, and myoglobinuria, and require high‐volume RRT; and (4) the occurrence of abdominal compartment syndrome, which may impair renal perfusion and function, and necessitate early RRT to reduce intra‐abdominal pressure.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^116wmkLo]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhosis — algorithmic management begins with an "Acute increase in serum creatinine > 0.3 mg/dL", after which stage 1 is split into "AKI 1a: creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL" and "AKI 1b: creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL", and "AKI 2–3" represents higher-stage disease; initial stage 1 care is "Risk factor management*: monitor 48 hours", while persistent cases and higher stages receive "Risk factors management* Albumin (1g/kg) for 2 days". Nonresolution prompts "Urinary biomarkers" to triage to "Consistent with ATN", for which the action box states "Renal replacement therapy on individualized basis", or "Consistent with HRS", for which the action box states "Vasoconstrictor therapy + albumin". The legend clarifies that "Initial management of AKI (increase in serum creatinine > 0.3 mg/dL in 48 hours) is geared toward reversing risk factors", and that "When the serum creatinine has increased > 1.5mg/dL (Stage 1b), or to ≥ 2 times baseline value (stage 2; stage 3 when serum creatinine has increased > 3 times baseline value) and remains above these levels despite risk factor management for 2 days, then vasoconstrictor agents are indicated provided patient meets HRS criteria"; it also defines response thresholds: "Complete response to therapy is defined return of the serum creatinine with treatment to < 0.3 mg above baseline value; partial response is defined as reduction in serum creatinine but to > 0.3 mg above baseline value". Risk factor management "involves holding diuretics, beta-blockers, and nephrotoxic drugs and discontinuing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) agents; treating infections and other precipitating causes; and expanding plasma volume as required", and "Careful monitoring for fluid overload is required when albumin is administered in patients with AKI because of the risk of pulmonary edema".

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: national guidance [^111chWTX]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Changes in kidney function during intercurrent illness

Regardless of whether patients are treated with RAAS inhibitors, changes in renal function are common during acute intercurrent illness; the incidence of AKI is between 7% and 18% of hospitalised patients. AKI is a powerful risk marker for poor outcome and is strongly associated with an increase in the risk of subsequent admission for heart failure. Renal function often does not to return to baseline level in survivors of AKI, especially in those with pre-existing CKD.

The incidence of AKI as defined by hospital coding is rising rapidly, which may reflect a genuine increase or simply greater awareness. Conditions associated with the development of AKI (such as diabetes and CKD) are also common indications for RAAS inhibitors and thus AKI in association with RAAS blockade is a common clinical scenario. However, it is not clear that ACEI/ARB therapy alone is associated with a substantially increased risk of AKI.

When AKI is associated with overt hypovolaemia, hypotension or sepsis, it is axiomatic that prompt correction of these abnormalities will improve outcome. However, the reflex inclusion of patients with HFrEF in treatment algorithms for AKI is dangerous. Administration of crystalloids to patients who are already fluid overloaded defies common sense. There is no good evidence that temporary cessation of RAAS therapy given for HFrEF during hospitalisation or perioperatively reduces rates of AKI. Among patients hospitalised with AKI, treatment with ACEI or ARB is associated with a lower risk of death.

In patients on a RAAS inhibitor, intercurrent illness commonly causes AKI, but there is no evidence that stopping the RAAS inhibitor is beneficial.
If a patient with HFrEF develops hyperkalaemia (table 2): Potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L, monitor closely, medication review and consider suspending RAAS inhibitor(s). Potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L, stop RAAS inhibitor(s).
If the patient with HFrEF has a rise in creatinine during intercurrent illness: By less than 30%, continue RAAS inhibitor(s) but monitor closely. Stop any other medication that may worsen renal function, including diuretic if clinically appropriate. If by ≥ 30%, RAAS inhibitor(s) should be stopped.
There must be robust arrangements to make certain that the reduced or stopped RAAS inhibitors prescribed for HFrEF are reintroduced and/or reuptitrated once the intercurrent illness is over.

### Renal sodium avidity in heart failure: from pathophysiology to treatment strategies [^112JeAZP]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Increased neurohumoral stimulation resulting in excessive sodium avidity and extracellular volume overload are hallmark features of decompensated heart failure. Especially in case of concomitant renal dysfunction, the kidneys often fail to elicit effective natriuresis. While assessment of renal function is generally performed by measuring serum creatinine-a surrogate for glomerular filtration-, this only represents part of the nephron's function. Alterations in tubular sodium handling are at least equally important in the development of volume overload and congestion. Venous congestion and neurohumoral activation in advanced HF further promote renal sodium and water retention. Interestingly, early on, before clinical signs of heart failure are evident, intrinsic renal derangements already impair natriuresis. This clinical review discusses the importance of heart failure (HF) induced changes in different nephron segments. A better understanding of cardiorenal interactions which ultimately result in sodium avidity in HF might help to treat and prevent congestion in chronic and acute HF.

### Association between systemic hemodynamics and septic acute kidney injury in critically ill patients: a retrospective observational study [^112zdfqS]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we observed a weak association between systemic hemodynamic parameters and the development of AKI among septic ICU patients. The hemodynamic parameter most associated with the development or progression of AKI, regardless of the level of fluid balance and PEEP, was the CVP level. This suggests participation of venous congestion in the physiopathology of AKI in severe sepsis and septic shock.

Although the role of renal hypoperfusion is believed to contribute to the development of sepsis-induced renal dysfunction, AKI appears to be only partially reversible after optimization of systemic hemodynamics. Recently, Schnell et al. found that fluid loading did not influence the Doppler renal resistive index in septic ICU patients. Although resuscitation targeting the forward determinants of renal blood flow (MAP and CO) is common, little is known about backward determinants (renal venous pressure). In experimental studies, renal venous congestion has been shown to be important in promoting renal injury. Uncoupling CO and AKI has also been observed in experimental septic models. In patients with acute heart failure, the increase in CVP, but not CO, has been found to be strongly associated with AKI. An association between AKI and elevated atrial and brain natriuretic peptide levels in chronic heart failure or after cardiac surgery suggests that cardiac chamber distension by fluid overload and high filling pressure is involved. In the present study, arterial pressure and CO were not statistically different between the two groups of patients, except for DAP. Because renal vascular resistance is low, as evidenced by a positive diastolic blood flow velocity, diastolic perfusion pressure might be a key determinant of renal perfusion. The reduction in diastolic flow may result from a decrease in diastolic perfusion pressure related to an increase in renal venous back pressure and/or a decline in DAP.

The intravascular level of CVP depends on the patient's volemic status, right and left heart function, surrounding venous pressure increased by mechanical ventilation, and/or reduced venous compliance. While a patient is in supine position, the renal venous flow depends on renal venous pressure, which is higher than CVP by at least 2 mmHg. The recommended Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines targeting CVP between "8 and 12 mmHg in spontaneous breathing" or "between 12 and 15 mmHg in patients receiving mechanical ventilation" might correspond to a level of renal venous pressure as high as 17 mmHg. To illustrate such a concept, the computed average renal diastolic perfusion pressure was estimated to be approximately 35 mmHg in the AKI + group vs. about 42 mmHg in the AKI − group, a difference that may affect glomerular filtration pressure.

### Cumulative fluid accumulation is associated with the development of acute kidney injury and non-recovery of renal function: a retrospective analysis [^1133qTM7]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common during critical illness, affecting > 50% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is a syndrome rather than a defined diagnosis, has many different aetiologies and can develop at different stages throughout critical illness. There is increasing evidence that AKI is associated with short- and long-term complications and high healthcare costs. Patients who leave hospital alive remain at risk of chronic health problems, including chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The risk is particularly high in patients with more severe, recurrent or prolonged AKI and in those with reduced renal functional reserve.

Many patients already suffer from AKI when admitted to the ICU but a large proportion develop AKI later whilst receiving critical care. Their risk of dying is significantly higher than that of patients with AKI on admission. There is a clear need for better strategies to prevent the development of AKI during critical illness and to reduce the risk of progression in those who develop AKI. Although some risk factors are not modifiable, for instance advanced age or pre-existing CKD, others are avoidable or potentially amenable to modification, for instance exposure to nephrotoxic drugs. A better understanding of the risk of ICU-acquired AKI and the identification of potentially modifiable risk factors is essential to reduce the global burden of AKI.

The objectives of this study were (a) to identify factors associated with the development of new AKI during early stay in the ICU and (b) to ascertain risk factors for non-recovery of AKI.

### Intra-abdominal hypertension: an important consideration for diuretic resistance in acute decompensated heart failure [^115aPfaT]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Fluid accumulation is the hallmark of heart failure decompensation. Fluid overload and congestion are associated with recurrent hospitalizations, poor quality of life, and increased mortality in heart failure. Despite the use of high-dose intravenous loop diuretic therapy, acutely decompensated heart failure patients may develop diuretic resistance. Diuretic refractoriness can be a result of elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in acutely decompensated heart failure. Increased renal venous and interstitial pressures in patients with elevated IAP may lead to renal impairment and diuretic resistance. Routine approaches such as sequential nephron blockade with a combination of loop and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, continuous diuretic infusion, and ultrafiltration may not be sufficient. Presented here is a case illustrating the importance of recognizing intra-abdominal hypertension in patients with diuretic resistance. Lowering IAP improves renal perfusion, renal filtration, and diuresis. When elevated, IAP is an easily reversible cause of diuretic resistance. Additionally, abdominal perfusion pressure can be used to guide therapy to reverse end-organ damage and avoid permanent renal replacement therapy.

### Fluid overload and changes in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery: predictors of mortality and longer intensive care stay. A prospective cohort study [^115VZ9Gz]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our analysis describes the importance of fluid overload and changes in serum creatinine during the perioperative period following cardiac surgery as early markers of intra-ICU mortality and longer ICU stay.

To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate systematically fluid overload after cardiac surgery. Our most interesting finding is that the 10% fluid overload also seemed to have a significant and independent effect on the combined events, including death. This 10% fluid overload effect was observed in another study that investigated acute kidney dysfunction. Sutherland et al. in a recent pediatric study into acute kidney dysfunction, reported a 3% increase in mortality for each 1% increase in fluid accumulation.

An inverse relationship between fluid accumulation and survival has been reported in several other conditions, such as in the perioperative period, acute pulmonary edema, pulmonary injury, sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic renal failure and decompensated heart failure. When we studied the impact of all the adjusted variables on combined events, we found that the changes in serum creatinine (≥ 0.3 mg/dL) and fluid accumulation (≥ 10%) were the variables most significantly associated with mortality (Table 2). The changes in serum creatinine values and the association with mortality seems to corroborate Lassnigg's findings. These results were previously observed in the perioperative period as well as in critically ill populations, because fluid overload has been associated with impaired wound healing and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Hypervolemia also seems to be associated with cardiac edema, leading to myocyte injury and malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^115Zg6Xs]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

American Burn Association burn shock resuscitation — scientific background highlights that following thermal injury involving greater than 20% of the TBSA, intravascular volume depletion and edema threaten perfusion, and recognition of "fluid creep" over 2 decades ago underscored that provision of excessive resuscitation fluid leads to increased morbidity and mortality in major burn patients. Both historically and currently, urinary output (UOP) has been the primary guide to the titration of resuscitation fluids, though alternative approaches using malperfusion markers, hemodynamic endpoints, or algorithm-based and computer supported decisions have been considered. Virtually all resuscitation formulae specify that colloids should be started at some point during resuscitation; albumin data suggest that early addition of albumin reduces total resuscitation volumes, while two study level meta-analyses of the 4 RCTs found no effect of albumin on mortality and reports note no effect of albumin on compartment syndrome development, renal function, or respiratory complications. For adjuncts, in humans the infusion 66 mg/kg/hour of ascorbic acid has been examined with mixed findings regarding reduction in resuscitation fluid volumes, and concerns have been raised about a possible association with oxalate nephropathy and development of AKI.

### Effects of fluid bolus therapy on renal perfusion, oxygenation, and function in early experimental septic kidney injury [^117HoYRC]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To examine the effects of fluid bolus therapy on systemic hemodynamics, renal blood flow, intrarenal perfusion and oxygenation, PO2, renal function, and fluid balance in experimental early septic acute kidney injury.

Design

Interventional study.

Setting

Research institute.

Subjects

Adult Merino ewes.

Interventions

Implantation of flow probes on the pulmonary and renal arteries and laser Doppler oxygen-sensing probes in the renal cortex, medulla, and within a bladder catheter in sheep. Infusion of Escherichia coli to induce septic acute kidney injury (n = 8). After 24, 25, and 26 hours of sepsis, fluid bolus therapy (500mL of Hartmann's solution over 15min) was administered.

Measurements and Main Results

In conscious sheep, infusion of Escherichia coli decreased creatinine clearance and increased plasma creatinine, renal blood flow (+46% ± 6%) and cortical perfusion (+25% ± 4%), but medullary perfusion (-48% ± 5%), medullary PO2 (-56% ± 4%), and urinary PO2 (-54% ± 3%) decreased (p < 0.01). The first fluid bolus therapy increased blood pressure (+6% ± 1%), central venous pressure (+245% ± 65%), cardiac output (+11% ± 2%), medullary PO2 (+280% ± 90%), urinary PO2 (+164% ± 80%), and creatinine clearance (+120% ± 65%) at 30 minutes. The following two boluses had no beneficial effects on creatinine clearance. The improvement in medullary oxygenation dissipated following the third fluid bolus therapy. Study animals retained 69% of the total volume and 80% of sodium infused. Throughout the study, urinary PO2 correlated significantly with medullary PO2.

Conclusions

In early experimental septic acute kidney injury, fluid bolus therapy transiently improved renal function and medullary PO2, as also reflected by increased urinary PO2. These initial effects of fluid bolus therapy dissipated within 4 hours, despite two additional fluid boluses, and resulted in significant volume retention.
