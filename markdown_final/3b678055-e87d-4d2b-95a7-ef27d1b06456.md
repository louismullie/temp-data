## Question

How long does the effect of lisinopril last?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long the effect of lisinopril lasts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacokinetics, especially the effective half-life from the FDA label. Then, I should verify how clinical dosing frequency maps to pharmacodynamic duration. Next, I will examine the mechanistic explanation for sustained effect despite serum decline. After that, I should confirm with clinical and perioperative data that characterize 24-hour activity. Finally, I need to consider caveats like renal impairment and heart failure that could modify duration, and then synthesize a clear, clinically actionable conclusion anchored to authoritative sources [^115AEmxA] [^114qHuXU] [^117WzcbJ].

> Let me first confirm the basic pharmacokinetic parameter. The FDA Zestril label states that upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of about 12 hours, and that declining serum concentrations show a prolonged terminal phase that probably reflects saturable ACE binding and is not proportional to dose [^115AEmxA]. Hold on, I initially thought that this prolonged terminal phase contributes to accumulation, but wait, let me verify the exact wording — actually, the label specifies that this terminal phase does not contribute to drug accumulation, so I should correct that assumption to avoid overestimating exposure at steady state [^115AEmxA].

> Next, I should review whether the clinical effect spans the full dosing interval. Lisinopril is dosed once daily for hypertension and heart failure in routine practice, and the FDA labeling for the combination product notes lisinopril monotherapy is effective in once-daily dosing across 10–80 mg, which implies sustained antihypertensive coverage over 24 hours when titrated appropriately [^114qHuXU] [^116DC8nj]. I need to ensure I'm not inferring duration solely from dosing, but the once-daily efficacy language and stable ambulatory control across the interval support a 24-hour clinical effect in typical patients [^114qHuXU].

> Now, why does a 12-hour effective half-life still yield 24-hour blood pressure control? Let me think about the pharmacodynamics. The label's note about a prolonged terminal phase likely representing ACE binding provides a mechanistic basis for dissociation between plasma levels and effect, with continued ACE inhibition sustaining BP control as concentrations decline, consistent with once-daily dosing despite the PK half-life [^115AEmxA]. I should double-check that I'm not overstating the binding kinetics — yes, the label is cautious, saying "probably represents saturable binding", which aligns with a prolonged pharmacodynamic effect without implying clinically relevant accumulation [^115AEmxA].

> I will now examine corroborating clinical evidence of 24-hour activity. Perioperative guidance from the SPACE trial materials explicitly describes lisinopril as having a 24-hour duration of action with half-life elimination of roughly 12–17 hours, consistent with standard practice to hold the dose the day before surgery when indicated, which clinically presumes 24-hour activity [^117WzcbJ]. Let me also consider ambulatory data: trials using once-daily lisinopril demonstrate sustained 24-hour BP control in ambulatory monitoring paradigms, for example high-dose lisinopril comparators maintaining 24-hour SBP control in diabetic cohorts, supporting full-interval efficacy when appropriately titrated [^117Bdefn]. But wait, what if interdialytic intervals challenge this? Even in hemodialysis studies, supervised lisinopril produced persistent antihypertensive effects over 44 hours in selected patients, suggesting robust, though context-dependent, durability of effect, albeit this is a small study and should be interpreted carefully [^111kKjud].

> Hold on, I should verify important caveats that could lengthen or modify duration. Impaired renal function reduces lisinopril clearance, and this becomes clinically significant when GFR drops below 30 mL/min; exposure rises, time to steady state is prolonged, and dose reduction is recommended, which functionally can extend effect and increase risk of accumulation if not adjusted, while lisinopril remains dialyzable if needed [^111dXKB3]. I need to check dosing guidance: for CrCl 10–30 mL/min, start 2.5–5 mg daily and titrate cautiously, and for CrCl < 10 mL/min or peritoneal dialysis, start 2.5 mg with careful monitoring, which reflects the prolonged elimination and potentially extended effect in these populations [^117B8MCk] [^111ZuRpN] [^112uzD1j]. Let me also reconsider heart failure: absolute bioavailability is reduced in stable NYHA II–IV HF to about 16%, but elimination half-life is relatively unchanged above GFR 30 mL/min, so the principal modifier of duration remains renal function rather than heart failure per se [^115AEmxA] [^111dXKB3].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the practical answer. In patients with normal renal function, lisinopril has an effective half-life of approximately 12 hours but provides 24-hour antihypertensive efficacy supporting once-daily dosing, with the sustained effect likely aided by ACE binding and pharmacodynamic persistence as serum levels fall [^115AEmxA] [^114qHuXU]. In significant renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min), elimination is prolonged, the effective duration is functionally extended, and dose reductions are required to avoid accumulation; in perioperative contexts, its 24-hour action motivates withholding strategies when indicated, consistent with clinical observations and guidance [^111dXKB3] [^117B8MCk] [^117WzcbJ].

Lisinopril has a **duration of action of approximately 24 hours**, supporting once-daily dosing for hypertension and heart failure [^117WzcbJ]. Its **effective half-life is about 12 hours** with repeated dosing, and the antihypertensive effect is sustained over 24 hours [^115AEmxA]. In renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min), elimination is prolonged and dose adjustment is required [^111dXKB3]. Lisinopril is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged in urine [^115AEmxA].

---

## Pharmacokinetic properties influencing duration of action

- **Absorption**: Peak serum concentrations occur ~7 hours after oral administration [^115AEmxA]; food does not affect bioavailability.

- **Distribution**: Not protein-bound [^115AEmxA]; distributes into tissues, including ACE-rich sites.

- **Metabolism**: Not metabolized [^115AEmxA]; excreted unchanged in urine.

- **Elimination**: Effective half-life ~12 hours with repeated dosing; terminal phase reflects saturable ACE binding and does not cause accumulation [^113CbeKq].

---

## Clinical duration of antihypertensive effect

- **Once-daily dosing**: Provides sustained 24-hour blood pressure control [^1179mz9q] [^114mb1QW].

- **Onset of action**: Antihypertensive effect begins within 1 hour; peak effect at 6–8 hours [^113CbeKq].

- **Duration of effect**: Single dose lasts ~24 hours, supporting once-daily use [^117WzcbJ].

---

## Factors influencing duration of action

- **Renal function**: Impaired renal function prolongs elimination and increases exposure; adjust dose when GFR < 30 mL/min [^111dXKB3].

- **Age**: Older patients have higher exposure and prolonged elimination; monitor closely [^111dXKB3].

- **Comorbidities**: Heart failure and renal impairment can prolong duration; monitor and adjust as needed [^1179yinj].

---

## Clinical implications of duration of action

Once-daily dosing improves **adherence and convenience**, and the long duration supports **consistent blood pressure control** [^1179mz9q]. Sustained 24-hour control reduces cardiovascular risk [^1159DzbN].

## Comparison with other ACE inhibitors

| **ACE inhibitor** | **Duration of action** | **Dosing frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Lisinopril | ~24 hours [^115AEmxA] | Once daily |
| Enalapril | 12–24 hours | Once or twice daily |
| Ramipril | 24 hours [^117WzcbJ] | Once daily |
| Captopril | 6–12 hours | Two to three times daily |

---

Lisinopril's duration of action is **approximately 24 hours**, enabling once-daily dosing and sustained antihypertensive control [^115AEmxA].

### Zestoretic [^113CbeKq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. This latter decrease may result in a small increase in serum potassium. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was less than 0.1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15 percent of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L, and approximately six percent had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L. In the same study, patients treated with lisinopril plus a thiazide diuretic showed essentially no change in serum potassium.

ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated.

While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension.

### Zestril [^115AEmxA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetics**

Adult patients: Following oral administration of Zestril, peak serum concentrations of lisinopril occur within about 7 hours, although there was a trend to a small delay in the time taken to reach peak serum concentrations in acute myocardial infarction patients. Food does not alter the bioavailability of Zestril. Declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase, which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose. Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of 12 hours.

Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins. It does not undergo metabolism and is excreted entirely unchanged in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25%, with large intersubject variability (6% to 60%) at all doses tested (5 mg to 80 mg). The absolute bioavailability of lisinopril is reduced to 16% in patients with stable NYHA Class II-IV congestive heart failure, and the volume of distribution appears to be slightly smaller than that in normal subjects. The oral bioavailability of lisinopril in patients with acute myocardial infarction is similar to that in healthy volunteers.

### Zestril [^111dXKB3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Impaired renal function decreases the elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys. This decrease becomes clinically significant only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min. Above this rate, the elimination half-life remains relatively unchanged. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, the time to peak concentration increases, and the time to attain a steady state is prolonged [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis.

Pediatric patients: The pharmacokinetics of lisinopril were studied in 29 pediatric hypertensive patients between 6 and 16 years old, with a glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL/min/1.73 m². After doses of 0.1 mg per kg to 0.2 mg per kg, steady-state peak plasma concentrations of lisinopril occurred within 6 hours, and the extent of absorption based on urinary recovery was about 28%. These values are similar to those obtained previously in adults. The typical value of lisinopril oral clearance (systemic clearance/absolute bioavailability) in a child weighing 30 kg is 10 L/h, and it increases in proportion to renal function. In a multicenter, open-label pharmacokinetic study of daily oral lisinopril in 22 pediatric hypertensive patients with stable kidney transplants (ages 7 to 17 years; estimated glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), dose-normalized exposures were within the range previously reported in children without a kidney transplant.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^113Dt9PV]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Studies suggest that bedtime dosing of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker shows a more sustained and consistent 24-hour antihypertensive profile, including greater night-time blood pressure (BP) reduction. We compared the antihypertensive effects of morning (a.m.) and evening (p.m.) dosing of valsartan on 24-hour BP.

- **Methods**: This 26-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study evaluated the efficacy and safety of valsartan 320 mg, dosed a.m. or p.m., versus lisinopril 40 mg (a.m.), a long-acting ACE inhibitor, in patients with grade 1–2 hypertension and at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. Patients (n = 1093; BP = 156 ± 11/91 ± 8 mmHg; 62 years, 56% male, 99% white) received valsartan 160 mg a.m. or p.m. or lisinopril 20 mg a.m., in a 1:1:1 ratio for 4 weeks, then force-titrated to double the initial dose for 8 weeks. At week 12, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg was added for 14 weeks if office BP was more than 140/90 mmHg and/or ambulatory BP more than 130/80 mmHg.

- **Results**: Mean 24-hour ambulatory SBP change from baseline to weeks 12 and 26 was comparable between valsartan a.m. (–10.6 and –13.3 mmHg), valsartan p.m. (–9.8 and –12.3 mmHg), and lisinopril (–10.7 and –13.7 mmHg). There was no benefit of valsartan p.m. versus a.m. on night-time BP, early morning BP, and morning BP surge. Evening dosing also did not improve BP lowering in patients requiring add-on HCTZ or in nondippers at baseline. All treatments were well tolerated.

Once-daily dosing of valsartan 320 mg results in equally effective 24-hour BP management.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure lead to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives include quantifying the blood pressure-lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, compared to placebo or no treatment.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials (RCTs) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were targeted.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111N7KCo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

Guidelines for hypertension vary in their preference for initial combination therapy or initial monotherapy, stratified by patient profile; therefore, we compared the efficacy and tolerability of these approaches.

- **Methods and results**: We performed a 1-year, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 605 untreated patients aged 18 to 79 years with systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 95 mm Hg. In phase 1 (weeks 0–16), patients were randomly assigned to initial monotherapy (losartan 50–100 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg crossing over at 8 weeks), or initial combination (losartan 50–100 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg). In phase 2 (weeks 17–32), all patients received losartan 100 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg. In phase 3 (weeks 33–52), amlodipine with or without doxazosin could be added to achieve the target. Hierarchical primary outcomes were the difference from baseline in home systolic, averaged over phases 1 and 2 and, if significant, at 32 weeks. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, and the difference in home systolic BP responses between tertiles of plasma renin. Home systolic BP after initial monotherapy fell 4.9 mm Hg (range: 3.7–6.0 mm Hg) less over 32 weeks (P < 0.001) than after initial combination but caught up at 32 weeks (difference 1.2 mm Hg [range: −0.4 to 2.8 mm Hg], P = 0.13). In phase 1, the home systolic BP response to each monotherapy differed substantially between renin tertiles, whereas the response to combination therapy was uniform and at least 5 mm Hg more than to monotherapy. There were no differences in withdrawal rates.

### Zestoretic [^1179yinj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Lisinopril should be administered with caution to patients with aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as with all vasodilators, due to the obstruction in the outflow tract of the left ventricle.

- **Impaired renal function**: Inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system can lead to changes in renal function in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure, whose renal function may rely on this system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors like lisinopril may cause oliguria, progressive azotemia, and, in rare cases, acute renal failure or death.

- **Renal artery stenosis**: In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, an increase in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of lisinopril and/or diuretic therapy. Renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy.

- **No apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease**: Some hypertensive patients without pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed minor and transient increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, particularly when lisinopril is used with a diuretic. This is more likely in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, and dosage reduction of lisinopril or discontinuation of the diuretic may be necessary.

### Heterogeneity in blood pressure response to 4 antihypertensive drugs: A randomized clinical trial [^111hxWfP]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Hypertension is the leading risk factor for premature death worldwide, with multiple blood pressure-lowering therapies available. However, the potential for maximizing benefit through personalized targeting of drug classes remains unknown. This study investigates and quantifies the potential for targeting specific drugs to individuals to optimize blood pressure effects.

The design of the study was a randomized, double-blind, repeated crossover trial conducted in men and women with grade 1 hypertension at low risk for cardiovascular events, at an outpatient research clinic in Sweden. Mixed-effects models were used to assess the extent to which individuals responded better to one treatment than another and to estimate the additional blood pressure lowering achievable by personalized treatment.

Each participant was scheduled for treatment in random order with four different classes of blood pressure-lowering drugs: lisinopril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), candesartan (angiotensin-receptor blocker), hydrochlorothiazide (thiazide), and amlodipine (calcium channel blocker), with repeated treatments for two classes. The main outcomes and measures focused on the ambulatory daytime systolic blood pressure, measured at the end of each treatment period.

The results revealed that there were 1468 completed treatment periods (median length, 56 days) recorded in 270 of the 280 randomized participants (54% men; mean age, 64 years). The blood pressure response to different treatments varied considerably among individuals (p < 0.001), specifically for the choice between lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide.

### Low doses vs. high doses of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril in chronic heart failure: a cost-effectiveness analysis based on the Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival (ATLAS) study [^112ozrTw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2000). Low credibility.

A cost-effectiveness analysis of high and low doses of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril was conducted for the treatment of chronic heart failure. This analysis utilized data from a randomized controlled trial, ATLAS, involving 3,164 patients. Patients with chronic heart failure were allocated to either a high-dose strategy (daily target dose 32.5–35 mg) or a low-dose strategy (daily target dose 2.5–5.0 mg) of lisinopril. Differential costs were assessed based on resource use data collected in the trial and costed using UK unit costs. The cost-effectiveness analysis related differential costs to differential life-years over a four-year trial follow-up.

The mean total number of hospital in-patient days per patient was 18.5 in the high-dose group and 22.5 in the low-dose group. Over the trial duration, the mean (S.D.) daily dose of lisinopril in the high-dose group was 22.5 mg (15.7 mg), compared to 3.2 mg (2.5 mg) in the low-dose group. The mean difference in cost per patient was £397 lower in the high-dose group [95% CI (high-dose-low-dose) -£1,263 to £436]. Mean life-years per patient were 0.085 years higher in the high-dose group [95% CI (high-dose-low-dose) -0.0074 to 0.1706]. Based on the mean costs and life-years, the high-dose therapy was found to dominate the low-dose therapy (less costly and more effective). Allowing for uncertainty in mean costs and life-years, the probability of high-dose therapy being less costly than low-dose therapy was 82%. If a decision maker is willing to pay at least £3,600 per life-year gained, the probability…

### Lisinopril therapy for hemodialysis hypertension: Hemodynamic and endocrine responses [^111kKjud]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

To evaluate the antihypertensive effects of lisinopril, a renally excreted angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, we assessed supervised administration of the drug after hemodialysis (HD) three times weekly. Blood pressure (BP) was assessed by interdialytic 44-hour ambulatory BP (ABP) monitoring, and endocrine responses were assessed by plasma renin activity (PRA) before and after dialysis.

- **Lisinopril administration**: Lisinopril dose was titrated at biweekly intervals. If this was not effective after full titration (lisinopril to 40 mg three times weekly), ultrafiltration was added to reduce dry weight.

The primary outcome variable was the change in BP from the end of the run-in period to the end of the study. During the run-in period, no change in mean ABP was noted. However, mean 44-hour ABP decreased from 149 ± 14 (SD)/84 ± 9 to 127 ± 16/73 ± 9 mm Hg, a decrease of 22/11 mm Hg (P < 0.05). At the final visit, one patient had systolic hypertension (≥ 135 mm Hg), and one patient had diastolic hypertension (≥ 85 mm Hg).

Four patients were administered 10 mg of lisinopril, five patients received 20 mg, and two patients received 40 mg; only one of these patients required ultrafiltration therapy. A persistent antihypertensive effect over 44 hours was observed. BP reduction was achieved without an increase in intradialytic symptomatic or asymptomatic hypotensive episodes. PRA increased in response to dialysis, as well as lisinopril.

In conclusion, supervised lisinopril therapy is effective in controlling hypertension in chronic HD patients. This may be related to the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.

### Zestoretic [^114qHuXU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Lisinopril monotherapy is an effective treatment for hypertension in once-daily doses ranging from 10 mg to 80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy is effective in doses of 12.5 mg to 50 mg per day. In clinical trials of lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy, using lisinopril doses of 10 mg to 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 mg to 50 mg, the antihypertensive response rates generally increased with the rising dose of either component.

The side effects of lisinopril, as noted in the warnings, are generally rare and seemingly dose-independent; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a combination of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (such as pancreatitis), with the former being more common. Therapy with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide may be associated with either or both dose-independent or dose-dependent side effects; however, the addition of lisinopril in clinical trials mitigated the hypokalemia commonly observed with diuretics.

To minimize dose-dependent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only following a patient has not achieved the desired effect with monotherapy.

- **Dose titration guided by clinical effect**: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to lisinopril/HCTZ 10/12.5 or lisinopril/HCTZ 20/12.5, depending on the monotherapy dose. Further increases of either or both components should depend on clinical response with blood pressure measured.

### Familial factors in the antihypertensive response to lisinopril [^1111pWSC]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Although it is widely recognized that there are familial elements in the pathogenesis of hypertension, remarkably little is known about the influence of family history on response to specific antihypertensive agents.

- **Methods**: This study was designed to address that issue by comparing the depressor response to lisinopril in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg in 74 patients enrolled as sibling pairs. Because all patients were treated with lisinopril, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), an objective measure not influenced by the investigators, was used to assess the primary blood pressure (BP) outcome variable.

- **Results**: Diastolic BP was highly correlated between sibling pairs at baseline (r = 0.476; P < .03) and on treatment (r = 0.524; p = 0.0021). Ethnicity/race had a striking influence on lisinopril dose and response rate. Among African American patients, 23 of 28 reached the top dose of 40 mg/day, whereas only 14 of 36 Caucasian patients reached that dose level. Among Caucasians, 92% responded, and only 48% of African Americans. Responders were characterized by being younger and heavier, having significantly lower microalbuminuria at baseline, higher baseline renal plasma flow (RPF), and higher urinary kallikrein.

- **Conclusion**: Among Caucasians, the presence of a hypertensive sibling predicts a striking therapeutic response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^1143bGFm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, especially for diabetic patients, based on their postulated advantages in reducing diabetic nephropathy, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality. Despite the widespread use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to November 19, 2014, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to October 19, 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies with at least six months of follow-up in people with primary elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg). The studies compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. Patients with proven secondary hypertension were excluded.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^115x2qQ6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

This is the first update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. Renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and renin inhibitors. They are widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, especially for people with diabetes, due to postulated advantages in reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use for hypertension, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remain unclear.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least six months follow-up in people with elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity outcomes.

### Renin inhibitors versus angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for primary hypertension [^114ynicX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Renin inhibitors (RIs) reduce blood pressure more than placebo, with the magnitude of this effect thought to be similar to that of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, a drug's efficacy in lowering blood pressure cannot be considered a definitive indicator of its effectiveness in reducing mortality and morbidity. The effectiveness and safety of RIs compared to ACE inhibitors in treating hypertension is unknown.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of renin inhibitors compared to ACE inhibitors in people with primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to August 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers about further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least four weeks follow-up in people with primary hypertension, which compared renin inhibitors with ACE inhibitors and reported morbidity, mortality, adverse events, or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected the included trials and evaluated the risks of bias.

### Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of lisinopril in pediatric kidney transplant patients: Implications for starting dose selection [^115sgAD4]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension in pediatric kidney transplant recipients contributes to long-term graft loss, yet treatment options — including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors — are poorly characterized in this vulnerable population. We conducted a multicenter, open-label pharmacokinetic (PK) study of daily oral lisinopril in 22 children (ages 7–17 years) with stable kidney transplant function. Standard noncompartmental PK analyses were performed at steady state.

- **Effects on blood pressure**: Effects were examined in lisinopril-naïve patients (n = 13). Oral clearance declined in proportion to underlying kidney function; however, in patients with low estimated glomerular filtration rate (30–59 ml/min per 1.73m²), exposure (standardized to 0.1 mg/kg/day dose) was within the range reported previously in children without a kidney transplant. In lisinopril-naïve patients, 85% and 77% had a ≥ 6 mmHg reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. Lisinopril was well tolerated.

Our study provides initial insight on lisinopril use in children with a kidney transplant, including starting dose considerations.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors for primary hypertension [^116RrMfd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a chronic condition associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Renin is the enzyme responsible for converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II. Renin inhibitors are a new class of drugs that decrease blood pressure (BP) by preventing the formation of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the dose-related BP-lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors compared to placebo in the treatment of primary hypertension. The study also aims to determine the change in BP variability, pulse pressure, and heart rate and to evaluate adverse events, including mortality, non-fatal serious adverse events, total adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse effects, and specific adverse events such as dry cough, diarrhea, and angioedema.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. There was no restriction by language or publication status. Additional searches included the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for clinical study reports, the Novartis Clinical Study Results Database, bibliographic citations from retrieved references, and direct contact with authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

### Moexipril hydrochloride [^111mwQGe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Single and multiple doses of 15 mg or more of moexipril hydrochloride provide sustained inhibition of plasma ACE activity of 80% to 90%, beginning within 2 hours and lasting 24 hours (80%).

In controlled trials, the peak effects of orally administered moexipril increase with the dose administered, over a range of 7.5 to 60 mg given once a day. Antihypertensive effects are first detectable about 1 hour after dosing, with a peak effect between 3 and 6 hours after dosing. Just before dosing (i.e. at trough), the antihypertensive effects are less prominently related to dose, and the antihypertensive effect tends to diminish during the 24-hour dosing interval when the drug is administered once a day.

In multiple-dose studies in the dose range of 7.5 to 30 mg once daily, moexipril hydrochloride lowers sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure effects at trough by 3 to 6 mmHg and 4 to 11 mmHg more than placebo, respectively. There is a tendency toward increased response with higher doses over this range. These effects are typical of ACE inhibitors, but, at the time of writing, there are no trials of adequate size comparing moexipril with other antihypertensive agents.

The trough diastolic blood pressure effects of moexipril are approximately 3 to 6 mmHg in various studies. Generally, higher doses of moexipril leave a greater fraction of the peak blood pressure effect still present at trough. During dose titration, any decision as to the adequacy of a dosing regimen should be based on trough blood pressure measurements.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^116em1Sr]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Efficacy results show no difference in the blood pressure (BP) control rate at the end of the study (Week 26) between patients receiving valsartan 320 mg as a morning dose (40.7%) or as an evening dose (39.7%), or when compared with lisinopril 40 mg (43.3%, P = 0.4989 for lisinopril versus valsartan a.m.). The percentage of patients achieving BP control at Week 12 was similar irrespective of the time of dosing of valsartan (36.7% a.m. versus 35.0% p.m. P = 0.6752), or when compared with lisinopril treatment (39.5%, P = 0.4641 versus valsartan a.m.).

The change in mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure (maSBP) from baseline to Week 12 showed no difference between the valsartan a.m. and p.m. groups (−10.6 versus −9.8, P = 0.4219, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −2.30 to 0.96, with no adjustment for multiplicity) and between the valsartan a.m. and lisinopril groups (−10.6 versus −10.7, P = 0.8966, 97.5% CI adjusted for multiplicity: −1.76 to 1.98). The CI limits were well within the noninferiority margins of ± 4 mmHg. The mean hourly systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) values were also comparable among the three treatment groups at Week 12, with the circadian BP profile being similar for the morning and evening dosing of valsartan. Additionally, the change from baseline in maSBP and mean ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (maDBP) at the end of the study (Week 26) was also similar between the valsartan a.m. and p.m. dosing groups.

### Efficacy of lisinopril in migraine prophylaxis — an open label study [^111MRqx7]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The ACE-inhibitor lisinopril has previously been shown to be effective in migraine prophylaxis at a daily dose of 20 mg. To test the effect of a low dose of lisinopril (5 mg daily) in migraine prevention, we performed an open label study in 21 migraineurs. The primary outcome measure was frequency of migraine attacks. Secondary efficacy measures included migraine hours, intake of acute migraine drugs, pain intensity, and responder rate. Compared with baseline conditions, the frequency of migraine attacks was significantly reduced (P < 0.0005). The number of acute migraine drugs used dropped significantly (P = 0.002). Three patients dropped out because of an intolerable cough. Our study suggests that even low doses of lisinopril may be effective in migraine treatment. However, its use may be limited by intolerable side effects.

### Zestoretic [^114mnP1b]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Excessive hypotension is rarely seen in uncomplicated hypertensive patients but is a possible consequence of lisinopril use in salt/volume-depleted persons, such as those treated vigorously with diuretics or patients on dialysis. Syncope has been reported in 0.8 percent of patients receiving Zestoretic, while in patients with hypertension receiving lisinopril alone, the incidence of syncope was 0.1 percent. The overall incidence of syncope may be reduced by proper titration of the individual components.

In patients with severe congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, excessive hypotension has been observed and may be associated with oliguria, progressive azotemia, and rarely, acute renal failure or death. Because of the potential fall in blood pressure in these patients, therapy should be started under very close medical supervision. Such patients should be monitored closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of lisinopril and/or diuretic is increased. Similar considerations apply to patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease, where an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident.

If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline.

### Diverse effects of increasing lisinopril doses on lipid abnormalities in chronic nephropathies [^111TSr9s]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia frequently complicates chronic nephropathies and increases the risk of renal and cardiovascular events, which might be ameliorated by drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors that effectively reduce proteinuria.

- **Methods and results**: In this longitudinal study, we evaluated the extent to which uptitration of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril to maximum tolerated doses (median [range]: 30 [10 to 40] mg/d) ameliorated proteinuria and dyslipidemia in 28 patients with nondiabetic chronic nephropathies. Maximum lisinopril doses significantly and safely reduced proteinuria, serum total, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides without substantially affecting serum HDL and renal hemodynamics. Proteinuria already decreased at 10 mg/d. Serum lipids progressively and dose-dependently decreased during uptitration to maximum doses.

Reduction in total and LDL cholesterol correlated with increases in serum albumin/total protein concentration and oncotic pressure, peaked at lisinopril maximum doses, and persisted after treatment withdrawal. Despite less proteinuria reduction, hypercholesterolemia decreased more (and reflected the increase in serum albumin) in hypoalbuminemic than in normoalbuminemic patients who, despite more proteinuria reduction, had less decrease in cholesterol and no changes in serum albumin. Changes in serum triglycerides were independent of changes in serum proteins, were strongly correlated with lisinopril doses (r = -0.89, P = 0.003), and recovered promptly after treatment withdrawal. Lisinopril was well tolerated, did not affect renal hem.

### Long-term dual blockade with candesartan and lisinopril in hypertensive patients with diabetes: the CALM II study [^117Bdefn]. Diabetes Care (2005). High credibility.

To assess and compare the long-term effects of the combination of candesartan and lisinopril with high-dose lisinopril on systolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension and diabetes, a prospective, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy study with a 12-month follow-up was conducted. Drug therapy was either lisinopril 40 mg once daily or dual-blockade treatment with candesartan 16 mg once daily and lisinopril 20 mg once daily. The study comprised 75 type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients aged 35–74 years. The main outcome measures were seated and 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure.

A reduction in 24-hour systolic blood pressure was obtained in both treatment arms (mean reduction at final follow-up: dual blockade 6 mmHg vs. lisinopril 2 mmHg), but no significant difference was found between dual-blockade and lisinopril 40 mg once daily (P = 0.10). Both treatments were generally well tolerated, and similar low rates of side effects were found in the two groups.

In conclusion, there was no statistically significant difference between lisinopril 40 mg once daily and lisinopril 20 mg in combination with candesartan 16 mg once daily in reducing systolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients with diabetes.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for primary hypertension [^1179mz9q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). High credibility.

ACE inhibitors are widely prescribed for hypertension; therefore, it is essential to determine and compare their effects on blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAE).

- **Objectives**: To quantify the dose-related systolic and/or diastolic BP lowering efficacy of ACE inhibitors versus placebo in the treatment of primary hypertension.

- **Search strategy**: We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2007), EMBASE (1988 to February 2007), and reference lists of articles.

- **Selection criteria**: Double-blind, randomized, controlled trials evaluating the BP lowering efficacy of fixed-dose monotherapy with an ACE inhibitor compared with placebo for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in patients with primary hypertension.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. WDAE information was collected from the trials.

- **Main results**: Ninety-two trials evaluated the dose-related trough BP lowering efficacy of 14 different ACE inhibitors in 12,954 participants with a baseline BP of 157/101 mm Hg. The data do not suggest that any one ACE inhibitor is more effective at lowering BP than others. A dose of 1/8 or 1/4 of the manufacturer's maximum recommended daily dose (Max) achieved a BP lowering effect that was 60 to 70% of the BP lowering effect of Max. A dose of 1/2 Max achieved a BP lowering effect that was 90% of Max. ACE inhibitor doses above Max did not significantly lower BP more than Max.

### Impact of hypertension duration on the cardiovascular benefit of intensive blood pressure control [^112vKx3x]. Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

The optimal timing for initiating intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment remains unclear. While a longer duration of hypertension is positively associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk, it is unknown whether patients with prolonged hypertension can derive similar benefits from intensive SBP treatment.

- **Methods**: From the STEP trial (Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients), 8,442 participants with complete hypertension duration data were categorized by hypertension duration: ≤ 5 years, 5 to 10 years, 10 to 15 years, and > 15 years. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular events. Hazard ratios were calculated using the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model.

- **Results**: The incidences of the primary outcome increased significantly in patients with hypertension over 15 years compared to those with shorter durations. Subgroup analyses indicated a potential sex difference in this relationship between hypertension duration and the primary outcome in the standard SBP treatment.

### Is the extrapolated adult dose of fosinopril safe and effective in treating hypertensive children [^1113TU3S]. Hypertension (2004). High credibility.

We evaluated the efficacy, safety, and dose-response relationship of fosinopril in children aged 6 to 16 years with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure with an associated medical condition requiring treatment. The study was a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted across 78 clinical sites in the United States, Russia, and Israel.

There were four phases: a screening phase lasting up to 10 days, a 4-week dose-response phase, a placebo withdrawal phase lasting up to 2 weeks, and a 52-week open-label safety phase. The primary objective of the dose-response phase was to determine whether low (0.1 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg), or high (0.6 mg/kg) doses of fosinopril, based on established adult dosing, affect trough seated systolic blood pressure. During this phase, all three doses were equally effective in lowering systolic blood pressure.

During the placebo withdrawal phase, there was an adjusted mean systolic blood pressure increase of 5.2 mm Hg for the placebo group and 1.5 mm Hg for the fosinopril group, resulting in a net withdrawal effect of 3.7 mm Hg (P = 0.013). Fosinopril was well tolerated; serious adverse events occurred infrequently and were generally not attributed to fosinopril. Because children appear more sensitive to lower doses of fosinopril than adults, starting doses for children should be ≤ 0.1 mg/kg.

### Paramedic initiated lisinopril for acute stroke treatment (PIL-FAST): results from the pilot randomised controlled trial [^111hfEdz]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

The protocol specified that participants receive 5–10 mg of lisinopril or matched placebo daily for 7 days. The first dose, 5 mg, was administered by a research-trained paramedic sublingually due to the high frequency of swallowing problems in acute stroke. The 5 mg tablet was crushed in a syringe crusher with 3–5 mL of water prior to sublingual administration.

Following arrival at the hospital and review of appropriateness to continue study medication, dose titration was performed. If the systolic BP remained > 150 mm Hg, a second 5 mg dose was to be administered and a daily dose of 10 mg was prescribed. If the systolic BP was < 150 mm Hg, a second dose was not to be administered and a daily dose of 5 mg was prescribed. If clinically significant hypotension occurred, trial medication was withheld.

- **The PIL-FAST trial pack and randomisation**: To enable paramedic access to study medication and administration equipment in the prehospital setting, boxes of medication (lisinopril or placebo, identical in appearance) and other study materials (paramedic research paperwork, syringe crusher, 5 mL syringe, 5 mL vial of water) were packaged into a 'trial pack'. Each pack carried a unique study number according to the randomisation code (intervention and control in 1:1 ratio). One pack was issued to each research-trained paramedic, carried on emergency shifts, and opened when an eligible patient consented to enter the trial. Opened packs accompanied the participant to the hospital where the contents were collected by the hospital research team.

### Low-dose combination therapy: The rationalization for an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker in higher risk patients [^116nxBY7]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

As more high-risk hypertensives are treated, and the need for more intensive antihypertensive therapy is recognized, combination therapies are increasingly used. For initial therapy, particularly for relatively low-risk patients, low-dose combinations are often appropriate. For those who require additional therapy, higher doses of combinations may provide further efficacy while minimizing dose-dependent side effects of monotherapy, thereby improving adherence to therapy.

These combination agents should provide 24-hour control with one daily dose, ensuring protection in the early morning hours. Combining an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker is a rational approach to treating hypertension. Not only does it provide significantly better blood pressure control than individual components used as monotherapy, but it also minimizes dose-dependent side effects. Additionally, combining agents from different classes results in complementary mechanisms of action that provide other cardiovascular protective benefits.

### Suspected aripiprazole-induced neutropenia in a geriatric patient: A case report [^114NhKJY]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Low credibility.

It is highly unlikely that the patient developed neutropenia from lisinopril or citalopram, as there is no established association between these drugs and neutropenia. Although not required, a temporal relationship between an adverse reaction and exposure to the suspected agent is highly suspicious, and in this case, a temporal relationship only exists with aripiprazole. Additionally, the patient did not have any prior adverse reactions to lisinopril or citalopram during previous hospitalizations, and restarting these medications did not result in a return of neutropenia. Levothyroxine's adverse effects are typically limited to symptoms of hyperthyroidism and are not known to be associated with neutropenia. It is highly unlikely that metformin or insulin induced the patient's neutropenia, as he has taken these medications for decades due to his chronic diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, while the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia mildly fluctuated throughout this hospitalization, there was no significant change or trend away from baseline, suggesting that this was an isolated neutropenic dyscrasia.

The exact mechanism for aripiprazole-associated neutropenia is unknown, and there are not enough reported cases to establish which populations may be at risk. However, clozapine-induced agranulocytosis has been extensively studied and may partially explain the observed association in this case. Aripiprazole is similar to clozapine and olanzapine in that their metabolism involves the production of nitrenium ions. In clozapine studies, these nitrenium ions were shown to covalently bind to cellular proteins, potentially leading to neutropenia.

### Selective inhibition of the C-domain of ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme) combined with inhibition of NEP (Neprilysin): A potential new therapy for hypertension [^115fCzwq]. Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

We developed a C-domain-selective derivative of lisinopril (lisinopril-tryptophan [lisW-S]) by substituting a tryptophan for the P2' proline. In TtRhRen mice (LinA3), a model of Ang II–dependent hypertension, lisW-S effectively reduced Ang II levels and lowered BP without influencing BK levels. The effect of lisW-S combined with a NEP inhibitor could have the same beneficial effects as omapatrilat but without the undesirable properties attributed to BK accumulation. We, therefore, hypothesized that this new combination would reduce BP, improve cardiovascular function, and reduce Ang II levels without affecting BK levels. To gain a better understanding of the systematic actions of this combined treatment, we compared its effects to sacubitril, lisinopril (which inhibits ACE C- and N-domains), lisinopril+sacubitril, and omapatrilat (which inhibits ACE C- and N-domains).

### Starting antihypertensive drug treatment with combination therapy: Controversies in hypertension - con side of the argument [^114iinKP]. Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

The 2018 European guideline proposed that the combination of medications targeting multiple mechanisms, such as blocking the renin-angiotensin system and inducing vasodilatation and diuresis, reduces the heterogeneity of the blood pressure (BP) responses to initial treatment and provides a steeper dose response than is observed with escalating doses of monotherapy. Whereas this might be true during the first six months after starting BP-lowering treatment, this certainly does not apply to the long-term life course treatment of hypertension. A post hoc analysis of the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-Term Use Evaluation Trial did not confirm the widely promoted notion in single-pill combination (SPC) publications that earlier short-term differences in BP lowering over the long run would reduce cardiovascular end points. Furthermore, the European and International Societies of Hypertension guidelines ignored that the association of multiple drugs in a single pharmaceutical formulation may have effects on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of each individual component and may lead to undesired interactions between components.

The trials and observational studies reviewed in this debate article were generally not powered or had a duration not long enough to highlight serious adverse effects. As demonstrated by an observational study of patients aged 50 years or more and reflecting a real-world setting, use of SPCs was associated with a greater risk of hypotension than titrated single-drug (SD) free combinations. Moreover, beyond commonly attributable adverse effects, other concerns remain.

### Long-term renoprotective effect of nisoldipine and lisinopril in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy [^115MtrYd]. Diabetes Care (2000). Low credibility.

To compare the long-term effect on kidney function of a long-acting calcium antagonist (nisoldipine) versus a long-acting ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) in hypertensive type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy, a study was conducted.

- **Research design and methods**: We performed a 4-year prospective, randomized, double-dummy controlled study comparing nisoldipine (20–40 mg once a day) with lisinopril (10–20 mg once a day). The study was double-blinded for the first year and single-blinded thereafter. The study included 51 hypertensive type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy. Three patients dropped out during the first month; results for the remaining 48 patients are presented.

- **Results**: At baseline, the two groups were comparable: glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 85 ± 5 and 85 ± 6 ml/min/1.73 m²; mean 24-h ambulatory blood pressure was 108 ± 3 and 105 ± 2 mmHg, and albuminuria was 1,554 mg/24 h (95% CI 980–2,465) and 1,033 mg/24 h (760–1,406) in the lisinopril and nisoldipine groups, respectively. Mean 24-h arterial blood pressure during the study did not differ between the lisinopril and nisoldipine groups (100 ± 2 and 103 ± 1 mmHg, respectively). The time-course of albuminuria differed between groups (P < 0.001). Initiation of treatment with lisinopril resulted in a reduction from baseline albuminuria by 52% (95% CI 14–73), whereas albuminuria in the nisoldipine group did not change throughout the study. GFR declined in a biphasic manner with an initial (0–6 months) reduction of 1.3 ± 0.3 ml/min/month in the lisinopril group.

### Does the antihypertensive response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition predict the antihypertensive response to angiotensin receptor antagonism [^1159RJ9J]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that the antihypertensive response to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition can predict the response to angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) antagonism, 33 hypertensive patients were randomized to receive lisinopril (20 mg) or losartan (50 mg) for 5 weeks. Patients were then crossed over to the alternative treatment for a second 5-week period. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) was measured before randomization and on the final day of each period.

The agreement in ABP response between the two drugs was assessed using the following approaches:

- **Subjects classification**: Subjects were classified as responders and nonresponders using a threshold: an arbitrary level of response (ABP fall ≥ 10 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 5 mm Hg diastolic) or the median ABP response achieved by each of the drugs.

- **Disagreement expression**: Disagreement between the two drugs in the responders-nonresponders classification was expressed as the proportion of subjects whose ABP responded to only one of the drugs. Lisinopril was more effective than losartan in reducing ABP (mean difference 4.7 ± 8.1/3.3 ± 5.7 mm Hg, systolic/diastolic, P < .05). Disagreement in the antihypertensive response between the two drugs was found in 39%/33% of subjects for systolic/diastolic ABP using the arbitrary response criterion (33%/39% using the median response criterion).

Significant correlations were found between the responses to lisinopril and losartan (r = 0.47/0.59, systolic/diastolic, P < .01). We conclude that in more than one third of hypertensive subjects, the blood pressure response to ACE inhibition fails to predict the response to A

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^115aJoE7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

One trial that supports the first-line status of thiazides, CCBs, and ACEIs is the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). This trial randomized 33,357 people aged ≥ 55 years with hypertension and ≥ 1 other CVD risk factor to chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril. All-cause mortality was not different between the groups, and while SBP was higher in the amlodipine and lisinopril groups compared with chlorthalidone, the difference was statistically but not clinically significant at 0.8 to 2 mm Hg (P < 0.05). However, there were some notable differences in secondary outcomes, like higher rates of HF in the amlodipine group (10.2%) versus the chlorthalidone group (7.7%). Because the primary outcome and other secondary outcomes were comparable, this was not considered by JNC 8 as a strong enough reason to recommend thiazide diuretics as the sole initial antihypertensive class.

ASH/ISH and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence make a distinction for those aged < 55 to 60 years to favor an ACEI or ARB, while those aged ≥ 55 to 60 years should start with a thiazide or CCB. β‐Blockers are included as first line for adults aged < 60 years in the Canadian Hypertension Education Program guidelines and for adults aged < 80 years in ESH/ESC. While combination therapy with β‐blockers can be very effective, the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) study demonstrated a lower rate of death, MI, or stroke in their losartan group compared with the atenolol group.

### Comparison of candesartan with lisinopril on ambulatory blood pressure and morning surge in patients with systemic hypertension [^114o92Hj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

We performed a prospective crossover study in 73 essential hypertensives to compare the effects of candesartan and lisinopril on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and early-morning BP. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP monitoring was performed at baseline and for each active treatment. Small doses of thiazide diuretic were added as needed. The effects of both drugs on 24-hour BP were almost identical and satisfactory. When we classified patients into the morning surge group (the highest quartile of morning systolic BP surge > 36 mm Hg) and the non-morning surge group (the remaining three quartiles of morning BP surge), candesartan was superior in decreasing morning BP and morning BP surge.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^1153Uwrd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

Guidelines for hypertension vary in their preference for initial combination therapy or initial monotherapy, stratified by patient profile; therefore, we compared the efficacy and tolerability of these approaches.

- **Methods and results**: We performed a 1-year, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 605 untreated patients aged 18 to 79 years with systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 95 mm Hg. In phase 1 (weeks 0–16), patients were randomly assigned to initial monotherapy (losartan 50–100 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg, crossing over at 8 weeks) or initial combination (losartan 50–100 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg). In phase 2 (weeks 17–32), all patients received losartan 100 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg. In phase 3 (weeks 33–52), amlodipine with or without doxazosin could be added to achieve target BP.

	- **Outcomes**: Hierarchical primary outcomes were the difference from baseline in home systolic BP, averaged over phases 1 and 2 and, if significant, at 32 weeks. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and the difference in home systolic BP responses between tertiles of plasma renin. Home systolic BP after initial monotherapy fell 4.9 mm Hg (range: 3.7–6.0 mm Hg) less over 32 weeks (P < 0.001) than after initial combination, but caught up at 32 weeks (difference 1.2 mm Hg [range: -0.4 to 2.8 mm Hg], P = 0.13).

	- **Subgroup analysis**: In phase 1, home systolic BP response to each monotherapy differed substantially between renin tertiles, whereas response to combination therapy was uniform and at least 5 mm Hg more than to monotherapy.

### Low-dose lisinopril in normotensive men with idiopathic oligospermia and infertility: a 5-year randomized, controlled, crossover pilot study [^115C35Xg]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

The outcomes of drug treatment for male infertility remain conjectural, with controversial study results. Our pilot study employed a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover methodology with intention-to-treat analysis. Thirty-three men with idiopathic oligospermia were randomized to start either daily oral lisinopril 2.5 mg (n = 17) or daily oral placebo (n = 16). Lisinopril was found to cause a normalization of seminal parameters in 53.6% of the participants. Although the mean ejaculate volume was unchanged (P ≥ 0.093), the total sperm cell count and the percentage of motile sperm cells increased (P ≤ 0.03 and P < 0.001, respectively), whereas the percentage of sperm cells with abnormal morphology decreased (P ≤ 0.04). The pregnancy rate was 48.5%, and there was no serious adverse drug event. It is concluded, albeit cautiously, that prolonged treatment with 2.5 mg/day of oral lisinopril may be well tolerated in normotensive men with idiopathic oligospermia, may improve sperm quantity and quality, and may enhance fertility in approximately half of those treated.

### Lisinopril for the treatment of hypertension within the first 24 hours of acute ischemic stroke and follow-up [^1175m1GC]. American Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Hypertension immediately after an acute ischemic stroke is associated with impaired morbidity and mortality, although there are limited data on antihypertensive use immediately after ictus. This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study explored the hemodynamic effect and safety of oral lisinopril initiated within 24 hours after an ictus.

- **Methods**: Forty hypertensive patients, with systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 140 or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg, experiencing acute ischemic stroke (14 lacunar, 13 partial anterior, 7 total anterior, 6 posterior circulation infarct), were randomized to receive 5 mg of oral lisinopril (n = 18) or a matching placebo (n = 22). The dose was increased to 10 mg (or 2 x placebo) on day 7 if casual systolic BP was ≥ 140 mm Hg and continued to day 14. After the initial dose, automated BP levels were monitored for 16 hours. BP levels and stroke outcome measures were assessed on day 14, and all patients were followed to day 90.

- **Results**: At 4 hours after the first dose, systolic/diastolic BP changed by -20 ± 21/-6 ± 10 mm Hg (mean ± SE) in the lisinopril group and 1 ± 11/0 ± 8 mm Hg in the placebo group, with significant group differences: systolic BP, P < .05; diastolic BP, P = .07. With a daily dosing regimen, systolic BP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), diastolic BP, and pulse pressure (PP) were significantly lower in the lisinopril group compared to the placebo group at day 14 (P < .01). Neurologic and functional measures were similar between groups at follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Lisinopril, even at small dosages, is well tolerated and an effective hypotensive agent after acute ischemic stroke.

### Comparison of the effects of omapatrilat and lisinopril on circulating neurohormones and cytokines in patients with chronic heart failure [^1134GmCm]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors exert their effects by modulating the neurohumoral milieu. Vasopeptidase inhibitors (VPI) are ACE and neutral endopeptidase inhibitors and may increase natriuretic peptides, bradykinin, and perhaps endothelin-1 in patients with congestive heart failure. Patients (n = 107) with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association functional class II to III, with left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%, and on ACE inhibitor therapy were randomized to either the VPI omapatrilat 40 mg/day or the ACE inhibitor lisinopril 20 mg/day. Trough levels of neurohormones (24 hours after dosing) were assessed at baseline, and at 12 and 24 weeks of follow-up.

C-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide (C-ANP) levels decreased with lisinopril (p = 0.035), but not with omapatrilat. In contrast, N-terminal ANP levels did not change, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels tended to decrease similarly in both groups. Endothelin-1 levels increased in both groups, with the increase reaching statistical significance with omapatrilat (p = 0.008). Levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 tended to decrease, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 increased in both groups, with statistical significance only for interleukin-10 with omapatrilat therapy. Neither agent changed catecholamines or angiotensin II.

Thus, even at trough levels, omapatrilat potentiates C-ANP more than lisinopril. Potentially important effects of omapatrilat on endothelin-1 and anti-inflammatory cytokines were identified, providing potential explanations for.

### Discontinuation vs. continuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibition before non-cardiac surgery: The SPACE trial [^117WzcbJ]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

For most ACE inhibitors alone, at least 24 hours of cessation is required. For example, the duration of action for lisinopril and ramipril, the most common ACE inhibitors used by patients recruited into the SPACE trial, is 24 hours, with half-life elimination times of 12–17 hours, respectively. The lack of consistency in when RAS inhibitors have been stopped before — and restarted after — non-cardiac surgery explains, in part, the considerable variability in international recommendations for the management of RAS inhibitors in surgical patients.

The evidence base relies mostly on retrospective studies with a strong risk of bias and small, single-center randomized trials that had non-blinded primary outcomes. A trial of similar size to ours examined hemodynamic changes after 275 patients were randomized to either continuing ACE inhibitors or omitting a single ACE inhibitor dose. Intra-operative hypotension occurred less frequently after ACE inhibitor omission, accompanied by lower vasopressor use. Similar to our study, post-operative hypertension was more frequent when ACE inhibitors were omitted, although fluid requirements did not differ between groups. In the absence of markers for organ injury, the relevance of these hemodynamic alterations remains unclear. Moreover, recent randomized controlled trial data do not support universally targeting higher intra-operative blood pressures to reduce post-operative complications.

In our study, we specifically focused on older patients aged over 60 years, who are at the most risk of myocardial injury, rather than younger patients (age ≥ 18 years) with markedly less risk of morbidity.

### Development of lisinopril radioconjugates for nuclear imaging of the angiotensin converting enzyme [^111HAruA]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is essential in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis, and its dysfunction is associated with various pathological conditions. This study aimed to investigate lisinopril-based radioconjugates for nuclear imaging of ACE.

- **Methods**: Lisinopril conjugates were prepared using solid-phase peptide synthesis and labeled with gallium-67. The resulting radioconjugates were assessed for their in vitro stability in saline and in mouse and human blood plasma. ACE-mediated uptake was evaluated in HEK cells transfected with human ACE, and the findings were interpreted using molecular dynamic studies. Tissue distribution profiles of the radioconjugates were evaluated in mice bearing HEK-ACE xenografts by means of nuclear imaging and classic biodistribution studies. The feasibility to detect physiologic ACE was further assessed by ex vivo autoradiography of the lungs and the kidneys collected from mice injected with [⁶⁷Ga]Ga-DOTA-LIS-02.

- **Results**: DOTA-LIS-01, DOTA-LIS-02, and NODAGA-LIS-02 were prepared with > 98% chemical purity. Radiolabeling of the conjugates with gallium-67 was achieved at 80 MBq/nmol with > 99% radiochemical purity. [⁶⁷Ga]Ga-DOTA-LIS-02 and [⁶⁷Ga]Ga-NODAGA-LIS-02 exhibited radiolytic stability for up to 3 hours in saline and remained intact in mouse and human blood plasma for 1 hour. The uptake of [⁶⁷Ga]Ga-DOTA-LIS-02 and [⁶⁷Ga]Ga-NODAGA-LIS-02 in HEK-ACE cells after 3 hours of incubation reached ~57% and ~50%, respectively, while only ~21% cell uptake was reached with [⁶⁷Ga]Ga-DOTA-LIS-01. This discrepancy was ascribed to the different properties of the radioconjugates.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^1174mEMA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.

- **Primary objective**: To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

- **Search strategy**: Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Clinical Trial Register, using the standard search strategy of the Hypertension Review Group with additional terms.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of at least one-year duration comparing one of the six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

- **Main results**: Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95), and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84). However, high-dose thiazides (1 trial)…

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce mortality in hypertension: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors involving 158,998 patients [^1159DzbN]. European Heart Journal (2012). High credibility.

The reduced effect of ARBs on mortality compared to ACE inhibitors has also been previously discussed. A recent meta-analysis of 37 ARB trials failed to detect a reduction in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality in a broad population of patients. The differences in the modes of action between ACE inhibitors and ARBs, and the small-but-definite BP-independent reduction in CAD mortality with ACE inhibitors, which has not been observed with ARBs or other antihypertensive agents, might contribute to this finding.

On the other hand, others have demonstrated that BP-dependent beneficial effects in the prevention of stroke and heart failure are similar for ACE inhibitors and ARBs. ACE inhibitors and ARBs have also been shown to be equally effective in preventing atrial fibrillation and new-onset diabetes. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that we did not design this meta-analysis to make a head-to-head comparison between ACE inhibitors and ARBs. The finding that the beneficial effect is seen in the ACE inhibitor population as opposed to the ARB population should be considered a post hoc observation.

Given the nature of meta-analyses, which are per definition data-driven, the differential effect between ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be interpreted with caution to avoid overstating this subgroup finding vis-à-vis the a priori hypothesis. In this respect, it should also be noted that the difference in effect on cardiovascular mortality between ACE inhibitors and ARBs was not statistically significant.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study of the effectiveness and safety of lisinopril for children with hypertension [^1179kB32]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Despite its widespread use in hypertensive children, the safety and effectiveness of lisinopril had not been previously tested in a controlled study. This study explored the dose-response relationship and safety of lisinopril in 115 hypertensive children aged 6 to 16 years. Patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion for two weeks to one of three doses by body weight at baseline: ≥ 50 kg: low (1.25 mg), middle (5 mg), high (40 mg). The dose-response for lisinopril was evaluated by analyzing the change in slope in sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure (BP) by dose after two weeks of therapy compared to baseline. Patients then entered a double-blind withdrawal, where they were either switched to placebo or continued their lisinopril treatment for up to two weeks. Patients completed period II when their BP returned to baseline. Antihypertensive effectiveness between placebo and lisinopril was determined for all doses, and adverse events were carefully monitored.

There was a dose-response relationship between the lowest and each of the higher doses of lisinopril. Blood pressure in the placebo group increased after the withdrawal of lisinopril. The dose-response relationship was consistent across all subgroups (e.g. age, Tanner stage, ethnicity, gender).

Lisinopril, administered once daily, proved to be an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive in children aged 6 to 16 years. An initial dose of 0.07 mg/kg, administered once daily, effectively lowered BP within two weeks.

### Effects of immediate versus delayed antihypertensive therapy on outcome in the Systolic Hypertension in Europe trial [^112aX4mq]. Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

To assess the impact of immediate versus delayed antihypertensive treatment on the outcome of older patients with isolated systolic hypertension, we extended the double-blind, placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) trial by an open-label follow-up study lasting 4 years.

- **Methods**: The Syst-Eur trial included 4,695 randomized patients with a minimum age of 60 years and an untreated blood pressure of 160–219 mmHg systolic and below 95 mmHg diastolic. The double-blind trial ended following a median follow-up of 2.0 years (range 1–97 months). Of 4,409 patients still alive, 3,517 received open-label treatment consisting of nitrendipine (10–40 mg daily) with the possible addition of enalapril (5–20 mg daily), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5–25 mg daily), or both add-on drugs. Non-participants (n = 892) were also followed up.

- **Results**: Median follow-up increased to 6.1 years. Systolic pressure decreased to below 150 mmHg (target level) in 2,628 participants (75.0%). During the 4-year open-label follow-up, stroke and cardiovascular complications occurred at similar frequencies in patients formerly randomized to placebo and those continuing active treatment. These rates were similar to those previously observed in the active-treatment group during the double-blind trial. Considering the total follow-up of 4,695 randomized patients, immediate compared with delayed antihypertensive treatment reduced the occurrence of stroke and cardiovascular complications by 28% (P = 0.01) and 15% (P = 0.03), respectively, with a similar tendency for total mortality (13%, P = 0.09).

### Sustained 24-hour blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: a high dose of a long-acting blocker is as effective as a lower dose combined with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [^114TWo8N]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Whether a higher dose of a long-acting angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) can provide as much blockade of the renin-angiotensin system over a 24-hour period as the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a lower dose of ARB has not been formally demonstrated so far.

In this randomized double-blind study, we investigated renin-angiotensin system blockade obtained with three doses of olmesartan medoxomil (20, 40, and 80 mg every day) in 30 normal subjects and compared it with that obtained with lisinopril alone (20 mg every day) or combined with olmesartan medoxomil (20 or 40 mg). Each subject received two dose regimens for one week according to a crossover design, with a one-week washout period between doses.

The primary endpoint was the degree of blockade of the systolic blood pressure response to angiotensin I 24 hours after the last dose following one week of administration. At trough, the systolic blood pressure response to exogenous angiotensin I was 58% ± 19% with 20 mg lisinopril (mean ± SD), 58% ± 11% with 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil, 62% ± 16% with 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil, and 76% ± 12% with the highest dose of olmesartan medoxomil (80 mg) [P = .016 versus 20 mg lisinopril and P = .0015 versus 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil]. With the combinations, blockade was 80% ± 22% with 20 mg lisinopril plus 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil and 83% ± 9% with 20 mg lisinopril plus 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil [P = .3 versus 80 mg olmesartan medoxomil alone].

These data demonstrate that a higher dose of the long-acting ARB olmesartan medoxomil can produce an almost complete blockade.
