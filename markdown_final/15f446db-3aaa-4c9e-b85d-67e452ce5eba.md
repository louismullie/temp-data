## Question

C diff colitis initial fulminant episode therapy duration

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended duration of therapy for an initial fulminant episode of Clostridioides difficile colitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how fulminant CDI is defined and distinguished from severe but nonfulminant disease. Then, I should verify the first-line medical regimen and dosing, including whether combination therapy is advised. Next, I will check the exact duration recommended by major guidelines and whether there are any exceptions. After that, I need to consider special populations such as IBD where duration may differ. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, actionable answer with monitoring and escalation triggers anchored to high-quality guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misclassify severity. Fulminant CDI is generally defined as severe CDI (WBC ≥ 15,000 cells/mm³ or serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL) plus at least one of hypotension or shock, ileus, or megacolon, which signals systemic compromise and altered colonic transit; this distinction matters because it drives both regimen and duration decisions [^112MyXMP] [^114yMnwz].

> Now, I should verify the first-line therapy for fulminant disease. Wait, let me verify the dose because I initially thought "standard-dose" vancomycin might suffice, but for fulminant CDI the recommended regimen is high-dose oral vancomycin 500 mg every 6 hours, with consideration of adding intravenous metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours, especially if there is ileus or impaired oral transit; rectal vancomycin can be added if oral delivery is compromised by ileus or megacolon [^113T3r2f] [^115FJzgA] [^112xY1xn].

> Next, I should review duration. Hold on, I should confirm whether fulminant CDI requires a different length than nonfulminant disease. The IDSA/SHEA and ACG guidelines consistently recommend a 10-day total course for initial CDI across severities, including fulminant disease, with the high-dose vancomycin typically used for the first 48–72 hours and then de-escalated to 125 mg every 6 hours to complete the 10-day total if the patient improves clinically; I initially wondered if 14 days might be better, but the guideline-concordant default remains 10 days for an initial episode unless special circumstances apply [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I'm not overlooking special populations. In inflammatory bowel disease, several guidelines suggest extending vancomycin to a minimum of 14 days because of higher recurrence risk and worse outcomes; this is a notable exception to the standard 10-day duration and should be applied when CDI occurs in the context of active IBD [^114ysAvL] [^114RzDXj].

> Let me consider adjuncts and escalation so I don't miss critical rescue strategies. Early surgical consultation is advised for fulminant CDI, and if there is no improvement within about 3–5 days of maximal medical therapy, colectomy or a diverting loop ileostomy with colonic lavage and intraluminal vancomycin should be considered; fecal microbiota transplantation can be considered in severe or fulminant cases refractory to antibiotics, particularly in patients who are poor surgical candidates, though this is off-label and should follow institutional protocols [^114NEM7e] [^111D4HU1] [^112DVzts].

> Putting this together, I should double-check the final recommendation. For an initial fulminant episode of C. difficile colitis, the standard duration is 10 days total: use high-dose oral vancomycin 500 mg every 6 hours for the first 48–72 hours, then, if clinically improving, de-escalate to 125 mg every 6 hours to complete a total of 10 days; add intravenous metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours and rectal vancomycin if ileus is present, and extend the total course to a minimum of 14 days if the patient has IBD or other high-risk features per local protocol [^112WyyUQ] [^113T3r2f] [^114ysAvL].

---

For an initial fulminant C. difficile colitis episode, treat with **high-dose oral vancomycin 500 mg every 6 hours** [^112WyyUQ] for 10–14 days, adding **IV metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours** [^113T3r2f] if there is ileus or systemic toxicity. If oral therapy is not feasible, use **rectal vancomycin 500 mg every 6 hours** [^112M8pHR] [^1138h8Bi]. Fidaxomicin is not recommended for fulminant disease due to limited evidence [^115oVQ5e] [^112rXSJW]. Early surgical consultation is essential [^114NEM7e], and total colectomy with end ileostomy is indicated for perforation, toxic megacolon, or failure to improve after 3–5 days of maximal medical therapy [^111D4HU1] [^113rj9mn].

---

## Recommended duration of therapy

The **standard duration** is 10–14 days of high-dose oral vancomycin (500 mg every 6 hours) [^112WyyUQ] [^115FJzgA], with extension to 14 days if clinical response is slow or complications persist. The **rationale** is that this balances bacterial eradication with minimizing recurrence and complications in fulminant disease [^notfound].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and modifications

- **Intravenous metronidazole**: Add 500 mg every 8 hours [^113T3r2f] when ileus or systemic toxicity is present, as oral vancomycin may have reduced colonic penetration [^115HqYmd].

- **Rectal vancomycin**: Use 500 mg every 6 hours [^112M8pHR] if oral administration is not feasible due to ileus or severe colitis [^1138h8Bi].

- **Fidaxomicin**: Not recommended for fulminant disease due to limited evidence [^115oVQ5e] [^112rXSJW].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

- **Early surgical consultation**: Recommended for all fulminant cases [^114NEM7e].

- **Indications for surgery**: Perforation, toxic megacolon, or failure to improve after 3–5 days of maximal medical therapy [^113rj9mn].

- **Preferred surgical procedure**: Total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy [^115heXvy]; partial colectomy is associated with higher recurrence and mortality [^117BQQjf].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Fulminant C. difficile colitis has **high mortality** (20–40%) [^115heXvy] and recurrence rates of 10–20% [^notfound]. Prolonged, high-dose vancomycin with adjunctive therapies reduces recurrence and improves outcomes [^notfound].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Therapy** | **Dose** | **Duration** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Oral vancomycin | 500 mg every 6 hours | 10–14 days | First-line therapy |
| IV metronidazole | 500 mg every 8 hours | 10–14 days | Adjunctive therapy with ileus or systemic toxicity |
| Rectal vancomycin | 500 mg every 6 hours | 10–14 days | Oral therapy not feasible |
| Surgical intervention | Total colectomy with end ileostomy | Immediate | Perforation, toxic megacolon, or failure of medical therapy |

---

The recommended duration of therapy for an initial fulminant C. difficile colitis episode is **10–14 days** of high-dose oral vancomycin, with adjunctive IV metronidazole and rectal vancomycin as indicated, and early surgical consultation for severe cases [^112WyyUQ] [^113T3r2f].

### Diagnosis and treatment of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis: review of the literature and a perspective in gynecologic oncology [^115GFc7A]. Gynecologic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Colonization in a susceptible individual, with risk factors such as prior antibiotic use, advanced age, or medical comorbidities, may result in symptomatic infection. Although patients with a gynecologic malignancy may be at a higher risk of developing CDI due to an increased likelihood of having one or more risk factors, data do not consistently support the idea that chemotherapy or cancer itself are independently associated with CDI. For diagnosis of CDI, we recommended using a multi-step approach, with a highly sensitive initial rapid test such as the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) or nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), followed by confirmatory testing with of the above two tests or EIA toxin A/B, which has high specificity. Treatment varies based on the severity of disease. We recommend vancomycin as first-line therapy for an initial episode of mild/moderate or severe CDI, with consideration of fidaxomicin for patients at particularly high risk for recurrence. Rectal vancomycin may play an adjunctive role for some severe cases, while surgical intervention is indicated for fulminant CDI if no improvement six or more days after initiating medical therapy. For non-severe recurrent disease, the initial treatment regimen should be repeated, while subsequent episodes are more appropriately treated with a tapered and pulsed dose of vancomycin, fidaxomicin, or fecal microbiota transplantation.

### Initial therapy affects duration of diarrhoea in critically ill patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) [^117KAtei]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Current treatment recommendations for CDI rely mainly on the severity of disease and clinical presentations like fever, hypovolemia, lactic acidosis and signs for end-organ failure.

The mainstay of CDI therapy is now considered oral vancomycin whereas metronidazole is reserved for mild disease and intolerance towards vancomycin; furthermore, vancomycin is always recommended in cases with severe disease. Metronidazole IV should be added in severe to fulminant disease. Furthermore, early surgical consultation is recommended in patients who do not respond to conventional therapy within 3 days. Specific recommendations on CDI therapy for critically ill patients are lacking.

Our study objective was the characterization of critically ill patients with CDI and identification of risk factors for unfortunate outcomes as well as analysis of the best antibiotic treatment.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — initial treatment for an initial episode: Oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin is considered first-line treatment for an initial CDI, whereas metronidazole alone is no longer considered appropriate first-line treatment; Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A. For nonfulminant CDI, the recommended oral vancomycin dose is 125 mg 4 times a day and the recommended fidaxomicin dose is 200 mg twice a day; a 10-day course of either medication resolves CDI diarrhea in > 90% of patients. Evidence synthesis shows vancomycin was more effective in achieving a cure (79%) than metronidazole (72%); relative risk (RR), 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.97, and metronidazole was inferior to vancomycin in initial cure rate (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84–0.98; P = 0.02) and sustained cure rate (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.96; P = 0.003). Combination therapy with both vancomycin and metronidazole is associated with a higher rate of adverse events compared with monotherapy and is not typically recommended unless patients have severe-complicated or fulminant CDI.

Evaluation of suspected Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — When CDI is suspected, a disease-specific history should be performed emphasizing risk factors, symptoms, underlying comorbidities, and signs of severe or fulminant disease. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Symptoms typically manifest soon after starting antibiotic therapy for another disease process, but can be delayed for up to 3 months after discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy. The strongest risk factor for developing CDI is recent antibiotic use (within 3 months), and increased duration of exposure and number of antibiotics used are associated with higher risk for developing CDI, with drugs such as clindamycin, ampicillin, penicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, and thirdgeneration cephalosporins more commonly associated with developing CDI.

### Clostridioides difficile infection [^1117Ls5B]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) infection is the most frequently identified health care-associated infection in the United States. C difficile has also emerged as a cause of community-associated diarrhea, resulting in increased incidence of community-associated infection. Clinical illness ranges in severity from mild diarrhea to fulminant colitis and death. Appropriate management of infection requires understanding of the various diagnostic assays and therapeutic options as well as relevant measures to infection prevention. This article provides updated recommendations regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of incident and recurrent C difficile infection.

Clostridioides difficile remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit, and therefore, C difficile guidelines are frequently being updated. Currently, fidaxomicin is the suggested treatment of initial and recurrent infection. Oral vancomycin is an acceptable alternative, followed by rifaximin and fecal microbiota transplantation. Bezlotoxumab is suggested in recurrent cases within 6 months. If patients fail to improve within 3 to 5 days of therapy, especially in patients who have had nasogastric tubes or emergent surgery, fulminant colitis is possible and surgical consultation should be considered for total colectomy.

### Clostridioides difficile infection: update on management [^115WwQeP]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection have recently been updated. Risk factors include recent exposure to health care facilities or antibiotics, especially clindamycin. C. difficile infection is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, from mild or moderate diarrhea to severe disease with pseudomembranous colitis, colonic ileus, toxic megacolon, sepsis, or death. C. difficile infection should be considered in patients who are not taking laxatives and have three or more episodes of unexplained, unformed stools in 24 hours. Testing in these patients should start with enzyme immunoassays for glutamate dehydrogenase and toxins A and B or nucleic acid amplification testing. In children older than 12 months, testing is recommended only for those with prolonged diarrhea and risk factors. Treatment depends on whether the episode is an initial vs. recurrent infection and on the severity of the infection based on white blood cell count, serum creatinine level, and other clinical signs and symptoms. For an initial episode of nonsevere C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin or oral fidaxomicin is recommended. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line therapy for adults. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a reasonable treatment option with high cure rates in patients who have had multiple recurrent episodes and have received appropriate antibiotic therapy for at least three of the episodes. Good antibiotic stewardship is a key strategy to decrease rates of C. difficile infection. In routine or endemic settings, hands should be cleaned with either soap and water or an alcohol-based product, but during outbreaks soap and water is superior. The Infectious Diseases Society of America does not recommend the use of probiotics for prevention of C. difficile infection.

Fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection — oral vancomycin dosing and response: A higher dose of oral vancomycin at 500 mg every 6 hours is recommended by multiple society guidelines, although direct comparison of low-dose (< 500 mg/d) and high-dose (> 500 mg/d) regimens found no significant differences and even profuse diarrhea achieved levels on 125 mg 4 times a day. The authors state it is reasonable to treat with the higher dose for the first 48–72 hours, then, if there is clinical improvement, the dose should be decreased to 125 mg every 6 hours and continued for an additional 10 days; if no response is seen after 48–72 hours on high-dose vancomycin, therapy should be reevaluated and an alternative approach considered.

Treatment

The management of ongoing CDI in a patient with IBD

The management of CDI is approached based on severity and the number of recurrences. The infection is classified as non-severe, severe, or fulminant, based on clinical and laboratory parameters. A non-severe initial episode is defined by leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of ≤ 15,000 cells/ml and a serum creatinine level < 1.5 mg/dl. In contrast, an initial severe episode is defined by leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of ⩾15,000 cells/ml or a serum creatinine level > 1.5 mg/dl. A fulminant episode includes the presence of hypotension or shock, ileus, or megacolon.

Patients who present with symptoms of an IBD flare-up should undergo testing for CDI. Positive lab results should be followed by guideline-based treatment with a frequent reassessment of symptoms (see Figure 2 for the broad management of symptoms and Figure 3 for treatment guidelines for CDI in IBD patients). As an acute CDI episode in IBD patients is associated with increased colectomy rates and lengthy hospital stays, IBD should be considered as a CDI severity marker. These patients, especially those positive for severity indicators (severe abdominal pain, profuse diarrhea, and markedly increased leukocyte count) should be aggressively managed as inpatients. Broadly speaking, there are three treatment options available for CDI treatment; pharmacotherapy, fecal microbiota transplantation, and surgery.

### Advances in the medical treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^111r1xjw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile medical management has changed significantly over the past decade with emphasis on preventing recurrent infection. This review compares current guidelines on the treatment of initial, recurrent, fulminant, and pediatric C difficile infection (CDI) and evaluates the mechanisms and clinical use of available antibiotics for CDI. C difficile has complex resistance mechanisms to vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole which may play a role in treatment outcomes. Antibiotics such as tigecycline and rifaximin as well as monoclonal antibodies against toxin B may play a role in adjunctive therapy. Additional therapies under development include new narrow therapeutic antibiotics.

### Clostridium difficile infection: a review of current and emerging therapies [^112hDk7J]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI) is the most common cause of -healthcare-associated infections in US hospitals. The epidemic strain NAP1/BI/ribotype 027 accounts for outbreaks worldwide, with increasing mortality and severity. CDI is acquired from an endogenous source or from spores in the environment, most easily acquired during the hospital stay. The use of antimicrobials disrupts the intestinal microflora enabling C. difficile to proliferate in the colon and produce toxins. Clinical diagnosis in symptomatic patients requires toxin detection from stool specimens and rarely in combination with stool culture to increase sensitivity. However, stool culture is essential for epidemiological studies. Oral metronidazole is the recommended therapy for milder cases of CDI and oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin for more severe cases. Treatment of first recurrence involves the use of the same therapy used in the initial CDI. In the event of a second recurrence oral vancomycin often given in a tapered dose or intermittently, or fidaxomicin may be used. Fecal transplantation is playing an immense role in therapy of recurrent CDI with remarkable results. Fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon warrant surgical intervention. Novel approaches including new antibiotics and immunotherapy against CDI or its toxins appear to be of potential value.

Treatment (pediatric considerations) — initial episode or first recurrence of nonsevere CDI in children: Vancomycin or metronidazole is recommended for the treatment of children with an initial episode or first recurrence of nonsevere CDI (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). For initial episode, non-severe, options are Metronidazole for 10 days (PO) or Vancomycin for 10 days (PO), with pediatric dosing metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg/dose tid or qid (maximum 500 mg tid or qid) and vancomycin 10 mg/kg/dose qid (maximum 125 mg qid). For initial episode, severe/fulminant, Vancomycin for 10 days (PO or PR) with or without metronidazole for 10 days (IV). For second or subsequent recurrence, options include Vancomycin in a tapered and pulsed regimen, Vancomycin for 10 days followed by rifaximin for 20 days, or fecal microbiota transplantation; pediatric dosing shown includes vancomycin 10 mg/kg/dose qid (maximum 500 mg qid), while rifaximin has no pediatric dosing and is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in children < 12 years of age.

### Clostridium difficile infection: a review of current and emerging therapies [^111RHSgC]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI) is the most common cause of ­healthcare-associated infections in US hospitals. The epidemic strain NAP1/BI/ribotype 027 accounts for outbreaks worldwide, with increasing mortality and severity. CDI is acquired from an endogenous source or from spores in the environment, most easily acquired during the hospital stay. The use of antimicrobials disrupts the intestinal microflora enabling C. difficile to proliferate in the colon and produce toxins. Clinical diagnosis in symptomatic patients requires toxin detection from stool specimens and rarely in combination with stool culture to increase sensitivity. However, stool culture is essential for epidemiological studies. Oral metronidazole is the recommended therapy for milder cases of CDI and oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin for more severe cases. Treatment of first recurrence involves the use of the same therapy used in the initial CDI. In the event of a second recurrence oral vancomycin often given in a tapered dose or intermittently, or fidaxomicin may be used. Fecal transplantation is playing an immense role in therapy of recurrent CDI with remarkable results. Fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon warrant surgical intervention. Novel approaches including new antibiotics and immunotherapy against CDI or its toxins appear to be of potential value.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for severe and fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is indicated and operationalized as follows: We suggest FMT be considered for patients with severe and fulminant CDI refractory to antibiotic therapy; in particular, when patients are deemed poor surgical candidates (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Reported single-FMT cure in case reports ranges from 66%–91%. A pseudomembrane-driven protocol treats patients who fail to respond to 5 days of vancomycin ± intravenous metronidazole with colonoscopic FMT, restarts oral vancomycin within 24–48 hours, and repeats FMT at 3- to 5-day intervals until resolution. Using this protocol, 100% of severe CDI and 87% of fulminant CDI patients were cured during the same admission. In an open-label randomized trial, overall success was 75% with a single FMT–vancomycin and 100% with multiple FMT–vancomycin (P = 0.01), with 57% fulminant cases in the multiple-FMT group. Mortality improvements accompanying FMT include reductions from 43.2% to 12.1% and, with early FMT within 2–4 days of diagnosis, from 42.2% to 12.1% (P < 0.001). During sequential therapy, administration of oral vancomycin 125 mg every 6 hours or fidaxomicin 200 mg every 12 hours should be continued as long as pseudomembrane is present, and if discharged before resolution, therapy should be continued for a minimum of 5 days followed by a final outpatient FMT.

### Clostridioides difficile colitis [^111EH3L6]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile colitis is an important source of hospital-acquired diarrhea associated with antibiotic use. Symptoms are profuse watery diarrhea, typically following a course of antibiotics; however, some cases of fulminant disease may manifest with shock, ileus, or megacolon. Nonfulminant colitis is treated with oral fidaxomicin. C difficile colitis has a high potential for recurrence, and recurrent episodes are also treated with fidaxomicin. Bezlotoxumab is another medication that may be used in populations at high risk for further recurrence. Fulminant disease is treated with maximal medical therapy and early surgical consultation. Antibiotic stewardship is critical to preventing C difficile colitis.

### Treatment of an initial infection with Clostridium difficile in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117X7WGq]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Although the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in the general population has increased dramatically over the past decade, an even greater rate of infection exists in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Susceptibility in this population is likely inherent to the pathophysiology and treatment of these diseases. C. difficile infection can cause serious complications and death. Consequently, early diagnosis and initiation of effective antibacterial therapy is imperative. This article evaluates treatment recommendations for an initial episode of C. difficile infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease based on the current guidelines and a Cochrane systematic review.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^111hwoKq]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

CURRENT AND NEWLY APPROVED Clostridioides difficile INFECTION TREATMENTS

The vegetative bacteria can be successfully eliminated with antimicrobial therapy; however, the spores are highly resilient and can persist in the gut. The treatment of initial CDI with antimicrobial therapy can cause further disruptions to the microbiota, exacerbating the intestinal dysbiosis and potentially leading to the relapse of symptoms, known as CDI recurrence. CDI recurrence is defined as the onset of symptoms within 8 weeks of clinical cure from a previous episode and can occur in up to 20% of patients, with increasing frequency with each subsequent episode. This highlights the need to combine current antimicrobial regimes with microbiota-restorative therapies to re-establish colonization resistance of the commensal microbiota and reduce the likelihood of recurrent disease.

In line with current guidelines, CDI treatment options include fidaxomicin, vancomycin and metronidazole. Fidaxomicin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic that demonstrates superior preservation of the intestinal microbiota when compared to vancomycin and is associated with similar clinical cure rates and a lower risk of CDI recurrence. Fidaxomicin standard therapy (200 mg, 12 hourly for 10 days) is recommended as the first choice for treatment of the initial episode of nonsevere CDI, severe CDI and severe-complicated/refractory CDI. If fidaxomicin is not available, standard vancomycin therapy (125 mg, 6 hourly for 10 days) can be used as an alternative. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as a first line agent to treat CDI as the clinical cure rate demonstrated inferiority to vancomycin and was found to be a robust predictor of recurrence; however, despite recommendations, metronidazole remains a first line treatment option in many countries due to the cost and availability of alternatives.

Guideline narrative — study scope and graded considerations for initial therapy are provided. The trials informing fidaxomicin and vancomycin excluded fulminant disease and together randomized more than a thousand patients: "patients with fulminant CDI were not included, both studies included the same treatment protocols and > 1000 patients were randomized in a double-blinded manner". Based on this evidence, "fidaxomicin should be considered along with vancomycin as the drug of choice for an initial episode of CDI". Agents "that are probably effective… and which have not received FDA approval, include nitazoxanide and fusidic acid", whereas "Additional agents with inadequate evidence to recommend treatment of an initial CDI episode include rifaximin, tigecycline, and bacitracin". A resistance caution is noted: "Isolates with high MICs (> 256 μg/mL) and development of high MICs during treatment with rifaximin are well documented".

### Initial therapy affects duration of diarrhoea in critically ill patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) [^115nhemG]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

CDI further harms critically ill patients by increasing 28-day mortality and in case of prolonged diarrhoea the length of their hospital stay. Appropriate therapy should be initiated promptly to shorten duration of diarrhoea. Our data point to the fact that metronidazole IV as a single agent might not represent an efficient initial monotherapy. Future studies should address the evaluation of combination therapy in critically ill patients with CDI. Since immunosuppressive therapy was identified as an independent predictor of increased 28-day mortality, patients should be carefully evaluated whether immunosuppressive therapy is indicated in case of concurrent CDI.

### Challenges in the diagnosis and management of recurrent and severe Clostridioides difficile infection in children [^111pPV6a]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Children with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) can experience recurrent or severe disease. Recurrent CDI occurs in 20%-30% of children with an initial CDI episode. A careful clinical evaluation is important to distinguish recurrent CDI from other disorders that cause recurring gastrointestinal symptoms. Multiple treatment options exist for recurrent CDI, but the optimal therapeutic approach remains undefined. Severe or fulminant CDI can result in poor outcomes and significant morbidity in children. Since there is not a validated definition for severe CDI in children, physicians must use their clinical judgment to identify patients with severe CDI to institute appropriate therapy. In this review, we describe the diagnostic and management challenges in caring for children with recurrent and severe CDI.

Results

Patients' characteristics

The study population was 132 patients treated with CDI-specific antibiotics. Median age of all patients was 70 years (IQR 59–77), and 71.2% were male. 72.7% of the patients needed mechanical ventilation (invasive and non-invasive) during their ICU stay (Table 1); median duration of mechanical ventilation was 11 days (IQR 2–25). 78.8% of the patients received vasopressors for a median of 4 days (IQR 1–12). Renal replacement therapy was necessary in 24.2% of the patients for a median of 9 days (IQR 3–28.5). Main admission diagnoses were sepsis (30.3%) and postoperative admission (29.5%) and cardiac failure (16.7%). In five patients (3.8%), CDI was the leading diagnosis due to severe symptoms; all patients analysed developed CDI during their ICU stay. Detailed patients' characteristics are illustrated in Table 1.

Table 1
Patients' characteristics in our study population with CDI stratified according to 28-day mortality

*In some patients, > 1 diagnosis was encoded as principal diagnosis

Median stay on ICU was 14 days (IQR 6–29); overall median hospital stay was 37.5 days (IQR 18–61).

Most patients received proton pump inhibitors (PPI) during ICU stay (95.5%). Furthermore, 25% of all patients were given immunosuppressive drugs, mostly steroids in a dosage > 10 mg/day (21.2%). Other immunosuppressive medications included calcineurin inhibitors (9.1%), mycophenolic acid (3%) and azathioprine (3%).

The median time between ICU admission and diagnosis of CDI was 13.5 days (IQR 5–28) (Table 2). 18.9% (n = 25) of all patients suffered from recurrent CDI. Severe CDI was present in 60.6% of all patients. Toxic megacolon occurred in one patient. Overall, two patients (1.5%) required colectomy due to fulminant CDI.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^114kKMFz]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been an epidemic for many years. Our biggest challenge in treating CDI is preventing recurrence, which is seen in approximately 25% of patients with initial infection and in 40–60% of those with subsequent episodes. Given the major disease burden of this infection, appropriate data-driven treatment remains essential. Clinical treatment guidelines provide an unbiased critical analysis of the literature, integrating the quality of the available data to make recommendations. As CDI has been evolving and more research has become available, the frequency of guideline issue from various global societies has increased, as has the detail of the recommendations to fit more relevant clinical scenarios. In this review, we will discuss clinical guideline recommendations over three time periods: The Initial Guidelines 1995–1997, The Second Wave 2009–2013, and The Modern Era 2014-present. We see the changing recommendations from metronidazole or vancomycin for initial infection during earlier times to preferential treatment with fidaxomicin within the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) joint guidelines provisional update in late 2020. The recommended treatments for first recurrence were initially with the same antimicrobial as the first episode but have since changed to having multiple options for one or more recurrences. We have also seen the addition of immune boosting treatments, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)/microbiota restoration therapy (MRT) and bezlotoxumab in the more modern recommendations. As the guidelines are evolving with the times, it remains important to understand the differences among them so we can apply this information clinically and optimize patient outcomes.

Our biggest challenge in treating CDI is preventing recurrence, which is seen in approximately 25% of patients with initial infection and in 40–60% of those with subsequent episodes. Given the major disease burden of this infection, appropriate data-driven treatment remains essential. Clinical treatment guidelines provide an unbiased critical analysis of the literature, integrating the quality of the available data to make recommendations. As CDI has been evolving and more research has become available, the frequency of guideline issue from various global societies has increased, as has the detail of the recommendations to fit more relevant clinical scenarios. In this review, we will discuss clinical guideline recommendations over three time periods: The Initial Guidelines 1995–1997, The Second Wave 2009–2013, and The Modern Era 2014–present. We see the changing recommendations from metronidazole or vancomycin for initial infection during earlier times to preferential treatment with fidaxomicin within the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) joint guidelines provisional update in late 2020. The recommended treatments for first recurrence were initially with the same antimicrobial as the first episode but have since changed to having multiple options for one or more recurrences. We have also seen the addition of immune boosting treatments, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)/microbiota restoration therapy (MRT) and bezlotoxumab in the more modern recommendations. As the guidelines are evolving with the times, it remains important to understand the differences among them so we can apply this information clinically and optimize patient outcomes.

Surgical therapy for fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection — evidence for total colectomy and against partial colectomy: Furthermore, attempts at performing partial colectomies were associated with a 16% postoperative recurrence rate due to persistent sepsis requiring the resection of additional colon. Based on a study population of 51,051 patients, an odds ratio (OR) for mortality of 0.71 (0.49–0.99) was associated with patients undergoing a total colectomy when compared with continued medical therapy. These reviews suggest that at least in certain instances, a total colectomy provides a survival benefit compared with ongoing medical therapy that has failed to improve the overall condition of a patient with fulminant CDI and partial colectomies should be avoided.

Nonsevere Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — initial episode management includes the following and supporting evidence: "We recommend that oral vancomycin 125 mg 4 times daily for 10 days be used to treat an initial episode of nonsevere CDI (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence)". "We recommend that oral fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 days be used for an initial episode of nonsevere CDI (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)". "Oral metronidazole 500 mg 3 times daily for 10 days may be considered for treatment of an initial nonsevere CDI in low-risk patients (strong recommendation/moderate quality of evidence)". In comparative trials, fidaxomicin showed similar clinical cure but lower recurrence than vancomycin: "cure rates with fidaxomicin (82.1%) were similar to vancomycin (88.6%). The rate of recurrence within 30 days, however, was significantly lower with fidaxomicin (13.0% vs 26.6%, P = 0.02)", and a second RCT found "no significant difference in clinical cure (76.2% vs 70.5%, P = 0.473), but lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin (8.3% vs 32.6%, P < 0.05)". A Veteran Administration analysis found "no statistically significant difference in the combined outcome of clinical failure or recurrence between 213 fidaxomicin treatment courses (31.9%) and 639 vancomycin treatment courses (25.5%)", with mortality "30-day (10.8% vs 11.7%), 90-day (22.5% vs 21.9%), and 180-day mortality rates (29.1% vs 29.1%)" similar. A Cochrane review concluded that "moderate quality evidence suggests that vancomycin is superior to metronidazole and fidaxomicin is superior to vancomycin", while noting "The differences in effectiveness between these antibiotics were not large and the advantage of metronidazole is its far lower cost". For follow-on therapy, rifaximin trials used "400 mg t.i.d. for 20 days" with recurrence "decreased from 31% to 15%", and another trial used "400 mg t.i.d. for 14 days and then 200 mg t.i.d. for an additional 14 days" with recurrence "from 30% to 16% (P = 0.06)", but concerns include "30%–50% resistance rates", and the authors "do not currently recommend its routine use".

Table 3 — key concept statements for C. difficile management detail that only individuals with symptoms suggestive of active C. difficile infection (CDI) should be tested (3 or more unformed stools in 24 h). We recommend the following criteria, which are predictive of unfavorable outcomes, be used to classify severe CDI at the time of diagnosis: white blood cell ≥ 15,000 cells/mm³ or serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL. We recommend defining fulminant infection as patients meeting criteria for severe CDI plus presence of hypotension or shock or ileus or megacolon. We suggest that for patients who require surgical intervention, either a total colectomy with an end ileostomy and a stapled rectal stump or a diverting loop ileostomy with colonic lavage and intraluminal vancomycin, be used depending on clinical circumstances, the patient's estimated tolerance to surgery, and the surgeon's best judgement. Immunosuppressive inflammatory bowel disease therapy should not be held during anti-CDI therapy in the setting of disease flare and escalation of therapy may be considered if there is no symptomatic improvement with treatment of CDI. We recommend using vancomycin to treat pregnant and peripartum patients with CDI, and we recommend using vancomycin to treat breastfeeding patients with CDI. We suggest vancomycin or fidaxomicin be used first line for treatment of CDI in patients who are immunocompromised.

Fig. 1
Patients admitted to the ICU between January 2010 and September 2015 with CDI. Legend: shown is initial CDI therapy during first 48 h

This retrospective analysis was performed in accordance to the local regulations of the ethics committee (General Medical Council Hamburg, Ärztekammer Hamburg, reference number WF 11/16).

Definition of healthcare-associated CDI

CDI was defined as a positive stool test for C. difficile GDH and toxin A/B (via EIA) or positive PCR for toxigenic C. difficile in combination with a documentation of matching clinical symptoms (diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort). Time point of CDI diagnosis was defined as the date of receiving the positive stool test result.

A severe episode of CDI was defined by fulfilling any one or more of the following criteria at the time point of diagnosis according to literature: serum creatinine concentration > 1.5 mg/dl and > 15,000 white blood cells per μL according to the clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA).

Stool testing

For detection of CDI, the C. diff Quick Check Complete EIA (TechLab; Blacksburg, VA, USA) had been used for C. difficile glutamate dehydrogenase antigen (GDH) and toxin A/B testing of non-formed stool samples as recommend by the manufacturer. GDH-positive, toxin A/B-negative samples had been retested by Xpert C. difficile PCR (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA).

Statistical methods

All continuous variables are reported as median and 25–75% interquartile range (IQR). Categorical variables were compared via chi-square analysis or Fisher's exact, as appropriate. Metric variables were compared via Mann-Whitney U test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess effect of initial medical treatment on duration of diarrhoea > 5 days. Cox regression proportional hazard analysis was performed to assess predictors of mortality. SPSS 24 for Windows (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis. All p values reported are two sided, and p < 0.05 was considered significant.

IDSA/SHEA 2017 Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) — initial episode treatment recommendations state that either vancomycin or fidaxomicin is recommended over metronidazole for an initial episode of CDI, using vancomycin 125 mg orally 4 times per day for 10 days or fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 days (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). In settings where access to vancomycin or fidaxomicin is limited, we suggest using metronidazole for an initial episode of nonsevere CDI only, with metronidazole 500 mg orally 3 times per day for 10 days and avoidance of repeated or prolonged courses due to risk of cumulative and potentially irreversible neurotoxicity (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

Severe CDI — fidaxomicin comparative outcomes: In patients with severe disease, fidaxomicin was noninferior to vancomycin in achieving clinical cure at the end of therapy and associated with decreased risk of recurrence in a phase 3 clinical trial, and trials of fidaxomicin have excluded patients with fulminant CDI and life-threatening illness so evidence to support its use in these populations is limited. In critically ill patients, although only 36 patients in this series had a diagnosis of severe or fulminant CDI, one-third of them experienced treatment failure, and a more recent retrospective chart review that compared 213 fidaxomicin and 639 oral vancomycin courses showed no statistically significant difference for the primary outcome of combined clinical failure or recurrence (68/213 [31.9%] vs 169/639 [25.5%], respectively, P = 0.071).

Scope

In 2009, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This document was updated in 2014. The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.

Methods and Questions

Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, recurrent and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis? Outcome measures for treatment strategy were: clinical cure, recurrence and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations was performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of our recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The guideline committee was invited to comment on the recommendations. The guideline draft was sent to external experts and a patients' representative for review. Full ESCMID endorsement was obtained after a public consultation procedure.

Recommendations

Important changes compared with previous guideline include but are not limited to: metronidazole is no longer recommended for treatment of CDI when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are available, fidaxomicin is the preferred agent for treatment of initial CDI and the first recurrence of CDI when available and feasible, FMT or bezlotoxumab in addition to standard of care antibiotics (SoC) are preferred for treatment of a second or further recurrence of CDI, bezlotoxumab in addition to SoC is recommended for the first recurrence of CDI when fidaxomicin was used to manage the initial CDI episode, and bezlotoxumab is considered as an ancillary treatment to vancomycin for a CDI episode with high risk of recurrence when fidaxomicin is not available. Contrary to the previous guideline, in the current guideline emphasis is placed on risk for recurrence as a factor that determines treatment strategy for the individual patient, rather than the disease severity.

Fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection — intravenous metronidazole added to oral vancomycin: Guidelines recommend addition of intravenous metronidazole to oral vancomycin in fulminant disease; a single-center ICU study reported lower mortality with vancomycin plus metronidazole than vancomycin alone (15.9% vs 36.4%, P = 0.03), whereas a more recent multicenter retrospective study of 526 patients found no benefit for colectomy, death, or recurrence; addition of intravenous metronidazole might be helpful in paralytic ileus because oral vancomycin transit may be impaired and intravenously administered metronidazole can achieve therapeutic colonic concentrations.

Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) infection (CDI) is caused by an anaerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive bacterium, and is the leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea in developed countries. Although CDI is classically considered a hospital-acquired, antibiotic-associated infection, the incidence of community-acquired CDI is also on the rise. Furthermore, the incidence of pediatric CDI seems to be increasing, most notably among patients with comorbid conditions, such as cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. The severity of CDI is variable, ranging from asymptomatic colonization or self-limiting diarrhea to fulminant colitis. In hospitalized children, CDI has been associated with increased length of stay and increased risk of mortality. However, because asymptomatic colonization with toxigenic C. difficile is common in children aged < 2 years, the clinical significance of this organism as a cause of diarrhea in young infants is uncertain.

The Infectious Disease Society of America and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America guidelines for the treatment of CDI in children recommend vancomycin or metronidazole for an initial nonsevere episode or first recurrence, and vancomycin (with or without metronidazole) for an initial severe episode. However, although these antibiotics are successful in approximately 80%–90% of initial episodes, up to 40% of children with CDI experience a recurrence of infection within 60 days. Risk factors for recurrence in children include cancer and chronic comorbid conditions; in adults, recurrence is associated with advanced age and the use of non-CDI antibiotics during or after CDI treatment, among other factors. Consequently, efforts have been directed toward the development of new antibiotics that reduce the risk of CDI recurrence.

The macrocyclic antibiotic fidaxomicin was approved in the United States and in the European Union in 2011 for the treatment of CDI in patients aged ≥ 18 years. Two phase 3 registration trials in adults have shown that fidaxomicin is noninferior to vancomycin for initial clinical cure of CDI and is associated with a significant 10%–15% reduction in the risk of recurrence at 28 days after the end of treatment (EOT). However, patients aged < 16 years were excluded from both studies, and the safety and efficacy of fidaxomicin in children aged < 18 years has not been established. This is reflected in the Infectious Disease Society of America/Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America guidelines, which note that insufficient safety and efficacy data are available to recommend the use of fidaxomicin in children with CDI, although occasional off-label use has been reported.

### Diagnosis and management of Clostridium difficile infection [^111GaL7P]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is increasing in frequency and severity in and out of the hospital, with a high probability of recurrence after treatment. The recent literature on CDI was reviewed using PubMed to include recent publications dealing with diagnosis and therapy. Real-time polymerase chain reaction is a sensitive and useful diagnostic test for CDI but there are growing concerns of false-positive test results if the rate of CDI is low in the patient population providing samples and/or if the population being studied commonly includes people with C difficile colonization. Recommended therapy of CDI includes oral metronidazole for milder cases of CDI and oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin for more severe cases, each given for 10 days. Colectomy is being performed more frequently in patients with fulminant CDI. For treatment of first recurrences the drug used in the first bout can be used again and for second recurrences longer courses of vancomycin often are given in a tapered dose or intermittently to allow gut flora reconstitution, or other treatments including fidaxomicin may be used. Bacteriotherapy with fecal transplantation is playing an increasing role in therapy of recurrent cases. Metagenomic studies of patients with CDI during successful therapy are needed to determine how best to protect the flora from assaults from antibacterial drugs and to develop optimal therapeutic approaches. Immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis offer opportunities to prevent CDI, to speed up recovery from CDI, and to eliminate recurrent infection. Humanized monoclonal antitoxin antibodies and active immunization with vaccines against C difficile or its toxins are both in development and appear to be of potential value.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with CDI — antibiotic selection and duration: We suggest vancomycin 125 mg p.o. 4 times a day for a minimum of 14 days in patients with IBD and CDI (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). There are no published RCTs comparing treatments for CDI in adults with IBD. In a retrospective, single-center study, a vancomycin-containing regimen vs metronidazole reduced 30-day readmissions (9% vs 31.0%, P = 0.04) and length of stay (6.38 days vs 13.62 days, P = 0.022). Longer vancomycin duration 21–42 days vs < 21 days reduced CDI recurrence from 11.7% to 1.8% (OR 0.13, P = 0.043).

### Clinical review of the management of fulminant Clostridium difficile infection [^115heXvy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality among elderly hospitalized patients. A small but increasing number of patients have developed fulminant CDI, and a significant number of these patients require emergency colectomy. In this review, we discuss the risk factors, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of fulminant CDI.

Data Sources

A literature search (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Biosis, Science Citation Index, Ovid Journals) was performed from the period between January 1980 and June 2008 using the key words "Clostridium difficile", pseudomembranous enterocolitis", colectomy", acute abdomen", antibiotic-associated diarrhea", or "fulminant Clostridium difficile colitis". Articles not in English or not related to human subjects were excluded. For this review, we analyzed the articles identified in our original search and those articles cited in the original review articles. No randomized trials were found on the surgical management of fulminant CDI and only retrospective studies with a minimum of five patients were used in the review. With respect to medical treatment, we based our review on guideline articles, systematic reviews, and available randomized trials.

Conclusion

Both the incidence and severity of CDI are increasing. Fulminant CDI is underappreciated as a life-threatening disease because of a lack of awareness of its severity and its nonspecific clinical syndrome. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for a good outcome, and early surgical intervention should be used in patients who are unresponsive to medical therapy. The surgical procedure of choice is a total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy, although the mortality rate remains high.

Clostridioides difficile infection occurs when the bacterium produces toxin that causes diarrhea and inflammation of the colon. These guidelines indicate the preferred approach to the management of adults with C. difficile infection and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. In instances where the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, key concept statements were developed using expert consensus. These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable and should be viewed as the preferred, but not the only, approach to clinical scenarios.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^1154GUAZ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

In cases of suspected severe CDI, antibiotic agents should be discontinued, if possible. A meta-analysis addressing factors associated with prolonged symptoms and severe disease due to C. difficile showed that continued use of antibiotics for infections other than CDI is significantly associated with an increased risk of CDI recurrence. If continued antibiotic therapy is required for the treatment of the primary infection, antimicrobial therapy with agents that are less frequently implicated with antibiotic-associated CDI should be used; these include parenteral aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, macrolides, vancomycin, or tetracycline/tigecycline.

Although there is a clinical association between proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use and CDI, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies have studied the relationship between discontinuing or avoiding PPI use and the risk of CDI. Thus, a strong recommendation to discontinue PPIs in patients at high risk for CDI regardless of the need for PPIs will require further evidence. However, stewardship activities to discontinue unneeded PPIs are strongly warranted.

Regarding treatment, antibiotic therapy is the first choice for CDI treatment and molecule choice should be based according to the severity of the disease. When antibiotic therapy is indicated for symptomatic cases with a positive stool C. difficile test, options include metronidazole, oral or intraluminal vancomycin, and oral fidaxomicin. Metronidazole should be limited to the treatment of an initial episode of mild-moderate CDI. Vancomycin orally 125 mg four times daily for 10 days is considered superior to metronidazole in severe CDI. Doses of up to 500 mg have been used in patients with severe or fulminant, as defined as hypotension or shock, ileus, or megacolon, CDI, although there is little evidence for this in the literature. Fidaxomicin orally 200 mg twice daily for 10 days may be a valid alternative to vancomycin in patients with CDI. Fidaxomicin may be useful for treating patients who are considered at high risk for recurrence (elderly patients with multiple comorbidities who are receiving concomitant antibiotics).

Regarding medical management for Clostridioides difficile infection, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, non-severe disease, ASCRS 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin as first-line therapy in patients with an initial CDI. Avoid using metronidazole alone as first-line therapy.

### Fulminant Clostridium difficile colitis: a complication of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis [^1136MqWL]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis for maxillofacial surgical wounds remains common practice. Surgeons must weigh the risks (e.g. Clostridium difficile colitis) against the benefits before administering antibiotics for any reason and the relative risk and morbidity of C difficile colitis against those of a potential postoperative wound infection. In addition, the possibility of C difficile infection as a complication of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis should be discussed with patients before surgery, especially those with concomitant baseline risk factors. This report describes the case of a young healthy patient with few risk factors for C difficile infection who received a standard perioperative course of antibiotic therapy. Subsequently, the patient developed severe fulminant C difficile infection that required a protracted hospital admission, subtotal colectomy, and ileostomy. This case underscores that antibiotic prophylaxis continues in widespread use and is not benign therapy.

Management of CDI

Due to these considerations, an aging population with greater comorbidities and CDI affecting younger community dwellers, the treatment of CDI remains a clinical challenge. For a nonsevere first episode, either vancomycin or fidaxomicin are preferred (metronidazole may be used if these are not available). For a first severe episode either vancomycin or fidaxomicin are recommended. For a fulminant infection, a combination of high-dose vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole are used. For a first recurrence, either fidaxomicin (if vancomycin was used for the initial infection) or vancomycin (if metronidazole was used for the initial infection) should be prescribed. Another option is a pulsed and tapered vancomycin regimen(Figure 1).

Standard pharmacologic management of Clostridioides difficile infection. A suggested regimen for vancomycin taper is as follows: 125 mg orally four times daily for 10–14 days, 125 mg orally two times daily for 7 days, 125 mg orally once daily for 7 days, and 125 mg orally every 2 or 3 days for 2–8 weeks. A rifaximin chaser regimen involves vancomycin 125 mg orally four times daily for 10 days followed by rifaximin 400 mg three times daily for 10 days.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) — fulminant disease treatment prioritizes high-dose oral vancomycin, rectal vancomycin if ileus, and adjunct intravenous metronidazole with exact dosing. For fulminant CDI, vancomycin administered orally is the regimen of choice; if ileus is present, vancomycin can also be administered per rectum, with vancomycin dosed at 500 mg orally 4 times per day and 500 mg in approximately 100 mL normal saline per rectum every 6 hours as a retention enema, and intravenously administered metronidazole (500 mg every 8 hours) should be administered together with oral or rectal vancomycin, particularly if ileus is present.

Clinical variables

We reviewed demographics, disease duration, and certain comorbidities from the electronic clinical charts. The disease's localization and behavior were divided according to the Montreal's classification for IBD subjects. In addition, we collected the total number of prior biologics given. The Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Department of our institution provided a registry of CDI cases that occurred during the study period. A CDI case was considered when a toxigenic C. difficile was detected with the rapid algorithm (consisting in direct EIA toxin and toxin B PCR) or toxigenic culture in colon biopsy, and rectal or fecal specimens. We excluded asymptomatic carriers that could represent a CDI colonization. The CDI episode was then classified into four categories based on symptom onset regarding time to hospitalization, as well as its relationship with healthcare facilities: (1) HO-HCFA (Healthcare facility-onset, healthcare facility-associated) CDI: the onset of symptoms occurring more than 48 h after admission to a healthcare facility. (2) CO-HCFA (Community-onset, healthcare facility-associated) CDI: symptom onset occurring in the community or 48 h or less after admission to a healthcare facility, provided that symptom onset was less than 4 weeks after the last discharge from a healthcare facility. (3) CA (Community-associated) CDI: symptom onset in the community or 48 h or less after admission to a healthcare facility, provided that symptom onset was more than 12 weeks after the last discharge from a healthcare facility. (4) Indeterminate: symptom onset occurring in the community, but the patient having been discharged from the healthcare facility 4–12 weeks before symptom onset. Clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, and therapy used for the CDI episodes were also reviewed. The severity of CDI episodes was divided into mild to moderate, severe, and severe-complicated according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. Mild and moderate were defined if the patient had ≤ 15,000 leukocytes/µl and/or an increased creatinine < 50% from baseline. For the severe episodes, the patient had > 15,000 leukocytes/µl and/or an increase of creatinine > 50% from baseline. Severe complicated or fulminant colitis was considered in those patients having associated hypotension, shock, paralytic ileum, toxic megacolon, intestinal perforation, admission to the Intensive Care Unit, or colectomy due to CDI. We then divided the severity into two categories: mild-moderate and severe-complicated. We used the CDI severity criteria outlined in the international IDSA/SHEA guidelines, as there is currently no validated CDI severity score for the IBD population. In addition, clinical outcomes after CDI were analyzed in terms of IBD treatment intensification, recurrence or reinfection of CDI, and severe outcomes such as colectomy. A recurrence was defined as an episode of CDI diagnosed within 8 weeks of a successfully treated initial episode and a reinfection was considered if the CDI was diagnosed after 8 weeks from the previous episode.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^112UWMQ1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) first recurrence — treatment recommendations and comparative efficacy are as follows: We suggest tapering/pulsed-dose vancomycin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of fidaxomicin, vancomycin, or metronidazole (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). We recommend fidaxomicin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of vancomycin or metronidazole (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). rCDI is generally defined as the recurrence of diarrhea and a confirmatory positive test (NAAT or EIA) within 8 weeks after treatment of an initial episode of CDI. In subgroup analyses of two phase 3 trials, fidaxomicin was superior in preventing a second recurrence within 28 days (35.5% of patients treated with vancomycin and 19.7% of patients treated with fidaxomicin, P = 0.045). In older adults, extended‑pulsed fidaxomicin achieved sustained clinical cure 30 days post‑treatment in 124 (70%) of 177 vs 106 (59%) of 179 with vancomycin (P = 0.030). Vancomycin cleared C. difficile by end of therapy more often than metronidazole (89% vs 59%, respectively; P = 0.001). Based on efficacy and safety concerns, metronidazole should not be used to treat rCDI and metronidazole treatment should be limited to 1 course because of risk of neurotoxicity with prolonged or repeated use.
