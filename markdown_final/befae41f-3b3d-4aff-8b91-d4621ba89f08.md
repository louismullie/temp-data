## Question

Intervention if all laxatives fail

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a stepwise plan for what to do when "all laxatives have failed". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the diagnosis is correct and whether secondary or structural causes or alarm features were overlooked. Then, I should verify that nonpharmacologic measures and each laxative class were actually optimized with adequate dose and duration. Next, I need to consider phenotype-directed testing to distinguish a defecatory disorder from slow- or normal-transit constipation. After that, I should review targeted therapies such as biofeedback, prescription secretagogues or prokinetics, and PAMORAs for opioid-induced constipation. Finally, I need to weigh procedural or surgical options for select patients after physiologic confirmation and failed conservative care, with a plan for follow-up and re-evaluation of physiology if symptoms persist [^116Kuqo7] [^112RBpmg].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude masqueraders before assuming "laxative-refractory". I need to check that the patient meets Rome-based functional constipation criteria and that we have screened for alarm features like hematochezia, anemia, unintentional weight loss, or a strong family history of colorectal cancer, because these mandate prompt investigation rather than escalation of constipation therapy [^116Kuqo7]. Hold on, I should verify common secondary contributors: constipating medications such as opioids, anticholinergics, calcium channel blockers and antipsychotics; metabolic or endocrine disorders like hypothyroidism and hypercalcemia; neurologic disease such as Parkinson's or spinal cord injury; and structural problems such as strictures, malignancy, or fissure, because addressing these can obviate "refractory" labeling [^1139rLft]. I also need to remember in cancer and palliative contexts to obtain focused labs like corrected calcium and TSH when clinically suspected and to tailor evaluation to severity and change in pattern, not reflexively ordering broad panels [^11592NPJ].

> Next, I should review the nonpharmacologic foundation to make sure it has truly been maximized for at least several weeks, because many "failures" reflect underdosing of basics. I need to ensure gradual fiber titration toward roughly 25–30 g/day alongside adequate hydration, recognizing that in slow transit or significant outlet dysfunction fiber may not help and can worsen bloating, so I should individualize this step and not overassume benefit [^111ahNtv] [^115gRGad]. Let me confirm a regular toileting regimen with unhurried, postprandial attempts and hip flexion support, as well as physical activity, because these behavioral measures support colonic motility and defecatory dynamics even when medications are used in parallel [^111g6QJo] [^111ahNtv]. But wait, in non-ambulatory or low-fluid intake cancer patients, I should avoid bulk agents due to obstruction risk, so I need to tailor fiber recommendations to context [^116NsELu].

> Now I will examine whether each laxative class was actually optimized with adequate dose and duration before declaring failure. Osmotic laxatives are first-line; polyethylene glycol (PEG 3350) at 17 g daily is supported by randomized data and is often trialed for at least 2 weeks, with some labels suggesting use for up to two weeks unless directed by a clinician, and lactulose is an alternative if PEG is unavailable or not tolerated, so I should confirm both dose and adherence over time [^113iaxH4] [^116wWSKT] [^1141P9Y4] [^111Ld4H5]. I should double-check that stimulant agents were used appropriately as scheduled second-line or as rescue; bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate have evidence for short-term use, and ASCRS supports stimulant use as needed when osmotics are insufficient [^114wqysS] [^1118Zugc]. Hmm, wait a minute, I started to document senna dosing as "8.6–17.2 mg at… " and left it hanging; let me correct that by noting that senna is commonly used in the 8.6–17.2 mg range once or twice daily with titration for effect, although guideline texts emphasize class recommendations over precise doses, so I should frame senna within the stimulant class rather than assert a single fixed regimen [^114wqysS] [^1118Zugc]. I should also ensure that magnesium-based osmotics, if used, were avoided in advanced CKD and that any adverse-effect driven discontinuations were addressed with dose adjustments rather than premature abandonment where possible [^113iaxH4].

> But wait, what if the patient is on opioids or the story suggests opioid-induced constipation rather than chronic idiopathic constipation? I need to check this specifically, because for laxative-refractory opioid-induced constipation, the next step is a peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist such as naldemedine or naloxegol, with methylnaltrexone as another option, while avoiding bulk-forming fiber in OIC and starting with osmotic or stimulant laxatives as first-line when not yet optimized [^111ifmEZ] [^115ymmh2] [^113DPM6k] [^1111jDf4]. Hold on, I should verify that opioid dose and other constipating co-medications have been minimized when feasible, because de-prescribing can improve bowel function without escalating bowel regimens [^111ifmEZ].

> I also need to ensure we are not missing fecal impaction, because escalation with oral agents alone may fail if rectal stool burden is the driver. Let me first confirm with a careful digital rectal examination and, if there is a full rectum or impaction, proceed with suppositories or enemas and consider digital fragmentation or extraction in the absence of bleeding or perforation concern, followed by a maintenance regimen to prevent recurrence [^112kUz6M] [^113X7Us2]. I should double-check the response and reassess rectal tone and sensation afterward to avoid premature assumptions of "pharmacologic failure" when the issue was outlet obstruction by impacted stool [^112kUz6M].

> If symptoms persist despite optimized basics and adequate laxative trials, I should not jump to conclusions; instead, I will now examine anorectal physiology to phenotype the constipation, because this is the pivot point for targeted therapy. The AGA recommends anorectal manometry with balloon expulsion testing in patients who do not respond to laxatives, and cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that upfront anorectal function testing can triage care efficiently compared with empiric escalation, particularly when the therapeutic goal extends beyond just increasing stool frequency [^116Kuqo7] [^115QJQjp]. I should confirm colonic transit if anorectal tests are normal or once a defecatory disorder is treated, to distinguish normal- from slow-transit constipation and guide next steps, recognizing that further motility testing may be warranted for suspected colonic motor dysfunction [^112RBpmg].

> When a defecatory disorder is identified, I need to reconsider the plan and pivot to pelvic floor biofeedback as first-line rather than more laxatives. The AGA recommends pelvic floor retraining by biofeedback therapy over laxatives for defecatory disorders, and the ASCRS 2024 guideline also supports biofeedback as a first-line therapy for pelvic floor dyssynergia, so I should arrange instrumented training with a qualified therapist and set expectations for multiple sessions with practice between visits [^116RycpH] [^112JeRiB]. I should also confirm whether adjuncts like suppositories or enemas are needed in refractory pelvic floor dysfunction cases, and in selected nonrelaxing puborectalis, botulinum toxin injections may be considered after addressing functional contributors, though patient selection and expertise are critical [^114hDYHD] [^111vEJeH]. If biofeedback fails despite adequate dosing, I need to ensure we re-evaluate anorectal physiology and transit again before changing course, to avoid missing persistent dyssynergia or evolution of transit delay [^115AvugW].

> If anorectal testing is normal and transit is normal but symptoms persist, I should verify whether the patient has already tried prescription agents beyond OTC laxatives. Let me think about intestinal secretagogues such as lubiprostone or linaclotide, which ASCRS recommends considering when dietary measures and OTC laxatives fail, and recognize their mechanisms may also reduce abdominal symptoms via improved secretion and potential sensory effects, which can matter to patients who are bothered by bloating or straining more than frequency alone [^114dUzmH] [^117SsVfA]. Hold on, I should also consider a prokinetic like prucalopride in laxative-refractory chronic idiopathic constipation after excluding secondary causes, as suggested in European algorithms, while acknowledging that practice patterns vary and shared decision-making about benefits and adverse effects is essential [^114xeRU3]. I should confirm that expectations are aligned, as no studies have definitively shown superiority of newer drugs over inexpensive laxatives across all outcomes, and mechanism-based selection can help optimize the match to symptoms and physiology [^112RBpmg] [^117SsVfA].

> If colonic transit is delayed and symptoms are severe despite optimized medical therapy, I need to be methodical about surgical considerations. I should first confirm isolated slow-transit constipation without an untreated defecatory disorder, and only then discuss total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis for highly selected, refractory cases, consistent with ASCRS and AGA guidance, while counseling carefully about risks, benefits, and realistic outcomes [^114S9LRK] [^112SVFdH]. Let me also remember that fecal diversion may be considered in intractable situations when other options are exhausted or contraindicated, but stapled transanal rectal resection should not be performed for rectocele or internal intussusception in this context [^112ZkE6W] [^111hiFqP]. I should double-check that a structured preoperative evaluation including psychological assessment and nutritional optimization has been completed, because these predict postoperative outcomes and satisfaction [^114S9LRK].

> For patients with structural outlet problems contributing to obstructed defecation, I should confirm the lesion and stage treatment appropriately. Significant symptomatic rectocele may warrant surgical repair after treating concomitant functional causes like nonrelaxing puborectalis, and in cases of severe obstructed defecation from rectal intussusception after failed nonoperative care, repair can be considered, always within a multidisciplinary framework to optimize selection and timing [^1165jeAQ] [^111q7n28]. Hold on, I should verify with defecography or MRI defecography when the clinical and physiologic tests are discordant before committing to operative repair, to avoid operating on the wrong target pathology [^112mwEMZ].

> Throughout this process, I need to ensure longitudinal follow-up with objective and patient-reported outcomes and to re-check physiology at key junctures. The AGA advises re-evaluating anorectal physiology and colonic transit in patients whose symptoms persist despite an adequate trial of biofeedback, and in patients with normal- or slow-transit constipation, long-term laxative therapy remains appropriate, with periodic reassessment for efficacy and adverse effects rather than defaulting prematurely to invasive options [^115AvugW] [^113FEDEE]. Finally, I should keep in mind that goals of care differ by patient; some prioritize reducing straining or bloating over stool frequency, so I need to confirm the primary symptom targets before deciding whether to escalate to secretagogues, prokinetics, neuromodulatory pelvic floor therapies, or surgery, thereby aligning treatment with what matters most to the patient while adhering to evidence-based pathways [^112RBpmg] [^115QJQjp].

When all laxatives fail, the next step is to **identify the underlying cause** using anorectal manometry, balloon expulsion testing, and colonic transit studies [^116Kuqo7] [^114xeRU3]. If a defecatory disorder is found, **biofeedback therapy is first-line** and effective in 70–80% of cases [^112JeRiB] [^114iT3zK]. For slow-transit constipation, **consider secretagogues** (linaclotide, plecanatide, lubiprostone) or **prucalopride**; for opioid-induced constipation, use PAMORAs (naldemedine, naloxegol, methylnaltrexone) [^114wqysS] [^111ifmEZ]. If medical therapy fails, options include **rectal irrigation, sacral neuromodulation, or surgery** (subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis for isolated slow transit and targeted repair for outlet obstruction) [^114S9LRK] [^112mwEMZ]. Management should be individualized based on physiology and patient preferences.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation after laxative failure

A **structured diagnostic approach is essential** to identify the underlying pathophysiology:

- **Anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion test**: Identify defecatory disorders (e.g. dyssynergic defecation) [^116Kuqo7] [^114xeRU3].

- **Colonic transit studies**: Differentiate slow-transit constipation from normal-transit constipation [^114xeRU3].

- **Defecography**: Evaluate structural abnormalities (e.g. rectocele, intussusception) [^114xeRU3].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

### Biofeedback therapy

Biofeedback therapy is the **first-line treatment** for defecatory disorders, with success rates of 70–80% [^112JeRiB] [^114iT3zK]. It retrains pelvic floor muscles, improving coordination and rectal sensation.

---

### Pelvic floor physical therapy

Pelvic floor physical therapy, including biofeedback, **is effective** for pelvic floor dysfunction–related constipation [^112JeRiB].

---

## Pharmacological interventions beyond traditional laxatives

### Secretagogues and prokinetic agents

- **Linaclotide and plecanatide**: Guanylate cyclase-C agonists increasing intestinal secretion and motility [^114wqysS].

- **Lubiprostone**: Chloride channel activator increasing intestinal fluid secretion [^114wqysS].

- **Prucalopride**: Selective serotonin 5-HT4 receptor agonist enhancing colonic motility [^114wqysS].

---

### Peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs)

For opioid-induced constipation refractory to laxatives, the AGA **recommends naldemedine or naloxegol** [^111ifmEZ], and methylnaltrexone is considered in refractory cases [^111ifmEZ].

---

## Minimally invasive procedures

### Rectal irrigation

Rectal irrigation **is effective** for refractory constipation, particularly in patients with neurological disorders or severe pelvic floor dysfunction.

---

### Sacral neuromodulation

Sacral neuromodulation **is effective** for chronic constipation refractory to conservative measures, with success rates of 40–60% [^1165jeAQ].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is considered **when all conservative and minimally invasive treatments fail**:

- **Subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis**: Recommended for isolated slow-transit constipation [^114S9LRK].

- **Targeted surgical repair**: For outlet obstruction (e.g. rectocele repair, rectal intussusception repair) [^112mwEMZ] [^111q7n28].

- **Fecal diversion**: Considered in intractable cases refractory to all other treatments [^112ZkE6W].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies include novel pharmacological agents, neuromodulation techniques, and personalized medicine approaches, but **further research is needed** to establish their efficacy and safety.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing intervention choice

Age and comorbidities influence the risk–benefit profile of invasive procedures. The underlying pathophysiology determines the suitability of biofeedback, pharmacological agents, or surgery, and **patient preferences are essential** to shared decision-making.

---

## Risks and benefits of advanced interventions

| **Intervention** | **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|-|
| Biofeedback therapy | - High success rate <br/> - Non-invasive | - Limited availability <br/> - Patient adherence required |
| Secretagogues | Effective in chronic idiopathic constipation | - Diarrhea <br/> - Abdominal pain |
| PAMORAs | Effective in opioid-induced constipation | Gastrointestinal side effects |
| Sacral neuromodulation | Effective in refractory cases | - Surgical risks <br/> - Device complications |
| Subtotal colectomy | Effective in isolated slow-transit constipation | - Surgical risks <br/> - Potential for chronic diarrhea |

---

## Long-term outcomes and quality of life

Advanced interventions significantly **improve long-term outcomes and quality of life**, with sustained symptom relief and improved bowel function reported in multiple studies.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Clinical guidelines emphasize a **stepwise approach**, starting with diagnostic evaluation, followed by non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions, and reserving surgery for refractory cases [^114wqysS] [^114S9LRK].

---

When all laxatives fail, a **structured diagnostic approach is essential** to define the underlying pathophysiology. Biofeedback therapy is **first-line** for defecatory disorders, while secretagogues, prokinetic agents, and **PAMORAs** are effective pharmacologic options. Minimally invasive procedures and surgery are reserved for refractory cases, with patient-specific factors guiding the choice of intervention.

Guidelines and algorithms for the management and treatment of chronic constipation have not incorporated more recent therapeutic developments. Although a new set of Rome Foundation diagnostic algorithms covering the diagnosis and management of FGIDs, including chronic constipation and refractory constipation, have been published recently, newer agents were not included. According to these guidelines, patients with constipation that is refractory to a high-fiber diet and traditional laxatives should be referred for physiological testing, such as anorectal manometry, rectal balloon expulsion, and colon transit.

With the recent availability of prokinetic agents such as prucalopride, an additional therapeutic step can be integrated into the existing guidelines. Once idiopathic chronic constipation has been identified and IBS and secondary constipation have been excluded, empirical treatment with osmotic and/or stimulant laxatives should be employed. If patients continue to experience symptoms such as bloating, abdominal discomfort, and incomplete bowel movements, a prokinetic agent like prucalopride could be considered.

If constipation symptoms remain refractory to pharmacological treatment, patients should be referred for physiological testing as outlined in the published Rome algorithm for refractory constipation and difficult defecation. Patients should only be referred for surgery following colon transit testing both without and with laxatives.

### Anorectal biofeedback: An effective therapy, but can we shorten the course to improve access to treatment [^114iT3zK]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Constipation and fecal incontinence (FI) are disorders with a high prevalence in the general community and are associated with a significantly impaired quality of life. These conditions contribute significantly to healthcare utilization, direct and indirect economic costs to society, and time off work. Conservative management options for these patients are sometimes suboptimal, resulting in many patients continuing to experience symptoms. Instrumented anorectal biofeedback (BF) is an important component of the management algorithm and improves symptoms and quality of life in patients with fecal incontinence and those with defecation disorder-associated constipation. Other management options, such as surgery or sacral nerve stimulation for FI, are much more expensive, invasive, and have significantly higher complication rates.

Anorectal BF has been recommended by several consensus groups as the first-line therapy for patients with defecation disorder-associated constipation or FI who have failed conservative measures. Response rates are approximately 80% for constipation and 70% for FI. Importantly, it is the instrumentation and the concomitant process of educating patients about their anorectal physiology, in relation to normal anorectal physiology, that has been shown to contribute to the efficacy of BF protocols. This is in contrast to protocols utilizing Kegel exercises and education alone. The comprehensive protocol proposed by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and European Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility (ANMS-E) highlights this approach's significance.

Chronic constipation is a considerable problem because it significantly affects the quality of a patient's life. It can be diagnosed at every age and is more frequent in women and among the elderly. In epidemiological studies, its incidence is estimated at 2–27% in the general population.

Chronic constipation may be primary or secondary. However, primary constipation (functional or idiopathic) can be classified into normal transit constipation, slow transit constipation, and pelvic outlet obstruction. In this review, we attempt to present the pathophysiological aspects and new therapeutic options for chronic idiopathic constipation, particularly highlighting the value of patient assessment for accurate diagnosis of the cause of the problem, thus helping in the choice of appropriate treatment.

In circumstances involving constipation, particularly concerning patients with cancer, the ESMO 2018 guidelines suggest specific interventions for managing fecal impaction. Disimpaction, typically through digital fragmentation and extraction of stool, is recommended for the management of fecal impaction in the absence of suspected perforation or bleeding. This procedure should be followed by a maintenance bowel regimen to prevent recurrence.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation — a European perspective [^115UQ5Zb]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

Although constipation can be a chronic and severe problem, it is largely treated empirically. The evidence for the efficacy of some of the older laxatives from well-designed trials is limited. Patients often report high levels of dissatisfaction with their treatment, which is attributed to a lack of efficacy or unpleasant side effects. Management guidelines and recommendations are limited and do not sufficiently include treatments that became available more recently, such as prokinetic agents in Europe.

- **Purpose**: We present an overview of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and available guidelines for the treatment of chronic constipation, and include recent data on the efficacy and potential clinical use of the more newly available therapeutic agents. Based on published algorithms and guidelines on the management of chronic constipation, secondary pathologies and causes are first excluded, and then diet, lifestyle, and, if available, behavioral measures are adopted. If these fail, bulk-forming, osmotic, and stimulant laxatives can be used. If symptoms are not satisfactorily resolved, a prokinetic agent such as prucalopride can be prescribed. Biofeedback is recommended as a treatment for chronic constipation in patients with disordered defecation. Surgery should only be considered once all other treatment options have been exhausted.

### Refractory constipation: What is the clinician to do [^111g6QJo]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Most clinicians will agree that chronic constipation is characterized by abnormal bowel movement consistency and/or frequency, along with evacuation symptoms. However, patient perception of constipation varies widely and includes symptoms that may or may not meet official defining criteria. Although intermittent constipation is extremely common, only a small minority of patients seek care for their symptoms.

Among these patients, dissatisfaction with the currently available laxative options is not uncommon, and many patients require specialized care for severe or refractory symptoms. This is especially true for those with abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome overlap, bloating or distention, and psychological comorbidities.

This review outlines a physiological assessment of patients with refractory constipation, exploring treatment options for individuals with slow transit, rectal evacuation disorders, and normal transit. Additionally, we explore non-laxative approaches for normal-transit patients who are bothered by ongoing symptoms, with an emphasis on the biopsychosocial model of functional gastrointestinal disease and treatment of visceral hypersensitivity using neuromodulators.

Finally, we propose a comprehensive evaluation algorithm for managing patients with refractory slow-transit constipation, considering surgical options. We examine surgical options such as colectomy and cecostomy using an antegrade continent enema.

### Delayed excretion of high-dose methotrexate in pediatric acute leukemia correlates with laxative and constipation management [^113YC9Le]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). High credibility.

Delayed excretion of high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can result in significant morbidity. While methotrexate is primarily renally excreted, HD-MTX may overwhelm renal excretion and increase reliance on fecal elimination. This study evaluated the association between laxative use for constipation and delayed excretion of HD-MTX.

- **Methods**: This multisite chart review included pediatric patients with ALL (2010–2020) who received HD-MTX (5 g/m²). Delayed excretion was defined as a serum MTX concentration greater than 0.4 µM at Hour 48. We identified the use of laxative medications after each HD-MTX infusion, with receipt of two or more doses considered a proxy for constipation. Multilevel logistic regression models evaluated associations between clinical factors and delayed HD-MTX excretion to account for multiple MTX cycles per individual.

- **Results**: A total of 533 eligible patients received 1875 HD-MTX infusions. Patients were mostly male (59.8%), Hispanic (56.7%), with a median age of 9.5 years. Delayed excretion was observed following 42.7% of HD-MTX infusions, and patients received two or more laxative doses during 19.9% of infusions. Independent of other factors, individuals who received two or more laxative doses were nearly 60% (odds ratio 1.58; 95% confidence interval: 1.19–2.09; p = .002) more likely to experience delayed excretion compared to those receiving fewer than two laxative doses.

- **Conclusion**: Receipt of at least two laxative doses was independently associated with delayed methotrexate excretion in pediatric patients.

### Chronic constipation: New insights, better outcomes [^117Coowf]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Constipation is a symptom that affects around 11–20% of the adult population yearly. Most physicians consider infrequency of defecation as a hallmark of constipation. However, most patients view excessive straining as the biggest component of constipation, and only a minority of patients with constipation have infrequent bowel movements.

Constipation might be due to many different medical conditions or occur as a side-effect of drug therapy. When these medical conditions or drug therapies are not present, a diagnosis of functional constipation, chronic idiopathic constipation, or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation is often made. In all patients with constipation, rectal outlet dysfunction should be excluded by physical examination. This condition occurs in approximately 25% of patients diagnosed with idiopathic constipation and can be improved with different therapeutic approaches than the administration of laxatives.

Because of the availability of over-the-counter laxatives, most patients consider themselves able to self-manage constipation, and patients have often tried many different treatments before seeking professional help. The physician must carefully assess these previous efforts of self-treatment, optimize them, and strategically use the increasing list of prescription medications for management.

### Clinical examination remains more important than anorectal function tests to identify treatable conditions in women with constipation [^117NkNUa]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is a common disorder, with an estimated prevalence of 10–15% that increases with age. Women are substantially more affected than men. After excluding a colorectal tumor, lifestyle measures, laxatives, and sometimes physiotherapy are recommended to relieve the complaints of constipation, including abdominal fullness, hard stool, straining, and incomplete evacuation. Although many women respond to such a regime, a substantial number of women have ongoing complaints. Referral to specialized centers with anorectal testing facilities is often the next step. The thought behind this lies in the possible demonstration of underlying disorders requiring specific therapy.

Rectocele, dyssynergic pelvic floor, or slow-transit constipation are generally thought to have different therapeutic approaches: a large rectocele requires surgery; a dyssynergic pelvic floor requires sustained physiotherapy; slow transit constipation requires high doses of laxatives, rectal cleansing, and — rarely — surgical intervention. Therefore, it seems important to recognize women with large rectoceles and/or a dyssynergic pelvic floor, as the presence of these conditions directly influences management.

A key question is which test(s) can discriminate between these diagnoses. Studies are not consistent regarding the value of anorectal function tests (AFTs) in patients with constipation. American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guidelines and several studies recommend anorectal manometry (ARM) in patients with constipation. However, other studies show that AFTs have no added value.

### Biofeedback efficacy for outlet dysfunction constipation: Clinical outcomes and predictors of response by a limited approach [^111osGRF]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

Patients who failed a four-week conservative treatment trial were evaluated at the first medical examination (T0).

At T0, the patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire including the Rome III criteria for FC/IBS-C and a self-administered straining questionnaire. The following assessments were performed at the same visit: augmented digital rectal examination (DRE), balloon expulsion test (BET), conventional low-resolution water-perfused anorectal manometry (ARM), and colonic transit time (CTT) with radiopaque markers.

Perception of patients' satisfaction with their bowel habits was assessed through a 100 mm linear visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 indicated completely satisfied and 100 indicated completely unsatisfied. The mean use of laxatives per week and the mean complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM) per week were recorded before and after biofeedback (BF) therapy.

Patients whose BET and ARM results were inconsistent underwent a barium defecography, performed according to the Faccioli et al. technique. The following findings were considered consistent with structural outlet obstruction: (1) rectocele greater than 4 cm (grade III), (2) intussusception extending into the distal anal canal, (3) prolapse of rectal mucosa beyond the anus, and (4) enterocele that appeared to obstruct rectal emptying with retained contrast at the end of straining.

Using these data, patients were assigned to five diagnostic subtypes.

Comparison between demographic features and constipation groups revealed that no differences were observed regarding sex among the groups. Patients with dyssynergic defecation (DD) had a lower mean age compared with all the other groups (p < 0.001). Patients with isolated slow transit constipation had a lower mean age.

### Optimizing the management algorithm for adults with functional constipation failing a fiber/laxative trial in general gastroenterology: Cost-effectiveness and cost-minimization analysis [^115QJQjp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Anorectal function testing is traditionally relegated to subspecialty centers; yet, it is an office-based procedure capable of triaging care for many patients with Rome IV functional constipation who fail empiric over-the-counter therapy in general gastroenterology, as an alternative to empirical prescription drugs. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of routine anorectal function testing in this specific population.

- **Methods**: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis from the patient's perspective and a cost-minimization analysis from the insurer's perspective to compare three strategies: (i) empiric prescription drugs followed by pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) for drug failure, (ii) empiric PFPT followed by prescription drugs for PFPT failure, or (iii) care directed by up-front anorectal function testing. Model inputs were derived from systematic reviews of prospective clinical trials, national cost data sets, and observational cohort studies examining the impact of chronic constipation on health outcomes, healthcare costs, and work productivity.

- **Results**: The most cost-effective strategy was upfront anorectal function testing to triage patients to appropriate therapy. For patients without anal hypocontractility on anorectal manometry and with a balloon expulsion time of at least 6.5 seconds, referral to PFPT was recommended. In sensitivity analysis, empiric PFPT was found to be more cost-effective than empiric prescription drugs, except in situations where the primary goal of treatment was to increase bowel movement frequency.

### Constipation: pathophysiology and management [^116aWzCK]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Continuing advances in pharmaceutical development are providing an expanding array of treatment approaches for patients with chronic constipation. More comprehensive characterization of pancolonic motility offers the promise of improved understanding of the pathophysiology of this common disorder. Chronic constipation, which responds poorly to laxatives, may result from the use of drugs such as opioids, or from defecation disorders and advanced colonic dysmotility.

- **Recent findings**: This article highlights improved characterization of pancolonic motility, evidence of efficacy of established and novel drugs for both idiopathic and opioid-induced constipation, and a new algorithm for the evaluation of patients with chronic idiopathic constipation who respond inadequately to available laxatives.

The articles cited in this review inform the reader of new developments in the evaluation and treatment of patients with chronic constipation.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation — a European perspective [^116wWSKT]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

Undigestible fibers attract water, which leads to a larger and softer fecal mass. Systematic reviews of older studies indicate that fiber increases the number of bowel movements, but the quality of these studies is inconsistent and the treatment duration was usually limited to 4 weeks or less. It has been shown that patients with slow transit and/or impaired defecation are unlikely to respond to fiber.

Most comparative data suggest that lactulose and polyethylene glycol (PEG) have similar efficacy, but with a lower incidence of vomiting and flatulence associated with the latter. PEG provides well-tolerated and effective relief in constipated patients. In a 6-month placebo-controlled study, 304 patients with chronic constipation received either 17 g PEG or placebo. Fifty-two percent of PEG-treated patients compared with 11% of placebo-treated patients were successfully relieved from constipation (according to modified Rome criteria) for more than 50% of their treatment weeks (P < 0.001). No treatment-related safety differences were observed between the PEG and placebo groups during the study, with the exception of GI complaints (39.7% PEG-treated patients vs. 25% placebo-treated patients; P = 0.015). This difference was observed due to abdominal distension, diarrhea, loose stools, flatulence, and nausea, which are considered usual effects of laxative use.

In addition, a retrospective study of institutional patients with chronic constipation reported good long-term results for up to 12 months, and for up to 5 months in a randomized prospective study in adult and pediatric constipated patients.

### Clinical examination remains more important than anorectal function tests to identify treatable conditions in women with constipation [^116PE97S]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Many women with chronic constipation are referred for anorectal function tests (AFT) when they fail initial conservative treatment with lifestyle advice and laxatives. Our goal was to prospectively investigate the diagnostic potential of AFT in women with constipation in order to identify treatable conditions.

- **Methods**: Between May 2003 and June 2011, all women with constipation referred to our tertiary referral center completed a questionnaire regarding their perianal complaints and underwent physical examination. They were evaluated according to our AFT protocol, including anorectal manometry (ARM) and anal endosonography.

- **Results**: One hundred and thirteen women were referred and classified as having idiopathic constipation (n = 100), neurological disorder (n = 8), or others (n = 5). Of the 100 women with idiopathic constipation, clinical examination identified 25 (25%) with hypertonia of the pelvic floor (dyssynergic pelvic floor) and 15 (15%) with a rectocele. In 37/100 women also complaining of impaired evacuation, the yield of rectocele was 15 (41%) and of hypertonia 5 (14%). Women with hypertonia were younger (40 vs. 51 years; P = 0.002) and had no rectoceles identified (P = 0.02), and fewer women could relax during straining on ARM (56% vs. 92%; P < 0.001) compared with women without pelvic hypertonia. Other ARM measurements showed no differences between women with evacuation disorders, rectoceles, or hypertonia. Anal endosonography showed no internal sphincter hypertrophia.

- **Conclusion**: Potentially treatable conditions, such as rectoceles and hypertonia, can be effectively identified through clinical examination rather than relying solely on AFT.

### Novel pharmacological therapies for management of chronic constipation [^113VtHBL]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Constipation is a particularly subjective symptom. For some patients, it means infrequent stools, while others express difficulty in defecation or encounter hard stools. For years, there have been efforts to standardize the meaning of chronic constipation (CC). The American College of Gastroenterology and the Latin-American Consensus on Chronic Constipation similarly define it as "a functional disorder with an evolution of at least 3–6 months, characterized by infrequent stools, difficulty passing, and a long time to achieve deposition".

An international group of experts in gastrointestinal motility convened to define a consensus document on functional gastrointestinal disorders known as the Rome criteria. The latest update, Rome III, was published in 2006. According to these criteria, CC is diagnosed when at least two of the following symptoms are present: fewer than three bowel movements per week (in ≥ 25% of instances), hard stools, sensation of incomplete evacuation, anorectal obstruction, or the use of manual maneuvers to defecate. Additionally, these symptoms must be inadequate to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome and must have been present for the past three months, having started at least six months prior to diagnosis.

Although physicians mainly focus on the frequency of bowel movements (fewer than three per week), for patients, accompanying symptoms such as hard stools, infrequent bowel movements, straining, and incomplete evacuation are of greater concern. This is demonstrated by studies conducted in Canada and Mexico, where subjects self-reported these symptoms.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation — a European perspective [^115NJmcx]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

- **Enterokinetic treatment algorithm**: Once idiopathic chronic constipation has been identified (Rome III), and education, lifestyle, dietary measures, and treatment with laxatives (response evaluable after 2–4 weeks) have failed to provide adequate relief, an enterokinetic agent can be commenced. The response to prucalopride is evaluable after 4–12 weeks. If constipation symptoms remain refractory to pharmacological treatment, patients should be referred for physiological testing as outlined in the published Rome algorithm for refractory constipation and difficult defecation.

- **Refractory constipation and difficult defecation**:
	1. Patients who fulfill the criteria for functional constipation and have not improved with increased dietary fiber and the use of simple laxatives, and with no alarm features, often warrant further physiological assessment.
	2. The three key physiological investigations are anorectal manometry, the balloon expulsion test, and a colonic transit study.
	3. If both anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion are normal, the results of colonic transit testing enable characterization of the disorder as functional constipation with slow or normal transit.
	4. If both manometry and the rectal balloon expulsion test are abnormal, this is sufficient to diagnose a functional defecation disorder.
	5. If only one of the anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion tests is abnormal, further testing using barium or magnetic resonance defecography may be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.

### Biofeedback efficacy for outlet dysfunction constipation: Clinical outcomes and predictors of response by a limited approach [^11418pzg]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

Patients who failed the BET, regardless of colorectal physiology tests, underwent BF therapy. Failure to evacuate a rectal balloon has been shown to correlate with both BF and improved posture outcomes in refractory constipation due to defecatory disorders.

The BF treatment protocol, performed according to previously published techniques, consisted of five weekly BF training sessions that lasted 30–45 minutes. Briefly, patients were first taught to strain more effectively and to coordinate expulsion efforts with their breathing. Next, they were taught to relax pelvic floor muscles during straining by electromyography (EMG) feedback imaging. A surface intra‐anal EMG probe connected to a portable instrument (Myotron‐120; Enting Instruments & Systems, Dorst, The Netherlands) was used to measure pelvic floor EMG responses to attempted defecation. A sustained increase in average EMG activity during straining trials greater than 50% above resting EMG levels (i.e. paradoxical contraction) was indicative of PFD. In the final phase of training, patients practiced defecating a 50‐mL, air‐filled balloon while the trainer gently pulled on the catheter connected to the balloon. After BF training, all patients were told that their pushing efforts had improved; this was done to ensure that patients entering the follow-up phase of the study had a positive expectation and would be motivated to return for follow-up. All the BF training sessions were performed by a registered nurse unaware of physiology results, but BET.

One month after the end of BF therapy, patients were re-assessed (T1).

### Anorectal biofeedback: An effective therapy, but can we shorten the course to improve access to treatment [^112J2oxL]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Another limitation of our study is the absence of defecating proctograms, which limits our ability to fully characterize the constipated patients with a defecatory disorder and perhaps includes patients less likely to benefit from biofeedback through the program. Proctograms are very useful for defining anatomical abnormalities; however, they are not recommended prior to biofeedback therapy by consensus groups such as the Rome Committee. There is no evidence that the information they provide will alter biofeedback therapy. Radiation exposure is an additional concern, especially as many patients were female and young, and therefore more radiosensitive. Nevertheless, there were no differences in defecatory dynamics between patients in the two protocols, making a bias unlikely.

In conclusion, an abbreviated anorectal biofeedback protocol offered to patients traveling from a long distance provides substantial, at least short-term, improvements in constipation and fecal incontinence, as well as in quality of life, satisfaction, and feeling of control over bowel movements. These improvements are not substantially different from a full protocol. Small advantages were observed for the more comprehensive protocol in terms of improvement in patient satisfaction with bowel movements and rectal sensation. Further work refining biofeedback protocols, tailored to patient subtypes and desired outcomes, is warranted. Our study also suggests that any further reduction in instrumented sessions below three or four may be detrimental. Although this study was performed in Australia, where distances to major medical facilities can be significant, the same problems of access…

### Mechanisms, evaluation, and management of chronic constipation [^112RBpmg]. Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

With a worldwide prevalence of 15%, chronic constipation is one of the most frequent gastrointestinal diagnoses made in ambulatory medicine clinics and is a common cause for referrals to gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons in the United States. Symptoms vary among patients; straining, incomplete evacuation, and a sense of anorectal blockage are just as important as decreased stool frequency. Chronic constipation is either a primary disorder — such as normal transit, slow transit, or defecatory disorders — or a secondary one, due to medications or, in rare cases, anatomic alterations. Colonic sensorimotor disturbances and pelvic floor dysfunction, such as defecatory disorders, are the most widely recognized pathogenic mechanisms.

Guided by efficacy and cost, management of constipation should begin with dietary fiber supplementation and stimulant and/or osmotic laxatives, as appropriate, followed, if necessary, by intestinal secretagogues and/or prokinetic agents. Peripherally acting μ-opiate antagonists are another option for opioid-induced constipation. Anorectal tests to evaluate for defecatory disorders should be performed in patients who do not respond to over-the-counter agents. Colonic transit, followed if necessary by assessment of colonic motility with manometry and/or a barostat, can identify colonic dysmotility. Defecatory disorders often respond to biofeedback therapy. For specific patients, slow-transit constipation may necessitate a colectomy. No studies have compared inexpensive laxatives with newer drugs with different mechanisms.

### Perceptions, definitions, and therapeutic interventions for occasional constipation: A Rome Working Group consensus document [^116Hip7r]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Functional constipation is the most common disorder of gut-brain interaction, affecting approximately 12% of the world population. Although typically considered a chronic condition, many individuals experience shorter yet repetitive bouts of constipation, representing a different clinical entity. There has been increased interest in this latter disorder, which has recently been classified as occasional constipation. This Rome Foundation working group document reflects the consensus of an international team of specialists, who summarized currently available research to provide a working definition and treatment algorithm for occasional constipation. The recommendations herein are based on evidence, accounting for gaps in the literature as well as international variance in definitions and health-seeking behaviors for constipation.

- **Methods**: The committee members reviewed the scientific literature, focusing specifically on occasional constipation, with the understanding that being a new entity, a paucity of data would be available. We used Rome IV research and clinical definitions to establish the framework for our definition of occasional constipation. Where possible, treatment recommendations were based on the earliest extractable data from functional constipation studies, focusing on positive results within the first two weeks of treatment. We employed the Delphi method to achieve consensus with 100% agreement among the authors.

- **Results**: An evidence-based review of the literature resulted in the definition of occasional constipation.

### Current management strategies and therapeutic targets in chronic constipation [^112qS6Wd]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Constipated patients who are refractory to simple lifestyle interventions will usually resort to laxatives, whether prescribed or over-the-counter. Clinical trial evidence is scarce for older medications such as laxatives, especially concerning a condition as chronic and subjective as constipation. Newer polyethylene glycol-based laxatives have been investigated under rigorous clinical trial settings, but comparisons between different laxatives are not available. Newer prokinetic agents, targeting peristalsis, intestinal secretion, and the colonic flora, have been developed for laxative-refractory constipation. This review focuses on the evidence for each of these agents and the relative indications for each of them.

### Clinical examination remains more important than anorectal function tests to identify treatable conditions in women with constipation [^1179j1x9]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Many women with chronic constipation are referred for anorectal function tests (AFT) when they fail initial conservative treatment with lifestyle advice and laxatives. Our goal was to prospectively investigate the diagnostic potential of AFT in women with constipation to identify treatable conditions.

Between May 2003 and June 2011, all women with constipation referred to our tertiary referral center completed a questionnaire regarding their perianal complaints. They underwent physical examination and were evaluated according to our AFT protocol, including anorectal manometry (ARM) and anal endosonography.

One hundred and thirteen women were referred and classified as having idiopathic constipation (n = 100), neurological disorder (n = 8), or others (n = 5). Of the 100 women with idiopathic constipation, clinical examination identified 25 (25%) with hypertonia of the pelvic floor (dyssynergic pelvic floor) and 15 (15%) with a rectocele. In 37/100 women also complaining of impaired evacuation, the yield of rectocele was 15 (41%) and of hypertonia 5 (14%). Women with hypertonia were younger (40 vs. 51 years; P = 0.002) and had no rectoceles identified (P = 0.02), and fewer women could relax during straining on ARM (56% vs. 92%; P < 0.001) compared with women without pelvic hypertonia. Other ARM measurements showed no differences between women with evacuation disorders, rectoceles, or hypertonia. Anal endosonography showed no internal sphincter hypertrophia.

### Unmet needs in pediatric functional constipation [^1162SZoX]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Oral laxatives are the most commonly prescribed treatments for fecal disimpaction and maintenance therapy, but their long-term use has not been adequately evaluated. The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) guidelines recommend polyethylene glycol (PEG), with or without electrolytes, dosed orally (1–1.5 g/kg/d) for 3 to 6 days as the first-line treatment for children presenting with fecal impaction. If PEG is unavailable, lactulose is recommended as the first-line maintenance treatment, whereas milk of magnesia, mineral oil, and stimulant laxatives may be considered as additional or second-line treatments. While significant improvements in constipation symptoms have been reported with both osmotic (e.g. PEG) and stimulant (e.g. senna) laxatives in RCTs, approximately 40% to 50% of children with functional constipation experience at least one episode of relapse within the first 5 years after initial recovery. Dietary fibers, traditional medicine, and probiotics are commonly used; however, the clinical evidence supporting their use is not clear. Prebiotics and probiotics may be effective at improving clinical symptoms, but data from RCTs are limited.

Among the nonpharmacological interventions, sacral neuromodulation provides a suitable option for refractory pediatric functional constipation (PFC), but it is not frequently used, and data on its clinical benefits in children are limited. In a prospective cohort study (n = 30), sacral neuromodulation improved the mean defecation frequency, which was sustained over a prolonged period.

### Epidemiology and burden of chronic constipation [^1139rLft]. Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology = Journal Canadien de Gastroenterologie (2011). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on constipation:

- **Definition**: Constipation is a symptom-based disorder defined as fewer than three bowel movements per week.
- **Pathophysiology**: Constipation is caused by pelvic floor dysfunction, slow colonic transit, metabolic disorders (such as hypercalcemia and hypothyroidism), medications (including opiates, calcium channel blockers, and antipsychotics), neurological disorders (like diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and spinal cord injury), irritable bowel syndrome, and primary colonic disorders (such as strictures, cancer, anal fissure, and proctitis).
- **Epidemiology**: The overall prevalence of constipation in the US is 16%.
- **Disease course**: Anomalous regulation of neuromuscular components within the colon and anorectum, along with disruption in the corresponding ascending and descending pathways in the brain-gut axis, result in infrequent bowel movements, excessive straining, a sense of incomplete evacuation, failed or lengthy attempts to defecate, digital manipulation to evacuate stools, abdominal bloating, and hard consistency of stools.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Chronic constipation decreases quality of life and ability to function. However, only approximately 25% of patients consult physicians or use medications to manage associated symptoms.

### Exploring the attitudes of pediatric oncologists toward the use of laxatives for the prevention of constipation in patients undergoing active treatment: a Canadian perspective [^1143ns2h]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Constipation is a common problem in pediatric oncology patients and may lead to significant consequences. There is a paucity of published literature on the prevention of constipation in this population. The primary purpose of this study was to explore the practice of pediatric oncologists in preventing constipation in children receiving active chemotherapy treatment, specifically during periods of intensive vincristine therapy.

- **Methods**: A web-based survey of pediatric oncologists and pediatric oncology trainees in Canadian centers was conducted.

- **Results**: A 48% response rate was achieved. The majority of physicians had a lower threshold for defining constipation in oncology patients compared with the published literature. More than 90% of the respondents estimated the prevalence of constipation in pediatric oncology patients to be 30% or higher. The majority of respondents prescribed constipation prophylaxis in the presence of one or more of the following factors: history of constipation prior to or during previous phases of therapy, vincristine combined with either narcotics or immobility, multiple vincristine doses per month, spinal cord compression and immobility, and isolated narcotic therapy. Polyethylene glycol 3350, lactulose, and docusate were the most commonly recommended first-line prophylactic therapies used.

- **Conclusion**: Constipation is a significant problem in patients during cancer treatment. Most oncologists suggest giving laxatives as prophylaxis in the presence of risk factors, as well as prompt treatment once any symptoms appear.

### Novel pharmacological therapies for management of chronic constipation [^114YFfzC]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Lembo et al. conducted two multicenter (208 centers in the United States and 8 Canadian centers), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase III studies (trial 303 and 01) involving 1,276 patients with chronic constipation (CC). Patients received 145 or 290 mcg of linaclotide once daily for 12 weeks versus placebo. The primary endpoint was achieving ≥ 3 complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week and an increase of one or more CSBMs from baseline lasting at least 9 of the 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was achieved in 21.2% and 16% of patients with a dose of 145 mcg and in 19.4% and 21.3% with a dose of 290 mcg of linaclotide, compared with 3.3% and 6.0% for placebo (P < 0.01). Additionally, improvements in all secondary endpoints were found — frequency, stool consistency scales, straining, abdominal discomfort, bloating, constipation severity, and quality of life assessment (PAC-QoL) — with both doses of linaclotide compared to placebo. Trial 303 also included, at the end of the treatment, a period of 4 weeks of double-blind randomized crossover therapy with 290 mcg linaclotide or placebo (patients initially assigned to any dose of linaclotide continued with the same dose of linaclotide or placebo, according to the randomization, and patients who initially received placebo were randomized to linaclotide 290 mcg). Interestingly, patients who continued taking linaclotide and those who were switched from placebo to linaclotide had a sustained increase in CSBMs during this period, and in addition, patients who were switched from linaclotide to placebo showed a decrease in the range of CSBMs similar to that of the placebo group.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation — a European perspective [^114yh8BM]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

Although constipation can be a chronic and severe problem, it is largely treated empirically. Evidence for the efficacy of some older laxatives from well-designed trials is limited. Patients often report high levels of dissatisfaction with their treatment, attributed to a lack of efficacy or unpleasant side effects. Management guidelines and recommendations are limited and do not sufficiently include treatments that have become available more recently, such as prokinetic agents in Europe.

We present an overview of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and available guidelines for the treatment of chronic constipation, including recent data on the efficacy and potential clinical use of more newly available therapeutic agents. Based on published algorithms and guidelines on the management of chronic constipation, secondary pathologies and causes are first excluded. Diet, lifestyle, and, if available, behavioral measures are then adopted. If these fail, bulk-forming, osmotic, and stimulant laxatives can be used. If symptoms are not satisfactorily resolved, a prokinetic agent such as prucalopride can be prescribed. Biofeedback is recommended as a treatment for chronic constipation in patients with disordered defecation. Surgery should only be considered once all other treatment options have been exhausted.

### Chronic constipation: An evidence-based review [^111rCUZ8]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is a common condition seen in family practice, particularly among the elderly and women. There is no consensus regarding its exact definition, and it may be interpreted differently by physicians and patients. Physicians prescribe various treatments, and patients often adopt different over-the-counter remedies. Chronic constipation is either caused by slow colonic transit or pelvic floor dysfunction, and treatment varies accordingly.

- **Methods**: To update our knowledge of chronic constipation, its etiology, and best-evidence treatment, information was synthesized from articles published in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Levels of evidence and recommendations were made according to the Strength of Recommendation taxonomy.

- **Results**: The standard advice of increasing dietary fibers, fluids, and exercise for relieving chronic constipation only benefits patients with a true deficiency. Biofeedback works best for constipation caused by pelvic floor dysfunction. Pharmacological agents increase bulk or water content in the bowel lumen or aim to stimulate bowel movements. Novel classes of compounds have emerged for treating chronic constipation, with promising clinical trial data. Finally, the link between senna abuse and colon cancer remains unsupported.

- **Conclusions**: Chronic constipation should be managed according to its etiology and guided by the best evidence-based treatment.

### Treatments for intractable constipation in childhood [^114DbTR2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Constipation that is prolonged and does not resolve with conventional therapeutic measures is called intractable constipation. The treatment of intractable constipation is challenging, involving pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies, as well as surgical approaches. Unresolved constipation can negatively impact quality of life, with additional implications for health systems. Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify treatments that are efficacious and safe.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatments used for intractable constipation in children.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registers up to 23 June 2023. We also searched reference lists of included studies for relevant studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any pharmacological, non-pharmacological, or surgical treatment to placebo or another active comparator, in participants aged between 0 and 18 years with functional constipation who had not responded to conventional medical therapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were symptom resolution, frequency of defecation, treatment success, and adverse events; secondary outcomes were stool consistency, painful defecation, quality of life, faecal incontinence frequency, abdominal pain, hospital admission for disimpaction, and school absence. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each primary outcome.

- **Main results**: This review included 10 RCTs with 1278 children who had intractable constipation.

### Mechanisms of action of current pharmacologic options for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^117SsVfA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Multiple therapeutic agents are currently available for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. A better understanding of the mechanism of action of each treatment provides important insights into expected responses and is key to optimizing treatment outcomes. Some constipation treatments, such as stimulant laxatives, may increase bowel movement frequency but are ineffective at relieving, and may even exacerbate, abdominal symptoms. On the contrary, prescription treatments, such as the guanylyl cyclase-C agonists, may improve bowel symptoms and reduce visceral hypersensitivity. This review summarizes the mechanisms of action of commonly used over-the-counter and prescription therapies for chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, outlining how these mechanisms contribute to the efficacy and safety of each treatment option.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation — a European perspective [^117Fpeqv]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

It has been suggested, though not anatomically proven, that neuronal damage from neurodegeneration or damage during pelvic surgery or childbirth reduces colonic motility and may underlie certain cases of idiopathic slow-transit constipation. Although the relationship between sex hormones and chronic constipation is not clear, a decreased level of ovarian and adrenal steroid hormones has been reported in association with constipation. Furthermore, one in vitro study proposed a mechanism for slow-transit constipation where the over-expression of progesterone receptors can down-regulate contractile G-proteins and up-regulate inhibitory G-proteins in colonic circular muscle cells.

- **Defecation disorders**: A number of patients with chronic constipation display difficulty in expelling stools from the rectum. This failure may be due to impaired rectal contraction, paradoxical anal contraction, or inadequate anal relaxation. Lack of coordination, or dyssynergia, of the muscles involved in defecation is thought to be the most likely cause, but a high proportion of patients may also show impaired rectal sensation. Structural abnormalities are less common but include rectal prolapse and/or intussusception, rectocele (a herniation, usually of the anterior rectal wall towards the vagina), and excessive perineal descent. In many patients, pelvic floor dysfunction may contribute to constipation with or without delayed transit, and as a consequence, biofeedback therapy has been shown to be beneficial in recent controlled trials.

### Chronic constipation in adults: Contemporary perspectives and clinical challenges. 2: Conservative, behavioural, medical and surgical treatment [^115xm9Ki]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is a prevalent disorder that affects the quality of life for patients and consumes resources in healthcare systems worldwide. In clinical practice, it remains a challenge, as clinicians frequently are unsure which treatments to use and when. Over a decade ago, a Neurogastroenterology and Motility journal supplement devoted to the investigation and management of constipation was published (Neurogastroenterol Motil 2009;21(Suppl 2):1). In October 2018, the 3rd London Masterclass, entitled "Contemporary management of constipation", was held. Faculty members of this symposium were invited to write two reviews, presenting a collective synthesis of talks and discussions from this meeting. The first review addresses epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical associations, pathophysiology, and investigation.

The present review is the second of these, providing contemporary perspectives and clinical challenges regarding behavioral, conservative, medical, and surgical treatments for patients presenting with constipation. It includes a management algorithm to guide clinical practice.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation — a European perspective [^116LAAJu]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

Treatment options are essential in addressing chronic constipation. Laxatives aid defecation by decreasing stool consistency (softening) and/or artificially or indirectly stimulating colon motility via one or more mechanisms. Well-designed, placebo-controlled, blinded clinical trials of older laxatives are limited. Although many trials report improvements in the number of bowel movements per week and some report improvements in certain symptoms, many studies are small and lack comprehensive clinically relevant treatment endpoints.

Similarly, there is a lack of head-to-head comparisons, leading to insufficient evidence to determine whether one laxative class is superior to another. It is largely unknown if laxative treatments address the impaired quality of life observed in patients with chronic constipation, as most studies have failed to assess quality of life measures. Indeed, for some patients, laxatives can worsen certain symptoms, such as bloating and flatulence.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation — a European perspective [^115wqWct]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

Recent controlled studies have established the efficacy of biofeedback in the management of chronic constipation in those with defecatory disorders, but the efficacy seems less in those with slow-transit constipation. This establishes biofeedback as the treatment of choice for constipation with defecation disorders. However, recognizing and diagnosing defecatory disorders is beyond the scope of primary care practice and is usually only done by gastroenterologists. Moreover, this therapy requires a patient who understands the concept and aim of the biofeedback process, as well as a skilled and motivated physiotherapist. The availability of experienced therapists and reimbursement of biofeedback is problematic in most parts of Europe.

- **New pharmacological treatments for constipation**:

	- **Currently available treatments**:

		- **Lubiprostone**: Chloride channels play an important role in fluid transport and the maintenance of cell volume and pH in a variety of tissue and cell types, particularly in intestinal epithelial cells. Nine separate channels have been identified, of which the CIC-2 channel is of particular interest. When it is activated, the secretion of intestinal fluid is promoted. The secretion of fluids into the GI tract improves stool consistency and may contribute to normal transit.

		- Lubiprostone activates chloride channels to increase intestinal fluid secretion. However, its exact mechanism is unclear and may involve type-2 chloride channels, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channels, and/or G-protein-coupled prostaglandin receptors.

### Consensus recommendations for the management of constipation in patients with advanced, progressive illness [^114X5R2b]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2010). Low credibility.

Constipation is a highly prevalent and distressing symptom in patients with advanced, progressive illnesses. Although opioids are one of the most common causes of constipation in these patients, it is important to note that there are many other potential etiologies and combinations of causes to consider when making treatment decisions. Management approaches involve a combination of good assessment techniques, preventive regimens, appropriate pharmacological treatment of established constipation, and frequent monitoring. In this vulnerable patient population, maintaining comfort and respecting individual preferences and sensitivities should be overriding considerations when making clinical decisions.

This consensus document was developed by a multidisciplinary group of leading Canadian palliative care specialists to define best practices in palliative constipation management that will be relevant and useful to healthcare professionals. Although a wide range of options exists to help treat constipation and prevent its development or recurrence, there is a limited body of evidence evaluating pharmacological interventions. These recommendations are, therefore, based on the best available evidence, combined with expert opinion derived from experience in clinical practice. This underscores the need for further clinical evaluation of the available agents to create a robust, evidence-based foundation for treatment decisions in the management of constipation in patients with advanced, progressive illnesses.
