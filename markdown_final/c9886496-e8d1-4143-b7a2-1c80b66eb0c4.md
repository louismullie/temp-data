Pain in eldery

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing pain in older adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and burden to frame the clinical problem. Then, I should verify the unique pathophysiology and assessment challenges in older adults. Next, I will review a stepwise, multimodal management approach, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies. After that, I need to consider special populations such as those with cognitive impairment and frailty. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, goal-oriented care plan and highlight evidence gaps and monitoring needs, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references and that I double-check any assumptions before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the scope and burden of chronic pain in older adults, because this shapes triage and resource allocation. Chronic pain affects roughly 20–30% of adults globally, with higher prevalence in older adults and women, and high-impact chronic pain is particularly disabling, limiting life or work activities on most days, which is common in older cohorts [^111Kw5VF] [^112WfRhG]. I should double-check longitudinal data: the 2019–2020 NHIS cohort showed an incidence of chronic pain of 52.4 per 1000 person-years and persistence of 462.0 per 1000 person-years, underscoring the need for early intervention to prevent chronicity and disability [^115Jm5Lp] [^116QHg4J]. Hold on, I should verify regional variability: in low- and middle-income countries, chronic pain prevalence in the general elderly population averages about 56%, with low back pain particularly prominent, which aligns with the global musculoskeletal burden in aging [^116uUJwY].

> Next, I should review the unique pathophysiology and clinical features in older adults, because these drive both assessment and treatment choices. Aging alters nociception, with reduced peripheral fiber density and central nociceptive processing, yet descending inhibitory pathways degrade, making severe pain less tolerable and increasing chronic pain risk; this helps explain why older adults may report lower acute pain scores but have higher chronic pain burden and disability risk [^1167F88a]. Wait, let me verify the musculoskeletal contributors: osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, and sarcopenia are common and often coexist, with sarcopenia linked to a 1.5-fold higher odds of chronic pain, especially in low- and middle-income settings, reinforcing the need to screen for muscle loss and mobility deficits [^111m2fRH] [^117TTSGs]. I need to ensure I note neuropathic components too, including postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy, which are prevalent and often underrecognized in late life [^112vKBio].

> I will now examine assessment challenges, because underrecognition leads to undertreatment. Cognitive impairment, sensory deficits, and stoicism reduce self-report reliability; observational tools such as the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) and the Abbey Pain Scale are recommended when self-report is limited, though observer bias and context must be considered [^113HuYCQ] [^116x2Jav]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of undertreatment: in community-dwelling frail elders with daily pain, analgesic use is often absent or inadequate, and undertreatment is even more pronounced in those aged 85 and older and in those with dementia, highlighting a persistent quality gap [^116rd7jz] [^111pDfsv]. Let me reconsider the tools: hierarchical approaches that integrate self-report with behavioral cues improve detection, but I need to confirm that staff training is essential to reduce misclassification and improve care plans [^116x2Jav].

> Now, I should outline a stepwise, multimodal management approach, starting with nonpharmacologic foundations. Exercise therapy, including strength, flexibility, balance, and endurance components, improves pain, function, and mood and should be prioritized. Adherence can be sustained over years when embedded in structured programs, and manual therapy can be adjunctive for back and hip pain, though evidence quality varies [^1163oQRW] [^112pZMxV]. Wait, I should verify psychological strategies: cognitive-behavioral therapy and self-management education reduce pain intensity and improve coping, and contemporary guidelines endorse individualized, person-centered nonpharmacologic care as first-line for chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults, including older adults [^112M88ax]. I need to ensure I mention assistive devices and environmental modifications to preserve independence and reduce fall risk, even if they do not directly reduce pain intensity [^114TwJTp].

> Turning to pharmacotherapy, I should confirm first-line choices and escalation rules. Acetaminophen remains first-line for mild to moderate musculoskeletal pain given its favorable safety profile when dosed within hepatic limits, typically up to 3 g/day in frail older adults with hepatic risk, with careful monitoring for hepatotoxicity and drug interactions [^1163oQRW] [^114TwJTp]. Hold on, I should verify NSAID cautions: oral NSAIDs are not recommended for long-term use in older adults due to gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular risks; if absolutely necessary, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with gastroprotection and close monitoring [^1163oQRW] [^116QM2u7]. For moderate to severe pain or acetaminophen-refractory cases, short-term tramadol or carefully selected opioids may be considered with explicit constipation prophylaxis, fall risk mitigation, and monitoring for delirium and respiratory depression; long-term opioid efficacy in older adults is limited and should be reserved for carefully selected patients with close follow-up [^1163oQRW] [^111jpwaJ]. I should double-check adjuvants: low-dose tricyclics or gabapentinoids can help neuropathic pain, but adverse effects are more common in older adults, necessitating slow titration and renal dose adjustments [^114TwJTp].

> Let me consider interventional options for refractory cases, but I need to be cautious about evidence quality. Intra-articular corticosteroids can provide short-term relief for knee osteoarthritis, and hyaluronic acid may be an option for those intolerant to systemic therapy, though benefits are modest and patient selection matters [^114TwJTp]. Wait, I should verify epidural steroids: evidence for epidural steroid injections in sciatica is mixed, with some signal in spinal stenosis, so shared decision-making and realistic expectations are essential; similarly, nerve blocks and other procedures should be individualized based on pain phenotype and goals [^114TwJTp]. I need to ensure that any procedural plan includes pre-procedural optimization of comorbidities and post-procedural rehabilitation to sustain gains [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with cognitive impairment and dementia. Pain is frequently underrecognized in dementia, and behavioral observation tools, collateral history, and careful medication reconciliation are critical; undertreatment remains common despite growing awareness, so scheduled reassessment and analgesic trials with close monitoring are warranted [^113HuYCQ] [^111pDfsv]. Hold on, I should verify that phenotyping approaches linking pain behaviors to likely mechanisms can guide therapy and reduce both under- and overtreatment in this group, though evidence is still evolving [^115jQ5Rp]. For frailty, persistent pain accelerates functional decline and contributes to frailty risk; integrating pain control with falls prevention, nutrition, and sarcopenia management is essential to preserve independence [^114fW1zn] [^111m2fRH].

> I should also address multimorbidity and polypharmacy, because these are ubiquitous in older adults with pain. Chronic pain commonly coexists with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, and anxiety, which constrain analgesic choices and increase adverse event risk; deprescribing and medication simplification, along with pharmacist-led reviews, reduce harm while aligning treatment with patient priorities [^114nyoWJ] [^116csmnv]. But wait, what if opioids are being intensified simply because pain is prioritized and safer alternatives are inaccessible? That pattern has been observed, reinforcing the need to expand access to nonpharmacologic care and to set realistic, function-focused goals with patients and caregivers [^116csmnv].

> Let me synthesize a practical, goal-oriented care plan, and I should confirm each step against guidelines. Start with a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment including pain intensity, functional goals, mood, sleep, cognition, comorbidities, and medications; use validated tools appropriate to cognitive status and reassess at each visit to track progress and adverse effects [^1163oQRW] [^112HK8HM]. Set shared, function-focused goals such as walking a certain distance, maintaining social engagement, or improving sleep, and align interventions to these goals rather than solely targeting pain scores [^1163oQRW]. Begin with acetaminophen and nonpharmacologic therapies, escalate cautiously to topical NSAIDs or tramadol if needed, and reserve opioids for carefully selected patients with close monitoring; throughout, mitigate fall risk, constipation, and cognitive effects [^114TwJTp] [^111xhHRp]. I need to ensure ongoing monitoring for efficacy, adverse effects, and evolving comorbidities, and to reassess the care plan regularly as goals and function change [^1163oQRW].

> Finally, I should identify evidence gaps and monitoring needs, and I will double-check that these align with consensus statements. There is limited high-quality evidence on long-term opioid safety and efficacy in older adults, and underrepresentation of the oldest old in trials limits generalizability, necessitating cautious, individualized prescribing and robust post-marketing surveillance [^111jpwaJ] [^112pqUQa]. Nonpharmacologic interventions need better standardization and access, particularly for CBT, exercise, and multimodal programs in real-world settings, and implementation science is needed to translate evidence into practice for diverse older populations [^112M88ax] [^114NkB4u]. I should confirm that routine outcome tracking should include pain intensity, function, mood, sleep, falls, and medication harms, with periodic attempts to de-intensify therapy when goals are met or risks outweigh benefits [^1163oQRW].

Pain in the elderly is **highly prevalent** and often undertreated, with chronic pain affecting 43–76% of community-dwelling older adults and up to 80% in nursing homes [^1158LCL2] [^111HHVSS]. It is typically **multifactorial**, driven by musculoskeletal, neuropathic, and visceral causes, and is strongly linked to functional decline, depression, sleep disturbance, and increased healthcare use [^112vKBio] [^114w6Ads]. Assessment is complicated by cognitive impairment and polypharmacy, requiring **simple tools and caregiver input** [^113HuYCQ] [^116x2Jav]. Management should be **multimodal**, starting with acetaminophen, topical NSAIDs, and nonpharmacologic therapies; opioids are reserved for severe refractory pain with close monitoring for adverse effects [^1163oQRW] [^111xhHRp]. Regular reassessment and individualized plans are essential to balance efficacy with safety [^1163oQRW].

---

## Prevalence and epidemiology

Prevalence estimates vary widely due to differing definitions and populations, but **chronic pain is common in older adults** [^117EhyYf]:

- **Community-dwelling elderly**: 43.8–76.4% [^1158LCL2].
- **Nursing home residents**: up to 80% [^111HHVSS].
- **Global estimates**: 25–65% in community-dwelling older adults [^111HHVSS].

---

## Common types and causes of pain in the elderly

Pain in older adults is **multifactorial**, with common types and causes including:

| **Type of pain** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Musculoskeletal pain | - Osteoarthritis <br/> - Rheumatoid arthritis <br/> - Osteoporosis <br/> - Degenerative disc disease [^111wDrxJ] |
| Neuropathic pain | - Diabetic neuropathy <br/> - Postherpetic neuralgia <br/> - Peripheral neuropathy [^111HHVSS] |
| Visceral pain | - Cancer <br/> - Gastrointestinal disorders <br/> - Cardiovascular disease [^112vKBio] |
| Post-surgical pain | - Chronic post-surgical pain <br/> - Joint replacement surgeries [^notfound] |

---

## Impact on quality of life and functional status

Chronic pain significantly impairs **quality of life and functional status** in older adults, leading to:

- **Functional limitations**: Reduced mobility, difficulty with activities of daily living (ADLs), and increased risk of falls [^113NQBWh].
- **Psychological impact**: Higher rates of depression, anxiety, and social isolation [^1158LCL2].
- **Sleep disturbances**: Insomnia and poor sleep quality are common [^115V3mzT].
- **Increased healthcare utilization**: Frequent doctor visits, hospitalizations, and medication use [^114nyoWJ].

---

## Barriers to effective pain assessment and management

Several barriers complicate pain management in older adults, including **cognitive impairment**, which hinders accurate self-report and necessitates reliance on observational tools and caregiver input [^113HuYCQ]. Communication difficulties stemming from sensory impairments and language barriers further complicate assessment [^116x2Jav]. Polypharmacy increases the risk of drug interactions and adverse effects, while undertreatment remains common due to misconceptions about pain being a normal part of aging and concerns about medication side effects [^116rd7jz].

---

## Recommended assessment tools and strategies

Effective pain assessment in older adults requires **tailored tools and strategies**:

- **Unidimensional scales**: Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Verbal Descriptor Scale (VDS), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) [^113vgXLh].
- **Multidimensional tools**: Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) [^113NQBWh].
- **Observational tools**: Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD), Abbey Pain Scale for cognitively impaired patients [^notfound].
- **Regular reassessment**: Frequent monitoring and documentation of pain levels and treatment effectiveness [^1163oQRW].

---

## Pharmacological management

Pharmacological management should follow a **stepwise approach**, balancing efficacy with safety:

- **First-line therapy**: Acetaminophen (paracetamol) due to its favorable safety profile [^114TwJTp].
- **Second-line therapy**: Topical NSAIDs (e.g. diclofenac gel) for localized musculoskeletal pain [^1163oQRW].
- **Adjunctive therapies**: Antidepressants (e.g. duloxetine) and anticonvulsants (e.g. gabapentin) for neuropathic pain [^114TwJTp].
- **Opioids**: Reserved for severe, refractory pain due to risks of falls, cognitive impairment, and respiratory depression. Use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring [^112mqZbs].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions are **essential components** of pain management:

- **Physical therapy**: Exercise programs, strength training, and balance exercises [^114TwJTp].
- **Psychological therapies**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness, and relaxation techniques [^114TwJTp].
- **Complementary therapies**: Acupuncture, massage therapy, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) [^114TwJTp].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight management, smoking cessation, and alcohol reduction [^notfound].

---

## Role of caregivers and healthcare professionals

Caregivers and healthcare professionals play a **critical role** in managing pain in older adults. Caregivers provide daily support, monitor pain, administer medications, and communicate with healthcare providers, while healthcare professionals conduct comprehensive assessments, develop individualized treatment plans, and coordinate multidisciplinary care [^1163oQRW].

---

## Current guidelines and best practices

Current guidelines emphasize a **multimodal, individualized approach**:

- **American Geriatrics Society (AGS)**: Recommends acetaminophen as first-line therapy, cautious use of NSAIDs, and opioids only for severe refractory pain with close monitoring [^notfound].
- **British Geriatrics Society**: Emphasizes regular reassessment, non-pharmacological interventions, and caregiver involvement [^114TwJTp].
- **World Health Organization (WHO)**: Advocates for a biopsychosocial model, integrating physical, psychological, and social interventions [^notfound].

---

Pain in the elderly is a **complex, multifactorial issue** that significantly impacts quality of life and functional status. Effective management requires a **multimodal approach**, incorporating pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, regular reassessment, and caregiver involvement.

### Opioids for chronic pain: new evidence, new strategies, safe prescribing [^112DUJoY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In the United States, the prevalence and burden of chronic pain is large and still growing. Older adults (aged ≥ 65 years) make up a large portion of the population with chronic pain, and their presentation, diagnosis, and treatment tends to be more complicated because of age-related physiological changes and comorbidities. Guidelines on treating patients with severe back pain recommend opioids as an option for those who do not find adequate pain relief from acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). For older adult patients at higher risk for NSAID-related adverse effects, such as those who have gastrointestinal or cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, or who are taking low-dose aspirin, opioids are recommended instead. Opioids may also be an appropriate option for patients with neuropathic pain who have not achieved adequate analgesia from maximum doses of first- and second-line antineuropathic agents. Still, opioids are not appropriate for all patients; rather, a differential diagnosis, consideration of other comorbidities, and the potential for opioid-related adverse effects and substance abuse are required to confirm the value of opioid treatment for each individual. For nonresponders to opioid therapy, opioid rotation should be considered before discontinuation is pursued.

### Chronic pain and geriatric syndromes in community-dwelling patients aged ≥ 65 years [^1116BNvS]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

GS, are clinical conditions in older adults that do not fit into discrete disease categories. Conditions such as delirium, pressure ulcers, falls, and incontinence are "widely known", but other conditions, such as visual and hearing problems, elder abuse, malnutrition, sleep problems, and even dizziness and syncope too have been included under the heading of GS.

Pain is a very common problem among adults. The prevalence of chronic pain in the adult population ranges from 20% to 50%, depending on the study population, the sampling method, the interview method, the definition of "chronicity" and the definition of the site of pain.–

Many studies have investigated associations between pain and specific GS, such as functional limitations,–affective disorders,–cognitive decline,–and falls. However, a literature review on the association between pain and GS and their mutual effect on outcomes, such as mortality, functional decline, falls, etc. did not yield a clear-cut picture. Lohman et alfound that the inclusion of persistent pain as an additional criterion for frailty led to a potentially better prediction of incident adverse outcomes. Andrews et allooked at the cross-sectional relationship between pain and basic functional limitations and their effect on ADL disability after a 10-year follow-up. They found that pain itself is not an independent risk factor. They linked this finding to the possibility that pain and functional limitation, such as other GS, have common underlying risk factors and mechanisms. In one of the important studies that investigated the prevalence and co-occurrence of GS among community-dwelling people aged ≥ 75 years, the authors cited the fact that they did not assess the co-occurrence of pain GS as one of the study limitations. It should be noted that many of the studies that looked at the effect of GS on negative outcomes did not take pain into account.–

In the present study, we assessed associations between chronic pain and GS among individuals aged ≥ 65 years. We hypothesized that GS are very common in our study population of older individuals with chronic pain.

### Predictors of multiwave opioid use among older American adults [^1111F7vk]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Although recent public health recommendations generally discourage opioid prescription, and randomized controlled trials demonstrate that, in many cases, opioids provide no more pain relief than over-the-counter nonopioid analgesics, opioids remain a common treatment for pain. Opioid prescription rates have decreased since the mid-2000s, particularly after a widely publicized 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendation to reduce opioid prescription, but this decrease has been gradual and partial. Indeed, given the consistent rise in U.S. pain prevalence, physicians continue to prescribe opioids, and not only for acute pain. In 2018, 15% of Americans were prescribed opioid medications for pain, both acute and chronic.

Use of opioids for chronic pain may have unintended consequences. Long-term opioid use (or, interchangeably, long-term opioid therapy [L-TOT]) — characterized by consistent use lasting longer than 90 days — now describes prescribed use patterns for 5%–12.5% of Americans with moderate-to-severe chronic pain. Unfortunately, when opioids are taken for this length of time, individuals tend to develop tolerance, requiring larger doses and making it more likely that analgesic benefits will be outweighed by significant health costs. Individuals risk the possibility of overdose, further injury (e.g. bone fractures), and myocardial infarction. Long-term opioid therapy also increases the likelihood of unemployment and higher health care costs. For these reasons, L-TOT has received increasing attention and is specifically addressed in the 2022 update of the CDC's recommendation for opioid prescription. In particular, the agency recommends that physicians seek opportunities to taper patients off of opioids or otherwise mitigate the risks of L-TOT whenever possible.

### Pain management in older adults: prevention and treatment [^111196Uc]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2001). Low credibility.

The release of guidelines in 1998 by the American Geriatrics Society on "The Management of Chronic Pain in Older Persons" was a breakthrough in helping to manage pain in this population. Already advances have fostered a need to update recommendations. This article focuses on the treatment strategies available for seniors that are likely to help to fulfill the obligation to relieve pain and suffering in patients. A review was done of the literature using Medline and other search techniques. New pain scales have been developed with seniors in mind and greater testing of older scales in elderly populations have helped to identify measures of pain more suited to frail seniors. Advances in cyclooxygenase inhibition selectivity, alternative medicine, and progress in the identification of nonopioid pain receptors and the development of products to target them are just a few of changes that have altered the way clinicians think about treating pain. The use of hospice in end-of-life palliative care is a valuable resource for clinicians managing pain at that phase in care as well. Tools are available to prevent and treat pain successfully in seniors. Educating clinicians about available assessment tools, techniques and interventions may be the biggest challenge to comforting the older adult in pain.

### Prevalence and characteristics of chronic pain in the Chinese community-dwelling elderly: a cross-sectional study [^111akp7d]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The current study results showed that pain intensity did not increase with aging and decreased after 80 years of age. However, other studies have also found a decrease in pain prevalence with age up to 85 years, which may be related to the decreased perception of pain caused by sensory dysfunction in people over 80 years old.

This study found that elderly living with lower monthly incomes had a higher prevalence of chronic pain, confirmed by other studies. Socioeconomic factors have been associated with worse health outcomes, for those living in poverty, low incomes haunt each financial decision, and many are unable to consistently afford prescribed interventions such as medications and ongoing visits to health care providers to manage their health. Therefore, it is important for policymakers to pay more attention to the elderly population.

In our study, significant relationship between the prevalence of chronic pain and education level was not observed, which was inconsistent with previous studies that reported a lower level of education indicated a higher incidence of chronic pain. They believed that patients with low education level might delay the visit or treatment due to insufficient health awareness, who fail to treat chronic pain-related illnesses early. Therefore, the results of this study may imply that older people with higher education in western China still lack sufficient health awareness. However, another factor was that a higher prevalence of chronic pain was observed in elderly with a lower level of education, which may be associated with the wrong perception that chronic pain is due to low education levels rather than low socioeconomic status.

This study found that elderly living in rural areas had a lower prevalence of chronic pain, but the impact of residence location on chronic pain may be due to interaction of some other factors, which might be lifestyle, economic burden and health seeking behavior. The economic conditions in urban areas are better than those in rural areas in western China, however earlier findings have shown that older people living in poorer neighborhoods are more likely to suffer from chronic pain. The reason for this paradoxical result in this study might be because older people living in cities have a modern way of life, which is not healthier and leading to increased risk for kinds of chronic disease, including chronic pain. Studies have shown that the health care costs was higher in developed cities, which may lead to the lack of treatment for pain due to the heavy economic burden of disease treatment in some elderly people. In this study it was also found that the medication use rate in rural areas was higher than in urban areas among older adults with chronic pain.

### The prevalence of chronic pain in young adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113xbFSi]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Previous systematic reviews have summarized the prevalence and impact of chronic pain in "average" pediatric (ie, school-age children) and adult (ie, middle-aged individuals) age groups. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the prevalence of chronic pain in the subgroup of individuals who fall in between established boundaries of "childhood" and "adulthood"-known as young adulthood. The goal of this research was to meta-analyze prevalence data on pain in young adults based on available data published between 2008 and 2020. Searches were identified with MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. We included general population and university-based studies presenting prevalence estimates of chronic pain (pain lasting ≥ 3 months) in young adults. We identified 43 articles providing prevalence estimates across a combined population of 97,437 young adult respondents (age range: 15–34 years), with studies undertaken in 22 countries. Available data allowed for stratification of prevalence according to pain condition. The overall pooled random-effect prevalence rate of chronic pain in young adults was 11.6%, suggesting that 1 in every 9 young adults experience chronic pain worldwide. Prevalence rates varied considerably according to pain condition. Estimates did not vary according to sex, geographic location, and several study methodological characteristics (ie, population type, sampling area, sampling year, investigation period, and assessment method). Overall, young adult chronic pain is common and should be recognized as a major public health concern. Considering the difficulties young adults face accessing adult health care, greater attention is needed to develop transition programs and evidence-based treatments tailored to the unique needs of this age group.

### Musculoskeletal aging [^116a7fhS]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic conditions associated with musculoskeletal aging contribute to a heavy functional and economic burden for our rapidly aging population. The purpose of this article is to review recent investigations in musculoskeletal epidemiology related to aging.

Recent Findings

Well over half the older adults in the United States report chronic joint symptoms. With the projected growth of the older population in the next 25 years, the number of elders with arthritis is expected to double to 41 million. Accumulating evidence points to large ethnic and racial differences in the prevalence of arthritis. Primary care interventions to improve self-management of arthritis have been developed and tested, although further work in this area is warranted. Progress is being made in other major chronic conditions associated with aging. Research shows that optimal screening for osteoporotic fracture risk will require risk factor information in addition to bone densitometry. Recent findings shed new light on treatments for osteoporosis and musculoskeletal pain. A new field of study is investigating sarcopenia, or skeletal muscle loss, in very old populations. Research to date has uncovered evidence that this disabling condition may be the result of immunologic and hormonal changes related to aging.

Summary

Investigations in many areas are contributing to a better understanding of the major chronic conditions that affect the lives of many older adults. However, the surge in the elderly population will require far greater research and intervention efforts to postpone or prevent a huge population burden of disability related to common musculoskeletal problems of old age.

### To compare the effect and durability of the effect of corrective exercise and manual therapy focused on the back versus hip on disability, function, pressure pain, pain map, health and psychological status of the elderly with chronic back and hip pain: protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^115xJJUE]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Background and rationale

Back and hip pain are common issues among the elderly population, often attributed to various factors such as age-related degeneration, chronic conditions, lifestyle and injury. As people age, the spine undergoes degenerative changes such as the loss of elasticity in spinal discs, osteoarthritis and bone spurs. These changes can lead to conditions like degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis and facet joint osteoarthritis, resulting in back pain. Osteoarthritis is a common cause of hip pain in older adults. It occurs when the cartilage cushions the hip joint and wears down over time, leading to pain, stiffness and reduced range of motion. Lack of physical activity can contribute to muscle weakness, joint stiffness and reduced flexibility, exacerbating back and hip pain. Ageing can cause muscle mass and strength loss, particularly in the core and hip muscles. Weakness and imbalance can contribute to poor posture, altered gait mechanics and increased stress on the back and hip joints.

Back and hip pain management in the elderly often involves a multidisciplinary approach, including physical therapy and exercise programmes to strengthen muscles, improve flexibility and enhance balance. Manual therapy, including techniques such as massage, mobilisation and manipulation, can also effectively address back and hip pain in the elderly population. Manual therapy can be a valuable component of conservative management for back and hip pain in elderly patients, promoting pain relief, improved function and enhanced quality of life. Manual therapy for back pain in the elderly includes massage therapy, mobilisation and manipulation. At the same time, manual therapy for hip pain in the elderly includes soft tissue mobilisation, joint mobilisation and stretching and range of motion exercises. Hicks et al investigated whether tailored, hip-focused physical therapy improves pain and functional limitations in the elderly compared with non-tailored, spine-focused physical therapy. Their findings warrant further investigation before clinical implementation. Furthermore, with the best knowledge of the authors, there is a lack of studies investigating the effect and durability of the effect of corrective exercise and manual therapy focused on the back versus hip versus a combination of both these therapies on disability, function, pressure pain, pain map, health and psychological status of the elderly with chronic back and hip pain. The authors hypothesised that combining both these pain management programmes will have a better effect on improving disability, function, pressure pain, pain map, health and psychological status of the elderly with chronic back and hip pain.

### Comprehensive review of epidemiology, scope, and impact of spinal pain [^116y1EX6]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent pain interfering with daily activities is common. Chronic pain has been defined in many ways. Chronic pain syndrome is a separate entity from chronic pain. Chronic pain is defined as, "pain that persists 6 months after an injury and beyond the usual course of an acute disease or a reasonable time for a comparable injury to heal, that is associated with chronic pathologic processes that cause continuous or intermittent pain for months or years, that may continue in the presence or absence of demonstrable pathologies; may not be amenable to routine pain control methods; and healing may never occur". In contrast, chronic pain syndrome has been defined as a complex condition with physical, psychological, emotional, and social components. The prevalence of chronic pain in the adult population ranges from 2% to 40%, with a median point prevalence of 15%. Among chronic pain disorders, pain arising from various structures of the spine constitutes the majority of the problems. The lifetime prevalence of spinal pain has been reported as 54% to 80%. Studies of the prevalence of low back pain and neck pain and its impact in general have shown 23% of patients reporting Grade II to IV low back pain (high pain intensity with disability) versus 15% with neck pain. Further, age related prevalence of persistent pain appears to be much more common in the elderly associated with functional limitations and difficulty in performing daily life activities. Chronic persistent low back and neck pain is seen in 25% to 60% of patients, one-year or longer after the initial episode. Spinal pain is associated with significant economic, societal, and health impact. Estimates and patterns of productivity losses and direct health care expenditures among individuals with back and neck pain in the United States continue to escalate. Recent studies have shown significant increases in the prevalence of various pain problems including low back pain. Frequent use of opioids in managing chronic non-cancer pain has been a major issue for health care in the United States placing a significant strain on the economy with the majority of patients receiving opioids for chronic pain necessitating an increased production of opioids, and escalating costs of opioid use, even with normal intake. The additional costs of misuse, abuse, and addiction are enormous. Comorbidities including psychological and physical conditions and numerous other risk factors are common in spinal pain and add significant complexities to the interventionalist's clinical task. This section of the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP)/Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) guidelines evaluates the epidemiology, scope, and impact of spinal pain and its relevance to health care interventions.

### The assessment of pain in older people: UK national guidelines [^117XGuGn]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

USA

In 1998 the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) provided the first clinical practice guideline on the management of chronic pain in older people. This was updated in 2002. Both versions concentrated on the assessment of pain and its pharmacological management.

The guidelines put forward by the AGS are divided into four sections. These include: the assessment of persistent pain, pharmacologic treatment, non-pharmacologic strategies, and recommendations for health systems that care for older persons. For each section, general principles are followed by the panel's specific recommendations for improving the clinical assessment and management of persistent pain in older persons. These recommendations are meant to serve as a guide to practice and should not be used in lieu of critical thinking, sound judgment, and clinical experience.

The guidelines produced in 2002 by the AGS were subsequently revised in 2009 by an expert panel assembled under the auspices of the American Geriatrics Society, with recommendations for pharmacologic management of pain in older adults. It was determined that the sections of the 2002 guideline dealing with assessment and non-pharmacologic treatment did not need updating and were still relevant to today's practicing clinicians. However, another guideline was developed describing medications to avoid and dosing modifications for older adults with poor renal clearance. The American Society for Pain Management Nursing Task Force on Pain Assessment in the Nonverbal Patient (including individuals with dementia) also recommended a comprehensive, hierarchical approach that integrates self-report and observations of pain behaviours.

Guidelines created by an expert group convened by the American Pain Society and the American Academy of Pain Medicine evaluated the current evidence on safe practices for the use of opioids to treat non-cancer pain. Notably, comprehensive approaches were recommended to address psychosocial factors and functional impairment as well as pain. Specific recommendations for older patients include low-dose initiation and slow titration of opioid therapy, constipation prophylaxis and frequent monitoring of patient responses to therapy. These guidelines provide some of the landmark principles for pain treatment decisions and care of older adults today. Current guidelines in relation to general principles of pharmacological pain management for older people state:
Use the least invasive route for medication
Where possible, choose sustained release formulations
Introduce one agent at a time, at a low dose, followed by slow dose-titration
Allow a sufficiently large interval between introducing drugs to allow assessment of the effect
Treatment should be constantly monitored and adjusted if required to improve efficacy and limit adverse events
It may be necessary to switch opioids.

### Chronic pain in European adult populations: a systematic review of prevalence and associated clinical features [^1117xFr5]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Chronic pain (CP) is a multifaceted and severely disabling persistent condition that affects individuals worldwide. A synthesis of epidemiological data is still lacking. The present systematic review aims at presenting point, period, and lifetime prevalence estimates of CP in the European adult population, as well as relevant features associated with it. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane library was run from inception to May 2024, resulting in 39,832 hits. Among those, 132 full-text articles were assessed, and 23 studies comprising 862,013 participants with CP were included. The Joanna Biggs Institutes' Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data (JBI) was used for quality assessment. Findings showed a point prevalence ranging from 12% to 48%, a 6-month prevalence of 17.5% to 49.8%, a 12-month prevalence ranging from 8.1% to 44.6%, and a lifetime prevalence ranging from 12.7% to 33.7% independently from sex. Sociodemographic factors (eg, female sex, higher age, no partnership, lower education, unemployment) and clinical features (eg, medical diseases, mental disorders and burdens, healthcare utilization, functional impairment) were identified as being associated with CP. The variability in prevalence estimates can be reduced by applying consistent diagnostic criteria (eg, ICD-11) and by using standardized assessment tools (eg, scales, clinical interview). The high prevalence and the characteristics of the associated features support the need for adequate, multicomponent care paths to manage CP based on a comprehensive biopsychosocial model.

### Caring for patients with pain during the COVID-19 pandemic: consensus recommendations from an international expert panel [^115drERx]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain causes significant suffering, limitation of daily activities and reduced quality of life. Infection from COVID-19 is responsible for an ongoing pandemic that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, leading to systemic complications and death. Led by the World Health Organization, healthcare systems across the world are engaged in limiting the spread of infection. As a result, all elective surgical procedures, outpatient procedures and patient visits, including pain management services, have been postponed or cancelled. This has affected the care of chronic pain patients. Most are elderly with multiple comorbidities, which puts them at risk of COVID-19 infection. Important considerations that need to be recognised during this pandemic for chronic pain patients include: ensuring continuity of care and pain medications, especially opioids; use of telemedicine; maintaining biopsychosocial management; use of anti-inflammatory drugs; use of steroids; and prioritising necessary procedural visits. There are no guidelines to inform physicians and healthcare providers engaged in caring for patients with pain during this period of crisis. We assembled an expert panel of pain physicians, psychologists and researchers from North America and Europe to formulate recommendations to guide practice. As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve rapidly, these recommendations are based on the best available evidence and expert opinion at this present time and may need adapting to local workplace policies.

### Prevalence and relevance of pain in older persons [^117UZ9hi]. Pain Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Setting

With the ageing of the world's population, any health problem which adversely affects quality of life in older persons becomes increasingly salient. Persistent pain is one of the most prevalent health conditions faced by adults of advanced age, and is recognized as a major concern for this segment of the population.

Results

Numerous epidemiologic surveys suggest that pain is most common during the late middle-aged phase of life (55–65 years) and continues at approximately the same prevalence into older age (65+). This is true regardless of the anatomical site or the pathogenic cause of pain. The one exception appears to be pain associated with degenerative joint disease (e.g., osteoarthritis) which shows an exponential increase until at least 90 years of age. Common age associated conditions like dementia may result in a reduced frequency and intensity of pain. Daily pain is a major risk factor for developing disability and the oldest age cohorts are most vulnerable. Discretionary and higher order physical activities appear most affected, while basic activities of daily living may be modified but are rarely ceased altogether. Similar relationships have been documented for risk of depression and mood disturbance in older persons with persistent pain. Despite such well characterized adverse impacts, pain often remains poorly treated in older persons. This occurs across all health care settings examined (i.e., emergency, acute, outpatient, long-term care).

Conclusion

Improved knowledge for both health professionals and patients, addressing the current research gaps and expansion of age-appropriate pain management services will be required to better meet the needs of our rapidly ageing population.

### Are chronic pain patients with dementia being undermedicated? [^111pDfsv]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In dementia, neuropathological changes alter the perception and expression of pain. For clinicians and family members, this knowledge gap leads to difficulties in recognizing and assessing chronic pain, which may consequently result in persons with dementia receiving lower levels of pain medication compared to those without cognitive impairment. Although this situation seems to have improved in recent years, considerable geographical variation persists. Over the last decade, opioid use has received global attention as a result of overuse and the risk of addiction, while the literature on older persons with dementia actually suggests undertreatment. This review stresses the importance of reliable assessment and the regular evaluation and monitoring of symptoms in persons with dementia. Based on current evidence, we concluded that chronic pain is still undertreated in dementia.

### Chronic pain among adults-United States, 2019–2021 [^115a6RxM]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Consistent with the population research objectives of the National Pain Strategy to provide more precise estimates of pain among various population groups, this study provides updated estimates of the prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain and highlights disparities in the prevalence of pain among certain populations. These findings can guide policymakers, clinicians, and researchers in future research examining the underlying reasons for disparities and in the development of tailored interventions and strategies addressing chronic pain in the United States.

### Pain assessment in elderly adults with dementia [^113HuYCQ]. The Lancet: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain is highly prevalent in the ageing population. Individuals with neurological disorders such as dementia are susceptible patient groups in which pain is frequently under-recognised, underestimated, and undertreated. Results from neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies showing that elderly adults are particularly susceptible to the negative effects of pain are of additional concern. The inability to successfully communicate pain in severe dementia is a major barrier to effective treatment. The systematic study of facial expressions through a computerised system has identified core features that are highly specific to the experience of pain, with potential future effects on assessment practices in people with dementia. Various observational-behavioural pain assessment instruments have been reported to be both reliable and valid in individuals with dementia. These techniques need to be interpreted in the context of observer bias, contextual variables, and the overall state of the individual's health and wellbeing.

### APA clinical practice guideline for psychological and other nonpharmacological treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults [^112M88ax]. APA (2024). High credibility.

Executive summary — background — chronic pain is characterized as among the most prevalent, disabling, and costly conditions, and chronic musculoskeletal pain is described as the most common among chronic pain conditions and one of the most frequent reasons individuals seek health care; the heterogeneity of pain experiences highlights the importance of taking an individualized, person-centered approach to treatment that considers how systemic factors and personal background characteristics shape care and create a pathway to maximize outcomes; given the public health significance of chronic musculoskeletal pain, it is imperative to have guidance on evidence-based options, and the guideline strives to provide comprehensive, evidence-based information within the scope of the systematic reviews used to providers, patients and their families, and the broad public.

### Chronic pain and geriatric syndromes in community-dwelling patients aged ≥ 65 years [^113NQBWh]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In growing elderly populations, there is a heavy burden of comorbidity and a high rate of geriatric syndromes (GS) including chronic pain.

Purpose

To assess the prevalence of chronic pain among individuals aged ≥ 65 years in the Southern District of Israel and to evaluate associations between chronic pain and other GS.

Methods

A telephone interview was conducted on a sample of older adults who live in the community. The interview included the Brief Pain Inventory and a questionnaire on common geriatric problems.

Results

Of 419 elderly individuals who agreed to be interviewed 232 (55.2%) suffered from chronic pain. Of those who reported chronic pain, 136 participants (68.6%) noted that they had very severe or unbearable pain. There were statistically significant associations between the pain itself and decline in patient's functional status, increased falls, reduced mood, and cognitive decline.

Conclusion

The results of this study show that chronic pain is very common in older adults and that it is associated with other GS. There is a need to increase awareness of chronic pain in older adults and to emphasize the important role that it plays in their care.

### A systematic review of the evidence for the efficacy of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain in community-dwelling older adults [^111jpwaJ]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

the ageing global population and concomitant increase in the use of opioid analgesia have highlighted the need to evaluate the effectiveness of opioids for chronic pain in older people.

Methods

a systematic review of the evidence for the efficacy of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain in community-dwelling people aged 65 years or more was conducted using PRISMA guidelines. The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Pubmed and PsychINFO were searched. The quality of studies was assessed. Secondary aims were to assess correlates of opioid use and the decision-making processes of prescribers.

Results

seven studies were identified of low to high quality. The majority of older people experienced ongoing pain despite continuing opioid therapy. There were mixed results regarding benefits of opioids in terms of activities of daily living and social engagement. In nursing home residents, opioid use at baseline was associated with severe pain, severe impairment in activities of daily living and a diagnosis of depression. Fear of causing harm to older people was common amongst opioid prescribers, limiting prescription. Facilitators of opioid prescription included educational interventions and access to an evidence base for opioid use.

Conclusion

there is limited evidence supporting the use of long-term opioid use in older people for chronic non-cancer pain and a lack of trials in this age group. Age-specific guidelines are required addressing initial assessment, indications, monitoring and de-prescribing.

### Special issues in the management of chronic pain in older adults [^115uhRiF]. Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Pain syndromes are prevalent among older individuals and generally increase in incidence as the population ages. Yet, pain often is undertreated in older patients, sometimes due to difficulties in assessing pain intensity and the effectiveness of treatment in the context of age-related cognitive impairment and physiologic changes. As a result, older patients with chronic pain conditions are more likely to experience greater functional limitations and decreased quality of life due to these and other barriers to appropriate care. This article discusses the epidemiology, assessment, and management of pain in older adults, and reviews special issues in the treatment of this population, such as adverse effects due to changes in drug metabolism and drug-drug interactions.

### Estimated rates of incident and persistent chronic pain among US adults, 2019–2020 [^116QHg4J]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Chronic pain risk and prognosis estimates are needed to inform effective interventions.

Objective

To estimate rates of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) incidence and persistence in US adults across demographic groups.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study examined a nationally representative cohort with 1 year of follow-up (mean[SD], 1.3 [0.3] years). Data from the 2019–2020 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Longitudinal Cohort were used to assess the incidence rates of chronic pain across demographic groups. The cohort was created using random cluster probability sampling of noninstitutionalized civilian US adults 18 years or older in 2019. Of 21 161 baseline participants in the 2019 NHIS who were randomly chosen for follow-up, 1746 were excluded due to proxy response(s) or lack of contact information, and 334 were deceased or institutionalized. Of the 19 081 remaining, the final analytic sample of 10 415 adults also participated in the 2020 NHIS. Data were analyzed from January 2022 to March 2023.

Exposures

Self-reported baseline sex, race, ethnicity, age, and college attainment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were the incidence rates of chronic pain and HICP, and secondary outcomes were the demographic characteristics and rates across demographic groups. A validated measure of pain status ("In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?") yielded 3 discrete categories each year: pain free, nonchronic pain, or chronic pain (pain "most days" or "every day"). Chronic pain present in both survey years was considered persistent; HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day. Rates were reported per 1000 person-years (PY) of follow-up, and age standardized based on the 2010 US adult population.

Results

Among 10 415 participants included in the analytic sample, 51.7% (95% CI, 50.3%-53.1%) were female, 54.0% (95% CI, 52.4%-55.5%) were aged 18 to 49 years, 72.6% (95% CI, 70.7%-74.6%) were White, 84.5% (95% CI, 81.6%-85.3%) were non-Hispanic or non-Latino, and 70.5% (95% CI, 69.1%-71.9%) were not college graduates. Among pain-free adults in 2019, incidence rates of chronic pain and HICP in 2020 were 52.4 (95% CI, 44.9–59.9) and 12.0 (95% CI, 8.2–15.8) cases per 1000 PY, respectively. The rates of persistent chronic pain and persistent HICP in 2020 were 462.0 (95% CI, 439.7–484.3) and 361.2 (95% CI, 265.6–456.8) cases per 1000 PY, respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, the incidence of chronic pain was high compared with other chronic diseases. These results emphasize the high disease burden of chronic pain in the US adult population and the need for early management of pain before it becomes chronic.

### Prescription opioids among older adults: ten years of data across five countries [^113jv5Ap]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain is a common symptom among community-dwelling people aged 65 or older, and can have a major impact on function, quality of life, and risk of disability in later life. Pharmacotherapy is one of the most frequently applied forms of pain management, as approximately half of older adults report daily or as-needed analgesic use. However, there have been many changes to how the notion and the role of analgesics in pain treatment is perceived in the last two decades, and many treatment guidelines now emphasise non-pharmacological treatment, especially for chronic non-cancer pain. Although paracetamol is recommended as the first-line drug, opioids play an important and symbolic part in this field. In severe cancer pain and end-of-life pain opioids hold a quintessential role; for moderate-to-severe pain they are recommended to be prescribed for carefully selected and monitored older patients. Overall, pain treatment guidelines emphasise individual evaluation and caution when prescribing opioids, as older adults are susceptible to opioid-related adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. Opioids increase the risk for severe adverse events, such as delirium, falls, and fractures, but also to the development of addiction, misuse, and consequent mortality. The North American opioid epidemic has also influenced prescribing guidelines in Europe, and prescribing opioids for people over 65 has moved under closer inspection recently. In addition, the cardiovascular risks associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have changed the patterns of use of non-opioid analgesics, which may increase the need for opioid analgesia.

### Estimated rates of incident and persistent chronic pain among US adults, 2019–2020 [^117T1r4C]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Epidemiological research on chronic pain (pain lasting ≥ 3 months) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) (chronic pain associated with substantial restrictions in life activities, including work, social, and self-care activities) in the US has increased substantially since the release of the Institute of Medicine (currently the National Academy of Medicine) report on pain in 2011and the Department of Health and Human Services National Pain Strategy (NPS) in 2016. These documents emphasized the need for epidemiological studies of pain in the US population, particularly in subpopulations that may be susceptible to the underreporting and/or undermanagement of pain. Since these publications, numerous nationally representative studies of US adults have described chronic pain and HICP prevalence, which varied depending on the operationalization of chronic pain and the survey year. Far less is understood regarding the incidence of chronic pain in US adults because few longitudinal population-based studies contain high-quality information on pain. Current knowledge of chronic pain incidence in the US is limited to specific communities or groups or health care professionals, and/or specific age ranges, and/or specific pain locations or conditions, and/or claims data or medical records. Of these, a minority of studies, have presented incidence rates (IRs), defined as the number of new cases of chronic pain per person per year (ie, person-years [PY]) of follow-up among persons without chronic pain at baseline. Compared with cumulative incidence proportions, IRs more adequately account for the time at risk of developing an outcome that may occur in study participants during follow-up. We have not found any studies to date examining chronic pain incidence in a nationally representative sample of all adults.

In addition to identifying the IRs of pain in all adults, we used data from the 2019–2020 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Longitudinal Cohort (NHIS-LC) to determine the IRs of chronic pain across demographic groups to refine our understanding of populations with an increased risk of chronic pain, a goal consistent with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Healthy People 2030 pain objectives. This study responded directly to the Institute of Medicine and NPS calls for improved national surveillance of chronic pain incidence to aid in the identification of subpopulations for whom early interventions may potentially prevent chronic pain onset and related disability.

### Pain management in frail, community-living elderly patients… [^116rd7jz]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of the 1341 patients with daily pain according to the 3-level ladder of the World Health Organization. Level 1 includes nonnarcotic analgesics; level 2, weak opiates; and level 3, morphine and potent opiates. The 3 levels are described in detail in the "Assessment of Pain and Analgesia" subsection of the "Subjects and Methods" section. Patients are grouped by age. Conclusions Daily pain is prevalent among frail elderly patients living in the community and is often untreated, particularly among older and demented patients. We collected data about use of analgesics, directly from general practitioners.

Analgesics were classified into 3 different groups according to the WHO 3-step ladder, 4 including nonopioids, weak opioids, and strong opioids. To identify predictors of analgesic use, we selected a sample of patients with daily pain and constructed a multiple logistic regression model, with use of analgesics as the dependent variable of interest. Potential predictors included age, sex, functional and cognitive status, and comorbidity. These were adjusted for confounding by a number of possible contraindications to pharmaceutical treatment. Table 2 shows predictors of analgesic use among persons with daily pain. Patients 85 years or older were less likely to receive analgesics, compared with the younger patients. This association remained significant in a multivariable model adjusting for several variables, including sex, functional and cognitive status, indicators of disease severity, and possible contraindications to analgesic use. Elderly subjects and patients with cognitive impairment may receive inadequate analgesia in part due to an underestimation and underreporting of pain. However, the observation that older and demented persons were at greater risk for undertreatment is especially concerning, since it has been documented in previous studies. 10, 16, 17.

### Prevalence and characteristics of chronic pain in the Chinese community-dwelling elderly: a cross-sectional study [^114Qf4nN]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain is also a major health problem in China as the country possesses the largest elderly population in the world. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the proportion of people aged 60 years and above had reached 16% in 2015. Thus, researchers have conducted studies to investigate the prevalence of chronic pain in the Chinese elderly population. Xue, Chu investigated the prevalence of chronic pain in the elderly in those aged 80 years and above in four provinces in China, and found that 76.4% of participants suffered from chronic pain. Moreover, Wang, Xu conducted a survey in elderly inpatients and reported that 55.5% of elderly inpatients had chronic pain. Accordingly, studies focusing on community-dwelling elderly mainly reported the prevalence of chronic pain rather than on characteristics like interference with daily life, health-seeking behaviors or conditions of medication use among the corresponding elderly. The aforementioned studies focused on specific subpopulations or prevalence of chronic pain that had limited insights into chronic pain. Therefore, getting a deeper insight into chronic pain, including its prevalence, characteristics, pain-related health-seeking behaviors in community-dwelling elderly are crucial for policymaking and chronic pain management.

Objectives

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, characteristics and pain-related health-seeking behaviors in the Chinese community-dwelling elderly.

### The assessment of pain in older people: UK national guidelines [^112LBSjp]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

We published national guidance on pain assessment in the older population in 2007. The purpose of the original version of this document was to focus on the assessment of pain in older people (aged 65 years of age and above) in chronic pain. These new guidelines seek to build upon the original guidelines and to add some new areas of interest which seem to be emerging from the literature, such as the role of interpersonal interaction. It is interesting that things have moved on since our original publication and the recommendations herein are different from those made in 2007.

### Older and better: a narrative review of successful aging and adaptation to pain in late life [^116GdZu6]. Pain Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

"Invariably, the self-assessed QoL was far better than I, as a physician, would have anticipated from the diseases and disabilities that you reported". -Ben Eiseman, MD, based on a survey of his octogenarian Yale University classmates.

Background

Chronic pain control is a high priority for the elderly; it is one of the most frequently encountered medical problems in this group. Chronic pain affects 60%-75% of people aged 65 years and older. Chronic pain's prevalence is even higher in those living in assisted living or nursing homes. Based on epidemiological data, the prevalence of chronic pain is directly proportional to age and is especially so in women. At least one in 3 patients over age 65 report significant ongoing pain that is often inadequately treated. Despite this high prevalence of chronic pain in older persons, aging research sheds light on how this suffering may be reduced. Healthy aging is not an oxymoron. Successful aging and adaptation to chronic pain involve similar medical, temperamental, behavioral, and cultural factors. Older patients with chronic pain face well-documented cultural bias, fear, and clinical pessimism; but adaptive coping is a realistic expectation.

Objectives

This narrative review aims to summarize the available literature on strategies used by older persons to optimize adaptation to late-life pain.

Study Design

This is a narrative review of a PubMed literature search 1947 to March 4, 2024.

Methods

A PubMed literature search covering years 1947 to March 4, 2024 was performed using permutations of the search terms pain, chronic pain, persistent pain, aging, elderly, and coping. Relevant articles were also obtained from careful review of the references in articles identified in the search.

Results

I summarized the available literature on strategies used by older persons to optimize adaptation to late-life pain. There are distinct differences between older persons and younger persons in the strategies they use to cope with chronic pain. Furthermore, I identified significant overlap between strategies and actions used by older persons to cope with pain and those strategies and actions used to successfully adapt to the aging process; these commonalities demonstrate a linkage of these adjustment processes and have clinical utility. Also presented are 2 cases that demonstrate the relevance of these factors for treating elderly patients with chronic pain.

Limitations

The literature search was limited to PubMed, which excluded psychology databases.

Conclusions

Chronic pain is common in the elderly and is not adequately treated. Data indicate that older persons can benefit from guidance toward distinct attitudes and actions they can employ to cope with persistent pain. Epidemiologic and aging literature describe attitudes and behaviors that facilitate health and wellbeing during aging. Data from gerontology and from research on chronic pain in elderly patients converge upon factors that are common to better adaptation to both aging and late-life pain. I describe these common factors, which I categorize as treatment-factors, traits, attitudes, and actions. Two cases are presented to demonstrate these concepts.

### Sarcopenia and chronic pain in the elderly: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117TTSGs]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our systematic review and meta-analysis provided evidence that the prevalence of sarcopenia is significantly higher in older adults with chronic pain compared to those without pain. There was also a significant positive correlation between chronic pain and an increased risk of sarcopenia. Additionally, pain in the low back or lower limbs, which can affect the mobility of older adults, was found to be associated with a higher likelihood of developing sarcopenia. However, the pathogenesis underlying the relationship between chronic pain and sarcopenia in older adults remains unknown. Several possible mechanisms have been proposed, including reduced activity and chronic inflammation, but these require further investigation through large-scale clinical studies in the future.

### Improving the pharmacologic management of pain in older adults: identifying the research gaps and methods to address them [^112pqUQa]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

There has been a growing recognition of the need for better pharmacologic management of chronic pain among older adults. To address this need, the National Institutes of Health Pain Consortium sponsored an "Expert Panel Discussion on the Pharmacological Management of Chronic Pain in Older Adults" conference in September 2010 to identify research gaps and strategies to address them. Specific emphasis was placed on ascertaining gaps regarding use of opioid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications because of continued uncertainties regarding their risks and benefits.

Design

Eighteen panel members provided oral presentations; each was followed by a multidisciplinary panel discussion. Meeting transcripts and panelists' slide presentations were reviewed to identify the gaps and the types of studies and research methods panelists suggested could best address them.

Results

Fifteen gaps were identified in the areas of treatment (e.g., uncertainty regarding the long-term safety and efficacy of commonly prescribed analgesics), epidemiology (e.g., lack of knowledge regarding the course of common pain syndromes), and implementation (e.g., limited understanding of optimal strategies to translate evidence-based pain treatments into practice). Analyses of data from electronic health care databases, observational cohort studies, and ongoing cohort studies (augmented with pain and other relevant outcomes measures) were felt to be practical methods for building an age-appropriate evidence base to improve the pharmacologic management of pain in later life.

Conclusion

Addressing the gaps presented in the current report was judged by the panel to have substantial potential to improve the health and well-being of older adults with chronic pain.

### Chronic pain management in older adults: special considerations [^117VbP1E]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2009). Low credibility.

The rising prevalence of neuropathic pain and the multifaceted sequelae of pain particularly within older adults are part of the increasing challenges in providing good geriatric pain management. Aging can lead to a higher sensitivity to pain within older adults, whereas physiological changes modify the absorption, bioavailability, and transit time of pharmaceutical agents. Ultimately, these differences within older adults require clinicians treating them to provide individually tailored analgesic approaches. Progressive age increases the variance in physiology among people; thus, the management approach should reflect an individual's unique requirements and limitations based on findings at the time of assessment.

### Overview of persistent pain in older adults [^113tTPgA]. The American Psychologist (2014). Low credibility.

With the shifting age demographics of the U.S. population, more psychologists will be asked to provide clinical services to older adults. Given the high prevalence of persistent pain in aging, in many cases this will mean providing empirically supported interventions for pain and the interference it creates. The purpose of this review is to provide a broad overview of the scope and impact of persistent pain in older people and to discuss mechanisms by which persistent geriatric pain can lead to suffering and disability. We consider the unique context of pain in older adulthood and review differences between older and younger people in terms of pain perception, the social network, beliefs about pain, pain-related coping, and adherence to pain medication. Finally, we discuss special issues affecting pain management in older adults, including dementia, polypharmacy, and barriers to accessing adequate pain care. This review also highlights a need for greater provider training in pain management to meet the needs of a changing U.S. population.

### Global pain and aging: a cross-sectional study on age differences in the intensity of chronic pain among middle-aged and older adults in 20 countries [^117VWDHy]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aims to examine age differences in the intensity of chronic pain among middle-aged and older adults, where intensity is measured on a scale differentiating between chronic pain that is often troubling and likely requires intervention versus more endurable sensations. We aim to explore whether individual health and national gross domestic product (GDP) explain these differences as well.

Methods

Cross-nationally harmonized data from 20 countries on self-reported intensity of chronic pain (0 = no, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) in 104,826 individuals aged 50+ observed in 2012–2013. Two-level hierarchical ordinal linear models with individuals nested within countries were used to isolate estimations from heterogeneity explained by methodological differences across single-country studies.

Results

Overall, mean participant age was 66.9 (SD = 9.9), 56.1% were women, and 41.9% of respondents reported any chronic pain. Chronic pain intensity rose sharply with age in some countries (e.g. Korea and Slovenia), but this association waned or reversed in other countries (e.g., the United States and Denmark). Cross-country variation and age differences in chronic pain were partly explained (85.5% and 35.8%, respectively) by individual-level health (especially arthritis), country-level wealth (as indicated by GDP per capita), and demographics.

Discussion

Chronic pain intensity is not an inevitable consequence of chronological age, but the consequence of potential selection effects and lower activity levels combined with individual-level health and country-level wealth. Our findings suggest further investigation of health conditions and country affluence settings as potential targets of medical and policy interventions aiming to prevent, reduce, or manage chronic pain among older patients and aging populations.

### Estimated rates of incident and persistent chronic pain among US adults, 2019–2020 [^111JbDcf]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

All of the aforementioned differences in rates were confirmed in adjusted regression analyses. For instance, regardless of baseline pain status, those 50 years or older had a higher risk of chronic pain compared with those aged 18 to 49 years (no reported pain at baseline: adjusted RR [ARR], 1.49 [95% CI, 1.11–2.02]; nonchronic pain at baseline: ARR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.24–1.84]; and chronic pain at baseline: ARR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.17–1.43]). Among those with baseline nonchronic or chronic pain, those without a college degree had a higher risk of chronic pain compared with those with a college degree (nonchronic pain at baseline: ARR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.15–1.71]; chronic pain at baseline: ARR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.07–1.28]).

### Prevalence and characteristics of chronic pain in the Chinese community-dwelling elderly: a cross-sectional study [^114CkWjZ]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pain adversely affects health and daily life in the elderly. Gaining insight into chronic pain that affects the community-dwelling elderly is crucial for pain management in China, which possesses the largest elderly population in the world.

Methods

This is a cross-sectional design study that followed the STROBE Guideline. A randomized cluster sampling method was used to recruit participants in the Sichuan Province from Dec 2018 to May 2019. In addition, face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect socio-demographic data, characteristics and health-seeking behaviors of chronic pain through a self-designed questionnaire.

Results

A total of 1381 older adults participated in this study. Among these participants, 791 (57.3%) had chronic pain. Here, prevalence and pain intensity were both found to increase from the 60–69 group to the 70–79 group, which then decreased in the ≥ 80 group with no significant differences in sex (p > 0.05). The most common pain locations were observed in the legs/feet (53.5%), head (23.6) and abdomen/pelvis (21.1%). Among the elderly suffering from chronic pain, 29.4% sought medical help, 59.2% received medication and 59.7% adopted non-drug therapy.

Conclusion

Chronic pain is a common health concern in the Chinese community-dwelling elderly, which possesses different characteristics than other countries' populations. Therefore, easier access to medication assistance and provision of scientific guidance for non-drug therapy may serve as satisfactory approaches in improving pain management.

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^1176E8QT]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

How common is chronic pain?

Limited data, differing definitions of chronic pain, data collection and reporting methods and differences in the prevalence of contributing factors (eg, psychological trauma, socioeconomic status and interpersonal violence) between countries pose significant challenges to estimating the global prevalence of chronic pain. However, depending on the definition, it is estimated that 25–30% of the world's adult population will suffer from chronic pain during their lifetime. In general, the prevalence is higher among women, older individuals and those with mental stresses, depression and anxiety. In a considerable proportion of those with chronic pain, the etiology is uncertain (Box 1). Although the prevalence of neuropathic pain is usually reported to be lower (approximately 5–10%), pathologic changes in the peripheral and central nervous systems play a major role in chronic pain, either alone or in combination with other pain states (mixed pain), and, where the etiology is uncertain, central sensitization is an important focus of treatment.

### Herpes zoster: epidemiology, natural history, and common complications [^114xRcRe]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster is a disease associated with aging that can significantly impair quality of life for affected individuals. Anyone infected with varicella (chickenpox) virus in childhood is at risk for reactivation of dormant virus and the onset of zoster disease, although it occurs with increasing frequency in the elderly as a result of waning of cell-mediated immunity. The most common complication of herpes zoster is postherpetic neuralgia, which can cause chronic and debilitating pain. Current treatments can decrease the severity of zoster rash and pain but cannot prevent disease onset or completely eliminate the most frequent symptoms. The zoster vaccine may help prevent the onset of herpes zoster in the target population of those age 60 years and older. This summary reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, natural history, and common symptoms of zoster disease.

### Introduction to special issue: translational research on pain and pain management in later life [^114NkB4u]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Medium credibility.

Next Steps

The articles in this special issue point to the promise and challenge of translational research on pain. They shed light on potential short- and long-term consequences of pain, new approaches to measurement, as well as promising nonpharmacological interventions for its management. A critical need, however, is to link these areas of inquiry, moving from the production of basic knowledge about pain to evidence-based approaches to prevention and treatment. Creating a more seamless translational pipeline requires innovative approaches to stakeholder involvement, so that interventions have immediate real-world relevance. Given the continued growth in the older population, and the tremendous amount of suffering generated by untreated or undertreated pain, fostering collaboration among researchers, practitioners, and affected older people themselves should be a top priority for the field.

### Chronic pain and geriatric syndromes in community-dwelling patients aged ≥ 65 years [^114Ey991]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In a random study of individuals aged ≥ 65 years living in the community, we found a high rate of chronic pain and GS as well as an association between them. There is a need for further studies to investigate these issues in depth, using accepted geriatric instruments for the determination of GS. This will facilitate more optimal care for the elderly population.

### A prospective study of chronic postsurgical pain in elderly patients: incidence, characteristics and risk factors [^113jmfUV]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

We found that majority of the CPSP patients experienced mild rest pain, and no patients underwent severe rest pain. Moderate-to-severe movement pain was common at 3 months after surgery, and then decreased obviously at 6 months. The intensity of the chronic pain in our study was comparable to other research. However, comparison between literatures should be conducted cautiously due to the adoption of different pain assessment tools.

Chronic pain in the elderly could result in greater postoperative functional disability and poorer quality of life. Herrick et al. showed that moderate-to-severe pain was associated with difficulty in ADL 3 months after hip fracture repair in elderly patients. Our study shows that the elderly patients who described pain had more restrictions in daily life activities as compared to the individuals who described no chronic pain. Negative impacts of CPSP on ADL were apparent in mood in patients suffered from CPSP. This exemplifies the consequences of chronic pain in mental well-being of this population.

The CPSP development is believe to be relevant to neuropathic mechanism involving nerves damage during surgery, and as well as neuroplastic changes after injury. Redistribution of the voltage-gated sodium channel subtype in nociceptors expressing neuropathic physiology and microglial activation in the ipsilateral dorsal horn of the spinal cord occur at the cellular and tissue levels following nerve injury. These changes facilitate the development of persistent pain as they provoke long-term changes including altered gene expression in the dorsal root ganglia and the spinal cord, central sensitization, and trans-synaptic neurodegeneration. Few studies investigated the epidemiology of neuropathic pain following surgery in elderly individuals. In this study, the rate of CPSP with neuropathic component was lower than those reported in studies in young adult and pediatric patients, although direct comparisons are not possible because of difference in patient characteristics. The protective impact of aging on the occurrence of neuropathic pain has been indicated in animal experiment, and the possible mechanisms include thickness of nerve sheath, nerve injury, and weaker glial activation.

### Assessment of patients with chronic pain [^112HK8HM]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic pain is a public health concern affecting 20–30% of the population of Western countries. Although there have been many scientific advances in the understanding of the neurophysiology of pain, precisely assessing and diagnosing a patient's chronic pain problem is not straightforward or well-defined. How chronic pain is conceptualized influences how pain is evaluated and the factors considered when making a chronic pain diagnosis. There is no one-to-one relationship between the amount or type of organic pathology and pain intensity, but instead, the chronic pain experience is shaped by a myriad of biomedical, psychosocial (e.g. patients' beliefs, expectations, and mood), and behavioural factors (e.g. context, responses by significant others). Assessing each of these three domains through a comprehensive evaluation of the person with chronic pain is essential for treatment decisions and to facilitate optimal outcomes. This evaluation should include a thorough patient history and medical evaluation and a brief screening interview where the patient's behaviour can be observed. Further assessment to address questions identified during the initial evaluation will guide decisions as to what additional assessments, if any, may be appropriate. Standardized self-reported instruments to evaluate the patient's pain intensity, functional abilities, beliefs and expectations, and emotional distress are available, and can be administered by the physician, or a referral for in depth evaluation can be made to assist in treatment planning.

### Outcomes associated with opioid use in the treatment of chronic noncancer pain in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1164w8yv]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2010). Low credibility.

This systematic review summarizes existing evidence regarding the efficacy, safety, and abuse and misuse potential of opioids as treatment for chronic noncancer pain in older adults. Multiple databases were searched to identify relevant studies published in English (1/1/80–7/1/09) with a mean study population age of 60 and older. Forty-three articles were identified and retained for review (40 reported safety and efficacy data, the remaining 3 reported misuse or abuse outcome data). The weighted mean subject age was 64.1 (mean age range 60–73). Studies enrolled patients with osteoarthritis (70%), neuropathic pain (13%), and other pain-producing disorders (17%). The mean duration of treatment studies was 4 weeks (range 1.5–156 weeks), and only five (12%) lasted longer than 12 weeks. In meta-analyses, effect sizes were -0.557 (P < .001) for pain reduction, -0.432 (P < .001) for physical disability reduction, and 0.859 (P = 0.31) for improved sleep. The effect size for the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Health Survey was 0.191 (P = 0.17) for the physical component score and -0.220 (P = 0.04) for the mental component score. Adults aged 65 and older were as likely as those younger than 65 to benefit from treatment. Common adverse events included constipation (median frequency of occurrence 30%), nausea (28%), and dizziness (22%) and prompted opioid discontinuation in 25% of cases. Abuse and misuse behaviors were negatively associated with older age. In older adults with chronic pain and no significant comorbidity, short-term use of opioids is associated with reduction in pain intensity and better physical functioning but poorer mental health functioning. The long-term safety, efficacy, and abuse potential of this treatment practice in diverse populations of older persons remain to be determined.

### Acceptability, values, and preferences of older people for chronic low back pain management; a qualitative evidence synthesis [^114mX8fj]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

In response to this context and the priority to support healthy ageing, the World Health Organization (WHO) initiated the development of standard clinical guideline for the non-surgical management of chronic primary LBP (CPLBP) in adults, including older people, in primary and community care settings in 2020. The guidelines were published in December 2023.

This qualitative evidence synthesis was commissioned in parallel to several systematic reviews of evidence of benefits and harms of prioritized interventions for the Guideline, synthesized from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). These interventions were broad in scope, intensity and setting for delivery (reflected in the inclusion criteria for this synthesis). The aim of all the interventions is to improve health and wellbeing outcomes for people living with CPLBP. However, it is important to explore how this broad variation in interventions is perceived and experienced by older people with CPLBP and/or their caregivers (formal or informal, family members). Are some interventions more accepted than others? Are there differences between the interventions and/or access to them related to equity (gender, culture, place of residence, socio economic status) or setting (geographic or health care setting)? These important context questions can only be comprehensively answered using qualitative research methods. These contextual data are intended to support the development of the WHO guideline and complement additional perspectives brought to the development process by other stakeholders involved in the guideline development, consistent with WHO guideline development methods.

### Chronic pain: a review of its epidemiology and associated factors in population-based studies [^116mjiSW]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain is a common, complex, and distressing problem that has a profound impact on individuals and society. It frequently presents as a result of a disease or an injury; however, it is not merely an accompanying symptom, but rather a separate condition in its own right, with its own medical definition and taxonomy. Studying the distribution and determinants of chronic pain allows us to understand and manage the problem at the individual and population levels. Targeted and appropriate prevention and management strategies need to take into account the biological, psychological, socio-demographic, and lifestyle determinants and outcomes of pain. We present a narrative review of the current understanding of these factors.

### Long-term exercise adherence in the elderly with chronic low back pain [^112pZMxV]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Chronic back pain is common in the elderly population and can be treated with exercise. Long-term adherence to exercise recommendations has been documented in adults of < 65 yrs of age but not for elderly adults. This study explored exercise behaviors of elderly adults with a history of chronic back pain before and 2 yrs after treatment in an exercise-oriented rehabilitation program.

Design

This study utilized a case series design to survey 126 subjects > 65 yrs old who underwent physical therapy during the year 2000 for complaints of chronic low back pain. Of these, 89 (70%) responded to the 2-yr questionnaire. Outcome measures included visual analog scale for pain, Oswestry disability questionnaires, back flexibility and strength, and a questionnaire exploring exercise behaviors. All subjects underwent a 6-wk physical therapy program that consisted of exercise coupled with advice to remain active.

Results

Improvements in flexibility and strength occurred during treatment. Mean Oswestry disability scores (0–100 scale) improved from 32 to 20, and pain scores (0–10 scale) from 5.0 to 3.0 during treatment (P < 0.001) and were maintained at the 2-yr follow-up, regardless of exercise adherence. The percentage of patients who performed at least some exercise increased from 49% before treatment to 72% at the 2-yr follow-up. The changes in disability or pain observed during treatment did not influence exercise compliance. The most frequently stated reasons for nonadherence was that exercise did not help or aggravated pain (33%). For those who exercised regularly, 80% did so because of the health benefits from exercise.

Conclusions

The exercise behaviors of many elderly adults with chronic low back pain can increase after an exercise-oriented spine physical therapy program.

### Chronic pain among adults-United States, 2019–2021 [^116Nijx2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Chronic pain is a debilitating condition that affects the lives of millions of adults in the United States. During 2021, an estimated 20.9% of U.S. adults experienced chronic pain, similar to the reported estimate of 20.4% in 2016. The estimated prevalence of high-impact chronic pain in 2021 (6.9%) was, however, lower than in 2016 (8.0%). Further, the age-adjusted prevalence of high-impact chronic pain in 2021 was 6.4%, which is the goal set by the Healthy People 2030 objective to reduce the prevalence of high-impact chronic pain.

Findings in this report highlight important disparities in the prevalence of chronic pain among certain population groups. Consistent with previous studies, the prevalences of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain were higher among older adults, females, adults currently unemployed but who worked previously, veterans, adults living in poverty, those residing in nonmetropolitan areas, and those with public health insurance. This report contributes additional findings that the prevalences of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain were also higher among AI/AN adults, adults identifying as bisexual, those who are divorced or separated, U.S.-born adults compared with non–U.S.-born adults, adults with a disability, adults in poor health, and adults with a history of certain chronic medical conditions.

Previous studies have identified disparities in the treatment of chronic pain and access to affordable and effective pain management care, yet further work is needed to understand why these disparities exist and to identify opportunities for appropriate and effective interventions. CDC's 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain provides recommendations to promote a multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management and implementation strategies to reduce disparities in pain management care. In addition, policies and programs that address primary injury prevention, improved access to affordable, culturally responsive health care, and more effective pain management therapies can mitigate the burden of chronic pain.

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the results are generalizable only to the noninstitutionalized, civilian adult population; military personnel and persons in nursing homes and other institutions were excluded. Second, survey responses are self-reported and subject to recall bias. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic affected the collection of survey responses §§ and had impacts on health care access and utilization that might affect these results in unknown ways.

### Low back pain in older adults-the need for specific outcome and psychometric tools [^112iwSUz]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

The average human life expectancy has increased significantly worldwide due to advances in medicine, health care delivery, and technology over recent years. The United Nations has estimated that the proportion of older individuals aged 60 or over in the world will increase threefold by the year 2050. However, the fast growth of the aging population is accompanied by global increase in the incidence of low back pain (LBP) complaints and associated medical costs.

The most prevalent health condition in older adults that leads to functional limitations and disability is LBP. Several population-based studies have estimated that the 1-year prevalence of LBP in community-dwelling seniors ranged from 13% to 50%. Importantly, older adults are more prone to experience disabling LBP compared to younger individuals. Williams et alnoted that seniors aged 80 years or older had a 3 times higher odds of experiencing high-intensity LBP than those aged 50–59 years. Since high-intensity LBP is associated with unfavorable treatment outcomes and disability, seniors with LBP usually have poor functional ability. Furthermore, since the prevalence of chronic LBP also increases with age, the prevalence of chronic LBP in adults aged 70 years or older has been estimated to be as high as 58%.

Given the high prevalence and multifactorial causes of LBP in older people, the assessments and treatments of LBP are very challenging. A survey highlights that less than half of primary care physicians are very confident in diagnosing contributors of chronic LBP in seniors. Causes of LBP in older adults may differ from those in a younger population. Aside from nonspecific or mechanical LBP, older people may experience LBP secondary to osteoporotic spine fractures, tumors/cancers, vertebral osteomyelitis, and visceral diseases. Additionally, risk factors (such as age, psychosocial factors, and comorbidities) for chronic LBP in older adults may vary in comparison to the younger population, which may further compound their quality of life, risk of falls, and management outcomes. Imperatively, since clinicians' low confidence in diagnosing patients with LBP may lead to overreliance on medical imaging or delay in proper LBP management, it is necessary for primary care providers to acquire enhanced understanding of LBP assessments in geriatric patients.

### Prevalence of chronic pain in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116uUJwY]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

The global burden of chronic pain and disability could be related to unmet surgical needs. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to characterise existing data regarding the prevalence and associations of chronic pain in low-income and middle-income countries; this is essential to allow better assessment of its relationship to pre-operative and post-operative pain as emergency and essential surgical services are expanded.

Methods

According to PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, PsycInfo, and Cochrane registries for articles published before Dec 31, 2013, using the search terms "pain AND (chronic OR persistent) AND (low income countries OR middle income countries OR LMIC OR Africa OR Asia OR Central America OR South America) AND (incidence OR prevalence)". We excluded paediatric populations (aged younger than 18 years) and those with acute pain or pain associated with known trauma, surgery, infection, or medical disorders.

Findings

We identified 122 publications in 28 low-income and middle-income countries for systematic review; 79 surveys from general adult populations, elderly general populations, or workers. The prevalence of any type of chronic pain was 33% (95% CI 26–40) in the general adult population, 56% (36–75) in the general elderly population, and 35% (4–88) in workers; lower back pain was 18% (14–24), 31% (22–41), and 44% (33–55), respectively; headache 39% (27–53), 49% (37–60), and 52% (16–86), respectively; chronic daily headache 5% (3–7), not available, and 12% (8–19), respectively; musculoskeletal pain 26% (19–33), 39% (23–57), and 86% (56–93), respectively; joint pain 14% (11–18), 42% (26–60), and not available, respectively; and widespread pain 14% (9–22), 22% (9–46), and not available, respectively. Due to limited data, meta-analysis could only be done in single populations for some conditions. For general adult populations, chronic migraine was 10% (5–20); chronic tension-type headache was 4% (2–9); chronic pelvic pain or prostatitis was 11% (8–17); and fibromyalgia was 4% (3–7). In elderly general populations, prevalence of temporomandibular disorder was 7% (1–31) and abdominal pain was 6% (1–28). Heterogeneity in prevalence was largely secondary to variable definitions of pain chronicity. Associations were not readily amenable to meta-analysis; yet of the 122 publications, pain was described in association with disability in 50, female sex in 40, older age in 34, depression in 36, anxiety in 19, and multiple somatic complaints in 13.

Interpretation

The prevalence of pain in low-income and middle-income countries is consistent with Global Burden of Disease data, with higher rates in the elderly general population and workers than in the general adult population. 28% of the global burden of disease that could be averted by surgery and safe anaesthesia might also be related to the chronic pain burden. Trauma, cancer, birth complications, congenital defects, and other surgical diseases potentially lead to chronic pain if not treated or if treated inadequately. This meta-analysis shows the range of chronic pain in low-income and middle-income countries, but has fallen short of revealing clear causes for the pain. The demonstration of the prevalence of chronic pain is essential as the era of global surgery begins, to allow benchmarking of this prevalence in the future as emergency and essential surgery services are expanded in low-income and middle-income countries.

### Linking persistent pain and frailty in older adults [^114fW1zn]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

In older adults, the impact of persistent pain goes beyond simple discomfort, often contributing to worsening functional outcomes and ultimately frailty. Frailty is a geriatric syndrome that, like persistent pain, increases in prevalence with age and is characterized by a decreased ability to adapt to common stressors such as acute illness, thereby increasing risk for multiple adverse health outcomes. Evidence supports a relationship between persistent pain and both the incidence and progression of frailty, independent of health, social, and lifestyle confounders.

Design and Setting

In this article, we synthesize recent evidence linking persistent pain and frailty in an effort to clarify the nature of the relationship between these two commonly occurring geriatric syndromes.

Setting

We propose an integration of the frailty phenotype model by considering the impact of persistent pain on vulnerability toward external stressors, which can ultimately contribute to frailty in older adults.

Results and Conclusions

Incorporating persistent pain into the frailty construct can help us better understand frailty and ultimately improve care for patients with, as well as those at increased risk for, pain and frailty.

### Body weight, frailty, and chronic pain in older adults: a cross-sectional study [^112vKBio]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pain is one of the most common conditions experienced by older adults. More than 50% of community-dwelling older adults and 80% of nursing home residents report pain regularly. Unlike younger adults, older adults tend to experience pain at multiple sites and have more than one pain causes. Common causes of chronic geriatric pain include musculoskeletal disorders (such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis), diabetic neuropathies and postherpetic neuralgia, cancer and cancer treatment, and advanced stages of chronic conditions that induce pain, such as congestive heart failure and end-stage renal disease. Older adults who experienced acute pain from surgery, trauma, or injury may also develop chronic pain if the pain signals remain active for more than 3 months.

The diversity of chronic pain conditions encountered by older adults could have different effects on their body weights. Cancer-related chronic inflammation likely leads to chronic pain and underweight, and diabetes-associated obesity increases the burden of weight-bearing and worsens the chronic pain of lower back and lower limbs. While excessive body weight is suggested as a risk factor for chronic pain among adults, there is limited data to understand such an association among the United States (US) geriatric population. A previous small-scale study of 840 US older adults aged over 70 observed that obese persons had two-to-four-fold greater odds of chronic pain than their normal-weight peers. Besides, we know very little about the relationship between chronic pain and being underweight — the other end of the body weight spectrum, which is particularly common among frail elderly. Understanding this relationship is essential because one-in-sixty US older adults are underweight due to malnutrition and morbidity. In anticipation of a growing older population with unhealthy weight as baby boomers age, delineating the relationship between unhealthy weight and chronic pain may inform further research and interventions on pain management in the geriatric population.

### Sarcopenia and chronic pain in the elderly: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111m2fRH]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Sarcopenia and chronic pain are prevalent among older adults, and despite numerous studies, the potential epidemiological link between the two conditions remains a topic of controversy. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the relationship between chronic pain and sarcopenia in the elderly.

Methods

EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library were searched through 22 March 2023 with additional manual searches of reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. We used a random effects model to conduct the meta-analysis and evaluated heterogeneity across studies with Cochran's Q statistic and I². Subgroup analyses were conducted based on income level, diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia, and pain site.

Results

17 observational studies (33,600 participants, 49% female) were included, of which 6 articles were retrieved for narrative review. The pooled prevalence of sarcopenia and the pooled odds ratios (OR) between chronic pain and sarcopenia were extracted from the remaining 11 studies. The pooled prevalence of sarcopenia among older adults suffering from chronic pain was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.08–0.18). Our analysis revealed a statistically significant positive association between chronic pain and an increased risk of sarcopenia, yielding a pooled OR of 1.52 (95% CI, 1.31–1.76). Furthermore, our subgroup analysis demonstrated that the low-income countries group showed a stronger association (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.54–1.95) between chronic pain and sarcopenia than the high-income countries group (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.20–1.60).

Conclusion

Older adults with chronic pain have a significantly higher prevalence of sarcopenia and risk of developing sarcopenia compared to those without pain. These findings highlight the importance of prioritizing the assessment and early detection of chronic pain in older people, as well as implementing proactive intervention measures in clinical practice. In addition, our results suggest that older people with chronic pain should be actively screened for sarcopenia.

### Chronic pain among adults-United States, 2019–2021 [^111rom8u]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain (i.e., pain lasting ≥ 3 months) is a debilitating condition that affects daily work and life activities for many adults in the United States and has been linked with depression (1), Alzheimer disease and related dementias (2), higher suicide risk (3), and substance use and misuse (4). During 2016, an estimated 50 million adults in the United States experienced chronic pain, resulting in substantial health care costs and lost productivity (5,6). Addressing chronic pain and improving the lives of persons living with pain is a public health imperative. Population research objectives in the National Pain Strategy, which was released in 2016 by the Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee, call for more precise estimates of the prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain (i.e., chronic pain that results in substantial restriction to daily activities) in the general population and within various population groups to guide efforts to reduce the impact of chronic pain (3). Further, a 2022 review of U.S. chronic pain surveillance systems identified the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) as the best source for pain surveillance data (7). CDC analyzed data from the 2019–2021 NHIS to provide updated estimates of the prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain among adults in the United States and within population groups defined by demographic, geographic, socioeconomic, and health status characteristics. During 2021, an estimated 20.9% of U.S. adults (51.6 million persons) experienced chronic pain, and 6.9% (17.1 million persons) experienced high-impact chronic pain. New findings from this analysis include that non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults, adults identifying as bisexual, and adults who are divorced or separated are among the populations experiencing a higher prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain. Clinicians, practices, health systems, and payers should vigilantly attend to health inequities and ensure access to appropriate, affordable, diversified, coordinated, and effective pain management care for all persons (8).

### Development and validation of a prediction model for chronic post-surgical pain after thoracic surgery in elderly patients: a retrospective cohort study [^111g2nsp]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain is one of the most common and consequential diseases in older adults, aged over 65 years. In 2016, a global survey about the prevalence of chronic pain in 50 million adults over the age of 18 revealed a higher prevalence of chronic pain in adults over the age of 65, compared to those less than 65. Besides, the elderly persons suffered from chronic pain that limited life activities or work as high as 26.5%. For older persons, fear of pain prevents individuals from exercising, taking care of themselves in daily life, or even impairing their memory. Therefore, chronic pain is a significant health hazard and needs to arise more attention.

As the standard of living and medical conditions improve, elderly patients account for an increasing proportion of the overall surgical patient population. Chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP), as one of the adverse outcomes after surgery, has a prevalence of about 30–40% and seriously affects the normal physical function, emotion and quality of life. Current studies on CPSP are for adults over 18 years, but fewer epidemiological surveys have been conducted on aged adults who were older than 65 years. And other studies about chronic pain in the elderly mainly focused on patients suffering from osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, yet fewer researchers investigated chronic pain in elderly patients after surgery. Therefore, it is crucial to understand and address chronic postoperative pain in elderly patients.

CPSP is common in thoracotomy. Thus, the aim of our study was to conduct a retrospective study to establish a prediction model of CPSP as an easy-to-use tool. Then, clinicians could give appropriate intervention and attention at the early stage to promote suitable postoperative care to improve life quality and reduce mortality in the elderly after surgery.

Epidemiology of Chronic Pain

It is estimated that 50 million adults in the United States experience chronic pain, which in 19.6 million subjects it has a high impact on daily life or work activities.

Chronic pain affects about 20% of the European population. In terms of the prevalence of chronic pain, Italy ranks third in Europe, with about 26% of the population who has used drugs to treat chronic pain at least once in their lifetime.

Since CNCP prevalence increases with age, it is likely to rise markedly in the near future, given the aging population in many developed nations in North America, Europe, and Asia.

The financial cost to society is huge, currently estimated at more than 200 billion Euros per annum in Europe and $150 billion per annum in the US.

While important advances in the understanding of pain mechanisms have increased potential therapeutic options, management of chronic pain remains generally unsatisfactory; two-thirds of patients report dissatisfaction with current treatments and most of them complain about chronic pain persisting for many years.

Achieving adequate pain relief through new therapeutic strategies is therefore important for achieving control of symptoms and improving quality of life in patients with chronic pain.

### Assessing pain in the confused elderly patient… [^113vgXLh]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Although frail older patients are likely to have painful conditions, managing pain in elderly patients whose cognitive impairment prevents them from communicating well about their pain may be difficult. Krulewitch and associates conducted a prospective, observational study to determine how nonprofessional caregivers recognize pain in the confused elderly patient and to compare their reports with those of the patient. Specifically, they sought to compare standard pain assessment instruments. A research assistant interviewed the caregiver and patient in the patient's home, and administered to both the Faces Pain Scale, involving seven pictures of faces, smiling to grimacing; the Nonverbal Visual Analog Scale, in which the respondent marks a line between the extremes of "no pain" and "worst pain"; and the Pain Intensity Scale, a six-item questionnaire. A total of 156 patient/caregiver pairs participated.

The age range of the patients was 65 to 98 years, the mean MMSE score was 15. 7 and most patients had advanced functional impairment. One third of the patients were unable to complete any of the instruments, and 42 percent were able to complete all of them. Of the patients who could only complete one or two scales, the PIS was most likely to be completed. Although patients with higher MMSE scores were more likely to be able to complete more instruments, the reported pain levels did not differ based on the level of cognitive impairment. There was statistically significant agreement between patient and caregiver on all three pain instruments used, with the highest correlation occurring on the PIS. Twenty-four of the pairs reported no pain or minimal pain, and 46 pairs reported at least moderate pain. In 16 pairs, the patient reported moderate to severe pain while the caregiver reported minimal or no pain.

The Hospice Approach Discomfort Scale had low correlation with the other tools, but there were few patients in this study with extremely low MMSE scores. The authors conclude that the PIS is the instrument most likely to determine the existence and magnitude of pain in a cognitively impaired older adult. A cognitively impaired patient is also more likely to be able to complete this instrument.

### Treatment guidelines for the pharmacological management of pain in older persons [^111DKFtV]. Pain Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic or persistent pain is a common problem in older adults and is often associated with significant physical disability and psychosocial problems. The potential benefits, risks, and costs of pharmacotherapy as a mainstay in the treatment of moderate to severe pain in this population must be well-understood and weighed accordingly. Recent treatment guidelines have been introduced that can guide decision making to optimize pain-related treatment outcomes in older individuals

Objectives and Results

This review article describes and summarizes key evidence-based recommendations that were derived by a committee convened by the American Geriatrics Society in order to provide guidance to optimize pharmacotherapy in the management of persistent pain in older individuals.

Conclusions

It is postulated that ongoing education of clinicians who treat older patients with persistent moderate to severe pain will lead to improved outcomes in this vulnerable population.

### Pain assessment in the older population: what the literature says [^116x2Jav]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

Assessment of pain in the older adult presents a number of challenges, especially related to communication. This commentary summarises the revised evidence-based Guidelines on the Assessment of Pain in Older Adults which have been developed by the British Pain Society and British Geriatrics Society. The guideline summarises the pain assessment tools that have been developed and validated for use in the older population. Recommendations are made for use of specific tools in older people and in those with dementia. The need for education and training of health care professionals is emphasised. Gaps in the evidence are identified as subjects for future research. It is hoped that the guideline will improve recognition of pain in older people, and help to drive the future research agenda.

### Identification and management of chronic pain in primary care: a review [^114nyoWJ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

It is of great relevance to primary care that chronic pain is also associated with significant increase in morbidity and mortality, with 20–50% of chronic pain sufferers having co-morbid depression. In an important study on multimorbidity, Barnett et al. established that chronic pain is one of the commonest morbidities to co-occur with other long-term conditions, but also that 88% of patients with chronic pain have other chronic illnesses. The most common comorbidities were cardiovascular disease and depression. This high prevalence of comorbidities in patients with chronic pain can limit the applicability and utility of clinical guidelines to multimorbid patients with chronic pain and restrict what treatment options can be used in pain control. Further research on managing chronic pain in multimorbid patients is essential to optimise improvements in health status, functioning, and quality of life and possibly also improve the management of their other major chronic health conditions. Recent research has demonstrated a link between chronic pain and mortality. Torrance et al. established that severe chronic pain was significantly associated with all-cause mortality and particularly death from cardiovascular disease. Such evidence suggests that in assessing patients with chronic pain, physicians should view chronic pain as a serious risk marker for premature mortality.

Primary care is "first-contact, accessible, continued, comprehensive and coordinated care". In most countries, of the 20% of the general population who experience chronic pain, the overwhelming majority are managed in primary care by their family doctor (general practitioner, GP), while only 0.5–2% are ever referred to secondary care for pain management. Consultations on pain account for 22% of all primary care consultations, and pain is one of the main reasons for patients seeking contact with healthcare. Patients with chronic pain visit their GP twice as often as patients without chronic pain. They also have a considerably higher level of use of emergency and unscheduled care than patients without chronic pain risking a care plan dictated by short-term decision making rather than comprehensive oversight of their pain as a whole.

### The burden of common chronic disease on health-related quality of life in an elderly community-dwelling population in the UK [^112t5Ktp]. Family Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Given the high prevalence of chronic conditions and multimorbidity in the elderly, there is a need to determine which chronic conditions have the greatest impact on health-related quality of life (HRQL) and identify where additional intervention may be required.

Objective

To explore the impact of a range of common chronic conditions on HRQL in a community-based population aged 65 years or more in the UK.

Methods

Secondary analysis of data derived from a large (n = 5849) cross-sectional study. HRQL was assessed using the EuroQoL EQ-5D. Multivariable models were used to estimate the relative effect of 15 individual common chronic conditions and combinations of these conditions on HRQL.

Results

Mean age of participants was 74.6 years, 49.2% were male. The mean EQ-5D index score was 0.78 (standard deviation 0.2), range -0.43 to 1.00. Overall, 53% (n = 3078) of the cohort reported problems with pain, 39% (n = 2273) with mobility and 9% (n = 529) with self-care. Multivariate modelling demonstrated that impaired HRQL was significantly associated with 13 of the 15 common chronic conditions studied. Clinically meaningful reductions in EQ-5D index scores were observed for osteoarthritis (-0.081, P = 0.0006), neurological disease (-0.172, P < 0.0001) and depression (-0.269, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

This study quantifies the relative impact of 13 common chronic conditions on HRQL in a UK-based community-dwelling ageing population. Findings indicate that osteoarthritis, depression and neurological disease have a strong clinically important negative effect on HRQL. These findings may help clinical decision making and priority setting for management of individuals with multimorbidity.

### Chronic pain self-management for older adults: a randomized controlled trial [^114w6Ads]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The problem of chronic pain in the elderly

Chronic pain is a common problem in the elderly, and is often associated with significant physical disability and psychosocial problems. Estimates of the prevalence of chronic pain problems among community-dwelling older adults range from 58–70%. The most common painful conditions among older adults are musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoarthritis, low back pain, and previous fracture sites. Chronic pain often results in depression, sleep disturbance, decreased mobility, increased health care utilization, and physical and social role dysfunction. Despite its high prevalence, pain in the elderly often is inadequately assessed and treated.

As the United States population grows older, the public health problem of chronic pain and its sequelae will worsen. Projections show dramatic increases in this age group; approximately 25% of the population will be age 65 years or older in 2050. Moreover, by 2030 there will be an estimated 8 million people who are 85 years or older. Thus, there is an urgent and growing need for interventions that are effective in decreasing pain, suffering, and pain-related disability in this group.

The role of self-management in the treatment of chronic painful conditions

There is substantial empirical evidence that attention to cognitive and behavioral factors, in addition to physiological factors, is necessary for the successful treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain. Empirically supported multimodal therapies that incorporate cognitive and behavioral strategies now exist for many chronic pain conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and low back pain. These therapies aim to enhance the ability of patients to successfully self-manage their pain, using a variety of techniques. Related approaches and strategies are described under the rubrics "cognitive-behavioral therapy" (CBT), "psycho-educational" or "educational", and "self-management" or "self-help". Although there are variations among these approaches, they share some or all of the following components: education about pain, instruction in the identification and modification of negative thoughts, exercise, communication skills, relaxation training, and physical therapies. The goal of the therapies is to enhance function, improve mood, and decrease pain intensity by changing the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses to pain.

### Chronic pain among adults-United States, 2019–2021 [^116sraUL]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Within population groups defined by geographic and socioeconomic characteristics, the age-adjusted prevalence of high-impact chronic pain among adults residing in nonmetropolitan areas (9.2%) and adults with a family income < 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL) (14.4%) was approximately two and four times as high, respectively, as among those residing in large central metro areas (5.5%) and those with family income ≥ 400% FPL (3.5%). Adults reporting poor general health and adults with a disability experienced an exceptionally high prevalence of chronic pain (67.6% and 52.4%, respectively) and high-impact chronic pain (48.7% and 32.0%, respectively). Among all chronic medical conditions reported, the age-adjusted prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain was highest among adults with a history of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (70.0% and 43.8%, respectively) and dementia (54.9% and 34.2%, respectively).

### Is excess weight a burden for older adults who suffer chronic pain? [^111eFXma]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity and chronic pain are common comorbidities and adversely influence each other. Advanced age is associated with more comorbidities and multi-morbidities. In this study, we investigated the burden of overweight/obesity and its comorbidities and their associations with chronic pain in a random population sample of Swedish older adults.

Methods

The cross-sectional analysis involved a random sample of a population ≥ 65 years in south-eastern Sweden (N = 6243). Data were collected from a postal questionnaire that addressed pain aspects, body mass index (BMI), and health experiences. Chronic pain was defined as pain during the previous three months. According to the 0–10 Numeric Rating Scale, pain scored ≥ 7 corresponds to severe pain. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the variables associated to pain aspects.

Results

A total of 2633 (42%) reported chronic pain. More obese older adults (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) experienced chronic pain (58%) than those who were low-normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m², 39%) or overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30 kg/m², 41%). Obese elderly more frequently had pain in extremities and lower back than their peers. In the multivariate model, obesity (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.59, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.33–1.91) but not overweight (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95–1.22) was associated with chronic pain. Obesity (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.16–2.01) was also significantly related to severe pain. We also found other comorbidities - i.e., traumatic history (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.99–3.19), rheumatic diseases (OR 5.21, 95% CI 4.54–5.97), age ≥ 85 years (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.22–2.25), and depression or anxiety diagnosis (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.32–2.53) - showed stronger associations with pain aspects than weight status.

Conclusion

In older adults, excess weight (BMI 30 or above) is a potentially modifiable factor but not the only risk factor that is associated with chronic pain and severe pain. Future studies should investigate the effectiveness of interventions that treat comorbid pain and obesity in older adults.

### Hypnosis can reduce pain in hospitalized older patients: a randomized controlled study [^111HHVSS]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pain is a common and serious health problem in the elderly. Various epidemiological studies estimate the prevalence between 25 and 65% in elderly persons who live in the community and up to 80% in institutionalized elderly people. The most common chronic, non-malignant pain conditions in the elderly are musculoskeletal pain located in the joints and back due to osteoarthritis or osteoporosis fractures in addition to neuropathic pain such as post-herpetic neuralgia and peripheral neuropathy. Living with pain has an impact on elderly people's overall functioning and quality of life. Patients suffering from chronic pain often have depression, sleep disturbances and impaired functionality with an impact on their quality of life.

The management of an elderly patient with chronic pain includes both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment. Common drug classes are paracetamol, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and opioids. The increased risk of polypharmacy, adverse side-effects and intoxication in elderly adults, compared to younger adults, is well recognized, leading to an increased interest in non pharmacological approaches. These include psychological support, physiotherapy, massage or hypnosis for example.

Hypnosis is an altered state of consciousness or state of focused attention to verbal stimuli induced by the therapist (hetero-hypnosis) or the subject himself (self-hypnosis). To enter "hypnosis" means "to enter" in "another" state, a transition from a normal ordinary state of consciousness. The patient is always in control and can stop the process whenever he desires to do so. Hypnotic techniques have proven to be useful for different kind of pain especially pain associated with burns, cancer, invasive medical procedures, headaches, musculoskeletal conditions, irritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia for example. The practice of self-hypnosis has been shown in studies to be an important element in the long term control of chronic pain. Self-hypnosis can be taught to the patient as a tool to modify behavior regarding nociceptive perception. It allows him to take an active part in his own pain management using personal resources and experiences. Little research specifically addresses the use of hypnosis in older adults. Although three studies did include older patients. The mean age of participants was relatively young (60 to 69 years) and not representative of very old patients treated in geriatric settings.

4.4. Search strategy

All publications on acute and chronic pain screening and assessment in adults over 60 years of age including case reports, cohort studies, review papers, observational studies, randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews in all languages in all care settings were identified from searches of Medline (PubMed), CINAHL, Amed, PsycINFO, Embase, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library between 01.01.2002 and 30.04.2017.

The archives of the British Pain Society, European Pain Society, Irish Pain Society, The British Geriatric Society and the Steinberg Collection were reviewed together with published conference papers and abstracts for the same time period. Professional and patient related internet sites were searched by section contributors. Searches were undertaken by specialist medical librarians in consultation with section contributors who were then provided with abstracts. Search strategies are described in Section 17 with an example of a detailed search provided for the section that explores pain assessment in older adults with mental health and psychological problems. Duplicate abstracts were removed by the librarians in collaboration with the section contributors. Additional references and abstracts were included at this point by the subject experts.

The section contributors then reviewed all abstracts and selected for inclusion those that met the working party pre-defined criteria, search terms and the clinical questions posed by the section editors. Seminal work, published prior to 2002 was included in the subject review section. Individual section contributors applied the NHMRC levels of evidence criteria to publications. The decision to include a paper within a section was made by consensus between the authors and project lead where appropriate. All section papers are identified in a specific reference list and are tabulated by section.

4.5. Evaluations of the literature

The selected publications were considered as potential sources of evidence. Each publication was assessed independently by two individual raters using an agreed method ensure to its methodological quality including study design, statistical analysis and validity of conclusions. Observational studies were assessed using MERGE guidance.

4.6. How recommendations were made

The recommendations made by the section contributors were explicitly linked to the supporting evidence that resulted from the search strategies for individual topics. Recommendations were made based on the NHMRC designation levels of evidence (see Table 1), and these recommendations were further confirmed through agreement between two reviewers.

### The assessment of pain in older people: UK national guidelines [^117EhyYf]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

6 Introduction

Until relatively recently our knowledge of the prevalence of pain in older people, particularly the oldest old, was relatively poor. Pain tended to be considered as part of the ageing process and was rarely investigated in its own right. There have however been an increasing number of studies into the prevalence of pain in older persons in the last decade.

6.1. Prevalence of pain in older persons

The work on prevalence has been published recently within the Management of Pain Guidelines, but there are some take home messages that have been incorporated within this document. The prevalence of any type of pain ranged widely from a low of 0% to a high of 93%, clearly illustrating how variations in the population, methods and definitions used can affect prevalence estimates. The vast majority of studies found that women had a higher prevalence than men.

Different patterns of pain prevalence were seen in men and women and in different sites of pain, however the age differences could be broadly categorised into four groups:
A continual increase in pain prevalence with age
An increase in prevalence with age up to 75–85 years and then a decrease with age
A decrease in pain prevalence with age and
No difference in pain prevalence with age

Chronic pain was most frequently reported in knees, hips and back.

While previous evidence suggests that chronic pain typically affects those of working age, there is growing evidence to demonstrate that chronic pain continues to increase into the oldest old. found that, although older people experience a decrease in non-disabling back pain, described as benign or mild pain, they experience increased prevalence of disabling back pain, described as severe. This work is further supported by the findings of Thomas et al. who reported that the onset of pain that interferes with everyday life continues to increase with age.

### Chronic pain: prevalence and management [^1127vA5w]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain is a distinct complication that profoundly affects the lives of individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). Chronic SCD pain emerges with increasing age and is very prevalent in adults. The pathophysiology of chronic SCD pain is likely distinct from acute SCD pain and therefore needs a different treatment approach. Clinical trials evaluating the treatment of chronic SCD pain are lacking and treatment currently relies on evidence from other chronic pain conditions. Continued investigations into the underlying causes of chronic SCD pain are needed, and clinical trials focused on chronic pain therapy are imperative.

### Special considerations in insomnia diagnosis and management: depressed, elderly, and chronic pain populations [^115V3mzT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with insomnia who also have chronic pain or depression or who are elderly represent segments of the population that are particularly difficult to treat. These populations tend to be at higher risk for experiencing difficulty sleeping and are more likely to experience chronic insomnia, sleep maintenance problems, and/or nonrestorative sleep. Worsening insomnia may exacerbate other somatic and psychological symptoms and vice versa. Conversely, there is evidence that appropriate recognition and management of the sleep complaint may alleviate other symptoms related to the associated condition and help interrupt this vicious cycle.

### Pain management in older adults [^112mqZbs]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pain is prevalent among older adults but is underrecognized and undertreated. The approach to pain assessment and management in older adults requires an understanding of the physiology of aging, validated assessment tools, and common pain presentations among older adults.

Objective

To identify the overall principles of pain management in older adults with a specific focus on common painful conditions and approaches to pharmacologic treatment.

Methods

We searched PubMed for common pain presentations in older adults with heart failure, end-stage renal disease, dementia, frailty, and cancer. We also reviewed guidelines for pain management. Our review encompassed 2 guidelines, 10 original studies, and 22 review articles published from 2000 to the present. This review does not discuss nonpharmacologic treatments of pain.

Results

Clinical guidelines support the use of opioids in persistent nonmalignant pain. Opioids should be used in patients with moderate or severe pain or pain not otherwise controlled but with careful attention to potential toxic effects and half-life. In addition, clinical practice guidelines recommend use of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with extreme caution and for defined, limited periods.

Conclusion

An understanding of the basics of pain pathophysiology, assessment, pharmacologic management, and a familiarity with common pain presentations will allow clinicians to effectively manage pain for older adults.

### Prevalence and characteristics of chronic pain in the Chinese community-dwelling elderly: a cross-sectional study [^1154cnKY]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Chronic pain is a common health concern in the Chinese community-dwelling elderly with a prevalence of 57.3%. The prevalence and intensity of chronic pain did not increase with aging and showed no differences with respect to sex. Pain in the legs/feet was the most reported pain location in both males and females. Furthermore, easier access to medication assistance and scientific guidance for non-drug therapy may be helpful in improving pain management in the elderly population.

### Evidence and consensus recommendations for the pharmacological management of pain in India [^115UCQ7Y]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Unmet needs of India

According to a survey by the World Health Organization (WHO), the incidence of chronic pain was demonstrated to range between 5% and 33% in 15 centers across Asia, Africa, Europe and the USA. India has a high burden of chronic diseases and injuries, which are the leading causes of disability and mortality and have pain as comorbidity. Globally, pain prevalence in the elderly population is highand is further expected to rise, owing to the presence of multiple comorbiditiesand barriers related to communication and cognition. With a considerable increase in life expectancy in the past decade, India has witnessed an unprecedented rise in the ailing population, who are struggling to get adequate treatment for pain. Furthermore, there are some additional challenges, such as lack of adequate health care facilities, poverty, inadequate health care expenditure and lack of awareness among health care practitioners and patients. Health care centers in India are often not well equipped to provide adequate treatment for pain, with physicians relying mostly on over-the-counter analgesics. This generalized approach seldom works in most complex pain disorders, which require a detailed diagnosis and thoughtful, planned management. Another concern stemming from lack of awareness is the use of irrational and inappropriate multidrug prescriptions in India. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the second most common components of prescriptions in India.–Rampant polypharmacy, coupled with lack of awareness, has had a huge impact on analgesic efficacy and presents tolerability issues. Several misconceptions regarding use of analgesics and fear of adverse events associated with the use of opioids or surgical methods of analgesia result in suboptimal treatment of pain. These inadequacies might be overcome by the amalgamation of expert opinions and available evidence to form standardized treatment guidelines for pain therapy. Hence, an expert panel was convened to delve on these lacunae and frame an appropriate treatment paradigm for pain management. The objective of this publication is to summarize the evidence-based consensus recommendations of this expert panel for the pharmacological management of pain in India.

### Factors predicting outcomes from chronic pain management interventions [^1167F88a]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Age

Older adults are more likely to have conditions that cause pain, but the threshold required for noxious stimuli to induce pain increases with age. Elderly individuals tend to report lower acute pain scoresand have a higher tolerance for mild pain, probably as a consequence of age related physiological changes, including decreased peripheral nociceptive fibre density, reduced central nociception, and decreased cortical activation, along with greater protective behavioural factors (ie, greater acceptance and less catastrophising).

Not all physiological changes of ageing are favourable. Descending inhibitory pathways degrade, making severe pain less tolerable and increasing the risk of chronic pain. Although the decreased neuroplasticity of older adults might protect against maladaptive somatosensory changes from acute pain, changes that have already occurred are difficult to reverse. Minimal data exist about age as an independent variable for procedural outcomes related to chronic pain. In a small prospective study of 47 patients undergoing CT (computed tomography) guided epidural steroid injections, no correlation was found between age and pain relief. In a secondary analysis of a multisite observational study in 227 patients with chronic knee pain, those who reported a perceived age lower than their chronological age had less pain and disability. A large prospective study (n = 346) found that older patients were more likely to have procedural success for non-surgical low back procedures (mean age for procedural success was 54 years v 50 years for failure). A retrospective study (n = 160) evaluating spinal fusion for lumbar stenosis found no differences in pain or functional outcomes between the super elderly (≥ 80 years) and those aged 65–79 years, but a higher rate of postoperative delirium in the cohort aged > 80 years. The inevitable physiological changes that occur with ageing influence, but do not determine, the perception of pain.

### An analysis of factors associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain, pain management preferences, coping strategies, and health-related quality of life among older people: a cross-cultural study [^112kGvF3]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

A surveyrevealed that most papers on pain in the elderly are related to original research on pain characteristics, with limited evidence regarding biological factors relevant to pain processing in the context of aging. Ageing has been shown to lead to changes in the sensory components of pain, particularly in women. In addition, there are controversial data on the influence of aging on pain mechanisms. Primarily, chronic diseases as comorbidities, but also other conditions as well as medication should be taken into account to estimate the relative contribution of chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) to disability, loss of functional independence and poor quality of life. CMP is a common medical and socioeconomic problem worldwide. The main factors shaping the interest in pain perception derive from demographic changes in developed countries, characterized by substantial increases in life expectancy, as well as high prevalence rates of CMP among OAs. The biopsychosocial model of chronic pain presents an integrated approach to CMP, taking into account differences in nociceptive processes and psychosocial factors.

### Chronic pain epidemiology and its clinical relevance [^111Kw5VF]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic pain affects ∼20% of the European population and is commoner in women, older people, and with relative deprivation. Its management in the community remains generally unsatisfactory, partly because of lack of evidence for effective interventions. Epidemiological study of chronic pain, through an understanding of its distribution and determinants, can inform the development, targeting, and evaluation of interventions in the general population. This paper reviews current knowledge of risk markers associated with chronic pain and considers how these might inform management and prevention. Risk factors include socio-demographic, clinical, psychological, and biological factors. These are relevant to our understanding of chronic pain mechanisms and the nature of, and responses to, current and future treatments.

### Is excess weight a burden for older adults who suffer chronic pain? [^1178LaTb]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pain is common in older adults, but the prevalence varies widely, ranging from 20 to 93%. This wide variation is likely due to the representative population samples used and discrepancies between questionnaires that assess pain. In Sweden, more than 50% of people aged 65 and over report chronic pain and in the future this percentage is likely to increase in the oldest age groups.

The prevalence of overweight and obesity in the elderly population is increasing worldwide. Excess weight can affect longevity and disease-specific mortality in old age. Rather than just surviving to an old age, more attention is now being paid to healthy aging. Both chronic pain and obesity can be barriers for healthy aging as these factors may affect important domains of life quality such as physical independence, mental well-being, and health.

### Impact of eliciting treatment priorities on analgesic prescribing in older patients with high levels of polypharmacy [^116csmnv]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Eliciting treatment priorities and tailoring care for older adults with multimorbidity is complex and may be difficult to operationalize and measure in primary care, with current evidence suggesting poor agreement between clinicians and patients. Chronic pain was identified as the most common treatment priority in this population of older adults with high levels of polypharmacy. The identification of pain as a treatment priority during medication review was associated with higher odds of opioid intensification despite guidance advising against their use for chronic pain. However, limited effective and safe therapeutic interventions and access to non-pharmacological treatments are barriers to optimal chronic pain management. Older patients with high disease and treatment burden levels require access to multi-disciplinary care, with support from professionals such as pharmacists, physiotherapists, and geriatricians to address their complex needs holistically and reduce the risk of medication-related harm.

### Prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain among adults-United States, 2016 [^112WfRhG]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic pain, one of the most common reasons adults seek medical care (1), has been linked to restrictions in mobility and daily activities (2,3), dependence on opioids (4), anxiety and depression (2), and poor perceived health or reduced quality of life (2,3). Population-based estimates of chronic pain among U.S. adults range from 11% to 40% (5), with considerable population subgroup variation. As a result, the 2016 National Pain Strategy called for more precise prevalence estimates of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain (i.e., chronic pain that frequently limits life or work activities) to reliably establish the prevalence of chronic pain and aid in the development and implementation of population-wide pain interventions (5). National estimates of high-impact chronic pain can help differentiate persons with limitations in major life domains, including work, social, recreational, and self-care activities from those who maintain normal life activities despite chronic pain, providing a better understanding of the population in need of pain services. To estimate the prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain in the United States, CDC analyzed 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data. An estimated 20.4% (50.0 million) of U.S. adults had chronic pain and 8.0% of U.S. adults (19.6 million) had high-impact chronic pain, with higher prevalences of both chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain reported among women, older adults, previously but not currently employed adults, adults living in poverty, adults with public health insurance, and rural residents. These findings could be used to target pain management interventions.

### Pain as a disease: an overview [^112J5woq]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic pain has been notoriously defined as the pain that lasts longer than the usual course of an acute injury or disease or the pain that recurs for months or years. The value of this definition is its ability to describe all the conditions that can be defined as chronic pain even if it does not refer to the impairment brought about by the pain, the presence of specific symptoms, and the supposed etiologic framework. This is also because chronic pain is a term employed to define several diverse conditions whose common feature is the presence of persistent pain.

According to a 2014 study on the global burden of chronic pain, at least 10% of the world's population is affected by a chronic pain condition and every year, an additional 1 in 10 people develops chronic pain. Even if these data are confirmed also for the low-income and middle-income countries, the unequal distribution of risk factors and pain management options leads the most disadvantaged to bear higher burdens of persistent pain and less effective treatment. A 2012 study of the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health shows that nearly 50 million American adults have chronic or severe pain; according to the American Academy of Pain Medicine, in the USA, pain affects more Americans than diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. The data from Europe present similar results: the 2006 enquiry on the prevalence of chronic pain shows that 19% of adult Europeans are affected by this condition, seriously compromising their quality of life.

### Pain management in older adults [^112WqZQa]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2003). Low credibility.

Pain is a common complaint of older adults. Persistent pain has a significant negative impact on elderly individuals' sense of well being, physical function, and quality of life. Increasing age and cognitive impairment are risk factors for undertreatment of persistent pain. Safe and effective therapy is available for pain syndromes that commonly affect older adults. Recognition of failure of health providers to appropriately assess and manage persistent pain has led to the recent development and adoption of regulatory guidelines for the implementation of effective pain management programs.

### The relationship between chronic pain and cognitive impairment in the elderly: a review of current evidence [^1144eEFB]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Chronic pain and cognitive impairment are prevalent geriatric syndromes in the population of older adults, and they are the main cause of disability in people over sixty-five years of age. As the global population continues to age, chronic pain and cognitive impairment will affect an increasing number of older adults. While numerous studies in recent years have shown that chronic pain is associated with cognitive decline, the exact mechanisms linking the two remain unclear. In this review, we aim to present the available evidence on the connection between chronic pain and cognitive impairment and to discuss the potential mechanisms by which chronic pain affects cognitive function. In addition, we review potential therapeutic interventions targeting psychological factors, microglia activation, and altered gut flora that may improve and prevent cognitive decline in people with chronic pain.

### The assessment of pain in older people: UK national guidelines [^113VtKQi]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

5 Background

Pain is described as an 'unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage'. It is classified as acute – associated with trauma or injury – or chronic (lasting longer than three months).

Millions of people who live in the United Kingdom experience chronic pain and as we go into older age, it is suggested that up to 93% of people have pain which is often 'expected to be part of ageing' or something that they have to 'learn to live with'. One of the fundamental issues regarding pain management in any age group is assessment of pain. This can be particularly challenging in older adults due to the age related changes in vision, hearing and cognition. Literature has suggested in the past that we have around 50% of the older population who live in the community experiencing uncontrolled chronic pain. However, what is more worrying is the fact that this number increases significantly to 80% when we look at care home populations. This is really worrying considering that our oldest, often most frail, members of society often live in care homes and yet it appears that they are experiencing more moderate to severe uncontrolled pain. Furthermore, it seems accepted that this population are often cared for by the least experienced and non-professionally qualified members of staff.

Recent systematic reviews of epidemiological studies suggest that the estimates of prevalence of chronic pain in the older population are not in fact accurate, and range from between 0 and 93%. Clearly, more work needs to be done in terms of prevalence studies.

If we focus specifically on those who are unable to articulate their pain, thus adults with dementia or other cognitive impairments, we estimate that we have over 700,000 people in the UK with dementias and this is expected to rise significantly. Over the next few years we expect there to be 44 million people worldwide with dementia.

As far back as September 1990, the Royal College of Surgeons, Faculty of Anaesthetists published their report – Pain after Surgery. In that report, it was suggested that pain should be assessed along with other routine observations of blood pressure and pulse. Since then, we have seen recommendations from around the world regarding pain assessment, suggesting that it become the 5 th vital sign.

### Chronic pain self-management for older adults: a randomized controlled trial [^113Khpcb]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Discussion

Persistent pain is a common problem in older adults that can be debilitating. Self-management strategies that incorporate physical and psychosocial pain coping skills are effective in decreasing pain and improving function and mood in younger adults. Little is known, however, about the efficacy of this therapy for older adults, especially those in the mid-old to old-old range. Our randomized controlled trial assesses the efficacy of such a treatment program, as compared with a control condition, in decreasing pain and improving physical and psychosocial functioning in elderly retirement community residents with chronic pain.

### Chronic pain and obesity in elderly people: results from the einstein aging study [^112x2TyJ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the prevalence of chronic pain in elderly people and its relationship with obesity and associated comorbidities and risk factors.

Design

Cross-sectional.

Setting

Community.

Participants

A representative community sample of 840 subjects aged 70 and older.

Measurements

The prevalence of chronic pain and its relationship with obesity (categories defined according to body mass index (BMI)), other medical risk factors, and psychiatric comorbidities were examined. Chronic pain was defined as pain of at least moderate severity (≥ 4 on a 10-point scale) some, most, or all of the time for the previous 3 months.

Results

The sample was mostly female (62.8%), and the average age was 80 (range 70–101). The prevalence of chronic pain was 52% (39.7% in men; 58.9% in women). Subjects with chronic pain were more likely to report a diagnosis of depression (odds ratio (OR) = 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.40–4.55) and anxiety (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.22–4.64). Obese subjects (BMI 30–34.9) were twice as likely (OR = 2.1, 95%CI = 1.33–3.28) and severely obese subjects (BMI ≥ 35) were more than four times as likely (OR = 4.5, 95% CI = 1.85–12.63) as those of normal weight (BMI 18.5–24.9) to have chronic pain. Obese subjects were significantly more likely to have chronic pain in the head, neck or shoulder, back, legs or feet, and abdomen or pelvis than subjects who were not obese. In multivariate models, obesity (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.27–3.26) and severe obesity (OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.57–10.82) were associated with chronic pain after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression, anxiety, and education.

Conclusion

Chronic pain is common in this elderly population, affects women more than men, and is highly associated with obesity.

### Safe prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with osteoarthritis – an expert consensus addressing benefits as well as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^116QM2u7]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is a common reason for patients to visit their family physician and the numbers seeking treatment for pain is anticipated to rise as the population ages and chronic conditions, such as osteoarthritis (OA), increase. In the United Kingdom (UK), annually, more than 17 million prescriptions are written for anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs. In addition, over-the-counter analgesic (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol) use is substantial, with 44% of patients consuming more than the recommended dosage on the label. Musculoskeletal pain is common and disabling, especially in the elderly population, whose number and proportion is estimated to double by 2030, compared to the 2000 figure. Prescribing pain medications within this particular population requires the skill of a knowledgeable physician to navigate through the numerous variables (e.g. physiologic changes, co-morbidities, and co-therapies) that make the elderly a heterogeneous and complex population to treat.

### Prevalence and characteristics of chronic pain in the Chinese community-dwelling elderly: a cross-sectional study [^1158LCL2]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) has defined chronic pain as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience may be associated with tissue damage, which may also be described in term of such damage lasting for over 3 months. With the population aging, a rise in prevalence for chronic and degenerated diseases is inevitable, leading to a high incidence of chronic pain in the elderly. Previous studies have investigated the incidence of chronic pain in the elderly, showing a prevalence ranging from 43.8 to 55.2% in elderly population residing in the east while 40 to 66% prevalent among those in the west. Moreover, the most common sites of pain in older people are the back, leg, knee or hip, and 'other' joints (such as joints of fingers, wrists and toes) in the most developed countries.

Chronic pain significantly impairs the health status and daily life of the elderly. Previous studies have found that chronic pain impairs the activities of daily living, dignity, sleep quality and quality of life. Chronic pain was also reported to cause social isolation, fatigue and depression in the elderly. Moreover, chronic pain can increase the utilization of medical resources of society as well as the healthcare costs of individuals. Despite a series of studies on chronic pain in the elderly, the prevalence and impacts of chronic pain in the elderly remain underestimated. Pain is always a recognized feature of old age to both physicians and caregivers. In terms of the elderly, nociception may change with aging, and the affected elderly become accustomed to living with chronic pain, causing them not to report their pain or seek medical attention. Some elderly populations suffering from moderate to severe pain reported no pain management, and some have concerned about using analgesics, resulting in misuse of potentially helpful treatments. Fortunately, one-third of older peoples could use both pharmacologic strategies and nonpharmacologic strategies to manage pain. The most prevalent nonpharmacologic strategies among them were exercise, nutritional supplements, ointments, heat and massage. Nevertheless, there were substantial ethnic disparities reported in pain prevalence, conditions and coping strategies. It is necessary to gain insight into the prevalence and pain-related health-seeking behaviors in the elderly according to different cultural and economic backgrounds.

### Participation in physical activity and back pain among an elderly population in south Asia [^111wDrxJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, chronic musculoskeletal pain is one of the most challenging health conditions encountered by the elderly population and health practitioners. Back pain, being the most common of all musculoskeletal conditions, has a lifetime prevalence of ~60%–80% among adult population in the Western countries. In the global Burden of Disease 2010 Study, low back pain (LBP) was reported to cause more global disability than any other condition (out of 291 conditions). In the UK, LBP affects around one-third of the adult population each year of whom about one-fifth will consult their general practitioners (GPs) about their back pain. However, currently there is insufficient evidence to know whether or not LBP is a result of aging, and if there is any etiological differences between LBP during early and late stages of life. Findings from review studies have suggested that the prevalence of LBP increases linearly from the third decade of life until the 60 years of age. Thus, with the expanding proportion of elderly population the burden of LBP is likely to increase in the coming decades and has the potential for causing significant challenges for primary health care service systems especially in the developing countries.

LBP is a major health problem among the elderly not only because of the high prevalence, but also because of the adverse impacts on functional mobility, activities of daily living, sleep quality, psychological symptoms and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL).–Apart from the health-related issues, back pain has been shown to be associated with increased medical expenditure, workplace absenteeism and early retirement, which altogether can have serious impacts of socioeconomic well-being at individual and community level. The etiology of back pain is multifarious; however, the common causes ranges from injuries and mechanical problems, such as intervertebral disk degeneration, vertebral fractures, herniated disks and myofascial pain. Given the diverse nature of the problem, LBP is managed by various health care providers, such as GP, family practitioners, neurologists, rheumatologists, emergency physicians, and orthopedic and neurological surgeons. Appropriate prevention and management strategies starting at the primary care level hold the potential to reduce the prevalence of population living with chronic back pain, for which a wide variety of cause-specific treatment and therapeutic options are available. A balanced approach by considering patients overall physical and psychological factors are believed to be most effective for effective management of LBP.

### Management of persistent pain in the older patient: a clinical review [^1163oQRW]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Persistent pain is highly prevalent, costly, and frequently disabling in later life.

Objective

To describe barriers to the management of persistent pain among older adults, summarize current management approaches, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic modalities; present rehabilitative approaches; and highlight aspects of the patient-physician relationship that can help to improve treatment outcomes. This review is relevant for physicians who seek an age-appropriate approach to delivering pain care for the older adult.

Evidence Acquisition

Search of MEDLINE and the Cochrane database from January 1990 through May 2014, using the search terms older adults, senior, ages 65 and above, elderly, and aged along with non-cancer pain, chronic pain, persistent pain, pain management, intractable pain, and refractory pain to identify English-language peer-reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, Cochrane reviews, consensus statements, and guidelines relevant to the management of persistent pain in older adults.

Findings

Of the 92 identified studies, 35 evaluated pharmacologic interventions, whereas 57 examined nonpharmacologic modalities; the majority (n = 50) focused on older adults with osteoarthritis. This evidence base supports a stepwise approach with acetaminophen as first-line therapy. If treatment goals are not met, a trial of a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, tramadol, or both is recommended. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not recommended for long-term use. Careful surveillance to monitor for toxicity and efficacy is critical, given that advancing age increases risk for adverse effects. A multimodal approach is strongly recommended-emphasizing a combination of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments to include physical and occupational rehabilitation, as well as cognitive-behavioral and movement-based interventions. An integrated pain management approach is ideally achieved by cultivating a strong therapeutic alliance between the older patient and the physician.

Conclusions and Relevance

Treatment planning for persistent pain in later life requires a clear understanding of the patient's treatment goals and expectations, comorbidities, and cognitive and functional status, as well as coordinating community resources and family support when available. A combination of pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and rehabilitative approaches in addition to a strong therapeutic alliance between the patient and physician is essential in setting, adjusting, and achieving realistic goals of therapy.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^111xhHRp]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

Impact of chronic pain on health care resources — definitions, prevalence, and disparities — includes that the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines chronic pain as pain that exists beyond an expected time frame for healing, while ASIPP defines it as pain that persists 6 months after an injury with features including potential nonresponse to routine pain control. High‑impact chronic pain identifies individuals with substantial restriction in daily activities. Population‑based studies report adult prevalence between 11% and 40%. The CDC report from 2019 to 2021 indicates that during 2021 an estimated 20.9% of U.S. adults experienced chronic pain, similar to 20.4% in 2016; high‑impact chronic pain in 2021 was 6.9% versus 8% in 2016, and the age‑adjusted prevalence in 2021 was 6.4%, aligning with the Healthy People 2030 Objective. Epidemiologic patterns show chronic pain increases with age, is reported more by females than males, with pain intensity and pain‑related disabilities more frequent in females, and greater pain‑related impact on QOL among those with lower socioeconomic status.

### Innovations in acute and chronic pain biomarkers: enhancing diagnosis and personalized therapy [^115ytuLQ]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Definitions and types of biomarkers for chronic pain

Pain is a multifaceted physiological and psychological phenomenon, presenting challenges in both research and clinical treatment due to its subjective nature and individual variability in perception. The gold standard and primary method for assessing pain is subjective reporting, such as pain rating scales. However, in situations where self-reporting is not feasible, such as with very young, elderly, inﬁrm, or unconscious patients, objective biomarkers are crucial.

### Estimated rates of incident and persistent chronic pain among US adults, 2019–2020 [^113BfCPg]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, the incidence of chronic pain (52.4 cases per 1000 PY) was high compared with other chronic diseases and conditions for which the incidence in the US adult population is known, including diabetes, depression, and hypertension. This comparison emphasizes the high disease burden of chronic pain in the US adult population and the need for both prevention and early management of pain before it can become chronic, especially for groups at higher risk.

### Chronic pain in people living with dementia: challenges to recognising and managing pain, and personalising intervention by phenotype [^115jQ5Rp]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Pain is common in people with dementia, and pain can exacerbate the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. Effective pain management is challenging, not least in people with dementia. Impairments of cognition, communication and abstract thought can make communicating pain unreliable or impossible. It is unclear which biopsychosocial interventions for pain management are effective in people with dementia, and which interventions for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are effective in people with pain. The result is that drugs, physical therapies and psychological therapies might be either underused or overused. People with dementia and pain could be helped by assessment processes that characterise an individual's pain experience and dementia behaviours in a mechanistic manner, phenotyping. Chronic pain management has moved from a 'one size fits all' approach, towards personalised medicine, where interventions recommended for an individual depend upon the key mechanisms underlying their pain, and the relative values they place on benefits and adverse effects. Mechanistic phenotyping through careful personalised evaluation would define the mechanisms driving pain and dementia behaviours in an individual, enabling the formulation of a personalised intervention strategy. Central pain processing mechanisms are particularly likely to be important in people with pain and dementia, and interventions to accommodate and address these may be particularly helpful, not only to relieve pain but also the symptoms of dementia.

### Estimated rates of incident and persistent chronic pain among US adults, 2019–2020 [^115Jm5Lp]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the rates of chronic pain (pain "most days" or "every day") and high-impact chronic pain (chronic pain that limits life or work activities on most days or every day) incidence and persistence in US adults?

Findings

In this cohort study of 10 415 adult participants in the National Health Interview Survey 2019–2020 Longitudinal Cohort, the incidence rates of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain in 2020 were 52.4 cases per 1000 person-years (PY) and 12.0 cases per 1000 PY, respectively. Among adults with baseline chronic pain, the rate of persistent chronic pain was 462.0 cases per 1000 PY.

Meaning

These longitudinal data emphasize the high disease burden of chronic pain in the US adult population and the need for early management of pain.

### Abdominal pain in the geriatric patient [^114PnMmF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain in the elderly can be a challenging and difficult condition to diagnose and treat. The geriatric population has significant comorbidities and often takes polypharmacy that can mask symptoms. The presentation of common conditions can be different than that in the younger population, often lacking the traditional indicators of disease, making it of pivotal importance for the clinician to consider a wide differential during their workup. It is also important to consider extra-abdominal abnormality that may manifest as abdominal pain.

### Guidance on the management of pain in older people [^114TwJTp]. Age and Ageing (2013). Low credibility.

This guidance document reviews the epidemiology and management of pain in older people via a literature review of published research. The aim of this document is to inform health professionals in any care setting who work with older adults on best practice for the management of pain and to identify where there are gaps in the evidence that require further research. The assessment of pain in older people has not been covered within this guidance and can be found in a separate document (http://www.britishpainsociety.org/pub_professional.htm#assessmentpop). Substantial differences in the population, methods and definitions used in published research makes it difficult to compare across studies and impossible to determine the definitive prevalence of pain in older people. There are inconsistencies within the literature as to whether or not pain increases or decreases in this age group, and whether this is influenced by gender. There is, however, some evidence that the prevalence of pain is higher within residential care settings. The three most common sites of pain in older people are the back; leg/knee or hip and 'other' joints. In common with the working-age population, the attitudes and beliefs of older people influence all aspects of their pain experience. Stoicism is particularly evident within this cohort of people. Evidence from the literature search suggests that paracetamol should be considered as first-line treatment for the management of both acute and persistent pain, particularly that which is of musculoskeletal origin, due to its demonstrated efficacy and good safety profile. There are few absolute contraindications and relative cautions to prescribing paracetamol. It is, however, important that the maximum daily dose (4 g/24 h) is not exceeded. Non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be used with caution in older people after other safer treatments have not provided sufficient pain relief. The lowest dose should be provided, for the shortest duration. For older adults, an NSAID or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitor should be co-prescribed with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and the one with the lowest acquisition cost should be chosen. All older people taking NSAIDs should be routinely monitored for gastrointestinal, renal and cardiovascular side effects, and drug–drug and drug–disease interactions. Opioid therapy may be considered for patients with moderate or severe pain, particularly if the pain is causing functional impairment or is reducing their quality of life. However, this must be individualised and carefully monitored. Opioid side effects including nausea and vomiting should be anticipated and suitable prophylaxis considered. Appropriate laxative therapy, such as the combination of a stool softener and a stimulant laxative, should be prescribed throughout treatment for all older people who are prescribed opioid therapy. Tricyclic antidepressants and anti-epileptic drugs have demonstrated efficacy in several types of neuropathic pain. But, tolerability and adverse effects limit their use in an older population. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections in osteoarthritis of the knee are effective in relieving pain in the short term, with little risk of complications and/or joint damage. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid is effective and free of systemic adverse effects. It should be considered in patients who are intolerant to systemic therapy. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid appears to have a slower onset of action than intra-articular steroids, but the effects seem to last longer. The current evidence for the use of epidural steroid injections in the management of sciatica is conflicting and, until further larger studies become available, no firm recommendations can be made. There is, however, a limited body of evidence to support the use of epidural injections in spinal stenosis. The literature review suggests that assistive devices are widely used and that the ownership of devices increases with age. Such devices enable older people with chronic pain to live in the community. However, they do not necessarily reduce pain and can increase pain if used incorrectly. Increasing activity by way of exercise should be considered. This should involve strengthening, flexibility, endurance and balance, along with a programme of education. Patient preference should be given serious consideration. A number of complementary therapies have been found to have some efficacy among the older population, including acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and massage. Such approaches can affect pain and anxiety and are worth further investigation. Some psychological approaches have been found to be useful for the older population, including guided imagery, biofeedback training and relaxation. There is also some evidence supporting the use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) among nursing home populations, but of course these approaches require training and time. There are many areas that require further research, including pharmacological management where approaches are often tested in younger populations and then translated across. Prevalence studies need consistency in terms of age, diagnosis and terminology, and further work needs to be done on evaluating non-pharmacological approaches.
