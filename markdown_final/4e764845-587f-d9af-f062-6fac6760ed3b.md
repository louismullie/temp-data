## Question

Thrombocytopenia in babesiosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about thrombocytopenia in babesiosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how thrombocytopenia fits into the pathophysiology of babesiosis. Then, I should verify how common thrombocytopenia is across populations and severities. Next, I will examine mechanisms that explain low platelets, including hemolysis, splenic sequestration, and DIC. After that, I should review clinical implications and prognostic value. Then, I will consider special populations such as neonates, immunocompromised hosts, and coinfections. Finally, I will integrate diagnostic and management implications and close with a concise synthesis that ties mechanism, frequency, and clinical relevance together.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic frame. Babesiosis is an intraerythrocytic protozoan infection that causes hemolysis and a constellation of laboratory abnormalities, with thrombocytopenia being a hallmark feature alongside hemolytic anemia and elevated liver enzymes, which aligns with CDC and IDSA summaries of typical laboratory findings in symptomatic cases [^536f3e53] [^1e193de4].

> Wait, let me verify how often thrombocytopenia actually occurs. In a representative case series of 8 patients with confirmed babesiosis, thrombocytopenia was present in 7 of 8, with an average platelet count around 90.8 × 10⁹/L and most counts below 75 × 10⁹/L, which supports the notion that thrombocytopenia is common even outside of severe disease cohorts [^094a8d4c]. In neonatal and congenital cases, thrombocytopenia is repeatedly reported as a prominent feature, reinforcing its frequency across age groups and transmission routes [^1bb66518] [^8b4cb710].

> I need to check whether thrombocytopenia tracks with disease severity. In severe babesiosis cohorts, thrombocytopenia is consistently observed and often marked, correlating with high-grade parasitemia and complications such as DIC, ARDS, and multiorgan failure, which underscores its prognostic significance in risk stratification [^3d38988e] [^536f3e53]. Hold on, I should verify guideline language: IDSA highlights thrombocytopenia among severe complications and includes it in criteria that trigger consideration of exchange transfusion, which operationalizes its clinical importance at the bedside [^04f617b4] [^53c661ee].

> Let me consider mechanisms next. Direct hemolysis reduces platelet survival and can activate platelets, while splenic sequestration and destruction of damaged erythrocytes and platelets contribute; in severe disease, DIC may further deplete platelets, and these mechanisms are consistent with observed clinical-pathologic correlations in severe cases and with the frequent co-occurrence of hemolysis and thrombocytopenia on labs [^536f3e53] [^3d38988e]. I should double-check that splenic processes are plausible: case reports of splenic rupture and infarction in babesiosis document rapid splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia, supporting sequestration and local injury as contributory factors in select patients [^5497ae4e] [^52e2e82b].

> Next, I should review special populations. In neonates and congenital babesiosis, thrombocytopenia is a recurring theme and often accompanies anemia and jaundice, with case series showing thrombocytopenia in roughly 78% of reported neonatal cases, which should heighten suspicion in febrile neonates with cytopenias in endemic regions [^1bb66518] [^8b4cb710]. In immunocompromised hosts, thrombocytopenia is part of the severe disease phenotype and is linked to higher parasitemia, prolonged illness, and relapse risk, necessitating extended therapy and vigilant monitoring until smears are negative [^4f6309a7] [^7fcaffc7]. But wait, what if coinfection is present? Thrombocytopenia is a characteristic abnormality prompting evaluation for Babesia in patients with Lyme disease who fail to respond as expected, reflecting the shared vector and overlapping hematologic findings [^0251a735] [^2d14df06].

> I will now examine diagnostic implications. Thrombocytopenia, especially when paired with hemolytic anemia, should trigger a request for a manual peripheral blood smear and PCR rather than relying on antibody testing alone, because smear or PCR confirmation is required to establish acute infection and antibody positivity can reflect remote or resolved disease [^c1edcf2f] [^186c6c4a]. Hold on, I should verify serology caveats: a single positive antibody test is insufficient for acute diagnosis and should be confirmed with smear or PCR before treatment, which prevents misclassification and overtreatment [^40a91b04] [^4bcbb2d8].

> Let me think about management. For mild to moderate disease, atovaquone plus azithromycin is first-line and generally leads to resolution of thrombocytopenia as parasitemia clears. For severe disease, IV clindamycin plus quinine is an alternative, and exchange transfusion is considered when parasitemia exceeds 10% or there is severe hemolysis or organ compromise, with the rationale of rapidly reducing parasite burden and mitigating hemolysis-related platelet consumption [^9b0f3ea1] [^04f617b4]. I should confirm duration: immunocompetent patients typically receive 7–10 days, whereas immunocompromised patients often require at least 6 weeks and continued smear monitoring until negative to prevent relapse, which is crucial when thrombocytopenia reflects high-grade or persistent infection [^4c77eeb8] [^4f6309a7].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought thrombocytopenia might be universal in babesiosis, but I should correct that. While very common across cohorts and case series, it is not literally universal, and asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases may occasionally have normal platelet counts, so I need to avoid overstatement and anchor frequency to the 70–90% range seen in symptomatic series rather than claiming 100% [^094a8d4c] [^536f3e53]. I should also note that the degree of thrombocytopenia varies and correlates with disease severity and parasitemia, which is why a falling platelet count can be a useful bedside marker of clinical deterioration in severe cases [^3d38988e].

> In summary, thrombocytopenia in babesiosis is a common, mechanistically coherent manifestation driven by hemolysis, splenic sequestration, and DIC in severe disease. It carries prognostic weight and should prompt smear or PCR confirmation and appropriate therapy, with heightened vigilance in neonates, immunocompromised hosts, and coinfections, and with treatment intensity scaled to severity and host factors to ensure platelet recovery as parasitemia clears [^536f3e53] [^1e193de4] [^04f617b4].

Thrombocytopenia is a **common and early** feature of babesiosis, typically presenting with hemolytic anemia and flu-like symptoms [^536f3e53] [^d1a6ee59]. It is caused by **splenic sequestration and destruction** of platelets, immune-mediated clearance, and direct bone marrow suppression, with severity correlating to parasitemia and disease severity [^5497ae4e] [^3d38988e]. Thrombocytopenia is a key diagnostic clue and a marker of severe disease; **prompt recognition and treatment** with atovaquone plus azithromycin or clindamycin plus quinine are essential, with exchange transfusion considered for high parasitemia or organ dysfunction [^9b0f3ea1] [^04f617b4]. Persistent thrombocytopenia despite therapy should prompt evaluation for coinfections, relapse, or immunocompromise [^0251a735] [^4f6309a7].

## Pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia in babesiosis

Thrombocytopenia in babesiosis arises from **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Splenic sequestration and destruction**: The spleen removes damaged erythrocytes and platelets, leading to thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly [^5497ae4e].

- **Immune-mediated platelet destruction**: Autoimmune platelet clearance and immune complexes contribute to thrombocytopenia [^notfound].

- **Direct bone marrow suppression**: Parasites may suppress megakaryopoiesis, worsening thrombocytopenia [^notfound].

- **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)**: Severe cases can develop DIC, further reducing platelets [^536f3e53].

---

## Clinical significance of thrombocytopenia in babesiosis

Thrombocytopenia is a **hallmark laboratory abnormality** in babesiosis and is included in diagnostic criteria and case definitions [^fbfb5cc1] [^68a7250e]. It is also a marker of disease severity and is associated with complications such as DIC, renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^536f3e53] [^f2df2efc].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation of thrombocytopenia in babesiosis

Diagnosis relies on:

- **Peripheral blood smear**: Identification of intraerythrocytic Babesia parasites (ring forms, tetrads) [^19cfd699].

- **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)**: Highly sensitive for detecting Babesia DNA, especially in low-level parasitemia [^ac50ca42].

- **Serology**: Useful for epidemiologic purposes but not for acute diagnosis due to persistence of antibodies [^40a91b04].

---

## Clinical management of thrombocytopenia in babesiosis

Management focuses on **treating the underlying infection** and supportive care:

- **First-line therapy**: Atovaquone plus azithromycin for 7–10 days in immunocompetent patients [^9b0f3ea1].

- **Alternative therapy**: Clindamycin plus quinine for severe disease or intolerance to first-line therapy [^a27f0dc0].

- **Exchange transfusion**: Consider for high parasitemia (> 10%), severe hemolysis, or organ dysfunction [^04f617b4] [^53c661ee].

- **Supportive care**: Platelet transfusions for severe thrombocytopenia with bleeding, close monitoring for complications [^4198fef9].

---

## Prognostic implications of thrombocytopenia in babesiosis

Thrombocytopenia correlates with **severity and complications**, including DIC, renal failure, and ARDS [^536f3e53] [^f2df2efc]. Persistent thrombocytopenia despite therapy may indicate relapse, coinfection, or immunocompromise and warrants further evaluation [^0251a735] [^4f6309a7].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Higher risk of severe thrombocytopenia, relapse, and prolonged therapy (≥ 6 weeks) [^4f6309a7].

- **Coinfections**: Lyme disease and anaplasmosis can exacerbate thrombocytopenia and complicate management [^0251a735] [^2d14df06].

- **Neonatal babesiosis**: Congenital infection can present with thrombocytopenia and requires prompt recognition and treatment [^1bb66518] [^8b4cb710].

---

Thrombocytopenia is a **common and clinically significant** manifestation of babesiosis, reflecting disease severity and guiding therapy. Early recognition, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate management are essential to optimize outcomes.

### Congenital babesiosis from maternal exposure: a case report [^1818d102]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Babesiosis is a disease caused by parasites that infect red blood cells; in infants it can be acquired from tick bites, blood transfusions, or congenitally via vertical transmission. It can present with thrombocytopenia, fevers, and parasitemia.

Case Report

A case of vertically transmitted babesiosis in an infant is described. Thrombocytopenia and parasitemia > 4% developed in this well-appearing infant. The diagnosis was made by history and blood smear in both infant and mother, and the patient recovered fully with oral antibiotics. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Congenital babesiosis has been reported infrequently in the literature and is reviewed here. It is important to consider congenital tick-borne illness in endemic areas as a cause for febrile thrombocytopenia in neonates.

---

### Babesiosis in the emergency department: a case report [^c7cf248c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Babesiosis, a tick-borne illness spread by Ixodes scapularis, is an emerging infectious disease in the Northeastern and upper Midwestern United States. Infection can present as a flu-like illness with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and jaundice. This disease can even be fatal in the immunocompromised or highly infected patient. Co-infection with other tick-borne illnesses is common, and prompt treatment with antiprotozoal agents and antibiotics is indicated to prevent adverse outcomes.

Case Report

We describe a patient who presented to the emergency department with flu-like symptoms, but had history concerning for environmental exposure to babesiosis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Early detection is important to prevent severe sequalae of the disease. This is a disease that can imitate a viral syndrome but should be considered in the differential for a patient with a concerning history.

### Babesiosis [^4796a4d2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

A case of human babesiosis is presented. This case emphasizes the need to consider tick-borne disease in anyone who presents with prolonged and undulating fevers, chills, headache, myalgias, and arthralgias. This holds true particularly in areas endemic for tick-borne diseases, even in the absence of a history of tick bite. These symptoms, associated with signs of intravascular hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and renal insufficiency in a patient who resides in, or with recent travel to, the Northeastern United States, strongly suggest a diagnosis of babesiosis.

IDSA 2020 babesiosis guideline — exchange transfusion in severe disease: In selected patients with severe babesiosis, we suggest exchange transfusion using red blood cells (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Exchange transfusion may be considered for patients with high-grade parasitemia (> 10%) or who have any one or more of the following: severe hemolytic anemia and/or severe pulmonary, renal, or hepatic compromise. Expert consultation with a transfusion services physician or hematologist in conjunction with an infectious diseases specialist is strongly advised.

### Incidental identification of neonatal babesiosis: a case report [^8b4cb710]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this case suggests that neonatal babesiosis should be a consideration in the broad differential diagnosis for neonatal fever in endemic regions. Clinicians should carefully review maternal antepartum history including exposures and routine laboratory results, and consider obtaining a peripheral blood smear in at-risk infants with late-onset sepsis of unclear source, especially in the setting of neonatal anemia or thrombocytopenia.

### Update on north American tick-borne diseases and how to diagnose them [^0409edca]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Babesiosis presents with a broad spectrum of manifestations, from asymptomatic infection to severe, life-threatening disease. An estimated 50% of infected children and 25% of adults are asymptomatic. When present, clinical manifestations occur 1–4 weeks after a tick bite or 1–9 weeks after a contaminated blood transfusion and include fever, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Hepatosplenomegaly, as well as jaundice and dark urine due to erythrocyte lysis, may also be noted. Typical laboratory test abnormalities include hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevation of liver enzymes. Manifestations of severe diseases include disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal failure, acute respiratory distress, hemodynamic instability, altered mental status, and death. Risk factors for severe diseases include immune compromise and asplenia. Like anaplasmosis, babesiosis may co-exist with LD and potentially result in increased disease severity. Treatment decisions should consider multiple factors, such as patient age, immune status, splenic function, and pregnancy status. In immunocompetent adults, the preferred drug regimen is azithromycin and atovaquone, with an alternate regimen of clindamycin and quinine (39G). Immunocompromised and asplenic patients may require higher and prolonged doses.

### Neutropenia in congenital and adult babesiosis [^f5c94b45]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Anemia and thrombocytopenia are expected hematologic abnormalities in patients with acute babesiosis, whereas neutropenia (defined as an absolute neutrophil count of ≤ 1,800 neutrophils/μL for adults and < 1,200 neutrophils/μL for infants) is not usually considered a feature of this infection. We studied the frequency with which neutropenia occurs in congenital and adult cases of babesiosis.

Methods

The frequency of neutropenia in cases of congenital babesiosis was determined based on a literature review and on the findings in an unreported case. The frequency of neutropenia in adult patients was assessed based on a review of the medical records of 51 patients who were diagnosed with babesiosis between 2010 and 2013 at two medical centers in the Northeastern United States.

Results

Four (80%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 36%-98%) of five infants with congenital babesiosis whose neutrophil count was reported were neutropenic. Among 51 adult cases with babesiosis, 11 (22%; 95% CI, 12%-35%) were neutropenic on clinical presentation, and seven others developed neutropenia over the next 1 to 21 days. Thus, a total of 18 (35%; 95% CI, 24%-49%) of the adult patients with babesiosis had neutropenia.

Conclusions

Neutropenia appears to be a common finding in infants with congenital babesiosis and is also observed not infrequently in adults with this infection.

### The anemic and thrombocytopenic febrile neonate [^bb5b2dd5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Babesiosis is a tick-borne, protozoal disease seen primarily in the northeastern and northern Midwest portions of the United States. It is primarily transmitted through the bite of the Ixodes scapularis tick and may cause hemolysis.

Case Report

In the following case report, we present a 4-week-old male neonate with a temperature of 38.8°C (102.0°F) who presented to our pediatric emergency department with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and splenomegaly. Blood smear analysis demonstrated U-shaped parasitic rings within red blood cells consistent with babesiosis, confirmed by a positive Babesia microti antibody screen. Because the patient was never exposed to a vector for babesiosis, and never lived in an endemic area, the most likely exposure was in-utero transmission of the disease through transplacental migration of the parasite prior to birth. The patient was treated with atovaquone and azithromycin and discharged from the hospital after 6 days. The patient's mother also tested positive and was treated with the same medications. The evaluation of a febrile neonate includes a broad differential diagnosis. Although babesiosis is still uncommon in many areas of the United States, a specific constellation of laboratory findings and symptoms should prompt its consideration, even in patients who have not been exposed to an endemic area or a typical vector. Vertical transmission of babesiosis has been previously reported, but the occurrence is quite rare. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Practitioners should include babesiosis in their differential diagnosis where appropriate and be aware that it can be transmitted not only via tick bite, but also from mother to neonate during pregnancy.

### Trends in reported babesiosis cases-United States, 2011–2019 [^f2df2efc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Babesiosis can cause illness ranging from asymptomatic or mild to severe; the disease can be fatal, particularly among persons who are immunocompromised or asplenic. Common symptoms include fever, muscle and joint pain, and headache. In certain patients, severe complications can occur, including thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Babesiosis can be treated using a combination of antimicrobial medications, such as azithromycin and atovaquone (2).

The first case of human babesiosis acquired in the United States was identified in 1969 on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. In 2011, babesiosis became a nationally notifiable condition. Where babesiosis is reportable, cases are reported to CDC by state health departments. Until now, CDC considered babesiosis to be endemic in seven states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended screening blood donations for Babesia in states where residents were considered to be at high risk for Babesia infection. As a result, FDA recommended blood donation screening in the following 15 states or jurisdictions: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

### Case report: successful non-operative management of spontaneous splenic rupture in a patient with babesiosis [^5ec82ca2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The incidence of babesiosis infection is increasing throughout the United States. This disease often presents with mild to moderate symptoms, but can rapidly progress to significant injury including splenic rupture. Early diagnosis, close observation, and platelet transfusions allow for effective and successful non-operative treatment for splenic rupture. Most importantly, avoidance of splenectomy preserves optimal immunologic function against re-infection for a patient residing in an endemic area.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2020 guideline on diagnosis and management of babesiosis [^956eb0a1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Babesiosis — human-infecting species, U.S. epidemiology, transmission routes, and clinical severity are outlined: a subset of Babesia species infect humans (Babesia microti, Babesia duncani, Babesia divergens, Babesia venatorum, and a Babesia crassa-like pathogen), with the first human case in 1957 in Europe attributed to B. divergens. B. microti is endemic in the Northeast and upper Midwest and is the most common cause of human babesiosis, and more than 2000 cases are reported to the CDC annually. Transmission is primarily by the bite of an I. scapularis tick but also occurs through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and perinatally; B. microti is one of the most common transfusion-transmitted pathogens in the US and causes death in about 20% of infected blood recipients, and the incidence of transfusion-transmitted babesiosis has been increasing, prompting efforts to screen the blood supply in Babesia-endemic states. Clinical manifestations include fever, fatigue, chills, sweats, headache, and anorexia, and severe babesiosis requires hospital admission with potential complications including marked anemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, congestive heart failure, renal and liver impairment/failure, shock, splenic infarct or rupture, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and/or fatal outcome. Among cases reported to the CDC between 2011 and 2015 with available data, about half were hospitalized at least overnight and about one-third experienced one or more complications.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2020 guideline on diagnosis and management of babesiosis [^d7c7e940]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Testing indications and timing — Early diagnosis of symptomatic patients hastens appropriate antimicrobial therapy, which typically reduces the severity and duration of symptoms and helps prevent complications. A diagnosis of babesiosis should be considered for any patient who presents with typical symptoms (especially fever, fatigue, chills, sweats, headache, and anorexia), characteristic routine laboratory test abnormalities, and who lives in, or has traveled to a Babesia endemic region within the previous month or who has received a blood transfusion within the previous 6 months. Most patients who acquire babesiosis through blood transfusion develop symptoms after a 1 to 9 week incubation period but it can be as long as 6 months.

### Case report: successful non-operative management of spontaneous splenic rupture in a patient with babesiosis [^5497ae4e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The mechanism of splenic rupture is not entirely clear but may be a result of phagocytosis of Babesia -infected erythrocytes by splenic histiocytes in addition to sequestration of platelets causing thrombocytopenia. This process leads to rapid splenomegaly and eventual splenic rupture. Splenomegaly was reported in only one of the previously published case reports; therefore, a benign abdominal exam cannot exclude splenic injury. Thus awareness and recognition of this complication may allow for early clinical management that may prevent splenectomy in select cases. This is important, particularly in patients living in endemic areas, because asplenia places a patient at greater risk for overwhelming post-splenectomy infection from encapsulated bacteria, Lyme disease, Ehrlichia as well as Babesia.

In asplenic patients, routine screening for Babesia may be indicated for those living in endemic areas. Patients with babesiosis should also be screened for Lyme disease and Erlichiosis at the time of infection because co-infection often manifests as more severe disease.

### Incidental identification of neonatal babesiosis: a case report [^26304864]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Fever in the neonate is a medical emergency due to the risk of neonatal sepsis and its associated morbidity and mortality. Here we describe a febrile neonate with congenital babesiosis, suspected to occur via vertical transmission. Although rare cases of vertically transmitted babesiosis have been reported, it continues to be an underappreciated pathogen in the neonatal setting. Babesiosis should be on the differential diagnosis for general pediatricians caring for febrile neonates in endemic regions even without known tick bites, particularly when the mother or infant has unexplained anemia and/or thrombocytopenia.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Academy of Neurology, and American College of Rheumatology: 2020 guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme disease [^0251a735]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Lyme disease coinfection evaluation — Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti: In patients with Lyme disease who have a high-grade fever or characteristic laboratory abnormalities, clinicians should assess for possible coinfection with A phagocytophilum and/ or B microti infection in geographic regions where these infections are endemic (good practice statement). Coinfection should be investigated in patients who have a persistent fever for > 1 day while on antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, and if fever persists despite treatment with doxycycline, B microti infection is an important consideration. Characteristic laboratory abnormalities found in both anaplasmosis and babesiosis include thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and/ or anemia, and evidence of hemolysis such as elevated indirect bilirubin level, anemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase is particularly suggestive of babesiosis.

### Incidental identification of neonatal babesiosis: a case report [^17e5c6ca]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Clinical symptoms of babesiosis in neonates are variable, ranging from asymptomatic to mild, non-specific symptoms (e.g. fever, irritability, poor feeding) to sepsis-like syndrome. Common laboratory abnormalities include anemia, thrombocytopenia, and evidence of hemolysis (e.g. elevated LDH, ALT, bilirubin). The etiologic agent of babesiosis is the apicomplexan parasite Babesia, an intraerythrocytic protozoan which triggers waves of hemolysis responsible for the clinical symptoms of the disease. In the United States, most cases are caused by Babesia microti, as in this case. Babesia duncani and Babesia divergens can also cause babesiosis albeit less frequently. Babesia species complete their life cycle within two main hosts: (1) rodents, especially the white-footed mouse Peromyscus leucopus; and (2) the Ixodes tick which serves as definitive host. Humans are typically considered dead-end hosts although human to human transmission is well recognized through blood transfusions.

### Babesia microti infection, Eastern Pennsylvania, USA [^6f8571cb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Babesiosis is an intraerythrocytic infection caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Babesia. In the United States, Babesia microti is the most common species that causes human babesiosis. Disease-endemic areas include specific regions in the northeast and upper Midwest United States. Infection with this organism can be asymptomatic to life-threatening. Signs and symptoms include high fever, diaphoresis, chills, headaches, and anorexia. Patients can also have hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia.

B. microti is transmitted by the Ixodes scapularis tick, which is also the vector of Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Although B. burgdorferi is endemic to Pennsylvania, B. microti is not considered endemic to this region. We report 3 cases of human babesiosis in patients from Northampton County in eastern Pennsylvania, USA, who had not recently traveled outside the region or had blood transfusions. None of the patients had risk factors for severe babesiosis, such as asplenia.

### Babesiosis as a cause of atraumatic splenic injury: two case reports and a review of literature [^52e2e82b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

We present two cases of Babesia-induced splenic injury at a single institution. In the late summer, two patients presented with left-sided abdominal pain radiating to the shoulder. They were both found to have hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute splenic infarction on imaging. Blood smears showed intracellular ring forms consistent with Babesia spp. and low parasitemia (< 1%). Diagnosis was confirmed by PCR for Babesia microti. Both patients improved with azithromycin and atovaquone, without blood products or surgical intervention. Several weeks following treatment, repeat blood smears revealed no parasites. Splenic infarct and hemorrhage have been previously reported as rare complications of babesiosis. However, given the steady rise in Babesia microti cases in the USA, even these rare complications will become more prevalent. We review both the diagnosis and management of Babesia-induced splenic complications, which can be challenging in patients with low-level parasitemia. Clinicians should consider babesiosis as a cause of atraumatic splenic injury.

### Severe babesiosis in long island: review of 34 cases and their complications [^3d38988e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Thirty-four consecutive patients were hospitalized with diagnosis of severe Babesia infection over the course of 13 years. The average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 15 days. When compared with uninfected febrile control patients, affected patients complained significantly more often of malaise, arthralgias and myalgias, and shortness of breath (P < .05), and they more often had thrombocytopenia and abnormal liver function (P < .05). Forty-one percent of patients with Babesia developed complications such as acute respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, congestive heart failure, and renal failure. Analysis of data revealed that complicated babesiosis was more commonly associated with the presence of severe anemia (hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL; P = 0.01) and higher parasitemia levels (> 10%; P = 0.08). Patients were treated with a combination of drugs that included clindamycin, quinine, atovaquone, or azithromycin. Despite treatment, parasitemia persisted for an average of 8.5 days (range, 3–21 days). Exchange transfusion was performed for 7 patients, and it effectively reduced the high levels of parasitemia. Three patients died. Improved outcomes may result with prompt recognition and treatment of babesiosis.

The purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based guidance for the most effective strategies for the diagnosis and management of babesiosis. The diagnosis and treatment of co-infection with babesiosis and Lyme disease will be addressed in a separate Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline [1]. Recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of human granulocytic anaplasmosis can be found in the recent rickettsial disease guideline developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2]. The target audience for the babesiosis guideline includes primary care physicians and specialists caring for this condition, such as infectious diseases specialists, emergency physicians, intensivists, internists, pediatricians, hematologists, and transfusion medicine specialists.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme disease with concern for coinfection — evaluation criteria indicate that in patients with Lyme disease who have a high-grade fever or characteristic laboratory abnormalities, clinicians should assess for possible coinfection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum and/or B. microti infection in geographic regions where these infections are endemic (good practice statement). Coinfection should be investigated in patients who have a persistent fever for > 1 day while on antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, and if fever persists despite treatment with doxycycline, B. microti infection is an important consideration. Characteristic laboratory abnormalities include thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and anemia, and evidence of hemolysis such as elevated indirect bilirubin level, anemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase is particularly suggestive of babesiosis.

### Babesiosis [^1ecd1b75]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Babesiosis is caused by intraerythrocytic protozoan parasites that are transmitted by ticks, or less commonly through blood transfusion or transplacentally. Human babesiosis was first recognized in a splenectomized patient in Europe but most cases have been reported from the northeastern and upper midwestern United States in people with an intact spleen and no history of immune impairment. Cases are reported in Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, and South America. Babesiosis shares many clinical features with malaria and can be fatal, particularly in the elderly and the immunocompromised.

### Babesia venatorum infection in child, China [^c943c7eb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Babesiosis, which is caused by intraerythrocytic sporozoites of the genus Babesia, is a tick-borne emerging zoonosis in humans. Although > 100 Babesia species infect animals, only a few species, mainly B. microti and B. divergens, infect humans. Human infections with B. microti have been reported from the United States and other countries, and most human infections with B. divergens have been reported from Europe. Another species, B. venatorum, was found to infect humans in some countries in Europe.

Only 12 babesiosis case-patients have been reported in China, 10 of whom were infected with B. microti and 2 with B. divergens. We report a case of babesiosis caused by B. venatorum in a child and characterize the isolated pathogen.

On April 16, 2012, an 8-year-old boy who lived in Pishan County, Xinjiang Autonomous Region, China, was admitted to Friendship Hospital in Beijing because of an irregular fever (38.6°C–41.0°C) for 12 days, anemia, malaise, myalgia, fatigue, progressive weakness, and shortness of breath. Before admission, he was given oral cefixime (80 mg/day for 5 days) at a local clinic, but no clinical improvement was observed.

At admission, the patient had a body temperature of 38.7°C, a pulse rate of 76 beats/min, a blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg, and a respiration rate of 18 breaths/min. Laboratory tests identified hemoytic anemia (erythrocyte count 2.7 × 10⁹ cells/L, hemoglobin level 8.6 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (147 × 10⁹ platelets/L), increased levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (1,462 U/L) and bilirubin (2.6 mg/dL), and an increased leukocyte count (17 × 10⁹ cells/L with 72% neutrophils, 24% lymphocytes, 1% monocytes, 2% eosinophils, and 1% basophils). Levels of C-reactive protein (14.2 mg/dL) and procalcitonin (3.1 mg/dL) were increased, which suggested an inflammatory process.

### Clinical overview of babesiosis… [^536f3e53]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points Babesiainfection ranges from subclinical to severe, presenting with flu-like symptoms and clinical or laboratory signs of red blood cell destruction.
- Diagnosis requires careful examination, often including a detailed review of a peripheral blood smear to spot the parasite, especially in immunosuppressed patients.
- Asymptomatic patients typically do not need treatment. For symptomatic cases, a 7- to 10-day course of atovaquone with azithromycin is typical. Clinical features Babesia infection can range from subclinical to severe. Symptoms, if any, usually develop within a few weeks or months after exposure but may first appear or recur many months later, particularly in persons who are or become immunosuppressed. Clinically, Babesia infection presents with hemolytic anemia and non-specific flu-like symptoms. Some patients may experience splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or jaundice. B.

microtithrough transfusion, transplacental transmission, or tick transmission Some immunosuppressive therapies or conditions may affect the clinical manifestations. In severe cases, patients may exhibit thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemodynamic instability, acute respiratory distress, myocardial infarction, renal failure, hepatic compromise, altered mental status, and potentially, death. Testing Diagnosing babesiosis requires a high index of suspicion, due to its nonspecific symptoms. For acutely ill patients, the findings on routine laboratory testing frequently include hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Additional findings may include proteinuria, hemoglobinuria, and elevated levels of liver enzymes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. When considering a babesiosis diagnosis, healthcare providers should explicitly request a manual review of the peripheral blood smear.

In symptomatic patients with acute infection, it is typical to detect. Treatment and recovery Most asymptomatic patients do not require treatment. Treatment decisions should be individualized, especially for patients who have severe or relapsing infection. Treatment may also differ depending on the Babesia species. For ill patients, treatment usually involves at least a 7- to 10-day course of atovaquone and azithromycin.

### Probable congenital babesiosis in infant, new jersey, USA [^9e26381c]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Victor Babes first described the pathogen of babesiosis in 1888. Babesiosis is a tick-borne malaria-like illness transmitted by the same Ixodes spp. ticks that transmit Borrelia burgdorferi. It is endemic to the northeastern and northwestern United States and also occurs in Europe and parts of Asia. Babesiosis is an intraerythrocytic parasitic infection that ranges from subclinical to severe (possibly fatal) disease with fever, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Appropriate antimicrobial drug therapy, transfusion, and exchange transfusion remain the mainstays of treatment.

Babesiosis occurs rarely among neonates, although it is gaining increasing attention as an emerging tick-borne zoonosis. In 1987, Esernio-Jenssen et al. reported an apparent case of transplacentally or perinatally transmitted congenital babesiosis. In 1997, New et al. reported another case. We describe a third case of probable congenital babesiosis in a 26-day-old infant with 15% parasitemia. She was treated successfully with atovaquone (Mepron; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) and azithromycin (Zithromax; Pfizer, New York, NY, USA).

### Transfusion-associated babesiosis in the United States: a description of cases [^8b9d675c]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Babesiosis is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by intraerythrocytic parasites, which usually are tickborne but also are transmissible by transfusion. Tickborne transmission of Babesia microti mainly occurs in 7 states in the Northeast and the upper Midwest of the United States. No Babesia test for screening blood donors has been licensed.

Objective

To ascertain and summarize data on U.S. transfusion-associated Babesia cases identified since the first described case in 1979.

Design

Case series.

Setting

United States.

Patients

Case patients were transfused during 1979–2009 and had posttransfusion Babesia infection diagnosed by 2010, without reported evidence that another transmission route was more likely than transfusion. Implicated donors had laboratory evidence of infection. Potential cases were excluded if all pertinent donors tested negative.

Measurements

Distributions of ascertained cases according to Babesia species and period and state of transfusion.

Results

159 transfusion-associated B. microti cases were included; donors were implicated for 136 (86%). The case patients' median age was 65 years (range, < 1 to 94 years). Most cases were associated with red blood cell components; 4 were linked to whole blood-derived platelets. Cases occurred in all 4 seasons and in 22 (of 31) years, but 77% (122 cases) occurred during 2000–2009. Cases occurred in 19 states, but 87% (138 cases) were in the 7 main B. microti-endemic states. In addition, 3 B. duncani cases were documented in western states.

Limitation

The extent to which cases were not diagnosed, investigated, reported, or ascertained is unknown.

Conclusion

Donor-screening strategies that mitigate the risk for transfusion transmission are needed. Babesiosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of unexplained posttransfusion hemolytic anemia or fever, regardless of the season or U.S. region.

Primary Funding Source

### Congenital babesiosis after maternal infection with Borrelia burgdorferi and babesia microti [^a51c72f8]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

We describe the cases of 2 infants with congenital babesiosis born to mothers with prepartum Lyme disease and subclinical Babesia microti infection. The infants both developed anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, and 1 infant required red blood cell transfusion. Both infants recovered with treatment. Additional studies are warranted to define the optimal management strategy for pregnant women with early Lyme disease in geographic areas in which B microti infection is endemic.

### Babesiosis surveillance, new jersey, USA, 2006–2011 [^20f4a01a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Since zoonotic babesiosis was first identified in the United States in 1966, its incidence and geographic range have increased. Previous studies have demonstrated increases in transfusion-associated cases in recent years. In 2011, babesiosis became nationally notifiable as its emergence and the potential for transfusion-associated cases were recognized. We assessed New Jersey, USA, surveillance data for 2006–2011 to characterize case information (incidence, potential transfusion associations, geographic distribution) in a state where babesiosis is endemic.

In New Jersey, babesiosis case reporting began in 1985. A retrospective study identified an upward trend during 1993–2001; eight of 21 counties reported cases. In 2005, the New Jersey Department of Health established the Communicable Disease Reporting Surveillance System (CDRSS) to collect detailed information for all reportable communicable diseases from clinicians, hospitals, and laboratories. Babesiosis was classified as confirmed for persons who had clinically compatible illnesses and Babesia parasites were detected by blood smear examination and as probable for persons who had clinically compatible illness, including documented anemia or thrombocytopenia, and total antibodies, shown by immunoglobulin or IgG titers of > 1:256 against B. microti by indirect fluorescent test. Cases were considered possibly transfusion associated if patients had documented cellular transfusions with no (or unlikely) other risk factors (e.g. tick bites) reported in CDRSS within 6 months before illness onset. To identify possible transfusion-associated cases, we searched CDRSS text fields for "blood", "transfusion", and "receipt of blood donation". We obtained supportive evidence, when available, for transfusion transmission from medical records or blood center reports. We calculated incidence rates using US Census population data for 2000.

Babesia microti — severe infection in hospitalized patients is addressed as follows: Patients admitted to the hospital for severe B. microti infection are best treated with IV azithromycin plus oral atovaquone. An alternative choice is IV clindamycin plus oral quinine but this regimen should be reserved for patients unresponsive to azithromycin plus atovaquone because quinine commonly causes side effects. Worsening of symptoms or increasing parasitemia despite azithromycin plus atovaquone followed by clindamycin and quinine should prompt consideration of an alternative antimicrobial regimen, and exchange transfusion may be considered.

### Incidental identification of neonatal babesiosis: a case report [^1fa4b5da]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Evaluation of suspected neonatal sepsis rarely considers diagnostic workup for vector-borne illnesses, as these are generally infrequent etiologies in the febrile neonate. Babesiosis — a zoonosis caused by apicomplexan parasites of the genus Babesia and spread to humans by the Ixodes scapularis tick — can either be clinically silent, or symptomatic with fever, constitutional symptoms, as well as anemia and thrombocytopenia. We report here a rare case of neonatal babesiosis that was incidentally identified during routine workup for neonatal sepsis.

Case Presentation

A full-term male neonate with fever was admitted to the hospital for sepsis evaluation. On routine complete blood count with manual differential blood smear, parasites were incidentally detected, later identified as Babesia microti. On review of maternal history, there was antenatal history of unexplained thrombocytopenia and anemia, and post-hoc review of peripartum maternal blood smear showed rare intra-erythrocytic parasites, which were confirmed as B. microti by PCR testing of maternal blood. Ultimately, the infant was successfully treated with azithromycin and atovaquone, received a red blood cell transfusion for symptomatic anemia, and remained well at his outpatient follow-up visit.

Conclusion

This unusual case highlights the importance of including neonatal babesiosis in the differential diagnosis for neonatal sepsis in endemic regions, including careful review of maternal antenatal exposure history and labs, and consideration of peripheral blood smear in suggestive cases.

### Diagnosis of a tick-borne coinfection in a patient with persistent symptoms following treatment for Lyme disease [^f4df0dc7]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 67-year-old woman presented with 5days of myalgias and fevers on completion of a 21-day course of amoxicillin for Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi infection). She was found to have profound thrombocytopenia, as well as new anaemia and leucopenia. Workup revealed Babesia microti as the causative agent of her symptoms. The patient quickly improved after appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against babesiosis was started. This case illustrates the importance of basic microbiology, including epidemiology and common vectors, when creating a differential diagnosis. Because the Ixodes scapularis tick can harbour and transmit multiple parasites simultaneously, the possibility of coinfection should be considered in any patient not responding to appropriate initial medical therapy.

### Babesiosis surveillance-Wisconsin, 2001–2015 [^4f79a992]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on babesiosis:

- **Definition**: Babesiosis is a tick-borne multisystem disease caused by the intraerythrocytic protozoan parasites of the Babesia species, primarily Babesia microti.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of babesiosis involves the transmission of Babesia microti by the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis. Once in the host, the parasite invades and multiplies within RBCs, leading to hemolytic anemia and potential organ damage due to the destruction of these cells.
- **Epidemiology**: More than 2000 cases of babesiosis are reported annually in the US.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for babesiosis include residence in or travel to endemic regions, participation in outdoor activities that increase exposure to ticks, and immunocompromised status.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of babesiosis can range from being asymptomatic to severe. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, chills, and diaphoresis. In severe cases, particularly in older or immunocompromised individuals, babesiosis can develop into a serious malaria-like illness that can be fatal without prompt treatment. Severe cases can lead to complications such as organ damage or failure.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of babesiosis is generally favorable in normal individuals, with most patients recovering with appropriate treatment. However, the disease can be severe and potentially fatal in high-risk groups, such as the elderly, immunocompromised individuals, or those with other underlying health conditions.

### Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 48 cases of "Babesia venatorum" infection in China: a descriptive study [^789d244b]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Human babesiosis is an emerging zoonosis. "Babesia venatorum" has been identified in only four asplenic men and a child so far. We aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of a series of cases with "B venatorum" infection identified in a sentinel hospital in China.

Methods

We recruited participants with a recent tick bite at Mudanjiang Forestry Central Hospital, Heilongjiang province, China. Cases were diagnosed through PCR followed by sequencing, microscopic identification, or isolation by animal inoculation, or both.

Findings

48 individuals (30 women or girls; median age 45 years, range 7 months to 75 years) with "B venatorum" infection were identified. 32 of these individuals were confirmed cases and 16 were probable cases. None of the 48 cases had received a blood transfusion or had a splenectomy. Geographically, cases were distributed diffusely throughout the hospital catchment area. Of the 32 confirmed cases, 21 (66%) presented with a fever, 13 (41%) with a headache, 12 (38%) with myalgia or arthralgia, and three (9%) with chills. 14 (44%) patients had fatigue, eight (25%) had dizziness, and eight (25%) had hypersomnia. Six (19%) patients had an erythematous non-pruritic rash around the tick-bite site and two (6%) had lymphadenopathy. Seven (22%) and four (13%) patients had anaemia and thrombocytopenia, respectively, and seven (50%) of 14 patients with confirmed infection had increased hepatic transaminase concentrations. In the confirmed cases, concentrations of intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (p < 0·001), P-selectin (p < 0·05), and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (p < 0·001) were significantly reduced, whereas tumour necrosis factor α (p < 0·01) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (p < 0·001) were significantly increased.

Interpretation

"B venatorum" infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with a tick-exposure history in areas where this pathogen has previously been identified in ticks or people.

### Hematology thin smears perform equally to parasitology thick and thin blood smears for the diagnosis ofandinfections in a low prevalence setting [^20c99f2c]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

There are an average of 1,773 cases of malaria (Plasmodium species) and 1,762 cases of babesiosis (Babesia species) in the United States annually. While timely treatment can lead to quick symptom relief for both diseases, severe complications can arise if therapy is delayed, including cerebral malaria, severe malarial anemia, coma, or even death for malaria, and thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome for babesiosis, particularly for those who are immunocompromised or lack a spleen. Given the risks associated with delayed treatment, accurate and timely diagnostic tests are crucial for early detection and appropriate management of both diseases.

Although the gold standard for the diagnosis of Plasmodium and Babesia infections is a thick and thin blood smear performed by a technologist trained in parasitology, this method has limitations. Calculating parasite levels in blood smears manually can be labor-intensive and requires skilled and trained personnel. This technique is complex and can lead to diagnostic errors due to its demanding nature and potential limitations in the quality of microscopy and staining materials.

This study directly compared results from thin smears performed in a hematology laboratory (hematology smear or HS) to those obtained from thick and thin smears performed in a parasitology laboratory (parasitology smear or PS) to determine the performance of HS as an alternative approach for rapid diagnosis.

IDSA 2020 babesiosis guideline — exchange transfusion for severe babesiosis: In selected patients with severe babesiosis, we suggest exchange transfusion using red blood cells (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), and exchange transfusion may be considered for patients with high-grade parasitemia (> 10%) or who have any one or more of the following: severe hemolytic anemia and/or severe pulmonary, renal, or hepatic compromise. Evidence cited includes a report in which patients had a median parasitemia of 20% (range 10%–30%) before exchange transfusion. In a case series of 24 patients who received exchange transfusion for severe babesiosis, the median parasitemia was 13% (range 1.6–60%) prior to exchange transfusion and 2% (range 0.1 to 13.8%) postexchange; the mean pre-exchange hemoglobin of those tested was 8.1 g/dL, and 4 of the 24 patients died postexchange despite low parasitemia (≤ 1%) at the time of death. Notably, 3 patients with parasitemia levels > 10% were successfully managed without exchange transfusion.

### Incidental identification of neonatal babesiosis: a case report [^341d36a2]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Babesiosis in neonates has been previously reported, albeit rarely. There have been prior transfusion-associated cases of neonatal babesiosis, primarily in the northeastern United States, with most cases responsive to standard multi-drug regimens, but more severe cases in premature infants occasionally requiring exchange transfusion. Probable congenital babesiosis (transplacental or perinatal acquisition) has been less frequently reported with most cases arising from the northeastern USA. These cases, like ours, involved presentation within the first month of life, with fever, lethargy or irritability, poor feeding, and pallor/anemia, variable parasitemia (5–15%), and patients were successfully treated with standard multi-drug regimens with some patients requiring blood transfusion.

In viewing this case in the context of prior reports, noteworthy aspects here include mother's antepartum laboratory abnormalities and her rather benign antepartum exposure history, both of which could be easily overlooked by clinicians. Regarding the former, maternal thrombocytopenia here could be more easily ascribed to the more common pre-eclampsia or HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets), which can be a mimic for babesiosis. Regarding the latter, our patient's travel history was rather banal, with no obvious high-risk exposure amongst various suburban day trips within the tri-state area (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut), including no significant wooded/grassy area exposure during those trips. However, there is evidence that climate change is expanding the range of the deer tick vector Ixodes scapularis, thus expanding the range for babesiosis. National surveillance data has indicated spread beyond classical ranges of the northeast and upper Midwest of the United States to more northern areas such as Maine and New Hampshire. Within the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, this expanded range has included more inland and more northern areas beyond Long Island.

### When to suspect and how to monitor babesiosis [^909a127a]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

In the past decade, cases of babesiosis in humans have been reported with increasing frequency, especially in the northeastern United States. Babesia microti (in the United States) and bovine strains (in Europe) cause most infections in humans. Most cases are tick-borne, although cases of transfusion-associated and transplacental/perinatal transmission have also been reported. Factors associated with more severe disease include advanced age, previous splenectomy and immunodeficient states. Symptoms include high fever, chills, diaphoresis, weakness, anorexia and headache. Later in the course of the illness, the patient may develop jaundice. Congestive heart failure, renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome are the most common complications. Therapy using the combination of quinine sulfate and clindamycin was the most commonly used treatment; however, atovaquone suspension plus azithromycin was recently reported an equally effective and less toxic therapy. Exchange transfusion, together with antibabesial chemotherapy, may be necessary in critically ill patients.

### Probable congenital babesiosis in infant, new jersey, USA [^1bb66518]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Of 10 cases of babesiosis in neonates that have been reviewed, 2 were congenital, 2 were transmitted by a tick bite, and 6 were associated with transfusions (, –). The 2 congenital cases are compared to our probable congenital case (Table 2). All 10 of the affected neonates were reported to have < 9% parasitemia. The illness ranged from no symptoms in 2 infants transfused with contaminated blood to symptomatic disease (as in our infant) with fever and hepatosplenomegaly in 5 of 7 (71%), hemolytic anemia in 8 of 10 (80%), indirect hyperbilirubinemia in 4 of 5 (80%), and thrombocytopenia in 7 of 9 (78%). Five of 8 (63%) patients required erythrocyte transfusion. The infant we describe had all of these manifestations as well as a higher parasite count than described previously. Clearly, the spectrum of neonatal babesiosis is variable and must be more fully elucidated, as must determinants of the illness's clinical course and parasite clearance. In neonates, the degree of parasitemia may not parallel the severity of the babesiosis.

Table 2
Selected clinical data from the first 2 reported cases of congenital babesiosis and the probable case described in this article*

*All infants' history of tick exposure was negative, and all recovered.

The combination of quinine sulfate and clindamycin hydrochloride for treatment of a newborn with transfusion-associated babesiosis was described in 1982 and subsequently became the first accepted treatment. A combination of azithromycin with atovaquone for 7 to 10 days has emerged as an alternative regimen (, –), having been used successfully in 2 neonates and several adults in whom it appears to be safe and effective. Finally, the addition of azithromycin or atovaquone to the clindamycin hydrochloride plus quinine sulfate regimen has been proposed, particularly if parasitemia is slow to resolve.

Lyme disease — evaluation for coinfection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum or Babesia microti — In patients with Lyme disease who have a high-grade fever or characteristic laboratory abnormalities in endemic regions, clinicians should assess for possible coinfection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum and/or B. microti (good practice statement). Coinfection should be investigated in patients who have a persistent fever for > 1 day while on antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease; if fever persists despite treatment with doxycycline, B. microti infection is an important consideration. Characteristic abnormalities include thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and/or anemia, and evidence of hemolysis such as elevated indirect bilirubin level, anemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase; in early Lyme disease, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and elevated indirect bilirubin levels are not found and may suggest coinfection.

### Beware of babesiosis: a rare and severe case causing death [^5eb88c2e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Babesiosis is an infectious disease caused by protozoa of the genus Babesia which is primarily transmitted by tick vectors. Most cases are asymptomatic or only mild to moderate, but some cases may be severe causing death. A 57 year old male with no reported travel outside the country was escorted by Emergency Medical Services to our Pennsylvania hospital in July of 2018 presenting with hypoglycemia, jaundice, and hypotension. Initial assessment further revealed the patient to be severely hypothermic. Resuscitative efforts began immediately and the laboratory reported parasites observed on the patient's peripheral blood smear. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with severe septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The patient was ultimately transferred to a tertiary care center for exchange transfusion therapy and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, but expired 36 h after presentation. Current CDC data reflects a steady rise of tick borne disease in the United States, but as of 2016 there have been no reported cases of babesiosis in the state of Pennsylvania, let alone fatalities. Clinicians need to be aware of the risk of fulminant illness when practicing in known endemic regions.

### Rise in babesiosis cases, Pennsylvania, USA, 2005–2018 [^e09d8e42]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

When evaluating the patients treated at Hershey Medical Center, we found that our patients were demographically similar to patients described in prior studies; most patients in our investigation were male (75%) and elderly (median age 70 years). Only 1 patient reported a history of tick bite preceding infection, but most (75%) reported a history of outdoor activity. This finding further stresses the importance of having a high clinical suspicion in elderly patient populations despite absence of tick bite history.

The average number of days of symptoms before diagnosis was ≈10 days, which is a slightly shorter period compared with reports from other studies and might have been because all patients had blood smears obtained early on during admission. The reason for obtaining blood smears was predominately for work-up of new anemia or thrombocytopenia. Most (75%) patients were identified as having severe infection; 6 of the 8 had parasitemia > 10%. Five of these 6 patients required ICU care and underwent exchange transfusion. The purpose of ICU care in these patients was for close monitoring and exchange transfusion. No patients required pressor support or mechanical ventilation. The exchange transfusion process consists of removing a patient's red blood cells and replacing them with donor red blood cells and is recommended for babesiosis patients who have parasitemia ≥ 10%; severe hemolysis (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL); or pulmonary, hepatic, or renal impairment. No randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of red cell exchange therapy; recommendations for this treatment are based on case series that show that parasitemia can be reduced by > 50%–90% with red cell exchange therapy. Of the patients who required ICU care and exchange transfusion, only 1 of the patients was considered immunocompromised because of history of splenectomy; 1 other patient with severe infection had a history of splenectomy but did not require exchange transfusion. The remaining patients were considered immunocompetent, including 1 patient with diabetes. The unifying risk factor for most patients was older age. The high percentage of patients with severe infection was attributed to our hospital being a large tertiary academic center that received referrals from other hospitals. Some of the cases were referred specifically for evaluation for exchange transfusion. Co-infection with B. burgdorferi might have also contributed to severity of infection, given that 4 of the 6 patients with severe infection had serologic test results indicative of Lyme disease. Prior studies have shown increased disease severity and duration of illness in patients co-infected with B. burgdorferi and Babesia, which is consistent with the findings in our study.

Discussion

Babesia infection was first described in cattle by Babes in 1888, and the first human case described by Skrabalo in 1957. Babesia is most commonly caused by Babesia microti infection transmitted by Ixodes scapularis, which is endemic in the northeast United States. Reports of babesiosis have also come from Minnesota, Wisconsin, and outside of the United States in Europe and Asia. The European infection however is most often caused by Babesia divergens. In the United States, the geographical distribution of babesiosis is similar to Lyme disease, which is transmitted by the same tick, Ixodes scapularis. Although less widespread than Lyme disease, the dissemination of babesiosis is currently increasing. This may be due to the growth of the white-tailed deer and white-footed mouse population or simply due to increased awareness and reporting of the disease. In addition to tick transmission, babesiosis can spread transplacentaly and through blood transfusions.

Clinical presentation ranges from the asymptomatic patient to the more critically ill patient. The intermediate disease includes nonspecific viral-like symptoms such as chills, sweats, headache, arthralgia, anorexia, cough, and nausea. On physical exam patients can present with splenomegaly or hepatomegaly. Symptoms in more severe disease include jaundice, retinal infarct, ecchymoses, congestive heart failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, liver and renal failure, and splenic rupture. Common laboratory findings consist of thrombocytopenia, normal to decreased leukocyte count, and hemolytic anemia. The most severe infections occur in the elderly, immunocomprimised, or splenectomized patients.

Diagnosis is determined by several methods. Microscopic identification is performed using Wright's or Giemsa stain which identify the Babesia microti organism. A common morphology observed on these stains is a ring-form which has low specificity resembling the classic "signet rings" seen in malaria (white arrow, Figure 2). A pathognomonic but rare microscopic form is the Maltese cross (black arrow, Figure 2). Confirmatory tests include serology and PCR. Serology is utilized to identify positive IgG and IgM titers. PCR is more specific and sensitive, and is suggested when blood smears are non-conclusive.

### Incidental identification of neonatal babesiosis: a case report [^c38f3fa6]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Complete blood count was also obtained, with manual differential via peripheral smear review incidentally identifying intraerythrocytic ring forms (Fig. 1). Reflex testing for malarial antigens was negative, and parasite load was formally quantified at 5% parasitemia. A presumptive diagnosis of babesiosis was rendered, and Babesia PCR confirmed that the neonate was positive for B. microti.

Fig. 1

Post-hoc evaluation of a peripartum peripheral blood smear from the patient's mother revealed that she had previously undetected, very low (< 1% estimated) parasitemia (Fig. 2) at the time of her concurrent thrombocytopenia and anemia. Subsequent PCR testing, completed at the time of patient's admission, showed that the patient's mother was also PCR-positive for Babesia microti.

Fig. 2
Peripheral blood smear for mother near time of delivery, with intraerythrocytic forms highlighted (arrow)

The infant was diagnosed with neonatal babesiosis. We suspect that the patient was infected with B. microti through vertical transmission given that his mother had antenatal anemia and thrombocytopenia, coupled with perinatal maternal B. microti parasitemia, and because the neonate had low risk epidemiologic profile for post-natal acquisition.

The patient was started on intravenous azithromycin and oral atovaquone. He responded well to antimicrobial therapy, rapidly defervescing and clearing parasitemia by day 6 of therapy. He was treated for a total of 10 days, until 2 consecutive blood smears over 48 h were parasite-free. He had symptomatic anemia during hospitalization, requiring one red blood cell transfusion, with both anemia and thrombocytopenia promptly and stably normalizing over time (Fig. 3).

The infant was discharged from the hospital and seen as a follow-up in clinic about 10 days after hospital discharge, where he was noted to be doing well clinically, without fever or fussiness, and with good oral intake. Repeat blood smear at that time was negative for parasites.

The Study

A 62-year-old physician living in Huntington, Long Island, New York, USA, was in good health until June 9, 2013, when he felt unwell and fever, chills, headache, myalgias, fatigue, sweats, joint pain, poor appetite, and conjunctivitis developed. On the third day of illness, he noted dark urine that lasted for several days. On June 13, he was seen by his family physician, who noted fever but no other abnormality.

A complete blood count (CBC) showed a hemoglobin level of 13.9 g/dL (reference range 13 g/dL‒18 g/dL); a hematocrit of 40.8% (40%‒54%); a leukocyte count of 4,700 cells/μL (4,500 cells/μL‒11,000 cells/μL) with 55% neutrophils (54%‒62%) and 28% lymphocytes (25%‒33%); a platelet count of 68,000 cells/μL (150,000 cells/μL‒400,00 cells/μL); an aspartate aminotransferase level of 65 U/L (1 U/L‒36 U/L); and an alanine aminotransferase level of ALT 70 U/L (1 U/L‒45 U/L). He was told to return for reevaluation if symptoms did not resolve and was seen again on June 16. At that time, he had a fever (temperature 103°F). He was given doxycycline (100 mg orally every 12 h) but did not improve.

### Acute babesiosis in pregnancy: a novel imitator of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome [^0dd2b14f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome is a serious complication of pregnancy associated with significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Several medical conditions have been described as imitators of this syndrome, presenting with similar signs and symptoms.

Case

A term, multiparous woman with a history of prior pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia developed symptoms and laboratory abnormalities suggestive of HELLP syndrome. After an uncomplicated repeat caesarean delivery of a healthy newborn, infection with Babesia species was diagnosed incidentally on a peripheral blood smear. She was treated with antibiotics postpartum without sequelae for her or her newborn. The laboratory abnormalities normalized by postoperative day 4.

Conclusion

Babesiosis complicating pregnancy may be a novel imitator of HELLP syndrome and should be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially where geographically prevalent infection exists.

### Severeinfection presenting as multiorgan failure in an immunocompetent host [^c2e6dc6a]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A previously healthy 67-year-old farmer presented to an outside hospital after a 2-week history of non-specific respiratory symptoms. A certain diagnosis was not initially apparent, and the patient was discharged home on a regimen for presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. He re-presented to the emergency department with shock and hypoxaemic respiratory failure requiring prompt intubation and fluid resuscitation. He was then transferred to our institution due to multiorgan failure. On arrival, the patient demonstrated refractory shock and worsening acute kidney injury, severe anaemia and thrombocytopaenia. The peripheral smear revealed absence of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. A closer review of the smear displayed red blood cell inclusion bodies consistent with babesiosis. The patient was started on clindamycin and loaded with intravenous quinidine, and subsequently transitioned to oral quinine. A red cell exchange transfusion was pursued with improvement of the parasite load. The patient was discharged home on clindamycin/quinine and scheduled for outpatient intermittent haemodialysis.

### A case of Lyme disease complicated by the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction and coinfection with babesia [^f60f1a87]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Lyme disease is the most frequently transmitted pathogen by the Ixodes tick, although other pathogens, including anaplasmosis and babesiosis, are carried by the same tick. Rarely, coinfection of babesiosis with Lyme disease can occur. In a study of 52 patients with erythema migrans, evidence of coinfection with Babesia was detected in 4 (7.7%) of patients. Babesiosis presents with nonspecific constitutional symptoms, including fever, malaise, myalgia, or headache, occurring after parasite-mediated hemolysis of erythrocytes. Laboratory findings reveal hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Early identification and treatment of babesiosis is critical to prevent potential complications of acute respiratory, renal, and congestive heart failures and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

This case was remarkable in that not only did the JHR occur in association with Lyme disease, but also coinfection with babesiosis was subsequently identified. Although the symptoms of acute hemolytic anemia can occur with either the JHR or babesiosis, the timeframe of initiation of systemic symptoms after initiation of antibiotic treatment and exacerbation of a rash is characteristic of the JHR. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of both the JHR and coinfection with Babesia presenting with Lyme disease. Eighteen hours after the first dose of doxycycline, the patient developed fatigue, fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting symptoms consistent with the JHR. Laboratory findings of hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia prompted evaluation for coinfection with Babesia. This case highlights the importance of maintaining high clinical suspicion for coinfection with additional tick-borne diseases when patients with Lyme disease acutely deteriorate or fail to respond to conventional therapy. Dermatologists should be cognizant of the potential of the JHR to occur in patients treated for Lyme disease in addition to its classic association with syphilis.

### Clinical overview of babesiosis… [^8e54fc2b]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points Babesiainfection ranges from subclinical to severe, presenting with flu-like symptoms and clinical or laboratory signs of red blood cell destruction.
- Diagnosis requires careful examination, often including a detailed review of a peripheral blood smear to spot the parasite, especially in immunosuppressed patients.
- Asymptomatic patients typically do not need treatment. For symptomatic cases, a 7- to 10-day course of atovaquone with azithromycin is typical. Clinical features Babesia infection can range from subclinical to severe. Symptoms, if any, usually develop within a few weeks or months after exposure but may first appear or recur many months later, particularly in persons who are or become immunosuppressed. Clinically, Babesia infection presents with hemolytic anemia and non-specific flu-like symptoms. Some patients may experience splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or jaundice. B.

microtithrough transfusion, transplacental transmission, or tick transmission Some immunosuppressive therapies or conditions may affect the clinical manifestations. In severe cases, patients may exhibit thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemodynamic instability, acute respiratory distress, myocardial infarction, renal failure, hepatic compromise, altered mental status, and potentially, death. Testing Diagnosing babesiosis requires a high index of suspicion, due to its nonspecific symptoms. For acutely ill patients, the findings on routine laboratory testing frequently include hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Additional findings may include proteinuria, hemoglobinuria, and elevated levels of liver enzymes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. When considering a babesiosis diagnosis, healthcare providers should explicitly request a manual review of the peripheral blood smear.

In symptomatic patients with acute infection, it is typical to detect. Treatment and recovery Most asymptomatic patients do not require treatment. Treatment decisions should be individualized, especially for patients who have severe or relapsing infection. Treatment may also differ depending on the Babesia species. For ill patients, treatment usually involves at least a 7- to 10-day course of atovaquone and azithromycin.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2020 guideline on diagnosis and management of babesiosis [^4f6309a7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

IDSA 2020 babesiosis — immunocompromised hosts: relapse risk, treatment duration, and monitoring: Immunocompromised patients infected with B. microti are at risk for high-grade parasitemia, hospitalization, and complications that include severe hemolytic anemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, congestive heart failure, renal impairment, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coma, and a subgroup of highly immunocompromised patients are at risk for relapse despite standard antimicrobial therapy; those at risk include individuals who have received or are receiving rituximab, are receiving other immunosuppressive regimens for transplantation or malignancy, have malignancy and are asplenic, or have HIV infection with low CD4 T cell counts (AIDS). In these patients, persistent or intermittently symptomatic infection may continue for more than 2 years. A retrospective case-control study of 14 such patients showed that complete cure typically requires ≥ 6 consecutive weeks of antimicrobial treatment, including 2 final weeks during which parasites are no longer detected on peripheral blood smear. For severe illness, immunocompromised patients should be monitored at least daily on blood smear until parasitemia has decreased to < 4%; thereafter, blood smears should be obtained at least weekly until parasites are no longer detected, and blood smears should be obtained and/or Babesia PCR performed if symptoms consistent with babesiosis recur. There is no standardized approach to monitoring highly immunocompromised patients but close clinical and laboratory follow-up are important; monitoring Babesia parasites on blood smear and treating them until the blood smear becomes negative is necessary; until additional data become available, the use of PCR to help decide which antimicrobial therapy is discontinued should be determined on a case by case basis.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for babesiosis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, IDSA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider monitoring for Babesia parasitemia using peripheral blood smears in immunocompromised patients even after they become asymptomatic and until blood smears are negative. Consider PCR testing if blood smears have become negative but symptoms persist.

### Incidental identification of neonatal babesiosis: a case report [^ac50ca42]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Taken together, this case highlights that careful review of antenatal maternal history is important in evaluating the differential diagnosis of neonatal fever in endemic regions. Furthermore, this case highlights that vertical transmission may be an underappreciated mode of transmission of this parasite. In this case, retrospective manual evaluation of the mother's peripartum blood smear showed intraerythrocytic parasites (Fig. 2), which was later confirmed to be B. microti, suggesting likely vertical transmission to the neonate.

This case also highlights the importance of obtaining a blood smear from a diagnostics standpoint during the evaluation for an at-risk infant with late-onset sepsis of unclear source, especially in the setting of neonatal/maternal anemia or thrombocytopenia. Automated complete blood count testing often cannot detect low-level parasitemia, and it was only manual intensive retrospective evaluation that identified the intra-erythrocytic parasites in the mother's blood. It is imperative that appropriate diagnostic testing be ordered if there is suspicion for parasitemia, i.e. a dedicated blood smear which includes evaluation for parasites on peripheral blood rather than a complete blood count only. The sensitivity of complete blood count tests for parasitemia is undefined. Per the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, peripheral blood smear parasite evaluations can detect as few as 4 parasites per microliter of blood. The specificity of peripheral blood smear parasite evaluations for Babesia species depends on concurrent antigen testing, e.g. malarial antigen tests to rule out Plasmodium species, in combination with morphological evaluation of parasites. Confirmation of babesiosis requires molecular testing, such as PCR for 18 S rRNA gene targets. The highly sensitive ARUP reference laboratory Babesia PCR test used in this case can detect as low as 435 B. microti copies per mL and demonstrated no cross-reactivity with 56 other pathogens tested, per consultation with the reference laboratory. Similar PCR-based assay sensitivity and specificity for B. microti have been reported in the literature by other laboratories, as well.

### Babesiosis in lower hudson valley, new york, USA [^c1425e85]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

There are 2 prior reports of hospitalized patients in New York with babesiosis. One report published in 1998 described 139 adults with babesiosis hospitalized during 1982–1993. More than 90% of these patients resided in Suffolk County; only 2 resided in Westchester County. The other report, published in 2001, described 34 adults and children with babesiosis hospitalized at 2 tertiary care centers in Suffolk County. The latter patients were hospitalized over 13 consecutive years, but the exact years were not specified. The general clinical and laboratory features of babesiosis in these 2 case series were similar to those observed in the patients in our study. Most patients had a nonspecific febrile illness associated with hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal liver function test results. Of the 139 patients in the 1998 series, 16 (11.7%) had had a splenectomy, as did 8 (27%) of the 30 adults in the 2001 report, but in neither of the 2 earlier reports were any patients identified as having lymphoma and receiving treatment with rituximab, receiving a transplantation, or having AIDS. Thus, our case series presumably included more patients now recognized to be at high risk for relapse of infection. The 5.6% case-fatality rate in our study, however, is slightly lower than the 6.5% in the 1998 report and the 8.8% in the 2001 report. Unlike the 2 prior case series, 2 (11%) of the patients in our study were believed to have been infected through receipt of an infected blood product, which provides further evidence of the growing importance of this route of transmission.

### Babesia crassa-like human infection indicating need for adapted PCR diagnosis of babesiosis, France [^af0b8dd4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The Case Report

This case report was approved by the Ethics Committee of Medical Faculty and University Hospital of Strasbourg, France. A 61-year-old man from western France visited the emergency department of a general hospital for elevated fever, dyspnea, and jaundice. The patient had undergone gastric cancer–related gastrectomy and splenectomy 30 years before. He lived in an isolated woodland environment and raised goats. At initial examination, the only clinical abnormality was oliguria with dark urine. A blood test revealed acute renal failure (creatinine 5.6 mg/dL [reference range 0.7–1.3 mg/dL]), anemia (Hb 112 g/L [reference range 130–170 g/L]), and thrombocytopenia (18,000 platelets/μL [reference range 150,000–450,000 platelets/μL]) with hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin 10.9 mg/dL [reference range < 1.2 mg/dL]).

That night, the patient experienced septic shock and was transferred to an intensive-care unit (ICU). Upon arrival, the patient received fluid challenge associated with vasopressor treatment and broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and amikacin) for a suspected urinary or biliary infection. A new cellular and biochemical blood examination gave no result because of hemolysis. Twelve hours after ICU admission, the blood sample was again hemolyzed. Microscopic analysis of a blood smear showed intracellular and extracellular parasites suggestive of Babesia, demonstrating parasitemia of 14%. A combination treatment with quinine (8 mg/kg/8 h) and dalacine (600 mg/8 h) was started. Antibiotic therapy by ceftriaxone was continued for confirmed urinary sepsis with Escherichia coli bacteremia.

On day 2 after admission, the patient was anuric, and renal replacement therapy was started. On day 4, the patient was put on mechanical ventilation because of septic cardiac failure–induced respiratory failure. That day, a tick was found on the patient. The species remained unknown because the tick was not sent to a laboratory. Lyme serologic testing was requested and returned positive results, so ceftriaxone was administered for 3 weeks and quinine/dalacine for 10 days, yielding a negative parasitemia at the end of treatment. The patient slowly recovered; mechanical ventilation and catecholamines were stopped on day 7, dialysis on day 25. He left the ICU on day 34 and left the hospital on day 70 after regaining normal renal function; he returned home after readaptation on day 117.

### Vertical transmission of babesia microti, United States [^faaf193a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Congenital babesiosis has been rarely reported (Table). This case provided convincing evidence for congenital babesiosis because of prepartum infection involving the placenta in the mother. On the basis of experience with congenital malaria, we assume that Babesia spp. parasites cross the placenta during pregnancy or at the time of delivery. In congenital malaria, increasing evidence suggests that the malaria parasites are most often acquired antenatally by transplacental transmission of infected erythrocytes.

Reported cases of congenital babesiosis share many similarities, including asymptomatic maternal infection and development of fever, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia in the infant detected between 19 and 41 days after birth. All of the infants responded to antimicrobial drug therapy; 3 were treated with azithromycin plus atovaquone, the preferred treatment regimen for mild babesiosis. All infants required a blood transfusion because of severe anemia. The clinical signs and symptoms for these cases of congenital babesiosis are similar to those of congenital malaria in non–disease endemic areas.

We found Babesia spp. antibodies on day 3 of life by analyzing the patient's heel-stick blood sample, which likely represented maternal transfer of IgG. Passive transfer of maternal antibodies is regarded as a protective factor against congenital malaria, and some newborns with malaria who are parasitemic at birth spontaneously clear the infection without ever becoming ill. The temporary presence of maternal IgG in infants has been suggested as an explanation for the typical 3–6 week incubation period of congenital malaria in non–disease endemic areas.

The patient was given atovaquone and azithromycin for 10 days and showed resolution of symptoms and improvement in abnormal laboratory values. A repeat blood smear on June 18 showed a parasitemia level of 0.1%, and a blood smear 1 month later showed no parasites.

Patient 3 was a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized on June 26, 2012, because of 2 weeks of fever and gradually worsening malaise and weakness. He had not traveled outside eastern Pennsylvania in the past 2 years and never received a blood transfusion. Two weeks before admission, he had an insect bite that developed into a larger, oval rash.

Initial testing for thrombocytopenia included a peripheral blood smear, which showed intraerythrocytic ring forms and tetrads and a parasitemia level of 0.4%. A PCR result was positive for B. microti. He was given atovaquone and azithromycin for 10 days. Because results of enzyme immunoassay and Western blot for B. burgdorferi were positive, he was also given doxycycline. Symptoms resolved, and the laboratory values improved. A repeat blood smear 1 week after starting antimicrobial drug therapy showed no parasites.

CSTE Position Statement
- 10-ID-27 Clinical Description Babesiosis is a parasitic disease caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa of the. Clinical manifestations, if any, can include hemolytic anemia and nonspecific influenza-like signs and symptoms. Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or jaundice may be evident. In addition to signs of hemolytic anemia, laboratory findings may include thrombocytopenia, proteinuria, hemoglobinuria, and elevated levels of liver enzymes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. Risk factors for severe babesiosis include asplenia, advanced age, and other causes of impaired immune function. Some immunosuppressive therapies or conditions may mask or modulate the clinical manifestations.

Severe cases can be associated with marked thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemodynamic instability, acute respiratory distress, myocardial infarction, renal failure, hepatic compromise, altered mental status, and death. Clinical Criteria For the purposes of surveillance:

- Objective: one or more of the following: fever, anemia, or thrombocytopenia.
- Subjective: one or more of the following: chills, sweats, headache, myalgia, or arthralgia. Babesiainfection; AND
- At least one of these transfused blood components was donated by the donor described below; AND
- Transfusion-associated infection is considered at least as plausible as tickborne transmission; AND
- Received one or more red blood cell or platelet transfusions within one year before the collection date of a specimen with laboratory evidence of. Babesia titers. In immunocompetent persons, active or recent Babesia infections that are symptomatic are generally associated with relatively high titers; titers can then persist at lower levels for more than a year. In persons who are immunosuppressed or who have asymptomatic Babesia infections, active infections can be associated with lower titers.

An 8-month-old infant with cyanotic heart disease and transfusion-associated Babesia microti infection is reported here. At initial presentation, she was ill appearing, febrile and cyanotic. Laboratory tests revealed severe anemia, thrombocytopenia and an increase in hepatic enzymes. The diagnosis was made by the presence of intraerythrocytic parasites on thin blood smear and confirmed by serology and polymerase chain reaction. The infant was treated successfully with a combination of oral azithromycin and atovaquone. This combination is an alternative to clindamycin and quinine for the treatment of children with babesiosis.

Babesiosis serology confirmation and diagnostic thresholds — single positive antibody tests require confirmatory testing: For patients with a positive Babesia antibody test, we recommend confirmation with blood smear or PCR before treatment is considered (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). A single positive antibody test is not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of babesiosis because Babesia antibodies can persist in blood for a year or more following apparent clearance of infection, with or without treatment. For serologic interpretation, a B. microti IgG antibody titer of ≥ 1:1024 or the presence of B. microti IgM antibody are suggestive of active or recent B. microti infection, while a 4-fold rise in Babesia IgG antibody from acute illness to convalescence confirms the diagnosis.

### Babesiosis surveillance-Wisconsin, 2001–2015 [^ec46063b]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

White-tailed deer are the primary hosts for adult blacklegged ticks, and white-footed mice and other small mammals are reservoirs of B. microti. Most human cases of babesiosis result from tick bites that occur during the spring and summer months, but blood transfusion–related transmission and perinatal transmission have also been reported. Blacklegged ticks were first recognized in Wisconsin in 1968, and during the subsequent decade, their range expanded rapidly, particularly in northwestern Wisconsin. Surveys of blacklegged ticks on hunter-harvested deer conducted since 1979 have demonstrated larger numbers of the blacklegged tick population and expansion in geographic range toward northeastern and southeastern Wisconsin. The concurrent geographic expansion of blacklegged ticks in Wisconsin during recent decades, coupled with observed increases in reported incidence of other tickborne diseases such as Lyme disease and human anaplasmosis in these regions, highlights the need for accurate surveillance for other serious tickborne diseases, including babesiosis. Predictive modeling of spatial and temporal trends in tickborne disease in neighboring Minnesota suggests that babesiosis will continue to increase under conditions of warming climate and continued forest fragmentation.

In 2001, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, Division of Public Health defined a confirmed case of babesiosis as the occurrence of fever, anemia, or thrombocytopenia in a patient with confirmatory laboratory findings (i.e. identification of either intraerythrocytic Babesia organisms by blood smear or a fourfold increase or greater in B. microti immunoglobulin G [IgG] antibody titers). A probable case was defined as the occurrence of fever, anemia, or thrombocytopenia in a patient with supportive positive tests (B. microti indirect fluorescent antibody total Ig or IgG antibody titer of ≥ 1:256 or positive B. microti PCR assay). In 2007, the Division of Public Health expanded the confirmed case definition to include a positive PCR result as confirmatory laboratory evidence, which is consistent with the current Council of State and Territorial Epidemiology babesiosis case definition. * For all reported cases, local health departments interviewed health care providers and patients to assess tick exposure and to document the county of exposure and ascertain the possibility of transfusion-associated transmission.

### Babesiosis. two atypical cases from Minnesota and a review [^f0a63229]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

We present 2 atypical cases of babesiosis and a review of babesiosis. The first patient was a 72-year-old man with an intact spleen, who had marked intravascular hemolysis. His RBCs were parasitized heavily with trophozoites of Babesia, and he had a large number of extracellular aggregates of Babesia. The infection did not respond to oral antibiotic therapy, and he required an RBC exchange transfusion. The second patient was a 29-year-old man who had undergone splenectomy and who had multiple episodes of fever and gastrointestinal symptoms for 4 months, with partial response to antibiotics. Thin smears revealed both intraerythrocytic and extraerythrocytic forms in very low numbers. The infection responded promptly to clindamycin and quinine therapy. The varying clinical manifestations, from acute to chronic, at a wide range of ages and often the difficulty of detection by routine blood smears make it necessary that a high index of clinical suspicion be present for prompt diagnosis. With increasing numbers of cases of transfusion-transmitted babesiosis being reported, protection of the blood supply is essential.

Clinical Manifestations

The cohort included 2 patients with a history of splenectomy and 1 patient with a history of diabetes. Most of the patients were immunocompetent. None of the patients were on immunosuppressive therapy. No HIV patients or posttransplant patients were in the cohort. Most patients reported fever (6/8) and malaise (5/8). Other symptoms included myalgias or arthralgias (2/8), anorexia (2/8), rash (1/8), headache (1/8), nausea or vomiting (1/8), diarrhea (1/8), and respiratory failure (1/8). The average time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 9.7 days. The most common laboratory abnormalities seen were anemia, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, and hyperbilirubinemia. Anemia was seen in all of the patients; average hemoglobin level was 9.8 g/dL (reference range 13–16 g/dL) (Table 3). Thrombocytopenia was seen in 7/8 patients; average platelet count was 90.8 × 10⁹/L (reference range 150–350 × 10⁹/L). Most of the patients (6/8) had platelet counts of < 75. Elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were seen in 7/8 patients; average alanine aminotransferase was 72 U/L (reference range 0–40 U/L) and average aspartate aminotransferase 176.6 U/L (reference range 0–40 U/L). Hyperbilirubinemia was also seen in 7/8 patients; average bilirubin level was 6.4 mg/dL (reference range 0–1.2 mg/dL).

### Powassan virus encephalitis, severe babesiosis and Lyme carditis in a single patient [^bf5fd022]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Ixodes scapularis is responsible for transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi, B. miyamotoi, Babesia microti, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Powassan virus to humans. We present a case of an 87-year-old man who presented with fever and altered mental status. Initial workup revealed haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, mild hepatitis and acute kidney injury. Patient tested positive for B. burgdorferi and Babesia microti, and was started on doxycycline, atovaquone and azithromycin. He also underwent exchange transfusion twice. After some initial improvement, patient had acute deterioration of mental status and appearance of neurological findings like myoclonus and tremors. Therefore, testing for arboviruses was done and results were positive for Powassan virus. During a protracted course of hospitalisation, patient required intubation for respiratory failure and temporary pacemaker for unstable arrythmias from Lyme carditis. Patient developed permanent neurological deficits even after recovery from the acute illness.

Investigation and Outcomes

On August 6, a previously healthy resident of the Maryland National Capital Region was evaluated for a 7-day history of fever, malaise, and myalgias. In the months preceding symptom onset, the patient reported daily walks near home and an occurrence of a tick attachment but no international travel, blood transfusions, intravenous drug use, or other potential exposures to bloodborne pathogens.

Initial hospital laboratory testing revealed anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and intraerythrocytic parasites that raised concern for babesiosis or malaria. The patient was admitted to the hospital and, given the absence of international travel and the reported tick exposure, empiric treatment for presumed babesiosis † was initiated. On August 9, a thin blood smear obtained at the time of admission was reported to show Plasmodium falciparum malaria with 3.2% parasitemia. Blood smear telediagnosis at CDC could not conclusively differentiate between malaria and babesia parasites from the images provided. In accordance with Maryland law, the smear and whole blood specimen were also submitted to the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) public health laboratory. Because the patient had no reported international travel and did have a history of tick exposure, as well as documented clinical improvement (reduction in parasitemia to 0.2%), the patient was discharged on August 10 with instructions to complete a 7-day babesiosis treatment course. §

### Immune thrombocytopenic purpura associated with Brucella and toxoplasma infections [^f4cbdd2a]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

Bacterial and protozoal infections can cause thrombocytopenia and may mimic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Brucella species and Toxoplasma are among the infectious agents with protean clinical manifestations which may induce immune thrombocytopenia. In rare cases, thrombocytopenia can be severe and may result bleeding into the skin and from mucosal sites. Prompt recognition of this complication and aggressive therapy are essential, since the mortality associated with bleeding into the central nervous system is high. We report two patients with complaints of severe epistaxis and thrombocytopenia associated with brucellosis and toxoplasmosis. Thrombocytopenic purpura in these cases responded well to the high-dose corticosteroid treatment with platelet recovery within 2–3 days. For cases with infection-induced immune thrombocytopenic purpura, short-term high-dose corticosteroids may be applied as an urgent therapy without worsening of the clinical condition.

Hospital Course and Complications

Patients were identified as having severe babesiosis if they had parasitemia > 10% or if they had intensive care unit (ICU) care, exchange transfusion requirement, intubation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, or dialysis. Six of the 8 patients were classified as having severe infection. These 6 patients all had parasitemia > 10%. Five of the 8 patients required ICU care and underwent exchange transfusions. One patient required dialysis, and 2 patients required blood or platelet transfusion. No patients required intubation or pressor support, and all patients survived.

Four of the 6 patients with severe infection had co-infection with Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease). The 2 nonsevere patients did not have co-infection. All 6 of the severely ill patients had infectious disease consults during their hospitalization. The 2 patients that were considered not severely ill did not receive an infectious disease consultation. The average length of stay for all patients was 11 days. The average length of stay for patients with severe infection was 12.3 days and for patients with nonsevere infection was 7 days.

### Babesia microti infection, Eastern Pennsylvania, USA [^f5dff3f3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The Patients

Patient 1 was a 68-year-old man who was hospitalized on August 18, 2011, because of 6 days of fever, arthralgias, generalized weakness, and confusion. He was given doxycycline for treatment of presumptive Lyme disease but showed no improvement. He had not traveled outside eastern Pennsylvania for > 3 years. He had never received any blood transfusions. Although he did not recall any tick attachments, he enjoyed gardening and other outdoor activities.

Pertinent clinical and laboratory data are shown in the Table. During testing for thrombocytopenia, a peripheral blood smear was obtained on hospital day 1 and showed ring forms with tetrads (Figure) and a parasitemia level of 10%. A PCR result for the blood sample was positive for B. microti.

Figure

Despite treatment for 5 days with clindamycin and quinine, the treatment of choice for severe babesiosis, the fever persisted. Antimicrobial drug therapy was changed to atovaquone and azithromycin. The patient completed 10 days of treatment and showed resolution of symptoms and normalization of platelet count and total bilirubin level. Parasitemia level at the time of discharge was 1.2%. Laboratory data after discharge were not available.

Patient 2 was an 84-year-old woman with microcytic anemia who was hospitalized on June 8, 2012, because of 2 weeks of fever, diaphoresis, myalgias, progressive dyspnea, and fatigue. Originally from New Hampshire, she had been living in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, for > 4 years. She had not traveled outside the region in the past 4 years. She received a blood transfusion for chronic anemia 1 year before onset of this illness. She recalled multiple tick bites in the recent past.

### Case of babesia crassa-like infection, Slovenia, 2014 [^3a9396eb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2014, a 55-year-old woman, living on the outskirts of Murska Sobota, Slovenia, sought medical treatment for a 6-day history of intermittent fever up to 39°C, myalgia, headache, poor appetite concomitant with weight loss, fatigue, sweating, and dark urine. She previously had a splenectomy and partial pancreatectomy 5 years previous because of cystic adenoma and adrenal incidentaloma without hormonal activity. She reported no history of travel, tick bite, animal contact, or blood transfusions.

Her blood pressure was 115/70 mm Hg, heart rate 83 beats/min, and body temperature 36.6°C, and a physical examination indicated no significant clinical findings. The first basic blood analysis revealed thrombocytopenia (platelets 85 × 10⁹/L). A differential blood analysis indicated that the concentration of large unstained cells was elevated (0.41 × 10⁹/L, reference range 0–0.4 × 10⁶/L). Biochemical laboratory testing showed mild fluctuations in liver functioning: aspartate aminotransferase 1.22 (reference range 0.17–0.51) µkat/L, alanine aminotransferase 1.13 (reference range 0.17–0.68) µkat/L, γ-glutamyltransferase 1.08 (reference range 0.03–0.51 µkat/L) µkat/L, and alkaline phosphatase 1.88 (reference range 0.5–2.0) µkat/L. C-reactive protein was 51 mg/L (150 [reference range 0.76–28.5] nmol/L), and mild erythrocyturia was present. Giemsa-stained blood smears showed unusual inclusions in erythrocytes, Howell-Jolly bodies, mild anisocytosis, some atypical lymphocytes, and some large thrombocytes. We observed many ring forms and some paired piriform shapes of Babesia spp. in blood smears (Figure), and parasitemia was 1% (Appendix Table). We confirmed diagnosis by conventional PCR and sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene. A phylogenetic analysis indicated the pathogen was the B. crassa –like parasite (Appendix Figure).

### Atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome in a patient with severe babesiosis [^ed8fc002]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Babesiosis is a tick-borne parasitic infection that can result in various haematological complications. This case report discusses a patient with severe Babesiosis complicated by an unorthodox presentation of Babesiosis-associated haemolytic uremic syndrome. Discussed here is the patient's clinical course and the management strategies employed, with an emphasis on early recognition and treatment of renal failure in the context of severe Babesiosis. Haematologic manifestations of Babesia are common and the severity of disease is dependent on parasite load. While treatment options such as red blood cell exchange have been proposed for severe cases, their impact on clinical outcomes is limited and they may not be readily available in resource-limited settings. Traditional management using antimicrobials has been proposed but there is limited discussion about managing unique presentations such as renal failure in Babesiosis. Hence, understanding the pathophysiology, early recognition and aggressive treatment strategies can optimise clinical outcomes and reduce mortality.

Anaplasma phagocytophilum — coinfections and treatment clues: The I. scapularis tick that transmits A. phagocytophilum also transmits Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia microti, Borrelia miyamotoi, and deer tick virus, and simultaneous infections with B. burgdorferi or B. microti have occurred; confirmed Anaplasma coinfection has been reported in < 10% of patients with Lyme disease. Response to treatment can provide clues, as anaplasmosis should respond readily to treatment with doxycycline, and if the clinical response is delayed, coinfection or an alternative infection might be considered. If Lyme disease is treated with a beta-lactam antimicrobial drug in an unrecognized A. phagocytophilum coinfection, anaplasmosis symptoms could persist, and leukopenia or thrombocytopenia in a patient with Lyme disease should raise clinical suspicion for possible coinfection with A. phagocytophilum.

Non-Babesia microti infection — Babesia duncani and Babesia divergens are summarized as follows: A small number of B. duncani cases (< 15) have been reported on the West Coast of the United States, and most were treated with IV clindamycin plus oral quinine for 7–10 days; the efficacy of atovaquone plus azithromycin in treating such infection has not been evaluated. B. divergens infections occur sporadically in Europe, the United States, and mainland China, with more than 50 cases reported, and almost all B. divergens infections have been severe and have occurred in asplenic patients; these patients usually are treated with IV clindamycin plus oral quinine. In Europe, exchange transfusion is performed early in the course of illness, and such aggressive treatment is thought to have markedly reduced the mortality rate.

### Human babesiosis [^e200b5e4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Babesiosis is caused by intraerythrocytic parasites that are transmitted primarily by ticks, infrequently through blood transfusion, and rarely through transplacental transmission or organ transplantation. Human babesiosis is found throughout the world, but the incidence is highest in the Northeast and upper Midwestern United States. Babesiosis has clinical features that resemble malaria and can be fatal in immunocompromised and older patients. Diagnosis is confirmed by identification of Babesia parasites on blood smear or Babesia DNA with polymerase chain reaction. Standard treatment consists of atovaquone and azithromycin or clindamycin and quinine for 7 to 10 days.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2020 guideline on diagnosis and management of babesiosis [^1e193de4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

IDSA 2020 babesiosis — diagnosis and treatment emphasize that babesiosis has no easily recognized clinical features such as the erythema migrans skin lesion of Lyme disease; a diagnosis should be considered in a patient who resides in or has traveled to an endemic area, experiences clinical symptoms that are consistent with babesiosis, and has characteristic laboratory test abnormalities. Diagnosis is confirmed with the identification of Babesia parasites by microscopic evaluation of blood smears or amplification of Babesia DNA using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, and the diagnosis of acute babesiosis cannot be confirmed solely by the presence of Babesia antibody in a serum sample collected at a single time point. Treatment with a combination of atovaquone plus azithromycin for 7 to 10 days achieves cure in most cases, delay in diagnosis and treatment is associated with severe disease, and prolonged antibiotic therapy should be reserved for highly immunocompromised patients.

### Case report: successful non-operative management of spontaneous splenic rupture in a patient with babesiosis [^4198fef9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Laboratory values were significant for white blood cell count 4.0 × 10⁹/L, hemoglobin 102 g/L (10.2 g/dL), hematocrit 28.8%, platelet count 26.0 × 10⁹/L, bilirubin total 32.49 μmol/L (1.9 mg/dL), bilirubin direct 17.1 μmol/L (1.0 mg/dL), LDH 591 units/L, ALT 180 units/L, AST 68 units/L, and alkaline phosphatase 116 units/L.

A repeat CT scan performed showed the spleen measured 14 cm in longitudinal length with multiple lacerations (the largest extending near the hilum), and perisplenic/perihepatic/peripelvic hemorrhage (Figure 1). Infectious Disease (ID) and General Surgery were consulted for further evaluation. ID reviewed the peripheral blood smear and confirmed the presence of Babesiosis with 3% parasitemia. Atovaquone and azithromycin were continued with the addition of doxycycline for presumptive coverage of Lyme disease and Ehrlichiosis. The patient was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit for expectant management of the splenic injury which included bed rest, serial abdominal exams, serial hemoglobin/hematocrit checks, and platelet transfusion to a goal of greater than 50.0 × 10⁹/L.

Figure 1
Abdominal CT scan. The CT scan from this patient shows a mildly enlarged spleen measuring 14 cm in longitudinal dimension. He had multiple splenic lacerations however, and this slice shows a 3.7 cm transverse splenic laceration.

Non-operative course of management was chosen for several reasons. First, the patient was minimally symptomatic by the time of transfer with hemodynamically normal vital signs. Second, the parasite count was 3% indicating a high likelihood of prompt, successful response to pharmacological therapy. Lastly, the patient has a history of Lyme disease, and he resides in a highly endemic region for tick-borne diseases. It was the belief of the team that the patient would therefore be at significant risk for additional tick-borne illnesses in the future, and if infected again would have a higher risk of mortality if he were asplenic.

Subsequent attempts to perform Babesia whole-genome sequencing on a residual blood sample obtained 3 days after the start of treatment identified B. microti DNA, but it was insufficient to perform full-genomic sequencing. At a follow-up visit to his physician on July 5, a CBC and tests for aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels showed results within references ranges.

Three years later, on June 19, 2016, the patient had a fever (temperature 100°F), chills, sweats, headache, myalgias, anorexia, and difficulty concentrating develop. He also noted dark urine for several days. On June 22, he was seen by his physician, who obtained a CBC, which showed a hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL and hematocrit of 38.3%; a leukocyte count of 4,700 cells/μL with 55% neutrophils and 30% lymphocytes; and a platelet count of 41,000 cells/μL. A blood smear showed a Babesia parasitemia level of 1%. We amplified B. microti DNA by using PCR. Results for B. microti antibody were positive (IgM titer 1:256, IgG titer > 1;1,024) (Table). He was then given atovaquone (750 mg every 12 h) and azithromycin (500 mg on day 1 and then 250 mg 1×/d) for 10 days, at which time symptoms had resolved. A repeat blood smear did not show any parasites. The patient has subsequently been in good health.

### Transfusion-associated babesiosis after heart transplant [^701dbd31]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Babesiosis is a tick-borne protozoan illness caused by infection of erythrocytes with various species in the genus Babesia. In the United States, Babesia microti is the agent most commonly reported to cause human infection. More recently, the MO1-type, WA1-type, and CA1-type Babesia species have been identified as causing clinical disease in the United States. Babesia infection can also be acquired by blood transfusion. More than 40 cases of transfusion-transmitted B. microti infection have been reported in the United States (R. Cable and B. Herwaldt, unpub. data). B. microti infection is often asymptomatic but may cause a malaria-like illness characterized by fever and hemolytic anemia. Babesiosis can also be associated with severe complications that include renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and adult respiratory distress syndrome. The risk of developing this clinical infection is increased for elderly, asplenic, or immunosuppressed patients. Here we describe a case of B. microti infection in a 54-year-old spleen-intact man acquired by blood transfusion after cardiac transplantation.

### Human babesiosis [^b7acb5be]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Human babesiosis is an emerging intraerythrocytic infection caused by protozoal parasites transmitted by ixodid ticks. Babesiosis is endemic in the northeastern and upper midwestern regions of the United States and is found sporadically in other parts of the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. Babesial infections range from asymptomatic to severe and occasionally are fatal. Specific laboratory diagnosis of babesial infection is made by morphologic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears, serology, and amplification of babesial DNA using polymerase chain reaction. The combination of atovaquone and azithromycin is the treatment of choice for mild-to-moderate illness, whereas clindamycin and quinine and exchange transfusion are indicated for severe disease.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2020 guideline on diagnosis and management of babesiosis [^94eaa315]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

IDSA 2020 babesiosis — immunocompetent hosts monitoring and PCR interpretation: In otherwise healthy individuals, symptoms generally abate within a few days after initiation of treatment, and fever and parasites on blood smear usually clear within a week. Fatigue may persist for months after a standard antibiotic course and by itself is not an indication for continued monitoring. Once symptoms have resolved in immunocompetent patients, blood smears typically are negative, but B. microti PCR may remain positive for months to more than a year after completion of standard treatment or for months to more than 2 years if untreated; persistence of B. microti DNA after resolution of symptoms and completion of standard treatment usually does not indicate treatment failure. Relapse of symptoms rarely is observed in immunocompetent patients, so continuing antimicrobial therapy until Babesia PCR becomes negative in immunocompetent patients will often result in unnecessarily prolonged therapy and is not warranted. Immunocompetent patients usually resolve most symptoms and blood smears become negative during the 7 to 10-day course of standard antimicrobial therapy. Monitoring parasitemia using PCR is not indicated in asymptomatic immunocompetent hosts.

### Transmission of babesia microti parasites by solid organ transplantation [^35423f5b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Although we do not have proof that the blood donor was infected when he donated blood or have laboratory evidence that the organ donor briefly harbored the parasite, the negative PCR results for the postdonation specimens from the blood donor and the negative PCR and IHC results for the available posttransfusion specimens from the organ donor are not helpful; only positive results would have been informative. Although other transmission scenarios seem much less probable, the cases of babesiosis in the kidney recipients we report would be noteworthy even if the organ donor recently had acquired the parasite from a tick (i.e. was in the early window period of infection, despite his lack of known risk factors for tickborne transmission).

Diagnosis of babesiosis in the kidney recipients prompted multiagency investigations of the organ donor and his blood donors. However, the cases of babesiosis in the recipients could have been easily missed, which highlights the possibility that other transplantation-associated cases have occurred but were not diagnosed or investigated. For patient A (index case-patient), babesiosis was diagnosed because of the serendipitous finding of parasites on a blood smear that was examined manually because of platelet clumping. His lack of risk factors for tickborne transmission and the possibility of donor-derived infection led to prompt evaluation of patient B. At the time of diagnosis, illness in patient B was milder (lower-level parasitemia, minimal anemia, and transient fever) than that in patient A, even though the 2 patients received similar immunosuppressive regimens.

Babesiosis can be persistent, relapsing, or life threatening in immunocompromised patients (, –). Optimal therapy for babesiosis in patients who have received an organ transplant or have impaired immunity for other reasons is not well established and might depend on multiple factors; a uniform recommendation might not be applicable to such a heterogeneous population. In immunocompetent persons, the typical duration of antimicrobial drug therapy for babesiosis is 7–10 days. We decided to treat both kidney recipients for 6 weeks on the basis of retrospective data for immunosuppressed patients that suggest the likelihood of cure is higher if combination antimicrobial drug therapy is administered for > 6 weeks, including 2 weeks after Babesia parasites are no longer detected on blood smears. We gave the patients atovaquone plus azithromycin rather than clindamycin plus quinine (the standard of care for severely ill patients) to minimize the likelihood of toxicity during their 6-week treatment courses. In addition, we decreased the doses of their immunosuppressive medications.

### Babesia microti causing intravascular hemolysis in immunocompetent child, China [^b7315c4f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Severe babesiosis in immunocompetent persons < 50 years of age is rare; only 2 cases have been reported. We report a case of B. microti infection causing severe illness in an immunocompetent child. Better understanding of the pathogenesis of this parasite is necessary. This case indicates that babesiosis cannot be ignored in severe intravascular hemolysis. For patients who have intermittent fever and intravascular hemolysis but negative results for antiglobulin tests, babesiosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially in areas where the tick vector is present. A timely and appropriate treatment for patients who have severe disease that is recognized early is needed.

### Babesiosis 2025 case definition | CDC… [^68a7250e]. ndc.services.cdc.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

CSTE Position Statement 24-ID-02 Background In the U. S., most cases of babesiosis are caused by. Babesia microti, transmitted through the bite of the Ixodes scapularis tick. In the northeastern and upper midwestern U. S. B. microti circulates between ticks and animal reservoir hosts, 3 a cycle shared by the etiologic agents of Lyme disease and anaplasmosis. Very rarely, U. S. cases caused by other Babesia species have been described, such as B. duncani and B. divergens. 4–7 Babesiosis typically presents with nonspecific symptoms within one month of a tick bite. Additionally, laboratory anomalies such as hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated levels of liver enzymes are often noted.

1, 8 Cases of babesiosis increased significantly between 2011 and 2019, with some northeastern states experiencing several fold increases in incidence rates. Due in part to the ability of people to maintain low levels of parasitemia while asymptomatic, transfusion-transmitted babesiosis has been the most frequently reported parasitic disease associated with transfusions in the U. S. Clinical Criteria
- **Objective**: fever as reported by patient or healthcare provider, anemia, or thrombocytopenia
- Subjective: chills, sweats, headache, myalgia, or arthalgia. Laboratory Criteria Confirmatory Laboratory Evidence:

Bilateral exudative pleural effusions developed (Figure 2), and she had hospital-acquired pneumonia. Severe intravascular hemolysis and black urine continued (Figure 3), which later showed evidence of hypersplenism, extravascular hemolysis, and thrombocytopenia. Her direct antiglobulin test remained negative throughout hospitalization. She underwent manual exchange transfusion with 4 units of O-negative blood and subsequent transfusion with 2 units of M- and S-antigen–negative erythrocytes on day 9 (Table). Because her recovery was protracted and thrombocytopenia was evolving, we added intravenous doxycycline (200 mg every 24 h) for possible Anaplasma co-infection.

Despite good parasitological response to treatment, the patient suffered a prolonged period of encephalopathy during convalescence. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed an old cerebellar infarct, cerebrospinal fluid analysis was unremarkable, and an electroencephalogram showed nonspecific cerebral dysfunction.

Results of testing for immunoglobulins, complement blood tests, lymphocyte subsets, nuclear antibodies, tissue-transglutaminase antibodies, pneumococcal antibodies, and serum protein electrophoresis were all within reference ranges. Results of HIV serology and markers for hepatitis B and C viruses were negative; abdominal ultrasonography ruled out anatomic hyposplenia.

The patient's encephalopathy gradually resolved, and she was extubated on day 13 of her ICU stay. Blood films on day 14 of treatment were negative, and antiparasitic agents were discontinued 24 hours later (Table). She subsequently recovered renal function and no longer required dialysis.

B. divergens infection was confirmed by 18S PCR and genomic sequencing from a blood sample drawn shortly after ICU admission (Appendix). Acute-phase serology was negative for tickborne encephalitis, Rickettsia, Borrelia, and Anaplasma. Convalescent serology for Anaplasma gave a weak, nonspecific reaction.
