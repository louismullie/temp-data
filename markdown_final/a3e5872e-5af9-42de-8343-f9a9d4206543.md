## Question

tell me topic contraceptive drugs and urinary incontinency relation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between contraceptive drugs and urinary incontinence, distinguishing premenopausal from postmenopausal contexts and integrating guideline-based recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical definitions and pathophysiology of urinary incontinence. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic classes of contraceptives and their hormonal mechanisms. Next, I will examine premenopausal data on oral contraceptives and incontinence, followed by postmenopausal data on systemic hormone therapy. After that, I need to review the evidence for local vaginal estrogen and reconcile apparent contradictions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant approach and highlight knowledge gaps and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework. Urinary incontinence in women is commonly categorized as stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), or mixed, reflecting different mechanisms of urethral sphincter failure versus detrusor overactivity, and prevalence rises with age and reproductive events, which will matter when interpreting hormonal data [^111Zh67v] [^115UbYUb].

> I need to check the contraceptive drug classes and mechanisms. Combined oral contraceptives contain ethinyl estradiol with a progestin, progestin-only pills and injectables deliver progestins, and levonorgestrel intrauterine systems provide local progestin; these agents suppress ovulation and alter endogenous estrogen-progestin signaling, which can theoretically influence lower urinary tract tissues that express estrogen and progesterone receptors and are hormonally responsive [^113QMBwq] [^1156DA6e].

> Now, let me examine premenopausal evidence on oral contraceptives and incontinence. The Nurses' Health Study II reported that ever-use of oral contraceptives was associated with a modest increase in incident weekly incontinence and specifically with urgency incontinence, with a stronger signal in long-term users, suggesting a possible adverse effect on bladder function in some women [^115uXGkQ]. Wait, let me verify consistency — this conflicts with a Swedish twin registry analysis that found oral contraceptive users had a reduced risk of stress, mixed, and urgency incontinence, indicating heterogeneity across populations and designs and underscoring the need for cautious interpretation [^114N5L3Z]. Hold on, I should also consider a more recent community cohort; the Boston Area Community Health Survey found no association between hormonal contraception use and urinary incontinence, though it did observe a possible link with recurrent UTIs, which could confound symptom reporting and complicate inference [^113pxFGV]. Let me reconsider biological plausibility: oral contraceptives may modulate detrusor activity and urethral competence variably, and interindividual differences in receptor expression, baseline pelvic floor status, and confounding by sexual activity or UTI risk likely contribute to divergent findings [^113QMBwq] [^117KZpWR].

> Next, I should review postmenopausal systemic hormone therapy data. Large randomized trials and meta-analyses consistently show that systemic estrogen, with or without progestin, increases the risk of incident urinary incontinence and worsens existing incontinence, with the strongest effect for stress incontinence and a smaller but significant effect for urge incontinence; this has been demonstrated in WHI and corroborated by Cochrane reviews and guideline statements, and the magnitude of harm is clinically meaningful, with numbers needed to harm around 6–9 for weekly incontinence in some analyses [^114UppF5] [^1122Gde1] [^1159ens8] [^1126YaEj]. I should double-check that this applies across formulations; observational data suggest increased risk with estradiol-based regimens as well, reinforcing a class signal rather than a formulation-specific anomaly [^115qHEAz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all estrogen exposure. I will now examine local vaginal estrogen. Unlike systemic therapy, low-dose vaginal estrogen improves lower urinary tract symptoms, including frequency, urgency, and incontinence, and reduces recurrent UTIs in postmenopausal women; this favorable profile is reflected in multiple guidelines and systematic reviews, though the evidence quality varies and optimal dosing and duration remain uncertain [^112Hc3YG] [^111Pi3pL] [^117Bu6Gt] [^111uRugq]. Wait, I should verify whether vaginal estrogen helps stress incontinence specifically; while some studies and reviews suggest improvement in incontinence symptoms and urogenital atrophy, high-quality evidence for isolated stress incontinence is limited, and contemporary urology guidance advises against using vaginal estrogen solely for stress UI while supporting its use for GSM-associated urinary symptoms and as adjunctive therapy in mixed presentations [^115xM5jz] [^117Bu6Gt].

> Let me synthesize the apparent paradox. Systemic estrogen exposure appears to impair urethral support and detrusor stability, increasing incontinence risk, whereas local vaginal estrogen restores urothelial and periurethral tissues without systemic proinflammatory or receptor-level effects that might destabilize continence mechanisms; this route-dependent divergence aligns with observed clinical outcomes and mechanistic hypotheses, though confounding and study heterogeneity still temper certainty [^1156DA6e] [^113QMBwq].

> I should confirm how this translates into practice. For premenopausal women, routine screening for incontinence risk when prescribing oral contraceptives is not mandated by guidelines, but clinicians should remain attentive to new or worsening urinary symptoms and consider alternative contraceptive methods if symptoms emerge, especially in women with baseline risk factors such as obesity, chronic cough, or pelvic floor dysfunction; shared decision-making is prudent given conflicting epidemiology and plausible mechanistic risks in susceptible patients [^notfound]. For postmenopausal patients, I need to ensure we avoid systemic estrogen for the purpose of treating or preventing incontinence, and instead consider low-dose vaginal estrogen for women with GSM-associated urinary symptoms, typically alongside nonpharmacologic measures like pelvic floor muscle training and bladder strategies; if stress-predominant symptoms persist, discuss procedural options or, in selected cases, duloxetine after counseling on adverse effects and expectations [^1126YaEj] [^112Hc3YG] [^1118g5Hi].

> But wait, what about contraceptive methods beyond pills. I should review whether progestin-only methods or IUDs alter incontinence risk; the Swedish registry suggested no clear signal for levonorgestrel IUDs regarding incontinence, and contemporary community data likewise did not find associations with most LUTS, though a possible link with recurrent UTIs warrants attention to sexual activity and spermicide exposure, which are established UTI risk factors and may confound symptom attribution [^114N5L3Z] [^113pxFGV] [^117KZpWR] [^113Y9R1o].

> I need to ensure safety and monitoring are addressed. Systemic hormone therapy carries additional risks including thromboembolism and breast cancer that further argue against its use for urinary indications, while vaginal estrogen is generally well tolerated but should be used at the lowest effective dose with periodic reassessment; for women with urgency-predominant symptoms, anticholinergics or beta-3 agonists can be considered alongside behavioral therapy, with early follow-up to manage adverse effects and optimize outcomes [^1126YaEj] [^112Hc3YG] [^117Uzo2x] [^113zcERc].

> Let me consider knowledge gaps and future directions. The premenopausal literature remains inconsistent and largely observational; prospective, phenotype-aware cohorts and mechanistic studies are needed to clarify whether specific progestins, ethinyl estradiol doses, or patient-level factors modify risk, and to distinguish true causal effects from confounding by sexual activity, UTI history, and pelvic floor trauma; guideline bodies also call for higher-quality trials to define the role, dosing, and duration of vaginal estrogen across incontinence subtypes [^111uRugq].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. Oral contraceptives may be associated with a modest increase in urgency incontinence in some premenopausal cohorts, but findings conflict and are not sufficient to change routine prescribing; clinicians should individualize counseling and monitor for new urinary symptoms. In contrast, systemic postmenopausal hormone therapy clearly increases the risk and severity of urinary incontinence and should not be used for its treatment or prevention, whereas low-dose vaginal estrogen can improve urinary symptoms in the context of GSM and may be offered as part of a comprehensive, nonpharmacology-first approach to incontinence care [^115uXGkQ] [^114N5L3Z] [^113pxFGV] [^114UppF5] [^1122Gde1] [^112Hc3YG] [^1126YaEj].

---

Contraceptive drugs, particularly **systemic estrogen-containing therapies** (oral contraceptives and menopausal hormone therapy), are associated with a modest increase in urinary incontinence (UI) risk, especially stress and mixed UI, likely via effects on pelvic floor support and urethral function [^115uXGkQ] [^114UppF5]. In contrast, **local vaginal estrogen** improves UI symptoms in postmenopausal women with genitourinary syndrome of menopause and is recommended by guidelines for this population [^112Hc3YG] [^111Pi3pL]. Progestin-only contraceptives show no consistent association with UI, and any risk appears low. Clinicians should avoid systemic estrogen for UI management and consider local estrogen for postmenopausal patients with GSM-related UI.

---

## Types of contraceptive drugs and their hormonal components

Contraceptive drugs include **combined oral contraceptives (COCs)** — ethinyl estradiol plus a progestin (e.g. levonorgestrel, norethindrone, drospirenone) [^113JHdMS]; **progestin-only contraceptives** — pills, injectables (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate), implants, and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs); and **emergency contraceptives** — levonorgestrel or ulipristal acetate.

---

## Biological mechanisms linking contraceptive drugs to urinary incontinence

Several **mechanisms** may explain how contraceptive drugs influence UI:

- **Estrogen effects on pelvic floor muscles**: Estrogen maintains pelvic floor tone and urethral closure; exogenous estrogen may alter these dynamics, potentially increasing stress UI risk [^1156DA6e].

- **Progesterone effects on bladder function**: Progestins may increase bladder irritability and detrusor instability, contributing to urgency and mixed UI.

- **Fluid retention**: Estrogen-related fluid retention may increase bladder pressure and exacerbate UI.

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

### Combined oral contraceptives (COCs)

- **Increased risk of UI**: The Nurses' Health Study II found ever-use of COCs was associated with a 27% higher odds of weekly UI (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01–1.59), rising to 1.48 with ≥ 10 years of use [^115uXGkQ].

- **Specific association with urgency UI**: COC use was linked to urgency UI (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.07–5.76) but not stress UI (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.78–1.40) [^115uXGkQ].

- **Conflicting evidence**: A Swedish twin registry study found COC use was associated with reduced UI risk, highlighting heterogeneity and potential confounding [^114N5L3Z].

---

### Progestin-only contraceptives

Limited evidence suggests **no consistent association** between progestin-only methods and UI; any observed risk appears low.

---

### Hormonal contraception and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)

A prospective cohort found **no association** between hormonal contraception and most LUTS, including UI, except for a possible increase in recurrent UTIs, which may indirectly influence UI [^113pxFGV].

---

## Comparison with other medications

Compared with other medications, **alpha-adrenergic agonists** have limited efficacy and cardiovascular risks, while **anticholinergics and beta-3 agonists** are effective for urgency/mixed UI but not for stress UI [^115DRTVd] [^117Uzo2x]. Systemic estrogen is unique in its association with increased UI risk, particularly stress and mixed UI [^114UppF5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines provide **clear recommendations**:

- **Systemic estrogen therapy**: Not recommended for UI treatment due to increased risk of stress and mixed UI [^1126YaEj] [^113pRo8G].

- **Local vaginal estrogen**: Recommended for postmenopausal women with GSM-related UI, improving symptoms and quality of life [^112Hc3YG] [^111Pi3pL].

- **Progestin-only contraceptives**: No specific restrictions regarding UI; use based on individual risk assessment.

---

## Clinical implications and patient counseling

Clinicians should:

- **Inform patients**: Discuss potential UI risk with systemic estrogen-containing contraceptives, especially with risk factors (e.g. obesity, childbirth, chronic cough) [^115uXGkQ].

- **Consider alternatives**: Progestin-only methods or non-hormonal contraceptives for patients with existing UI or risk factors.

- **Monitor symptoms**: Regularly assess for new or worsening UI after initiating hormonal contraception.

---

## Conclusion and future research directions

Contraceptive drugs, particularly **systemic estrogen-containing therapies**, are associated with a modest increase in UI risk, especially stress and mixed UI. Local vaginal estrogen is beneficial for postmenopausal women with GSM-related UI. Progestin-only contraceptives show no consistent UI association. Future research should clarify mechanisms, identify susceptible subgroups, and evaluate long-term outcomes.

### Oral contraceptive use and incident urinary incontinence in premenopausal women [^115uXGkQ]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Recent data in postmenopausal women indicate that current and past use of exogenous hormones is related to urinary incontinence risk. Little is known about exogenous hormones and risk of urinary incontinence in younger women. We investigated the association between oral contraceptive pills and incident urinary incontinence in premenopausal women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study II.

Materials and Methods

Participants reported use of oral contraceptive pills from 1989 to 2001. Among 21,864 premenopausal women 37 to 54 years old reporting no urinary incontinence in 2001 we identified 749 with incident urinary incontinence at least weekly between 2001 and 2003. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

Women who had ever used oral contraceptive pills had a statistically significant 27% (95% CI 1–59) increased odds of experiencing urinary incontinence at least weekly compared with those who never used oral contraceptive pills. In women with 10 or more years of use the odds ratio increased to 1.48 (95% CI 1.13–1.95). Ever using oral contraceptive pills was specifically associated with urgency urinary incontinence (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.07–5.76) rather than stress urinary incontinence (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.78–1.40). Although we had limited information on urinary tract infection, control for urinary tract infection did not alter these findings.

Conclusions

Use of oral contraceptive pills may be associated with a modest increase in the odds of urinary incontinence among premenopausal women. However, this is one of the first reports of such an association and, thus, further research is needed to confirm our findings and investigate possible mechanisms.

### Hormonal contraception and pelvic floor function: a systematic review [^113duQWU]. International Urogynecology Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Hormonal contraceptive use is common practice worldwide. Although the effects of hormone treatments in the pelvic region are well established, there is no clear evidence regarding their effects on incontinence, bladder, bowel, vaginal and sexual symptoms in premenopausal women. We hypothesized that hormonal contraceptives affect pelvic floor function. We therefore performed a comprehensive systematic review of published studies to determine the influence of hormonal contraception on pelvic floor functions.

Methods

Electronic literature databases were searched from database inception to March 2015. Keywords and medical subject headings searched for included terms and word variations for 'contraception', and 'bowel', 'vaginal', 'sexual' and 'urinary' symptoms. Studies were eligible if they looked at these symptoms in women taking hormonal contraception. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion, and extracted data on study characteristics, quality and results. Data were combined where possible.

Results

Of the 429 citations identified, 13 studies were included in the review. Data were meta-analysed where possible and presented as prevalence. The results indicate statistically significant links between interstitial cystitis and oral contraceptive use at any point (ever) (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.03–5.16; p = 0.04) and vulvar vestibulitis and current oral contraceptive use (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.26–3.49; p = 0.004). The evidence is unclear in other areas.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that oral contraceptives may have an effect on pelvic floor function. They could increase the risk of painful bladder and vulvar vestibulitis, but their effect on dyspareunia is inconsistent. However, robustly collected prospective data to establish causal associations are needed.

### Postmenopausal hormone therapy: does it cause incontinence? [^1159ens8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the effect of hormone therapy on risk of stress and urge urinary incontinence.

Methods

The Heart Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial to evaluate daily oral conjugated estrogen (0.625 mg) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg) therapy for the prevention of heart disease events in women with established heart disease. The 1,208 participants in Heart Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study who reported no loss of urine in the previous 7 days at baseline are included in this analysis.

Results

During 4.2 years of treatment, 64% of women randomly assigned to hormone therapy compared with 49% of those assigned to placebo reported weekly incontinence (P < .001). The higher risk of incontinence in the hormone group was evident at 4 months, persisted throughout the treatment period, and was independent of the age of the women. The odds ratios for weekly incontinence among women on hormone therapy compared with placebo were 1.5 for urge incontinence (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–1.8; P < .001) and 1.7 for stress incontinence (95% CI 1.5–2.1; P < .001). Four years of treatment with hormone therapy caused an excess risk of 12% for weekly urge incontinence and 16% for weekly stress incontinence; the corresponding numbers needed to harm were 8.6 (95% CI 5.8–16.6) and 6.2 (95% CI 4.6–9.4).

Conclusion

Estrogen plus progestin therapy increases risk of urge and stress incontinence within 4 months of beginning treatment.

### Urinary incontinence in women [^111Zh67v]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Urinary incontinence is common in women, but is under-reported and under-treated. Urine storage and emptying is a complex coordination between the bladder and urethra, and disturbances in the system due to childbirth, aging, or other medical conditions can lead to urinary incontinence. The two main types of incontinence in women, stress urinary incontinence and urge urinary incontinence, can be evaluated by history and simple clinical assessment available to most primary care physicians. There is a wide range of therapeutic options, but the recent proliferation of new drug treatments and surgical devices for urinary incontinence have had mixed results; direct-to-consumer advertising has increased public awareness of the problem of urinary incontinence, but many new products are being introduced without long-term assessment of their safety and efficacy.

### Risk of urinary incontinence symptoms in oral contraceptive users: a national cohort study from the Swedish twin register [^114N5L3Z]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the impact of oral contraceptives on lower urinary tract dysfunction in premenopausal women.

Design

Nationwide cohort study.

Setting

National registry.

Patient(S)

A total of 10,791 women (born 1959–1985) from the population- based Swedish Twin Registry who participated in a web-based survey of common diseases.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Symptoms of urinary incontinence.

Result(S)

For users of oral contraception there was a significantly reduced risk for symptoms of stress urinary incontinence, mixed urinary incontinence, and urgency urinary incontinence. The reduction remained significant when adjusting for age, body mass index, and pregnancy history. A reduced prevalence of symptoms of overactive bladder in oral contraceptive users was also observed although the association was nonsignificant. There were no significant associations between lower urinary tract symptoms and women using a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device compared with noncontraceptive users, with the exception of nocturia.

Conclusion(S)

Oral contraceptive use reduces the overall risk for symptoms of urinary incontinence.

### Oestrogen therapy for urinary incontinence in post-menopausal women [^113SEHjv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

It is possible that oestrogen deficiency may be an aetiological factor in the development of urinary incontinence in women.

Objectives

To assess the effects of local and systemic oestrogens used for the treatment of urinary incontinence.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register of trials (2 April 2009) and the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that included oestrogens in at least one arm, in women with symptomatic or urodynamic diagnoses of stress, urgency or mixed urinary incontinence or other urinary symptoms post-menopause.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trials were evaluated for methodological quality and appropriateness for inclusion by the review authors. Data were extracted by at least two authors and cross checked. Subgroup analyses were performed grouping participants under local or systemic administration. Where appropriate, meta-analysis was undertaken.

Main Results

Thirty- three trials were identified which included 19,313 (1,262 involved in trials of local administration) incontinent women of whom 9417 received oestrogen therapy. Sample sizes ranged from 16 to 16,117. The trials used varying combinations of type of oestrogen, dose, duration of treatment and length of follow up. Outcome data were not reported consistently and were available for only a minority of outcomes. Systemic administration (of oral oestrogens) resulted in worse incontinence than on placebo (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.48). This result is heavily weighted by a subgroup of women from the Hendrix trial, which had large numbers of participants and a longer follow up of one year; all the women had had a hysterectomy and the treatment used was conjugated equine oestrogen. The result for women with an intact uterus where oestrogen and progestogen combined were used also showed a statistically significant worsening of incontinence (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.18). There was some evidence that oestrogens used locally (for example vaginal creams or tablets) may improve incontinence (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.86). Overall, there were around one to two fewer voids in 24 hours and nocturnal voids amongst women treated with local oestrogen, and there was less frequency and urgency. No serious adverse events were reported although some women experienced vaginal spotting, breast tenderness or nausea. Women who were continent and received systemic oestrogen replacement, with or without progestogens, for reasons other than urinary incontinence were more likely to report the development of new urinary incontinence in one large study. The data were too few to address questions about oestrogens compared with or in combination with other treatments, different types of oestrogen or different modes of delivery.

Authors' Conclusions

Local oestrogen treatment for incontinence may improve or cure it, but there was little evidence from the trials on the period after oestrogen treatment had finished and none about long-term effects. However, systemic hormone replacement therapy, using conjugated equine oestrogen, may make incontinence worse. There were too few data to reliably address other aspects of oestrogen therapy, such as oestrogen type and dose, and no direct evidence on route of administration. The risk of endometrial and breast cancer after long-term use suggests that oestrogen treatment should be for limited periods, especially in those women with an intact uterus.

### Oestrogen therapy for urinary incontinence in post-menopausal women [^1122Gde1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

It is possible that oestrogen deficiency may be an aetiological factor in the development of urinary incontinence in women. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003 and subsequently updated in 2009.

Objectives

To assess the effects of local and systemic oestrogens used for the treatment of urinary incontinence.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register of trials (searched 21 June 2012) which includes searches of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings, and the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that included oestrogens in at least one arm in women with symptomatic or urodynamic diagnoses of stress, urgency or mixed urinary incontinence or other urinary symptoms post-menopause.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trials were evaluated for risk of bias and appropriateness for inclusion by the review authors. Data were extracted by at least two authors and cross checked. Subgroup analyses were performed by grouping participants under local or systemic administration. Where appropriate, meta-analysis was undertaken.

Main Results

Thirty-four trials were identified which included approximately 19,676 incontinent women of whom 9599 received oestrogen therapy (1464 involved in trials of local vaginal oestrogen administration). Sample sizes of the studies ranged from 16 to 16,117 women. The trials used varying combinations of type of oestrogen, dose, duration of treatment and length of follow up. Outcome data were not reported consistently and were available for only a minority of outcomes. The combined result of six trials of systemic administration (of oral systemic oestrogens) resulted in worse incontinence than on placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.48). This result was heavily weighted by a subgroup of women from the Hendrix trial, which had large numbers of participants and a longer follow up of one year. All of the women had had a hysterectomy and the treatment used was conjugated equine oestrogen. The result for women with an intact uterus where oestrogen and progestogen were combined also showed a statistically significant worsening of incontinence (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.18). There was some evidence that oestrogens used locally (for example vaginal creams or pessaries) may improve incontinence (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.86). Overall, there were around one to two fewer voids in 24 hours amongst women treated with local oestrogen, and there was less frequency and urgency. No serious adverse events were reported although some women experienced vaginal spotting, breast tenderness or nausea. Women who were continent and received systemic oestrogen replacement, with or without progestogens, for reasons other than urinary incontinence were more likely to report the development of new urinary incontinence in one large study. One small trial showed that women were more likely to have an improvement in incontinence after pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) than with local oestrogen therapy (RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.50 to 3.52). The data were too few to address questions about oestrogens compared with or in combination with other treatments, different types of oestrogen or different modes of delivery.

Authors' Conclusions

Urinary incontinence may be improved with the use of local oestrogen treatment. However, there was little evidence from the trials on the period after oestrogen treatment had finished and no information about the long-term effects of this therapy was given. Conversely, systemic hormone replacement therapy using conjugated equine oestrogen may worsen incontinence. There were too few data to reliably address other aspects of oestrogen therapy, such as oestrogen type and dose, and no direct evidence comparing routes of administration. The risk of endometrial and breast cancer after long-term use of systemic oestrogen suggests that treatment should be for limited periods, especially in those women with an intact uterus.

### Hormonal contraception use and risk of lower urinary tract symptoms and conditions: findings from the Boston area community health survey [^113pxFGV]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the association between hormonal contraception (HC) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) among premenopausal women in the Boston Area Community Health Survey.

Methods

At baseline in 2002–2005 and 5 years later, participants provided information on contraception use, 14 LUTS, and rUTIs. We used this information to investigate HC use (ever, past, current, and ever systemic) in relation to the prevalence and risk of urinary incontinence, other storage symptoms, voiding/emptying symptoms, lower urinary tract pain, and rUTIs. Associations were estimated using Poisson regression with robust variance estimation, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, vaginal parity, body mass index, waist circumference, cigarette smoking, diabetes, and sexual activity (rUTI analyses only).

Results

In both prevalent (n = 881) and incident analyses (n = 608–867, depending on the LUTS), no associations were observed for HC use with urinary incontinence, other storage LUTS, voiding/emptying LUTS, or lower urinary tract pain. In contrast, positive associations were observed for rUTIs in prevalent analyses (ever [adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) 6.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–41.3] and current use [aPR 16.3, 95% CI 1.8–152.1] compared to never use), with similar suggestive positive associations in incident analyses (ever use [adjusted relative risk = 4.4, 95% CI 0.9–21.2] and current use [aPR 5.9, 95% CI 0.7–53.5]).

Conclusions

Our prospective findings do not support associations between HC use and risk of most LUTS or conditions, except for rUTIs. Future studies should explore this association further to determine whether it is explained by residual confounding by sexual activity or the possible influence of HC use on the hormonal genitourinary tract milieu.

### Can we prevent incontinence? ICI-RS 2011 [^114NTaXR]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

A review of the current state of research with regard to prevention of incontinence.

Methods

The search was limited to English language publications on the topic of incontinence prevention.

Results

Incontinence is associated with a range of risk factors, most of which are modifiable. Lifestyle changes with behavioral modifications that can prevent urinary incontinence (UI) need to be adopted from an early phase of life. Pregnancy per se for the woman, independent of labor and delivery practice, is a risk factor for UI. The influence of estrogen is still under discussion as to its direct influence to UI. For both men and women, there is a correlation between pelvic-floor related surgery and UI and fecal incontinence (FI). With further improvement in surgical techniques, UI is often only a transient symptom for most patients. Psychological illnesses and their treatment can induce or worsen incontinence and therefore should be evaluated especially with other necessary co-medications.

Conclusions

The evidence would suggest that in some cases incontinence can be prevented. Although the evidence base for UI is greater than that for FI, the conditions share many similarities with respect to risk and treatment, suggesting that similar benefits may derive from population-based prevention strategies. With primary prevention, actions taken early, even in the absence of incontinence, may avoid or delay its onset. There is also evidence that some risk factors for incontinence are modifiable, although not type specific, and can be reduced through preventive measures.

### Effects of estrogen with and without progestin on urinary incontinence [^114UppF5]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Menopausal hormone therapy has long been credited with many benefits beyond the indications of relieving hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness, and it is often prescribed to treat urinary incontinence (UI).

Objective

To assess the effects of menopausal hormone therapy on the incidence and severity of symptoms of stress, urge, and mixed UI in healthy postmenopausal women.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Women's Health Initiative multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of menopausal hormone therapy in 27,347 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years enrolled between 1993 and 1998, for whom UI symptoms were known in 23,296 participants at baseline and 1 year.

Interventions

Women were randomized based on hysterectomy status to active treatment or placebo in either the estrogen plus progestin (E + P) or estrogen alone trials. The E + P hormones were 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE + MPA); estrogen alone consisted of 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen (CEE). There were 8506 participants who received CEE + MPA (8102 who received placebo) and 5310 who received CEE alone (5429 who received placebo).

Main Outcome Measures

Incident UI at 1 year among women without UI at baseline and severity of UI at 1 year among women who had UI at baseline.

Results

Menopausal hormone therapy increased the incidence of all types of UI at 1 year among women who were continent at baseline. The risk was highest for stress UI (CEE + MPA: relative risk [RR], 1.87 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.61–2.18]; CEE alone: RR, 2.15 [95% CI, 1.77–2.62]), followed by mixed UI (CEE + MPA: RR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.10–2.01]; CEE alone: RR, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.26–2.53]). The combination of CEE + MPA had no significant effect on developing urge UI (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.99–1.34), but CEE alone increased the risk (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10–1.58). Among women experiencing UI at baseline, frequency worsened in both trials (CEE + MPA: RR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.28–1.49]; CEE alone: RR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.35–1.61]). Amount of UI worsened at 1 year in both trials (CEE + MPA: RR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.06–1.36]; CEE alone: RR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.39–1.82]). Women receiving menopausal hormone therapy were more likely to report that UI limited their daily activities (CEE + MPA: RR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.06–1.32]; CEE alone: RR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.15–1.45]) and bothered or disturbed them (CEE + MPA: RR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.13–1.32]; CEE alone: RR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.37–1.65]) at 1 year.

Conclusions

Conjugated equine estrogen alone and CEE + MPA increased the risk of UI among continent women and worsened the characteristics of UI among symptomatic women after 1 year. Conjugated equine estrogen with or without progestin should not be prescribed for the prevention or relief of UI.

### Oestrogens for urinary incontinence in women [^115TEnyH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

It is possible that oestrogen deficiency may be an aetiological factor in the development of urinary incontinence in women.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oestrogens used for the treatment of urinary incontinence.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group trials register (November 2002) and the reference lists of relevant articles. Date of the most recent searches: November 2002.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that included oestrogens in at least one arm, in women with symptomatic or urodynamic diagnoses of stress, urge or mixed incontinence or other urinary symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trials were evaluated for methodological quality and appropriateness for inclusion by the reviewers. Data were extracted by all three reviewers and cross checked. Trial results were analysed within clinical subgroups or by intervention. Where appropriate, meta-analysis was undertaken.

Main Results

Twenty eight trials were identified which included 2926 women. Sample sizes ranged from 16 to 1525. The trials used varying combinations of type of oestrogen, dose, duration of treatment and length of follow up. Outcome data were not reported consistently and were available for only a minority of trials. In the 15 trials that compared oestrogen with placebo, 374 women received oestrogen and 344 placebo. Subjective impression of cure was higher amongst those treated with oestrogen for all categories of incontinence (36/101, 36% versus 20/96, 21%; RR for cure 1.61, 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.49). When subjective cure and improvement were considered together, a statistically higher cure and improvement rate was shown for both urge (35/61, 57% versus 16/58, 28% on placebo) and stress (46/107, 43% versus 29/109, 27%) incontinence. For women with urge incontinence, the chance of cure or improvement was approximately a quarter higher again than in women with stress incontinence. Taking all trials together, the data suggested that about 50% of women treated with oestrogen were cured or improved compared with about 25% on placebo. Overall, there were around 1 to 2 fewer voids in 24 hours amongst women treated with oestrogen. The effect again appeared to be larger amongst women with urge incontinence. There were no statistically significant differences in respect of frequency, nocturia or urgency. No serious adverse events were reported although some women experienced vaginal spotting, breast tenderness or nausea. In a large trial conducted amongst women with heart disease, data from a subset who had incontinence suggested that women treated with a combination of oestrogen and a progestogen had lower subjective cure or improvement rates compared to the placebo group (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95). The data were too few to address other questions about oestrogens compared with, or in combination with, other treatments, different types of oestrogen or different modes of delivery.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Oestrogen treatment can improve or cure incontinence and the evidence suggests that this is more likely with urge incontinence. There was little evidence from the trials after oestrogen treatment had finished and none about long-term effects. Combined oestrogen and progesterone appeared to reduce the likelihood of cure or improvement. There were too few data to address reliably other aspects of oestrogen therapy such as oestrogen type, dose and route of administration. However, the risk of endometrial and breast cancer after long-term use suggests that oestrogen treatment should be for limited periods, especially in women with an intact uterus.

### Management of urinary incontinence in women: scientific review [^111WUZBc]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Urinary incontinence is a common health problem among women that negatively impacts quality of life. Therefore, it is important that primary care physicians have an understanding of how to manage urinary incontinence effectively.

Objective

To review the most recent, high-quality evidence regarding the etiology and management of urinary incontinence in women.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and the ACP Journal Club were performed to identify English-language articles published between 1998–2003 that focused on the etiology or treatment of urinary incontinence in adult women. The references of each retrieved article were reviewed and an expert in the field was contacted to identify additional relevant articles.

Data Extraction

Using a combination of more than 80 search terms, we included articles of etiology that were cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, or systematic reviews of cohort, case-control, and/or cross-sectional studies. Studies of treatment had to be randomized controlled trials or systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials. The quality of each article was assessed independently by each author and inclusion (n = 66) was determined by consensus.

Data Synthesis

Multiple factors have been found to be associated with urinary incontinence, some of which are amenable to modification. Factors associated with incontinence include age, white race, higher educational attainment, pregnancy-related factors, gynecological factors, urological and gastrointestinal tract factors, comorbid diseases, higher body mass index, medications, smoking, caffeine, and functional impairment. There are several effective nonpharmacological treatments including pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation, bladder training, and prompted voiding. Anticholinergic drugs are effective in the treatment of urge urinary incontinence. Several surgical interventions are effective in the management of stress incontinence, including open retropubic colposuspension and suburethral sling procedure.

Conclusion

Urinary incontinence in women is an important public health concern, and effective treatment options exist.

### Menopause hormone therapy and urinary symptoms: a systematic review [^117Bu6Gt]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Importance

Urogenital changes associated with menopause are now classified as genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), which includes symptoms of urgency, frequency, dysuria, and recurrent urinary tract infections for which the recommended treatment is estrogen. However, the association between menopause and urinary symptoms and the efficacy of hormone therapy for these symptoms is uncertain.

Objective

Our objective was to define the relationship between menopause and urinary symptoms including dysuria, urgency, frequency, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and urge and stress incontinence by conducting a systematic review of the effects of hormone therapy (HT) for urinary symptoms in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

Evidence Review

Eligible studies included randomized control trials with perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with a primary or secondary outcome of the following urinary symptoms: dysuria, frequent UTI, urgency, frequency, and incontinence, included at least one treatment arm of estrogen therapy, and were in English. Animal trials, cancer studies and pharmacokinetic studies, secondary analyses, and conference abstracts were excluded. PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched until April 2022. Two authors reviewed each article with discrepancies resolved through whole group consensus. Data extracted included the following: publication date, country, setting, subject number, follow-up, duration, age, race/ethnicity, study design, inclusion criteria, and main findings.

Findings

There is insufficient evidence to confirm that menopause is associated with urinary symptoms. The effect of HT on urinary symptoms depends on type. Systemic HT may cause urinary incontinence or worsen existing urinary symptoms. Vaginal estrogen improves dysuria, frequency, urge and stress incontinence, and recurrent UTI in menopausal women.

Conclusions and Relevance

Vaginal estrogen improves urinary symptoms and decreases the risk of recurrent UTI in postmenopausal women.

### Estrogens and the lower urinary tract [^113QMBwq]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2011). Low credibility.

The urogenital tract is sensitive to the effect of oestrogen and progesterone throughout adult life. Epidemiological studies have implicated oestrogen deficiency in the aetiology of lower urinary tract symptoms occurring following the menopause. Although to date the role of oestrogen replacement therapy in the management of postmenopausal urinary incontinence remains controversial its use in the management of women complaining of urogenital atrophy is now well established. This aim of this paper is to review the recent evidence regarding the urogenital effects of hormone therapy with a particular emphasis on the management of postmenopausal urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, recurrent lower urinary tract infections and urogenital atrophy. In addition to a review of the available evidence suggestions are also made regarding priorities for further research in the field.

### Postmenopausal hormones and incontinence: the heart and estrogen / progestin replacement study [^111XnRTr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether postmenopausal hormone therapy improves the severity of urinary incontinence.

Methods

We included measures of incontinence and voiding frequency in the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study, a randomized, blinded trial of the effect of hormone therapy among 2763 postmenopausal women younger than 80 years with coronary disease and intact uteri. This report includes 1525 participants who reported at least one episode of incontinence per week at baseline. Participants were randomly assigned to 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in one tablet daily (n = 768) or placebo (n = 757) and were followed for a mean of 4.1 years. Severity of incontinence was classified as improved (decrease of at least two episodes per week), unchanged (change of at most one episode per week), or worsened (increase of at least two episodes per week).

Results

Incontinence improved in 26% of the women assigned to placebo compared with 21% assigned to hormones, while 27% of the placebo group worsened compared with 39% of the hormone group (P = .001). This difference was evident by 4 months of treatment and was observed for both urge and stress incontinence. The number of incontinent episodes per week increased an average of 0.7 in the hormone group and decreased by 0.1 in the placebo group (P < .001).

Conclusion

Daily oral estrogen plus progestin therapy was associated with worsening urinary incontinence in older postmenopausal women with weekly incontinence. We do not recommend this therapy for the treatment of incontinence.

### Increased risk for stress urinary incontinence in women with postmenopausal hormone therapy [^115qHEAz]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

The impact of estradiol-based hormone therapy (HT) on the incidence of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is unknown. Therefore, we compared the use of such HT regimens and tibolone in women with and without SUI.

Methods

The women with a history of SUI operation (N = 15,002) were identified from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Register, and the control women without such an operation (N = 44,389) from the Finnish Central Population Register. The use of HT was traced from the National Drug Reimbursement Register, and the odd ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for SUI were calculated by using the conditional logistic regression analysis.

Results

The cases had used any HT more often than the controls. The use of systemic estradiol-only or estradiol-progestin therapy was accompanied by an increased SUI risk (OR 3.8, 95% CI: 3.6–4.0 and OR 2.7, 95% CI: 2.6–2.9 respectively). The use of estradiol with noretisterone acetate showed a higher risk of increase than that with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Age over 55 years at the initiation of systemic HT was accompanied by a higher SUI risk increase than that under 55 years of age. The use of tibolone, an estradiol + levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, or vaginal estradiol also increased the risk.

Conclusions

The use of HT regimens may predispose to the de novo development or worsening of pre-existing SUI. Thus, caution is needed when these regimens are prescribed to women with mild stress-related urine leakage or with established SUI risk factors.

### Nonsurgical management of urinary incontinence in women: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116ueijr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Urinary incontinence in women — epidemiology, risk factors, types, and treatment goals: Urinary incontinence (UI), the involuntary loss of urine, has a prevalence of approximately 25% in young women (aged 14 to 21 years), 44% to 57% in middle-aged and postmenopausal women (aged 40 to 60 years), and 75% in elderly women (aged ≥ 75 years), and at least half of incontinent women do not report the issue to their physicians. Risk factors for UI include pregnancy, pelvic floor trauma after vaginal delivery, menopause, hysterectomy, obesity, urinary tract infection, functional and/or cognitive impairment, chronic cough, and constipation. Urinary incontinence also contributes to high medical spending — approximately $19.5 billion was spent in the United States in 2004 — and it accounts for 6% of nursing home admissions for elderly women, costing approximately $3 billion. The 2 types of UI are based on the dysfunctional mechanism: stress and urgency; stress UI is related to urethral sphincter failure associated with intra-abdominal pressure and results in the inability to retain urine when laughing, coughing, or sneezing, whereas urgency UI is the involuntary loss of urine associated with a sudden and compelling urge to void; mixed UI is a combination of stress and urgency. Overactive bladder is a constellation of symptoms that includes urinary urgency (with or without UI), usually accompanied by frequency, and nocturia. The primary goal of treatment is to achieve or improve continence, and clinically successful treatment has been defined as that which reduces the frequency of UI episodes by at least 50%; nonsurgical treatments addressed in this guideline include lifestyle changes, pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), and various approved drugs.

### Urinary incontinence and related quality of life among elderly women in tabas, south khorasan, iran [^113KGRc4]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

The results showed a statistically significant relationship between the UI prevalence with age, history of cesarean section, lifestyle, and drug use. That is, the UI prevalence was 30% in people aged 80 years and older and 26.2% in elderly women with a history of cesarean section. Also, the prevalence of this disorder was 35% among the elderly who lived with their single children. The majority of previous relevant studies revealed that UI prevalence in women increased with age. With age, anatomical and physiological changes of the urogenital system such as muscle and axon degeneration, decrease in bladder capacity, increase in detrusor activity and consequent decrease in detrusor contractile strength occur and as a result, elderly women are prone to UI. Overall, increased UI prevalence in elderly women may be due to the relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles and connective tissue supporting the urethra.

Only 26% of the participants who had a history of cesarean section reported that they are suffering from UI, and the prevalence of UI was higher among women who had no history of cesarean section. The results of previous studies also have shown that vaginal delivery may be related to UI and not cesarean Section. Some other studies have not reported a definitive relationship between the mode of delivery and UI.

There was a statistically significant relationship between the prevalence of UI and drug use. The results of other studies also indicate the relationship between drug use and UI prevalence. "In principle, drugs could cause incontinence by lowering bladder outlet resistance and/or by increasing intravesical pressure, which disrupts the normal pressure relationship between the bladder and urethra and leads to urinary leakage; other possibilities include disturbances of the central nervous control of voiding or an overproduction of urine".

### Effectiveness of hormones in postmenopausal pelvic floor dysfunction-international urogynecological association research and development-committee opinion [^113E5gww]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Role of systemic hormonal treatment relating to pelvic floor disorders

Influence of HRT on UI

There are major discrepancies regarding the role of exogenous systemic estrogen administration for UI in the existing literature, and available clinical trials report conflicting results. On the one hand, subjective improvement of UI could be demonstrated in a few studies, but several clinical trials and reviews could not demonstrate any efficacy — quite the contrary — of estrogen therapy for treatment of UI. However, these results have to be interpreted with caution as different therapeutic interventions were used in terms of the type of estrogen, dose, route of administration and duration of therapy.

Before publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) in 2002, systemic hormone therapy (HT) in various forms, doses and regimens of estrogen with or without progestin was commonly prescribed. Outcomes from the WHI study also taught us that systemic estrogen can be harmful because of the reported side effects such as increased risk of stroke after some years. A subgroup analysis showed that women receiving estrogen only as well as combination therapy had a statistically significant increase in risk for UI [estimated event rate difference, per 10,000 person-years (95% CI) 1261 (880–1689) and 876 (606–1168)], but this did not persist after stopping hormone therapy. Cody et al. reported in a Cochrane review (the combined results of six trials) that administration of oral estrogens resulted in an impairment of UI compared with placebo [risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% CI 1.17–1.48]. All of the women were hysterectomized, and the treatment used was conjugated equine estrogen. The results for women with an intact uterus where estrogen and progestogen were combined also showed a statistically significant worsening of UI (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04–1.18). Furthermore, women who were continent and received systemic estrogen replacement, with or without progestogens, for reasons other than UI, are more likely to report the development of new UI. In summary, systemic HT should not be used either to prevent or as therapy for urinary incontinence.

Influence of HRT on FI

Staller et al. studied the association between HRT and risk of FI among 55.828 postmenopausal women (participating in the WHI, Nurses' Health Study as well as HERS), and current or past use of HRT was associated with a modestly increased risk of FI among postmenopausal women. These results support a potential role for exogenous estrogens in the impairment of the fecal continence mechanism.

### Effect of oestrogen therapy on faecal incontinence in postmenopausal women: a systematic review [^111QLZrC]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

We performed a systematic review of all studies in female humans without any language restrictions.

Eligibility criteria

The population of interest was postmenopausal women, the intervention was the use of oestrogen therapy via any route, the comparator was no oestrogen use, placebo or other therapy and the outcome was faecal incontinence. All studies dealing with the above-mentioned population, intervention, comparator and outcome (PICO) of interest were evaluated.

Search strategy and selection of studies

A literature search of the bibliographic databases including Ovid, Medline, Cochrane library, EMBASE, LILACS, Global Index Medicus and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) was conducted by a professional librarian. The search strategy was based on a number of relevant medical subheadings (MeSH), words and word variants. The following key words were used: "menopause" or "postmenopause" AND "oestrogen replacement therapy" or "HRT" or "oestrogen" or "hormone" and "replacement" and "therapy" or "oestrogen only" or "combined" and "oestrogen" and "progesterone" AND "faecal incontinence" or "faeces" or "bowel" or "anal" and "incontinence".

The reference lists of the identified articles were searched and a grey literature search was performed to identify any other relevant articles or presentations (Annual Meetings screened for potential articles of interest: International Urogynecological Association [IUGA] 2014–2018 and International Continence Society [ICS] 2014–2017 [2018 not available]). Two reviewers then independently screened the titles and abstracts of all the articles and any disagreements were resolved through discussion or if required, by an independent third reviewer (PL). Full texts of the potentially eligible articles were then reviewed and assessed. One paper, only available in Portuguese, was translated into English for assessment.

The included studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB-2) and the Newcastle–Ottawa quality assessment scale where appropriate. The data were extracted independently by the two reviewers and entered onto a Microsoft Word table.

### The role of estrogens in female lower urinary tract dysfunction [^1137WwPP]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

The urogenital tract and lower urinary tract are sensitive to the effects of estrogen and progesterone throughout adult life. Epidemiologic studies have implicated estrogen deficiency in the etiology of lower urinary tract symptoms that occur after menopause. Although the role of estrogen replacement therapy in the management of postmenopausal urinary incontinence (UI) remains controversial, its use in the treatment of women with urogenital atrophy is now well established. This review summarizes recent evidence of the urogenital effects of hormone therapy, particularly emphasizing management of postmenopausal UI and recurrent lower urinary tract infections. Estrogen therapy alone has little effect in the management of urodynamic stress UI, although in combination with an alpha-adrenergic agonist, it may improve urinary leakage. Estrogen therapy may be of benefit for the irritative symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, and urge UI, although this effect may result from reversal of urogenital atrophy rather than a direct action on the lower urinary tract. The role of estrogen replacement therapy in the treatment of women with recurrent lower urinary tract infections remains to be determined, although there is now some evidence that vaginal administration may be efficacious. Low-dose, vaginally administered estrogens have a role in the treatment of urogenital atrophy in postmenopausal women and appear to be as effective as systemic preparations.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1156DA6e]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Urinary tract symptoms (including pelvic floor disorders) — hormone therapy effects — Vaginal ET increases periurethral and bladder neck vascularity and reduces the frequency and amplitude of detrusor contractions to promote detrusor muscle relaxation. Two large trials found that systemic hormone therapy with CEE 0.625 mg plus MPA 2.5 mg increased stress incontinence; increased incontinence was seen with oral ET alone (relative risk [RR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.17–1.48) and with EPT (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04–1.18). In contrast, vaginal estrogen use decreased incontinence (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64–0.86) and overactive bladder, with one to two fewer voids in 24 hours and reduced frequency and urgency; randomized trials show reduced risk of recurrent UTIs with vaginal but not oral estrogen. Evidence for effectiveness for pelvic organ prolapse is lacking.

### Prevalence of commonly prescribed medications potentially contributing to urinary symptoms in a cohort of older patients seeking care for incontinence [^1163HPZP]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Despite this research complexity, a growing body of evidence supports clinicians in their efforts to pursue medication modification as a risk reduction strategy for patients experiencing urinary symptoms. Data exist on post-menopausal hormone therapy examined in the context of two large randomized placebo controlled trials, with urinary symptoms as a post-hoc endpoint. Findings indicated a two-fold increased risk of de novo stress and mixed incontinence among new users of estrogen replacement therapy, a 30% increase in the onset of urgency incontinence and a significant exacerbation in the amount and frequency of stress and urgency incontinence among women with pre-existing symptoms. In a case control study, 20/49 women taking alpha-blocking antihyperstensives experienced incontinence compared to 8/49 controls (40.8 vs. 16.3%), although the relationship no longer persisted when patients on loop diuretics were excluded from the analysis. Discontinuation of alpha-blocking agents in 18 women with incontinence resulted in 13 (72%) reporting total or almost complete resolution of their urinary symptoms. Clinical data from a series of 172 elderly hypertensive and heart failure patients found that the use of loop but not thiazide diuretics was significantly associated with increased urinary frequency, a relationship that persisted when the age of the patient and the use of other cardiovascular diseases were accounted for. New use of calcium channels blockers among 38 men aged 47–89 years old was found to significantly exacerbate voiding symptoms, even when adjusting for other medication use and conditions that could contribute to lower urinary tract symptoms. A number of case reports describe cough-induced stress incontinence upon initiation of an ACE inhibitor, which remits upon discontinuation, and one case series reported a 10% incidence of severe ACE-inhibitor-induced stress incontinence in diabetic post-menopausal women.

### Stress urinary incontinence and the forgotten female hormones [^111LoLru]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of hormones to treat stress urinary incontinence (SUI) has fallen out of favor because of concerns over safety following publication of the Women's Health Initiative study. In addition, there are data that suggest that estrogen treatment does not help SUI. As women age, the decline in androgen output mirrors the increasing prevalence of SUI implying a potential causal association. Therefore, we suggest that androgens are the 'forgotten female hormone'.Vaginal estrogens can treat pelvic floor structures without significant systemic effects; we suggest that vaginal androgens can act similarly and thereby avoid the unwanted systemic effects of androgenization in women. Based on available preclinical and clinical data, we suggest that research should investigate vaginal treatment with androgen hormones as adjunctive therapy to pelvic floor exercises for SUI. In a postmenopausal woman, this could be supplemented with estrogens if trial data warrant it.

### Urinary incontinence in women [^115UbYUb]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Urinary incontinence symptoms are highly prevalent among women, have a substantial effect on health-related quality of life and are associated with considerable personal and societal expenditure. Two main types are described: stress urinary incontinence, in which urine leaks in association with physical exertion, and urgency urinary incontinence, in which urine leaks in association with a sudden compelling desire to void. Women who experience both symptoms are considered as having mixed urinary incontinence. Research has revealed overlapping potential causes of incontinence, including dysfunction of the detrusor muscle or muscles of the pelvic floor, dysfunction of the neural controls of storage and voiding, and perturbation of the local environment within the bladder. A full diagnostic evaluation of urinary incontinence requires a medical history, physical examination, urinalysis, assessment of quality of life and, when initial treatments fail, invasive urodynamics. Interventions can include non-surgical options (such as lifestyle modifications, pelvic floor muscle training and drugs) and surgical options to support the urethra or increase bladder capacity. Future directions in research may increasingly target primary prevention through understanding of environmental and genetic risks for incontinence.

North American Menopause Society 2022 hormone therapy — urinary tract symptoms (including pelvic floor disorders) explains that systemic hormone therapy does not improve urinary incontinence and may increase the incidence of stress urinary incontinence (Level I). Low-dose vaginal ET may provide benefit for urinary symptoms, including prevention of recurrent UTIs, overactive bladder, and urge incontinence (Level II). Hormone therapy does not have FDA approval for any urinary health indication (Level I).

### Management of urinary incontinence in women: clinical applications [^114SxCWs]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Urinary incontinence, defined as involuntary loss of urine, is a common health problem among women. The prevalence rate is between 12% and 55% for having ever experienced urinary incontinence. It is associated with poor self-rated health, impaired quality of life, social isolation, and depressive symptoms. However, physicians are usually not the ones to initiate discussion about incontinence with their patients. We present clinical cases to illustrate common scenarios in which a physician may be able to help a female patient manage her urinary incontinence by specifically addressing associated factors and offering treatments to improve or possibly even cure her symptoms. Several evidence-based effective nonpharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical treatment options are outlined.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^117KZpWR]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women — evaluation: Clinicians should obtain a complete patient history and perform a pelvic examination in women presenting with rUTIs. (Clinical Principle) Patients with rUTIs should have a complete history obtained, including LUTS such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, nocturia, incontinence, hematuria, pneumaturia, and fecaluria; further information to obtain includes any history of bowel symptoms such as diarrhea, accidental bowel leakage, or constipation; recent use of antibiotics for any medical condition; prior antibiotic-related problems (e.g. C. difficile infection); antibiotic allergies and sensitivities; back or flank pain; catheter usage; vaginal discharge or irritation; menopausal status; post-coital UTI; contraceptive method; and use of spermicides or estrogen- or progesterone-containing products. Details of prior urinary tract or pelvic surgery should be obtained, and patients should be queried as to travel history and history of working or walking for long periods of time, and UTI history includes frequency of UTI, antimicrobial usage, and documentation of positive cultures and the type of cultured microorganisms. Patient history should document the symptoms the patient considers indicative of a UTI, the relationship of acute episodes to infectious triggers (e.g., sexual intercourse), antimicrobials used for each episode, responses to treatment for each episode, as well as the results of any prior diagnostic investigations, and it is also important to note the relationship of infections to hormonal influences (e.g., menstruation, menopause, exogenous hormone use) as well as concomitant medication usage or behaviors that may alter infection susceptibility, including prior antimicrobial treatment, immunomodulatory medications, and topicals such as spermicides. At the initial presentation for rUTI evaluation, a physical examination including an abdominal and detailed pelvic examination should be performed to look for any structural or functional abnormalities; pelvic support for the bladder, urethra, vagina, and rectum should be documented, noting the compartment and stage of any clinically significant prolapse; and the bladder and urethra should be palpated directly for evidence of urethritis, urethral diverticulum, Skene's gland cyst, or other enlarged vulvar or vaginal cysts.

### Genitourinary symptoms in the menopausal transition [^111DFX9a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Irregular uterine bleeding is a common symptom among women in the menopausal transition. Women commonly transition from having regular cycles to having irregular cycles before the final menstrual period. In late perimenopause, anovulation becomes more common, leading to skipped menstrual cycles. Low-dose oral contraceptive pills are effective in decreasing the amount of menstrual blood loss and improving menstrual cycle regularity. It is unclear whether menorrhagia is associated with normal perimenopausal hormonal changes. Studies to date have failed to correlate menorrhagia with hormonal levels and pathology within the uterus. Because of the common association between uterine pathology and menorrhagia, this is an important area for future studies. Vaginal dryness is a common symptom, particularly in late perimenopause. The association between vaginal dryness and low estrogen levels is clear. Estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy is effective in treating this symptom. Locally released estrogen therapy may be preferred over systemic therapy because of lower systemic estradiol levels, reduced side effects, and high efficacy. The long-term safety of these products, particularly in women with a history of breast cancer, requires more study. The prevalence of incontinence increases as women age, but it is unclear whether the menopausal transition is an independent risk factor. Incontinence is a frequent complaint among women in the menopausal transition. In postmenopausal women, hormone therapy (HT) appears to be ineffective in preventing or improving the symptoms of incontinence. Further study of HT, including locally applied estrogens for the common symptom of incontinence, are needed in women in the menopausal transition.

### Effects of oral estrogen and progestin on the lower urinary tract among female nursing home residents [^115oQYrv]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the effects of oral estrogen/progestin on incontinence and related lower urinary tract conditions among female nursing home (NH) residents.

Design

Randomized placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Five NHs.

Participants

Thirty-two incontinent female residents of average age 88.

Measurements

Subjects were randomized to receive either oral estrogen (0.625 mg) combined with progesterone (2.5 mg) or placebo, daily for 6 months. Measures of incontinence severity, the clinical appearance of the vagina, vaginal and urethral cytology, and urine and vaginal cultures were made at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. In addition to active drug or placebo, all subjects received regular toileting assistance (prompted voiding) by trained research aides during 3-day data-collection periods to compensate for mobility and cognitive impairments.

Results

At 3 and 6 months there were no significant differences between the groups in the severity of incontinence, the prevalence of bacteriuria, or the results of vaginal cultures. Several clinical findings associated with atrophic vaginitis improved more in the active than the placebo group and vaginal pH and vaginal and urethral cytology exhibited a partial estrogenic effect.

Conclusions

Our results must be interpreted with caution because of the size and the select nature of our subject sample. Up to 6 months of oral estrogen had only a partial estrogenic effect on vaginal and urethral epithelium and no clinical effects in this patient population. We believe that future studies of estrogen for urinary incontinence in frail NH residents should utilize a topical preparation and consider targeting urinary tract infection as an additional outcome measure.

### Urinary incontinence in the 12-month postpartum period [^115TFSH9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the prevalence and severity of urinary incontinence in the 12-month postpartum period and to relate this incontinence to several potential risk factors including body mass index, smoking, oral contraceptives, breast-feeding, and pelvic floor muscle exercise.

Methods

Participants were 523 women, aged 14 to 42 years, who had obstetrical deliveries. The women were interviewed in their rooms on postpartum day 2 or 3 and by telephone 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postpartum. Chart abstraction was conducted to obtain obstetrical data from the index delivery.

Results

At 6 weeks postpartum, 11.36% of women reported some degree of urinary incontinence since the index delivery. Although the rate of incontinence did not change significantly over the postpartum year, frequency of accidents decreased over time. In the generalized estimating equation, postpartum incontinence was significantly associated with seven variables: baseline report of smoking (odds ratio [OR] 2.934; p = 0.002), incontinence during pregnancy (OR 2.002; p = 0.007), length of breast-feeding (OR 1.169; p = 0.023), vaginal delivery (OR 2.360; p = 0.002), use of forceps (OR 1.870; p = 0.024), and two time-varying covariates: frequency of urination (OR 1.123; P = < .001) and body mass index (OR 1.055; p = 0.005). Factors not associated with postpartum incontinence included age, race, education, episiotomy, number of vaginal deliveries, attendance at childbirth preparation classes, and performing pelvic floor muscle exercises during the postpartum period.

Conclusion

Postpartum incontinence is associated with several risk factors, some of which are potentially modifiable and others that can help target at-risk women for early intervention.

### Adrenergic drugs for urinary incontinence in adults [^116ZCEAv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Adrenergic drugs have been used for the treatment of urinary incontinence. However, they have generally been considered to be ineffective or to have side effects which may limit their clinical use.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of adrenergic agonists in the treatment of urinary incontinence in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group trials register (January 2002) and the reference lists of relevant articles. Date of the most recent searches: January 2002.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials which include an adrenergic agonist drug in at least one arm for adults with urinary incontinence.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data. Data were processed as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook.

Main Results

Fifteen randomised trials were identified, which included 832 women, of whom 506 received an adrenergic drug (phenylpropanolamine in 11 trials, Midodrine in two and Clenbuterol in another two). Of these, six were crossover trials. No trials included men. The limited evidence suggested that an adrenergic agonist drug is better than placebo in reducing number of pad changes and incontinence episodes, as well as improvement in subjective symptoms. The drugs also appeared to be better than pelvic floor muscle training in two small trials, possibly reflecting relative acceptability of the treatments to women but perhaps due to differential withdrawal of women from the trial groups. There was not enough evidence to evaluate the use of higher compared to lower doses of adrenergic agonists nor the relative merits of an adrenergic agonist drug compared with oestrogen, whether used alone or in combination.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There was weak evidence to suggest that use of an adrenergic agonist is better than placebo treatment. There was not enough evidence to assess the effects of adrenergic agonists when compared to or combined with other treatments. Patients using adrenergic agonists may suffer from minor side effects, only occasionally leading them to stop treatment. Rare but serious side effects such as cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension have been reported, however.

### Urinary tract infections in postmenopausal women: effect of hormone therapy and risk factors [^116F5RuA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of hormone therapy on urinary tract infection frequency and to examine potential risk factors.

Methods

We used data from the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study, a randomized, blinded trial of the effects of hormone therapy on coronary heart disease events among 2763 postmenopausal women aged 44–79 with established coronary heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate or placebo and followed for a mean of 4.1 years. History of physician-diagnosed urinary tract infections and risk factors were assessed by self-report at baseline and each annual visit.

Results

Urinary tract infection frequency was higher in the group randomized to hormone treatment, although the difference was not statistically significant (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99, 1.37). Statistically significant risk factors for urinary tract infections in multivariable analysis included: women with diabetes on treatment (insulin OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.40, 2.34), oral medications OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.09, 1.90), poor health (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.14, 1.57), childbirth (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.00, 1.90), vaginal itching (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.07, 2.50), vaginal dryness (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.04, 1.67), and urge incontinence (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.30, 1.75). Urinary tract infections in the previous year were strongly associated with a single urinary tract infection (OR 7.00, 95% CI 5.91, 8.29) as well as multiple urinary tract infections (OR 18.51, 95% CI 14.27, 24.02).

Conclusions

Oral hormone therapy did not reduce frequency of urinary tract infections. Potentially modifiable risk factors in postmenopausal women are different from those in younger women, and include diabetes, vaginal symptoms, and urge incontinence.

### Pharmacotherapy for stress urinary incontinence [^115DRTVd]. Current Opinion in Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the absence of an effective and well tolerated drug for stress urinary incontinence, pharmacological therapy for this condition has remained in the off-label prescription of some products particularly estrogens and alpha-adrenergic agonists. In this review we provide an update of the most recent developments on the pharmacological therapy for stress urinary incontinence.

Recent Findings

In recent years studies have uncovered a role for central neurotransmitters in control of the lower urinary tract and specific targets for pharmacological intervention have been identified. Duloxetine inhibits presynaptic neuron reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, in the sacral spinal cord, increasing urethral closure forces and thereby reducing episodes of stress urinary incontinence. In clinical trials in women with stress urinary incontinence, duloxetine has demonstrated efficacy in reducing incontinence episodes and increasing quality of life with no serious adverse effects. Nausea was the most common adverse event, being reported as mild-to moderate in severity and transient in most of patients.

Summary

Although estrogens produce some effects on the urethral epithelium and may be useful in patients with atrophic vaginitis, at present, there is no good evidence supporting its use in women with stress urinary incontinence. Alpha-adrenoreceptor agonists have been found to be effective in stress urinary incontinence, but the use of these drugs is limited due to some major safety concerns related to cardiovascular side effects. Duloxetine is a new selective norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor that has proven efficacy for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence in women.

### Menopausal hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions: a systematic review to update the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations [^113oSzzH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Menopausal hormone therapy to prevent chronic conditions is currently not recommended because of its adverse effects.

Purpose

To update evidence about the effectiveness of hormone therapy in reducing risk for chronic conditions and adverse effects, and to examine whether outcomes vary among women in different subgroups.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (January 2002 to November 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through the 3rd quarter of 2011), Scopus, and reference lists.

Study Selection

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials of menopausal hormone therapy published in English since 2002 that assessed primary prevention of chronic conditions.

Data Extraction

Investigators extracted data on participants, study design, analysis, follow-up, and results; 2 investigators independently rated study quality by using established criteria.

Data Synthesis

9 fair-quality trials met the inclusion criteria. The Women's Health Initiative reported most of the results, had 11 years of follow-up, and had data most applicable to postmenopausal women in the United States. It showed that estrogen plus progestin therapy reduced fractures (46 fewer per 10 000 woman-years) and increased invasive breast cancer (8 more per 10 000 woman-years), stroke (9 more per 10 000 woman-years), deep venous thrombosis (12 more per 10 000 woman-years), pulmonary embolism (9 more per 10 000 woman-years), lung cancer death (5 more per 10 000 woman-years), gallbladder disease (20 more per 10 000 woman-years), dementia (22 more per 10 000 woman-years), and urinary incontinence (872 more per 10 000 woman-years). Estrogen-only therapy reduced fractures (56 fewer per 10 000 woman-years), invasive breast cancer (8 fewer per 10 000 woman-years), and death (2 fewer per 10 000 woman-years) and increased stroke (11 more per 10 000 woman-years), deep venous thrombosis (7 more per 10 000 woman-years), gallbladder disease (33 more per 10 000 woman-years), and urinary incontinence (1271 more per 10 000 woman-years). Outcomes did not consistently differ by age or comorbid conditions.

Limitation

Limitations of the trials included low adherence, high attrition, inadequate power to detect risks for some outcomes, and evaluation of few regimens.

Conclusion

Estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone decreased risk for fractures but increased risk for stroke, thromboembolic events, gallbladder disease, and urinary incontinence. Estrogen plus progestin increased risk for breast cancer and probable dementia, whereas estrogen alone decreased risk for breast cancer.

### No. 248-guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of recurrent urinary incontinence following pelvic floor surgery [^1121iJM8]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for urinary incontinence in women, more specifically with respect to management of recurrent UI, SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend to consider offering conservative measures, such as drugs to relax the urethral sphincter, timed toileting, and double voiding, for the management of urinary frequency with moderate elevation of post-void residual volume. Consider also offering intermittent self-catheterization.

### Vaginal estrogen use in postmenopausal women with pelvic floor disorders: systematic review and practice guidelines [^112qghiJ]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Risk of pelvic floor disorders increases after menopause and may be linked to estrogen deficiency. We aimed to systematically and critically assess the literature on vaginal estrogen in the management of pelvic floor disorders in postmenopausal women and provide evidence-based clinical practice guidelines.

Methods

MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to July 2014 for randomized controlled trials of commercially available vaginal estrogen products compared with placebo, no treatment, or any medication for overactive bladder or urinary incontinence. We double-screened 1,805 abstracts and identified 12 eligible papers. Studies were extracted for participant information, intervention, comparator, efficacy outcomes, and adverse events, and they were individually and collectively assessed for methodological quality and strength of evidence.

Results

Evidence was generally of poor to moderate quality. Vaginal estrogen application before pelvic organ prolapse surgery improved the vaginal maturation index and increased vaginal epithelial thickness. Postoperative vaginal estrogen use after a midurethral sling resulted in decreased urinary frequency and urgency. Vaginal estrogen and immediate-release oxybutynin were similar in improvement of urinary urgency, frequency, and urgency urinary incontinence in women with overactive bladder, but oxybutynin had higher rates of side effects and discontinuation. Conversely, the addition of vaginal estrogen to immediate or extended-release tolterodine did not improve urinary symptoms more than tolterodine alone. One study reported an improvement in stress urinary incontinence with use of vaginal estrogen.

Conclusion

Vaginal estrogen application may play a useful role as an adjunct in the management of common pelvic floor disorders in postmenopausal women.

### Overactive bladder drugs and the risk of dementia [^116uPuw6]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

As with most observational studies, the central question is whether the observed associations reflect cause and effect. In favour of causation is biological plausibility (acetylcholine has a key role in cortical activation; anticholinergics impair cognition while most dementia treatments enhance cholinergic transmission) and, in the study by Pourhadi and colleagues, a modest dose-response gradient. The case for causation is weakened by several observations, including a low-to-modest effect sizes; unexpected associations (trospium, which should not cross the blood-brain barrier, was associated with dementia in both studies); and no differential risk relative to mirabegron, which suggests protopathic bias. In summary, these new studies fall well short of establishing cause and effect.

Even without compelling evidence for causality, the case for judicious use of drugs for overactive bladder is easily made. Four steps should be routinely considered before initiating drug treatment. Firstly, establish the cause of urinary incontinence. Drugs for overactive bladder are not indicated for stress incontinence. Secondly, identify contributing factors, including medications and comorbidities. For example, drugs such as cholinesterase inhibitors and loop diuretics can exacerbate urinary symptoms, triggering prescribing cascades in which a second drug is prescribed to treat an adverse effect of another. Improving control of diabetes mellitus and sleep apnoea might also alleviate symptoms. Thirdly, implement non-drug interventions. Behavioural interventions such as pelvic floor muscle training and bladder training (scheduled voiding at gradually increasing intervals) could outperform drug treatments without adverse effects. Lifestyle changes such as reducing caffeine intake, weight loss in individuals with obesity, and optimising fluid intake are also recommended. Lastly, weigh the expected benefits and risks of drug treatment. While the urge to do something for urinary incontinence can be strong, drugs for overactive bladder reduce incontinence by about half an episode per day. Consequently, for patients with multiple episodes of incontinence per day, the marginal benefit might not outweigh potential side effects.

### Effect of single doses of citalopram and reboxetine on urethral pressure: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-and active-controlled three-period crossover study in healthy women [^115WbQxm]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

Regulatory approvals were obtained from the Regional Ethics Committee (approval number: H‐19011020) and the Danish Medicines Agency (EudraCT 2019‐000059‐14). The study was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the local GCP unit monitored the study. The study was registered on(NCT04097288) and written informed content was obtained from all subjects before study related procedures. Funding was provided by the clinical department.

2.1 Study design and subjects

This was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐ and active‐controlled three‐way crossover study designed to assess the effect of citalopram and reboxetine on urethral pressure in healthy women. Subjects were recruited for this study by advertisement. The inclusion criteria were age 18–55 years, body mass index 18.5–30.0 kg/m 2, and regular use of safe contraceptive methods. Major exclusion criteria were any history or evidence of clinically significant disease, including any history or symptom of urinary incontinence, urinary retention, or overactive bladder, known QT prolongation or congenital long QT syndrome, smoking and drug abuse within 3 months before inclusion, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or use of any drugs (except for paracetamol (up to 4 g/day) and hormonal contraception).

2.2 Randomization and blinding

The Capital Region Pharmacy manufactured the blinded dosing kits and performed the randomization. The subjects were assigned consecutive randomization numbers (1–24), which corresponded to one of six possible treatment sequences. A Latin Square design balanced for the period was used (see Supporting Information Data). Study investigators, outcome assessor (performing urethral pressure reflectometry [UPR] measurements), other trial personnel, and subjects were blinded to sequence allocation throughout the study period.

### Effectiveness of hormones in postmenopausal pelvic floor dysfunction-international urogynecological association research and development-committee opinion [^111uRugq]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitation of the literature

A wide variety of topical estrogen administration forms and different dosages were used in the reported studies. Furthermore, heterogeneous control groups were used, and LET was compared with placebo or no treatment or non-hormonal treatment. There were a few RCTs, but they were not adequately powered. Therefore, most of the results have to be interpreted with caution.

Summary and recommendations

Most of the recommendations are evidence level 2C, meaning a low quality of evidence, and there is still a need for additional robust evidence.
LET seems to be safe and beneficial in the treatment of VVS compared with placebo.
LET improves lower urinary tract symptoms such as frequency, urgency and UI in postmenopausal women.
LET improves the vaginal environment and reduces UTIs at the time of prolapse surgery.
Little evidence exists to support the effect of LET on the quality of surgical repair, prolapse recurrence, etc.
Postmenopausal women on systemic hormonal treatment should be counseled regarding the increased risk of worsening of urinary incontinence symptoms or development of de novo incontinence and possibly fecal incontinence.

Still unclear:
Evidence is too sparse to give any recommendations regarding the effectiveness of LET in the treatment or prevention for POP.
No evidence and recommendations exist regarding the duration, optimal dosage, long-term effect and cost-effectiveness of estrogen treatment.

### Urinary incontinence and related quality of life among elderly women in tabas, south khorasan, iran [^115tp5LU]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

The mean ± SD of participants' age was 70.86 ± 8.27 years (range of 60–95 years). The majority of the participants had elementary education (57.5%) and were married. Of them, 36.3% had joint pain. Approximately, 66% of participants suffered from hypertension. Also, 35.8% of them had hyperlipidemia and 30% had diabetes (Tables 2 and 3, total column).

The prevalence of UI among the participants was 24.9%. The mean UI score was 6.29 ± 2.75 from the score range of 3 to 15. The most common UI was SUI among participants (40.2%). The least common UI in both groups was nighttime incontinence or nocturnal enuresis (Table 1).

Table 1
Prevalence of UI types in the studied population and among the elderly with UI

The mean ± SD of the UI-QoL score was 38.04 ± 11.67 from the score range of 22–76. There was a positive and significant correlation between UI-related QoL score and UI score (r = 0.585, p < 0.001). There was also no significant difference between different UI types in terms of UI-related QoL (Table 2).

Table 2
Mean and standard deviation of urinary incontinence-related quality of life score by types of urinary incontinence in the participants

SUI = Stress Urinary Incontinence, UUI = Urge Urinary Incontinence, PMSUI = Post Micturition Symptoms Urinary Incontinence, MUI = Mixed Urinary Incontinence

There was a statistically significant relationship between the prevalence of UI types with age, history of cesarean section, lifestyle, and regular drug use (p < 0.05). The prevalence of UI was 30% in people aged 80 years and older and 26.2% in the participants without a history of cesarean section. Also, the prevalence of this syndrome was 35% among elderly women who lived with their single children and 28.2% among those who were taking medication (Table 3).

### Single-dose tadalafil reduces opening urethral pressure: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in healthy women [^111S4Fp9]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

After receiving approvals from the regional ethics committee (H-2100186) and the Danish Medicines Agency (EudraCT number 2020–005839–76), this trial, registered at(ID NCT05095077), was conducted at the Zelo Phase 1 Unit, Copenhagen University Hospital Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg. The trial adhered to International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and relevant legislation, and was overseen by the GCP Unit at Copenhagen University Hospital.

Participants

Healthy female participants were recruited through advertisement on an online platform for trial participants. Eligible participants were women between 18 and 55 years (both included) with a body weight of 50 kg or more and a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 30 kg/m 2. Other inclusion criteria included the use of safe contraceptive methods or sexual abstinence throughout the trial period. We excluded women with a history of urinary dysfunction, including incontinence, retention, or overactive bladder; clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition; systemic drug use within the 2 weeks before the first trial day (except for paracetamol [up to 4 g/day], hormonal contraception and hormone replacement therapy); smoking within the previous 3 months; pregnancy within the previous 6 months; and current breastfeeding. All participants provided written informed consent upon entering the trial.

Trial Design, Randomization, and Masking

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-visit crossover trial with healthy female volunteers. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either a blinded single dose of tadalafil (40 mg) or a visually identical placebo at their first visit and then all participants crossed over and received the opposite treatment at the second visit. The production and packaging of the blinded dosing kit and the randomization process were carried out by the hospital pharmacy. In this way, investigators, outcome assessors, data managers, and participants were blinded to the random sequence allocation throughout the trial period, data management, and statistical analysis. To avoid carry-over effects, the visits were separated by a washout period of a minimum of 6 days, corresponding to approximately eight half-lives of tadalafil, giving a mean terminal half-life of 17.5 h.

### Urinary incontinence and related quality of life among elderly women in tabas, south khorasan, iran [^1114DbLq]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary incontinence (UI) is one of the most common problems in old age that is often seen in women, which causes not only physical problems but also psychological, social, economic problems and poor quality of life. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the UI and related quality of life (QoL) in elderly women.

Methods

This cross-sectional study enrolled 369 women over 60 years old and living in Tabas city, Iran who were selected by cluster random sampling method. The instruments included the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form, the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Urinary Incontinence Quality of Life Module, and a demographic questionnaire. Data analysis was carried out using independent t-test, chi-square, and logistic regression in SPSS software.

Results

The UI prevalence among participants was 24.9% and stress urinary incontinence was the most common type (40.2% of all elderly patients). The mean UI-related QoL score was 38.04 ± 11.67 from the score range of 22–76. There was a significant positive correlation between UI-related QoL score and UI score (r = 0.585, p < 0.001). Age, body mass index (BMI), constipation, history of cesarean section, hypertension, and the use of angiotensin receptor blockers are factors increasing the odds of having UI in this study population.

Conclusion

Aging, some chronic diseases, high BMI, and the use of some drugs are related to UI prevalence. Also, it is associated with lower QOL among elderly women. Designing appropriate intervention programs, controlling chronic diseases, training in the proper use of drugs, and also some physical exercises can be effective in controlling and improving this common syndrome of old age and promoting their QoL.

### Prevalence and associated factors of urinary incontinence in women living in China: a literature review [^112ezmzu]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

In our research, there was only one study focused on the young women (18–26 years old) and it found that age (21–26 years old comparing with 18–20 years old), constipation, alcohol consumption, often/always delayed urination, and/or often/always strained to urinate were associated with UI. The prevalence of UI in this study was 23.6%. Evidence from studies of young women who live outside of China also provides compelling evidence that UI in young women should be investigated further and intentionally. For example, the prevalence rate of UI for Swedish women (N = 653) between the ages of 18 and 30 years was 12%. In nulligravid Australian women aged 16–30 years (average age 22.5 ± 3.2 years), the prevalence of overall UI was 12.6%, and women who were sexually active and those who were not using oral contraceptives had the highest rates of UI. Mishra et al.'s study found that the UI prevalence rate for Australian women aged 22–27 years was 6.8% at baseline and increased to 16.5% nine years later. These researchers also reported that women with depressive symptoms or a history of depression were more likely than those without depressive symptoms to report subsequent UI symptoms. For nulligravid women living in Italy between 15 and 25 years old, age, BMI, depression/anxiety/panic attacks, eating disorders, and constipation were risk factors for UI. Participating in organized sports that involves high-volume exercise for competition also increased the risk of developing UI (OR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.3–2.7). Other studies conducted outside of China showed that UI is an issue for many nulliparous female athletes.

Gaps in our understanding of LUT function

To develop pathophysiologically based therapeutic options, a better understanding of contributions of the bladder and the urethra to LUT function is necessary. Historically, the approach has been to study the function of the entire LUT and to attribute changes in function as the result of changes in bladder function without considering the contribution of urethral function. While this is problematic for understanding both compartments of the LUT, studies that have been designed to study each compartment in isolation have focused disproportionately on bladder function. For example, the mechanisms that allow the female urethra to be functionally competent are not well studied, leading to an insufficient understanding of the pathophysiologies that underlie outlet obstruction and SUI in women. Therefore, more research should be directed to urethral function.

Another major gap in basic knowledge is bladder sensory signaling. Recent studies suggest that the primary cause of LUTSs may be due to alterations in sensory processing, including disorders in the brain. In addition, the urothelium that lines the bladder lumen has been suggested to act not only as a barrier but also as a sensory transducer of bladder filling, but the mechanisms of this putative role require further elucidation. Nonetheless, the bladder mucosa and the lamina propria have been suggested to be important functional centers of the bladder. The protective role of estrogen on the urothelium against UTIs and bladder cancer has been suggested, but is not fully understood, similar to the role of reproductive hormones in LUT function and dysfunction.

Much research has been devoted to understanding the regulation of contraction and relaxation of the detrusor or urethral smooth muscle by direct neural regulation. By understanding the intracellular mechanisms of smooth muscle contraction and regulation, we will improve our understanding of the excitation–contraction coupling event to develop new targets for novel therapeutic options.

Clinically, research on women who can void, despite not being able to generate sufficient detrusor contraction pressures, is of interest because it opens the possibility of more than one mechanism involved in voiding. Last, research is being conducted to develop alternatives to catheters for those patients who cannot void/empty their bladder, including bladder retraining, pharmacologic treatment, and neuromodulation.

### Effectiveness of hormones in postmenopausal pelvic floor dysfunction-international urogynecological association research and development-committee opinion [^113QmWjx]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction and hypothesis

There is clear evidence of the presence of estradiol receptors (ERs) in the female lower urinary and genital tract. Furthermore, it is a fact that estrogen deficiency after menopause may cause atrophic changes of the urogenital tract as well as various urinary symptoms. Moreover, the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on urinary incontinence (UI) symptoms as well as pelvic organ prolapse (POP), anal incontinence (AI) and vulvovaginal symptoms (VVS) is still a matter of debate. This committee opinion paper summarizes the best evidence on influence of sex steroids as well as hormonal treatment (local and systemic) in postmenopausal women with pelvic floor disorders.

Methods

A working subcommittee from the International Urogynecology Association (IUGA) Research and Development Committee was formed. A thorough literature search was conducted and an opinion statement expressed. The literature regarding hormones and pelvic floor disorders was reviewed independently and summarized by the individual members of the sub-committee.

Results

The majority of studies reported that vaginal estrogen treatment when compared with placebo has more beneficial effects on symptoms and signs of vaginal atrophy including sensation of burning, dyspareunia and UI symptoms. Definitive evidence on local estrogen application and prolapse treatment or prevention is lacking. A statistically significant increase in risk of worsening of UI as well as development of de novo incontinence was observed with estrogen-only or combination systemic HRT.

Conclusions

In summary, local estrogen seems to be safe and effective in the treatment of VVS and can also improve urinary symptoms in postmenopausal patients with UI, but most of these recommendations correspond to evidence level 2C. The evidence in POP is still scarce but not in favor of benefit. Finally, the duration of local estrogen treatment (LET), optimal dosage, long-term effects and cost-effectiveness compared with current practice are still unknown.

Reproductive years

The prevalence of LUTSs in women increases throughout their reproductive years. Many lifelong behaviors become established during the teenage and early adult years, which makes this an ideal time for intervention to prevent poor bladder and dietary habits that could eventually lead to LUTSs. The most common LUTS at this age is UI, including stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), and mixed urinary incontinence (MUI).SUI is defined as involuntary urine leakage on physical exertion (exercise, coughing, sneezing). UUI is loss of urine with urgency. Finally, MUI is the occurrence of both SUI and UUI.

UI symptoms may begin early in the reproductive years. In 2011, 41% of young female athletes (median age of 22) reported having at least one episode of SUI during high impact activities. Approximately 25% of women under age 40 report SUI during physical activity. Of working women between ages 18–60, 37% reported urine leakage during the previous 30 days; 44% reported leakage at least once monthly during work hours; 21% reported weekly incontinence; and 8% reported daily incontinence or more. More than 88% of these women reported a negative impact on concentration, physical activity levels, self-confidence, and ability to complete their work without requiring interruption. UI symptoms are stigmatizing–90% of women with UI never discuss their UI symptoms with their healthcare providers.

Pregnancy and vaginal delivery are prevalent comorbid conditions that may impact UI onset. Most women become sexually active in their reproductive years and subsequently experience pregnancy and childbirth, which are known risk factors for the development of LUTSs. After the first pregnancy, the odds of having SUI increased by 2.7-fold; up to a fourfold increased risk with 5 or more pregnancies. During vaginal delivery, the pelvic floor muscles stretch to accommodate passage of the fetus under significant abdominal pressure. Consequently, innervation and connective tissue support of the bladder and urethra can be damaged.

While vaginal delivery increased the risk of SUI, cesarean delivery was not protective against developing UI. In fact, the risk of developing severe SUI and UUI was equivalent regardless of the mode of birth. However, age at first delivery was associated with risk of UI. Women who delivered their first baby after the age of 30 had an increased risk of severe UI later in life and required more surgical interventions than those who delivered when they were younger.

### Expert panel recommendations on lower urinary tract health of women across their life span [^1114q96Y]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion and Recommendations

After a day of topical presentations and discussions, the entire group discussed the most important research recommendations emerging from the Roundtable. A summary of the discussion specific to each area follows. The specific recommendations are listed in Table 3.

3

As a whole, the experts agreed that given the demonstrated effectiveness of incontinence treatment, research is needed on methods of increasing healthcare-seeking behavior for women with incontinence as well as implementation of successful prevention and treatment strategies that extend the reach of and optimize individual adherence to effective continence promotion programs. However, while many effective treatments are available, there exists a fundamental lack of understanding of pathophysiology underlying LUT dysfunction, resulting in nontargeted therapies. Physicians are only able to treat symptoms, but cannot correct pathophysiological causes. This shortcoming is combined with the generalized grouping of patients according to symptoms rather than disease mechanisms and results in relatively poor management and ineffective treatment.

Discussions concluded that it is important to understand normal function along with dysfunction to identify the root cause of a problem with the ultimate goal of preventing disease. Knowledge gaps in research have resulted from inadequate phenotype definitions of urinary dysfunction, insufficient data to determine what is normal and abnormal, and animal models that do not appropriately reflect human disease. Specific research recommendations address these limitations, including the need for clinicians to better define disease states so that animal models that more accurately reflect these human conditions and their etiology can be developed.

There is a need for better understanding of molecular, cellular, microbiome, and physiological mechanisms of normal and abnormal function and improved understanding of the role of biological sex in urological function. Additional work is needed to develop animal models that discriminate between different disease etiologies (in incontinence, for example) to properly assess the efficacy and safety of newly developed treatments. Last, a precise understanding of etiologic mechanisms can inform how to develop preventative treatment strategies in the future.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause — focused history should document genitourinary symptoms and characterize chronicity, severity, and impact on quality of life (QoL), while identifying medication and comorbidity contributors and sexual/psychosocial concerns. The focused history should document genitourinary symptoms. It is important to understand the chronicity and severity of genitourinary symptoms as well as their impact on QoL, including sexual function. During a detailed history, the clinician should identify potential medications that might cause vaginal dryness (e.g., oral contraceptives, spironolactone, antihistamines, anti-androgens) and ask questions about sexual and psychosocial concerns. The clinician should also seek to identify medical comorbidities (e.g., lichen sclerosus, malignancy requiring radiation or chemotherapy, gender-affirming hormonal treatments, endocrine disorders, diabetes) that are known to cause GSM symptoms in some patients. Secondary sexual dysfunctions associated with GSM include decreased libido, arousal, genital sensation, and orgasmic responses (e.g., decreased intensity, increased orgasmic latency). Clinical symptoms of GSM that involve the lower urinary tract include urgency, frequency/nocturia, dysuria, stress/urge incontinence, and/or recurrent UTI (rUTI).

### Effect of oestrogen therapy on faecal incontinence in postmenopausal women: a systematic review [^112NDKaT]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Staller et al. reported from The Nurses' Health Study, which was a prospective cohort of 121,701 US female nurses initiated in 1976, where biennial self-administered questionnaires were completed since its conception. In 2008, questions about FI were included in the questionnaire, allowing its association with menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) in postmenopausal women to be studied. They stated that they asked about oral MHT. After exclusions (23,393 died, 13,587 were lost to follow-up, 15,830 had no FI information, 5,737 had no MHT information, 7,325 had baseline FI), Staller et al. reported on a cohort of 55,828 nurses. Women returned questionnaires in 2008, 2010 and 2012 about lifestyle factors, medical diagnosis, FI and exposure to MHT. Lifestyle factors and medical diagnoses considered were BMI, smoking, physical activity, parity, history of cholecystectomy, diabetes, hypertension and presence of neurological disease. The definition of FI was at least one solid or liquid faecal incontinence episode monthly. The number of months used, current use and type of MHT were recorded. Because of the assumed association with hormones, the analysis included measures that were surrogates for endogenous and exogenous oestrogen exposure, including parity, age at menopause, oral contraceptive use, ovulatory duration and type of menopause (surgical, radiation, natural). Of the 55,828 postmenopausal women eligible for the analysis, 6,834 developed FI (48% liquid, 40% solid and 12% solid and liquid). The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for incident FI were 1.32 (95% CI 1.20–1.45) for current users and 1.26 (95% CI 1.18–1.34) for past users of MHT compared with women who had never used MHT. The type of MHT altered the risk of FI in a subgroup analyses of current users: the multivariate hazard ratio was 1.37 (95% CI 1.10–1.71) for current users of combined formulations when compared with current users of oestrogen-only preparations. Women who were current users of MHT were younger at menopause, less likely to be obese or have diabetes and more likely to have had a surgically/radiation-induced menopause and to have used oral contraception. A longer duration of MHT increased the risk of FI with a multivariate adjusted risk of 1.22 (95% CI 1.13–1.31) for 1–5 years of use, 1.24 (95% CI 1.15–1.35) for 6–10 years of use, and 1.32 (95% CI 1.23–1.41) for > 10 years' use (p linear trend < 0.0001). The risk appears to return to baseline after > 2 years of discontinuation of MHT.

### Prevalence of commonly prescribed medications potentially contributing to urinary symptoms in a cohort of older patients seeking care for incontinence [^116FAJHG]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Lower urinary tract symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, urinary incontinence and voiding difficulties are highly prevalent and bothersome, impair quality of life and are associated with falls in the elderly. The etiology of lower urinary tract symptoms may be singular or multifactorial, with potential contributors encompassing lifestyle habits, underlying bladder or pelvic floor dysfunction, associated co-morbidities and/or functional factors. Many commonly used medications have been proposed to inadvertently interfere with bladder and/or sphincter function, or indirectly impair the ability to toilet. The use of oral estrogens, alpha-blocking agents, sedative-hypnotics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, ACE inhibitors, loop diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) and calcium channel blockers have all been implicated to some degree in the onset or exacerbation of urinary symptoms. Stress urinary incontinence has been associated with the use of alpha-blocking agents, which reduce urethral sphincter tone, and with consumption of ACE inhibitors in patients who experience treatment-related cough. Loop diuretics promote polyuria and can lead to urinary urgency and frequency, while NSAIDS and other medications known to cause edema may exacerbate nocturia due to nocturnal fluid redistribution. Centrally active medication potentially exert direct effects on the lower urinary tract system by causing relaxation of striated pelvic floor muscles and interfering with afferent sensory messages from the bladder, or even indirectly through their effect on mobility and toileting ability. Calcium channel blockers have been associated with bladder relaxation and impaired emptying, while the mechanism of action of estrogen replacement therapy remains unknown. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can precipitate de novo urgency incontinence via enhanced cholinergic activity in the bladder.

Elderly patients who seek care for incontinence have a higher likelihood of multiple morbidity, functional impairment and increased susceptibility to the adverse effects of medications. The prevalence of use of medications potentially contributing to urinary symptoms in older adults seeking care for incontinence remains unknown. A greater understanding of the frequency of use of specific classes of medications among these individuals could help target future research studies and clinical care approaches for reducing medication-risk in patients with urinary symptoms.

The purpose of the present report is to describe the prevalence of use of medications potentially causing or exacerbating lower urinary tract symptoms in a clinical cohort of older men and women presenting to outpatient incontinence clinics for an evaluation of urinary incontinence. Secondary objectives were to determine which factors were associated with the use of these medications, and to investigate whether associations between specific medication classes and the type or severity of urinary symptoms could be detected.

### Effect of oestrogen therapy on faecal incontinence in postmenopausal women: a systematic review [^116mAZvV]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We believe that this is currently the only review collating all the evidence available related to the impact of oestrogen on FI for postmenopausal women. The role of oestrogen therapy (vaginal, anal, systemic) in the treatment of FI in postmenopausal remains unclear because of limited high-quality data, but there is biological plausibility.

The mechanism suggested for the improvement reported in the first study by Donnelly et al. was increased resting pressure of the internal sphincter due to the improved functionality related to oestrogen causing alteration of collagen and elastic content of the pelvic floor. The subjective beneficial effects observed may have been related to an actual improvement in symptoms, but could also have been due to improved general wellbeing owing to increased circulating oestrogen from systemic administration and it is difficult to separate these effects. The next study found that topical anal oestrogens improved symptoms of FI; however, the placebo group also improved, highlighting a complex pathophysiology for FI with potential psychological overlay altering the patients' perception of the condition and therefore altering the subjective outcomes. In contrast to these first two studies, in 2017, the large prospective cohort study gave a hypothesis of oestrogen-mediated loss of connective tissue from the internal sphincter and levator ani to explain the increased FI with current and previous oestrogen use. The increased effect seen with combination therapy is attributed to progestin, causing both increased oestrogen receptors on the anorectum and a direct effect on oestrogen at a nuclear level. It is difficult to establish, in this particular study, whether exogenous oestrogen increases the risk of FI or whether women taking exogenous oestrogen are those who are affected most by both menopausal symptoms and FI and may have lower natural oestrogen levels. Although all the studies discussed add value to this systematic review, Staller et al.'s finding of increased risk of FI with oestrogen use is potentially a key finding that should be investigated promptly. Faecal incontinence could be an under-reported but considerable side effect of the widespread use of hormone therapy in postmenopausal women.

### Does urodynamic stress incontinence increase after the menopause? results from 2, 994 urodynamic studies in Australian women [^113xKhWc]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

As part of the growing awareness of age trends in incontinence, there has been increasing interest in the use of vaginal oestrogen in post-menopausal women, which has benefit as a first-line treatment for incontinence. Previous authors have mentioned difficulty in recruiting women with stress incontinence after the menopause into studies. Theoretically, oestrogen deprivation that occurs after the menopause should be associated with reduced epithelial coaptation of the urethral walls, reduced vascular pressure in the urethra and weakening of the ligaments supporting the peri-urethral tissues. Thus, we have been interested in assessing urodynamic stress incontinence (USI) after the menopause. However, most of the previous studies employing questionnaires or urodynamics have not focussed on the menopause as a possible contributing factor to the prevalence of any type of incontinence.

The aim of the present study was to analyse a consecutive series of urodynamic test results to determine the distribution of the different types of UI in pre- and post-menopausal women, more precisely than previous studies.

We hypothesised that the prevalence of USI in this population would be significantly greater in pre-menopausal women than in post-menopausal women.

### Oestrogens and overactive bladder [^111omvDC]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2014). Low credibility.

Estrogens are known to have a major role in the function of the lower urinary tract although the role of exogenous estrogen replacement therapy in the management of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction remains controversial. Whilst for many years systemic and vaginal estrogen therapy was felt to be beneficial in the treatment of lower urinary and genital tract symptoms this evidence has recently been challenged by large epidemiological studies investigating the use of systemic hormone replacement therapy. Consequently the role of estrogen in the management of postmenopausal women with Overactive Bladder (OAB) remains uncertain. In addition the evidence base regarding the use of exogenous estrogen therapy has changed significantly over the last decade and has led to a major changes in current clinical practice. The aim of this article is to review the evidence for the role of estrogen therapy in the management of OAB focusing on current knowledge with regard to both systemic and local estrogen therapy as well as investigating the emerging role of combination therapy with antimuscarinic agents.

Study Population

The 43,639 women who had participated in the Maternal Follow-up were eligible for this study. For all the analyses we excluded 1,669 women who had not answered any questions on UI, and 4,567 women who had not answered questions necessary to construct exposure variables. As pregnancy and the postpartum period itself are considered risk factors for UI, we also excluded women who reported having had UI already prior to childbirth (n = 1,364), women who were pregnant at follow-up (n = 252), or women with less than 12 months between last birth and follow-up (n = 142). This left us with a study population of 35,645 women (Fig. 1).

### Epidemiology of male urinary incontinence [^115B8iwA]. Current Opinion in Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary incontinence is a common clinical problem, particularly in older adults. This review was designed to review current and recently updated information on the epidemiology of urinary incontinence in men.

Recent Findings

There are an increasing number of urinary incontinence studies outside Europe and North America. However, overall, the trend indicates no remarkable increase in the number of publications relative to all areas. Prevalence studies have produced estimates with very wide ranges, mainly due to methodological differences. Studies have also examined risk factors and impact of urinary incontinence, including lifestyle, comorbidities and medications.

Summary

Recent research has focused less on urinary incontinence in men compared with women, despite urinary incontinence being relatively common and burdensome in men worldwide and strongly associated with age. Thus, the population burden is likely to increase with future demographic shifts. A wide variety of risk factors have been identified, and studies have shown that urinary incontinence can have substantial negative impacts on various clinical outcomes and quality of life.

### Prevalence and severity of urinary incontinence and associated factors in Iranian postmenopausal women: a cross-sectional study [^116vbdyh]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Menopausal transition is a biological situation associated with reproductive function loss and various health problems. Menopause, the permanent cessation of menstruation, results from the loss of ovarian follicular activity; it occurs between 45 and 55 years of age. Women spend about one-third of their lives in the postmenopausal period. Menopausal symptoms include physical and vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats), osteoporosis, urinary tract atrophy and infections, urinary incontinence (UI), increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, decreased libido, and sexual dysfunction.

The prevalence of UI during menopause varies from 9 to 69%. The overall rate is 46% in Iranian women, indicating the urgent need to pay attention to this issue. UI is the complaint of any unintentional passing of urine. It can be classified as follows: (A) Stress incontinence; unintentional and sudden loss of urine caused by increased intra-abdominal pressure with activities such as laughing, pushing, sneezing, and coughing, (B) Urgency incontinence; a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by an involuntary loss of urine, and (C) Mixed incontinence; a combination of stress and urgency incontinence. The frequency and severity of symptoms are related to age, body mass index (BMI), drowsiness, and constipation.

Urinary incontinence is not a life-threatening disease; however, it can affect the social, psychological, familial, occupational, physical, and sexual aspects of patients' lives. UI leads to a decrease in the quality of life, creating social isolation and limiting social activities. It is associated with decreased sexual desire and sexual satisfaction, also the feeling of shame and stress. According to recent data, the peak prevalence of UI is at the age of menopause. Estrogen and collagen deficiency result in decreased elasticity of the pelvic floor, atrophic changes, and urinary incontinence. Advanced age, usually coinciding with menopause, also has debilitating effects on the pelvic organs and tissues.

Due to the limited research on the Iranian population, the increase in mean life expectancy, and the prevalence of urinary incontinence and its impact on various aspects of life, our study aimed to determine the prevalence and severity of urinary incontinence and its related factors in a health centers-based sample of postmenopausal women in Tabriz-Iran. Caregivers better provide appropriate treatments to reduce the prevalence of UI through educating, preventing, and reducing the impact of risk factors.

### The effect of tolterodine on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a combination oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel [^114nBeNr]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Tolterodine is an antimuscarinic agent for the treatment of overactive bladder, a chronic condition that is particularly common in women. Given the prevalence pattern of overactive bladder and the widespread use of oral contraception, circumstances are likely to arise in which physicians may wish to prescribe tolterodine for patients already taking oral contraceptives. Based on a search of MEDLINE from 1990 to 2001, there have been no studies of whether concomitant use of these agents entails a risk of drug-drug interaction or conception.

Objective

This study investigated the effects of tolterodine on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a low-dose combination oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 microg/levonorgestrel 150 microg).

Methods

This was an open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover study in healthy women. Oral contraception was given for 21 days either alone or in combination with oral tolterodine 2 mg BID (on days 1–14) over two 28-day contraceptive cycles. Pharmacokinetic assessments were performed on day 14 based on plasma levels of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel up to 24 hours after dosing and serum tolterodine levels at 1 to 3 hours after dosing. The potential for pharmacodynamic interaction was assessed in terms of the risk of failure of suppression of ovulation based on serum levels of estradiol and progesterone measured throughout each cycle.

Results

Twenty-four healthy women (age, 23–41 years [mean, 30 years]; height, 155–178 cm [mean, 167 cm]; body weight, 51–75 kg [mean, 64 kg]) participated in the study. There was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between tolterodine and the steroid hormones in the oral contraceptive used, nor did the oral contraceptive show any relevant pharmacokinetic interaction with tolterodine. Serum levels of estradiol and progesterone indicated suppression of ovulation in both treatment periods.

Conclusion

In this selected population. coadministration of tolterodine did not affect the contraceptive efficacy of a low-dose combination oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel.

### Prevalence and associated factors of urinary incontinence in women living in China: a literature review [^114uFATC]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This review of studies on urinary incontinence (UI) was focused primarily on UI prevalence rates and associated factors across the adult lifecourse of Chinese women. UI is a urologic symptom that can have a significant impact on women's physical and mental health and quality of life. In addition, women with UI may experience socioeconomic burdens due to UI's effect on their ability to work and function in society. Although researchers from many countries have reported prevalence rates and associated factors for UI, little is known about the prevalence of UI in China's large female population. Language may act as a barrier to the inclusion of published studies in English-language journals. To overcome this barrier and to add to the global knowledge base about UI in women, the authors reviewed and discussed findings from epidemiological studies published in China and in Chinese language.

Methods

The authors retrieved research studies from the Wanfang database using the following search terms: "Subject: (Female)×Subject: (Urinary incontinence)×Subject: (Prevalence)×Date: 2013 to 2019". Searches employed the China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals and China Biology Medicine Database. The authors also used PubMed to search English-language studies published in Chinese journals on UI in Chinese women.

Results

This literature review includes 48 articles published between January 2013 and December 2019. The overall UI prevalence rates reported in adult Chinese women ranged from 8.7 to 69.8%, representing 43–349 million women, respectively. For women aged 17–40 years, 41–59 years, and 60 years and older, prevalence rates ranged from 2.6–30.0, 8.7–47.7, to 16.9–61.6%, respectively. Significant associated factors for overall UI included age, body mass index, constipation, parity, and menopause. Despite the 17–40 age range being peak reproductive years, the literature revealed little focus on UI prevalence rates. For women aged 41–59 years, the main associated factors included those related to pregnancy and gynecologic diseases. For women 60 years and older, chronic diseases represented most of the associated factors.

Conclusions

About 43–349 million Chinese women may experience UI. Many of the identified associated factors could be mitigated to reduce UI incidence and prevalence rates. Little is known about the prevalence rates and associated factors for UI among young (aged 17–40) Chinese women. Future research should investigate UI in young women to improve bladder health across their lifecourse.

### Associations between serum estrogen levels and urinary incontinence in women: a cross-sectional analysis of NHANES 2013 to 2016 [^1115SEwY]. Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore the relationship between serum estrogen levels and urinary incontinence in a nationally representative female population.

Materials and Methods

We included women who had serum estradiol measurements and self-reported urinary incontinence problems in the 2013–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles. A weighted multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine the association between urinary incontinence and serum estrogen levels after adjusting for age, race, Body Mass Index, diabetes, venipuncture, hypertension, poverty-to-income ratio, smoking, marital status, alcohol use, education, and menopause.

Result

A total of 4114 individuals were ultimately included in our study. Of these women, 1200 (29.17%) complained of urge urinary incontinence (UUI), 1674 (40.69%) complained of stress urinary incontinence (SUI), 730 (17.74%) complained of mixed urinary incontinence (MUI). Women in the lowest quartile of serum estrogen were more likely to complain of UUI compared to those in the highest quartile (OR = 1.885; 95% CI = 1.042–3.412, P = .039). No association was noted between serum estrogen levels and SUI or MUI.

Conclusion

Our study shows a significant association between low serum estrogen level and the increased likelihood of UUI in women. Further research is required to validate our findings, elucidate the physiological mechanisms that underlie them, and assess potential therapeutic implications.

### Effectiveness of hormones in postmenopausal pelvic floor dysfunction-international urogynecological association research and development-committee opinion [^113ks9fS]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Local estrogen in the treatment of OAB syndrome

In OAB, the use of LET has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials and also various guidelines have demonstrated significant improvement over placebo in urinary frequency, nocturia, urgency incontinence and volume at first sensation to void. Moreover, Erikson et al. performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial which showed that frequency, urgency, urgency incontinence and stress incontinence significantly improved with LET. However, one has to mention that some of the subjective improvement in these symptoms may simply represent local estrogenic effects reversing urogenital atrophy rather than a direct effect on lower urinary tract function. In an RCT published by Nelken et al. postmenopausal patients with OAB symptoms received either an estradiol-releasing vaginal ring or oral oxybutynin 5 mg twice daily. Those women who received oral oxybutynin had a mean decrease of 3.0 voids per day compared with a decrease of 4.5 voids per day in women using the estradiol ring, with a significant improvement in QoL parameters in both groups. The authors concluded that the estradiol-releasing vaginal ring and oral oxybutynin are similarly effective in OAB syndrome.

Regarding the synergistic use of vaginal estrogen therapy with antimuscarinic therapy, a 12-week prospective randomized trial compared tolterodine 2 mg twice daily and vaginal conjugated estrogen cream versus tolterodine 2 mg twice daily alone in 80 postmenopausal women with OAB symptoms. The results showed that combination therapy had a significantly greater improvement in mean daytime frequency and voided volume than monotherapy. Furthermore, a significantly greater improvement in quality of life (QoL) parameters was also observed in the combination therapy group.

Contrarily, other RCTs demonstrated that vaginal estrogen showed equivalence to oxybutynin 5 mg in the treatment of urinary urgency, frequency, and urge urinary incontinence, although the oral anticholinergic demonstrated a higher rate of side effects. The addition of local estrogen (various methods) to tolterodine (immediate or extended-release forms) did not offer an advantage over tolterodine alone, but one of the studies did demonstrate significantly fewer voids per day and greater voided volumes in the tolterodine plus estrogen arm.

### Prevalence of commonly prescribed medications potentially contributing to urinary symptoms in a cohort of older patients seeking care for incontinence [^116oT9tv]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The prevalence of use of medications potentially causing or exacerbating lower urinary tract symptoms was high (60.5%) in this clinical cohort of new patients presenting for a geriatric evaluation of urinary incontinence. More research is needed to determine whether de-prescribing these medications results in improved urinary symptoms.

### The association between constipation and lower urinary tract symptoms in parous middle-aged women: a prospective cohort study [^117FbWbF]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Our study includes women participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). ALSPAC is a prospective population-based birth cohort study, which recruited 14,541 pregnant women residing in the former Avon Health Authority in England, with an estimated date of delivery between April 1991 and December 1992. Detailed information can be found at the cohort website, including a fully searchable data dictionary. Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees. The relevant Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board provided (or waived) approval.

We defined the baseline of the current study between 2001 and 2005, at which time we excluded prevalent cases of LUTS and classified women according to whether they were taking medication to treat constipation or not. A total of 3,922 women had information on constipation and had not experienced LUTS at baseline (Fig. 1). Of these women, 3,729 had information on LUTS after 10 years of follow-up and were included in the current study (2011–2012) (Fig. 1).

FIG. 1.
Sample flowchart for constipation and LUTS paper. *Any LUTS includes storage symptoms (stress UI, mixed UI, urgency UI, urgency, nocturia, increased daytime frequency) and voiding symptoms (hesitancy and intermittency). LUTS, lower urinary tract symptoms; UI, urinary incontinence.

Constipation

Use of medication for constipation was self-reported in questionnaires at two time points (between 2001–2003 and 2003–2005). Women were asked to indicate whether they had "used any medicines (pills, syrups, inhalers, drops, sprays, suppositories, pessaries, ointments etc. including homeopathic and herbal remedies) in the last 12 months for constipation". Women indicated "yes" in response to this question by checking a box, whereas all women who did not respond "yes" were assumed to not have used any medicines for constipation in the past 12 months. We categorized the responses to using medications for constipation during the two time points as: none, yes at one of the two time points, and yes at both time points.

To increase statistical power, we repeated the analysis by collapsing the constipation variable into two categories instead of three: women who reported "no constipation" and women who reported "taking medication for constipation at any time point".

### Relationship between urinary profile of the endogenous steroids and postmenopausal women with stress urinary incontinence [^112qFetQ]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

The aims of this study were to investigate whether endogenous steroid hormones are (1) related to pathogenesis of stress urinary incontinence after menopause, (2) are related to severity of stress urinary incontinence, and (3) are related to prognostic parameters of stress urinary incontinence.

Methods

Twenty post-partum women with clinically diagnosed stress urinary incontinence and 20 age-matched postmenopausal women without stress urinary incontinence (control group) were evaluated. We compared urinary profile of the endogenous steroid hormones patients with stress urinary incontinence and controls, and between grade I and grade II of stress urinary incontinence. We also investigated the relationship between urinary profile of the endogenous steroid hormones and prognostic parameters of stress urinary incontinence (maximal urethral closure pressure, functional urethral length, Valsalva leak point pressure, cough leak point pressure, posterior urethrovesical angle, bladder neck descent, and stress urethral axis). The ages of the patients and those in the control group were 64.3 ± 5.6 and 57.5 ± 3.8 years old and the body mass indexes were 24.96 ± 3.14 and 22.11 ± 2.73 kg/m2 in patients and in normal subjects, respectively. Nine patients were grade I and 11 were grade II. Estrone and 17beta-estradiol only were detected in all subjects, regardless of control or patient group. It is noteworthy that there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in the levels of estrone and 17beta-estradiol in the urine of postmenopausal normal subjects compared with in the urine of postmenopausal patients with urinary incontinence. E2/E1 ratio was not different between the two groups (P > 0.05). Among the objective steroids, DHEA, Delta4-dione, Delta5-diol, Te, DHT, 16alpha-DHT, 11-keto An, THDOC, and THB were not detected either in the urine of normal subjects and nor in the urine of the patients. After comparing androgen levels between normal subjects and patients, no significant differences (P > 0.05) were detected, except for 5alpha-THB and 5alpha-THF. Neither 5alpha-THB or 5alpha-THF were detected in the patients' urine. Et/An (11beta-OH Et/11beta-OH An) concentration ratios were not significantly different between the two groups, either (P > 0.05). There were not significant differences of concentrations (micromol/g creatinine) of urinary steroids between grade I and grade II of stress urinary incontinence. Pregnanediol was significantly related to bladder neck descent in supine and sitting positions (R = 0.79, P = 0.01, and R = 0.73, P = 0.03, respectively), and pregnanetriol was significantly related to maximal urethral closure pressure and functional urethral length (R = 0.68, P = 0.04, and R = -0.79, P = 0.01, respectively). Androsterone was significantly related to bladder neck descent in supine and sitting positions (R = 0.68, P = 0.04, and R = 0.78, P = 0.01, respectively). 5-AT was significantly related to bladder neck descent in sitting position and stress urethral axis (R = 0.72, P = 0.03, and R = -0.71, P = 0.03). 11-keto Et was significantly related to bladder neck descent in supine and sitting positions and related to stress urethral axis (R = 0.82, P = 0.01, and R = 0.81, P = 0.01, R = -0.67, P = 0.04, respectively). THS was significantly related to bladder neck descent in supine and sitting positions and related to stress urethral axis (R = 0.76, P = 0.02, and R = 0.74, P = 0.02, R = -0.68, P = 0.04, respectively). THE was significantly related to bladder neck descent in sitting position (R = 0.67, P = 0.04).beta-Tetrahydrocortisol/alpha-tetrahydrocortisol (beta-THF/alpha-THF) and alpha-cortol were significantly related to maximal urethral closure pressure and functional urethral length (R = 0.74, P = 0.02, and R = -0.92, P = 0.01; R = 0.71, P = 0.36, and R = -0.87, P = 0.000, respectively). 17beta-estradiol (E2) was significantly related to bladder neck descent in supine position (R = -0.62, P = 0.04) and 17beta-estradiol/estrone (E2/E1) was significantly related to cough leak point pressure (R = 0.79, P = 0.01). In conclusion, the urinary concentrations of endogenous steroid metabolites in postmenopausal patients with stress urinary incontinence were not significantly different from normal patients and were not significantly different between grade I and grade II patients with stress urinary incontinence. Some endogenous steroid metabolites were positively or negatively significantly related to prognostic parameters of stress urinary incontinence.

### Hormone therapy for postmenopausal women with… [^1114KAjF]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Does hormone therapy improve urinary incontinence in postmenopausal women. Evidence-Based Answer Postmenopausal women should not receive oral hormone therapy for treatment of urinary incontinence. Hormone therapy is associated with worsening urinary incontinence in postmenopausal women who are incontinent at baseline and is associated with an increased risk of developing urinary incontinence in those who are continent at baseline. Evidence Summary In a 2009 Cochrane review of 33 trials including 19, 313 women with urinary incontinence, women receiving oral estrogen had worse urinary incontinence than those receiving placebo. Those receiving both oral estrogen and progesterone also had worse incontinence than those receiving placebo. However, 1, 262 women who received topical estrogen experienced improved urinary incontinence. No serious adverse effects were reported, although some women experienced vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness, or nausea. Participants were randomized to receive placebo or treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogen alone or with a combination of conjugated equine estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate. Urinary incontinence was assessed at baseline and at one year. Hormone therapy increased the incidence of all types of urinary incontinence in women who were continent at baseline. The risk was greatest for stress incontinence and least for urge incontinence. 3 During 4. 2 years of treatment, 64 percent of women randomly assigned to receive oral conjugated equine estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate reported weekly urinary incontinence, compared with 49 percent of those assigned to placebo.

The odds ratios for women receiving hormone therapy compared with placebo were 1. 5 for urge incontinence and
1. 7 for stress incontinence.

### Effects of estrogen with and without progestin on urinary incontinence… [^112Rvf14]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Women were randomized based on hysterectomy status to active treatment or placebo in either the estrogen plus progestin or estrogen alone trials. The E + P hormones were 0. 625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen plus
2. 5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate; estrogen alone consisted. at 1 year. Conclusions Conjugated equine estrogen alone and CEE + MPA increased the risk of UI among continent women and worsened the characteristics of UI among symptomatic women after 1 year. Conjugated equine estrogen with or without progestin should not be prescribed for the prevention or relief of UI. treatment of UI concluded that treatment consisting of estrogen alone is associated with perceived improvement or cure compared with placebo, but that larger trials were needed. 6 It identified 3 clinical trials comparing treatments of estrogen plus progestin with placebo, including the larger Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study.

7 The review of these studies only suggested that estrogen. Women randomized in the WHI hormone trials were asked to take a single daily tablet containing a placebo or active medication of 153 receiving CEE + MPA reported incident UI at 3 years compared with 26. acetate increased new onset UI among continent women and worsened the characteristics of UI among already incontinent women. This effect persisted through 3 years. Although these findings are based on 1 specific type, route of administration, and dosage of estrogen, they.

are consistent with findings from an observational study that reported use of several different formulations of E + P and estrogen alone and suggested an increased risk of UI associated with MHT. 16 To our knowledge, this is the first randomized trial to demonstrate that estrogen alone increased UI. The baseline prevalence of UI in the WHI participants is consistent.

### Oral contraceptive use and hormone replacement therapy are associated with microalbuminuria… [^112G17fG]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

We performed a case-control study of the baseline data and historical pharmacy data of 4301 female subjects of the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End Stage Disease study cohort, aged 28 to 75 years, excluding women who were pregnant or had type 1 diabetes mellitus. The main outcome measure was microalbuminuria, defined as a urinary albumin excretion of 30 to 300 mg per 24 hours. To that end, we studied the association of oral contraceptive use and hormone replacement therapy with microalbuminuria in the female subjects of the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End Stage Disease population, an ongoing study on the effect of microalbuminuria in the general population. We used the data of the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End Stage Disease cohort, consisting of 8592 subjects, aged 28 to 75 years, from Groningen, the Netherlands. This group was investigated for the presence of increased urinary albumin excretion.

20 From this study cohort, only women were included. In the postmenopausal group, users of hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptives showed an increased OR for having microalbuminuria. Findings were similar in users of hormone replacement therapy with and without addition of progestins. Women using hormone replacement therapy for more than 5 years had a higher risk of having microalbuminuria compared with those using this therapy for 5 years or less. Our findings regarding the association between oral contraceptive use and microalbuminuria are in agreement with those of Ribstein et al, 22 who found that a group of 57 oral contraceptive users had a higher prevalence of microalbuminuria compared with a group of 57 matched nonusers. They also showed this difference to be independent of blood pressure readings. This is in agreement with the data of Ribstein et al.

22 It has recently been shown that, as in persons with diabetes, glomerular filtration rate is elevated in subjects without diabetes with microalbuminuria, but more so in subjects with high-normal urinary albumin excretion. 20 However, in our study, adjustment for creatinine clearance did not change the observed association between oral contraceptive use or hormone replacement therapy and microalbuminuria, making this a less likely explanation.
