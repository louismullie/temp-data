## Question

In a patient with cirrhosis who has both hepatitis B and hepatitis C, which infection should be treated first?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which infection to treat first in a cirrhotic patient co-infected with HBV and HCV. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about staging the liver disease and confirming baseline virology for both HBV and HCV. Then, I should verify the core principle that HCV DAAs can precipitate HBV reactivation and what that means for concurrent management. Next, I will decide between HBV prophylaxis versus close HBV DNA monitoring during DAA therapy and define thresholds that trigger treatment. After that, I need to select an HCV regimen tailored to compensated versus decompensated cirrhosis, carefully checking for protease inhibitor contraindications. Finally, I will map out on-treatment safety checks, post-treatment virologic follow-up, and ongoing cirrhosis care including HCC surveillance and HDV testing, integrating guideline-backed nuances along the way.

> Let me first confirm the disease stage and baseline virology because treatment choices hinge on compensated (Child-Pugh A) versus decompensated (Child-Pugh B/C) cirrhosis, and on active replication status for both viruses. I should verify Child-Pugh and MELD, review labs, and if noninvasive staging is used, remember that transient elastography thresholds around 12.5 kPa support a diagnosis of cirrhosis, though clinical features also matter [^116NEtc1]. I need to check HBV markers including HBsAg, HBV DNA, HBeAg, and transaminases, and for HCV I should confirm active viremia with HCV RNA; genotyping is often unnecessary with pangenotypic regimens, and can be omitted unless it will directly inform regimen selection, such as contemplating glecaprevir/pibrentasvir where genotype 3 and cirrhosis can affect decisions [^114CgTb9]. Hold on, I should verify HBV serologies before DAAs in all patients to avoid missing occult or overt HBV coinfection that could reactivate on DAA therapy [^111HRdAV].

> Now, I need to center the core clinical principle. HCV DAA therapy can trigger clinically significant HBV reactivation in HBsAg-positive patients, including severe flares in those with cirrhosis, so this is not a true "HBV or HCV first" question but rather a concurrent approach: treat HCV while suppressing HBV or monitoring closely to preempt reactivation [^111u8Vn2]. Wait, let me verify the guidance on this point; both AASLD/IDSA and EASL emphasize either pre-emptive nucleos(t)ide analog prophylaxis or intensive HBV DNA monitoring during and after DAA therapy in HBsAg-positive patients, with special caution in cirrhosis due to limited hepatic reserve [^111u8Vn2] [^111APYbu]. Mechanistically, clearing HCV can alter immune control and unmask HBV replication, reinforcing the need for a planned HBV strategy during DAAs [^114qy6BC].

> Next, I should define the HBV management strategy. Option A is prophylactic HBV antiviral therapy — typically with high-barrier agents such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, tenofovir alafenamide, or entecavir — started before or at DAA initiation and continued through DAA treatment and for 12 weeks after completion to prevent reactivation, which I should particularly favor in cirrhotic patients given the catastrophic potential of flares [^111u8Vn2] [^111APYbu]. Option B is close HBV DNA monitoring when baseline HBV activity is minimal and reliable follow-up is guaranteed; I should monitor monthly during DAAs and immediately post-treatment, initiating HBV therapy if HBV DNA increases more than 10-fold above baseline or exceeds 1,000 IU/mL if previously undetectable or unquantifiable [^111u8Vn2]. Hold on, I should verify the duration of prophylaxis; yes, stopping 12 weeks after DAAs is recommended, but if the patient meets independent criteria for long-term HBV therapy, treatment should continue beyond that window [^111u8Vn2].

> I will now examine initiation of HCV therapy in parallel. In compensated cirrhosis, I can proceed with standard pangenotypic regimens such as sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 12 weeks, chosen based on prior treatment history and any genotype-specific caveats, while starting HBV prophylaxis concurrently or a day or two earlier if logistics allow [^115ubQYC]. Let me consider the evidence base; current guidance supports simplified DAA pathways with high cure rates in compensated cirrhosis, but I need to screen for drug-drug interactions and comorbid constraints prior to selection [^115ubQYC].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost generalized a protease-inhibitor regimen to all cirrhotics. Hold on, I should verify the contraindications in decompensation. Protease inhibitor–containing regimens, including glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and voxilaprevir-containing combinations, are contraindicated in decompensated cirrhosis; in Child-Pugh B/C I should use sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with ribavirin for 12 weeks, or 24 weeks without ribavirin if RBV is not tolerated, and I should refer promptly for transplant evaluation while ensuring HBV prophylaxis is in place [^111u8Vn2]. I should double-check that an expert center manages these regimens in decompensated patients due to the complexity and risk, which the guidance explicitly advises [^117Lj5bt].

> I need to ensure medication safety and interactions are addressed. Let me verify renal considerations and co-medications; with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, if a patient is on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate boosted by cobicistat or ritonavir, I should obtain renal monitoring and consider tenofovir alafenamide as needed to mitigate nephrotoxicity risk, and more broadly I must screen for clinically significant DAA interactions prior to start and during therapy [^116i2cGq] [^1111wMcU]. I should confirm no significant interactions exist with the chosen HBV nucleos(t)ide analogs, but I will still review the full medication list to avoid surprises, especially in individuals with polypharmacy [^111gTVzA].

> Next, I should review post-treatment management. If I used HBV prophylaxis, I will continue it for 12 weeks after completing DAAs, then reassess whether the patient meets criteria for ongoing HBV therapy based on HBV DNA, HBeAg status, ALT, fibrosis stage, and clinical context; if I opted for HBV monitoring rather than prophylaxis, I will continue monthly HBV DNA checks during DAAs and for 12 weeks after completion to catch delayed reactivation [^111u8Vn2]. Let me not forget HCV SVR assessment at 12 weeks after therapy and, regardless of SVR, ongoing cirrhosis care including semiannual HCC surveillance and management of portal hypertension per guidelines; I should also screen for and, if indicated, diagnose HDV coinfection in all HBsAg-positive patients to optimize comprehensive viral hepatitis care [^112GzEK8] [^113HTsMo]. I need to check immunization status and standard cirrhosis preventive care; pneumococcal vaccination is advised in cirrhosis and should be updated alongside hepatitis A where appropriate to reduce preventable complications [^111FRTNc].

> But wait, what if the baseline HBV DNA already meets standard HBV treatment criteria independent of DAAs. In that scenario, I should initiate full HBV therapy on its own merits and continue it long term rather than stopping at 12 weeks post-DAA, while still proceeding with HCV treatment concurrently, because the risk profile favors dual action rather than sequencing that could allow progression or reactivation of either virus [^111u8Vn2]. Hold on, I should verify that this still aligns with EASL prophylaxis language; yes, EASL supports concomitant nucleos(t)ide analog therapy during DAAs in HBsAg-positive patients and emphasizes ongoing HBV management per standard indications thereafter [^111APYbu].

> Finalizing the plan, I should clearly communicate that sequential monotherapy is not appropriate here. The standard of care is concurrent management: initiate curative HCV DAA therapy promptly while instituting HBV suppression either as prophylaxis for the DAA interval plus 12 weeks or as definitive long-term therapy if HBV treatment indications are met, with intensified vigilance in decompensated cirrhosis where protease inhibitors are avoided and transplant referral is urgent [^111u8Vn2] [^117Lj5bt]. This approach minimizes the risk of HBV reactivation, maximizes the likelihood of HCV cure, and protects limited hepatic reserve in cirrhosis, provided that I maintain strict on-treatment monitoring and post-therapy follow-up as outlined above [^111u8Vn2] [^111gTVzA].

Treat **HCV first** in HBV/HCV co-infected cirrhosis because DAAs can cure HCV [^115ubQYC] and improve liver function [^111gTVzA], but **start HBV therapy if HBV DNA is ≥ 2,000 IU/mL or ALT is elevated**. If HBV DNA is low/undetectable, **give prophylactic HBV therapy during HCV treatment** [^111APYbu] and continue for 12 weeks after DAAs [^111u8Vn2], or **monitor HBV DNA monthly** [^111u8Vn2] and start HBV therapy if HBV DNA rises > 10-fold or > 1,000 IU/mL. This approach prevents HBV reactivation [^111u8Vn2] while achieving HCV cure and improving cirrhosis outcomes [^115ubQYC].

---

## Clinical rationale for treating hepatitis C first

- **High efficacy of DAAs**: DAAs achieve > 95% SVR, rapidly suppressing HCV and improving liver function, including in cirrhosis [^115ubQYC] [^111gTVzA].

- **Improvement in liver function**: HCV cure can improve MELD and reduce decompensation risk, aiding transplant candidacy [^115ubQYC].

- **Reduction in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk**: HCV cure lowers HCC risk, though surveillance must continue in cirrhosis [^115ubQYC] [^1179pPDz].

- **Shorter treatment duration**: DAAs are typically 8–12 weeks, enabling rapid viral clearance and clinical benefit [^111gTVzA].

---

## Risk of hepatitis B reactivation during hepatitis C treatment

During HCV treatment, **HBV reactivation** can occur because HCV clearance may unmask HBV [^111u8Vn2]. Without HBV prophylaxis, reactivation occurs in 10–30% of HBsAg-positive patients and can lead to severe hepatitis, hepatic failure, or death, especially in cirrhosis [^111APYbu] [^114qy6BC].

---

## Recommended management strategy

For patients with cirrhosis and HBV/HCV co-infection, the **recommended management strategy** is as follows:

| **Step** | **Action** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Assess HBV DNA levels and ALT | Determine HBV activity and need for therapy [^111caa1z] [^111HRdAV] |
| 2 | If HBV DNA ≥ 2,000 IU/mL or ALT elevated, initiate HBV therapy (tenofovir or entecavir) | Suppress HBV and prevent reactivation [^116HkTc6] |
| 3 | If HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/mL and ALT normal, initiate HCV therapy with DAAs | Achieve HCV cure and improve liver function [^111gTVzA] [^115ubQYC] |
| 4 | Provide HBV prophylaxis during HCV treatment and continue for 12 weeks after DAAs | Prevent HBV reactivation [^111u8Vn2] [^111APYbu] |
| 5 | Monitor HBV DNA monthly during and after HCV treatment | Detect and treat HBV reactivation promptly [^111u8Vn2] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks associated with different treatment sequences

- **Treating HCV first**: Improves liver function and reduces HCC risk, but requires HBV prophylaxis to prevent reactivation [^115ubQYC] [^111u8Vn2].

- **Treating HBV first**: Suppresses HBV but does not address HCV-related liver injury; HCV should be treated promptly after HBV control [^111caa1z] [^111gTVzA].

- **Simultaneous treatment**: Not recommended due to limited data and potential drug interactions.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Both **AASLD/IDSA** [^111gTVzA] and **EASL** recommend **treating HCV first** with DAAs [^111u8Vn2], initiating HBV therapy when indicated [^111caa1z], and providing HBV prophylaxis during HCV treatment; EASL explicitly recognizes the risk of HBV reactivation and advises prophylaxis accordingly [^111APYbu].

---

## Special considerations in cirrhotic patients

In cirrhosis, **decompensated cirrhosis** warrants referral to transplant centers [^117Lj5bt] and avoidance of interferon-based therapies, whereas in **compensated cirrhosis**, DAAs are safe and effective, with close monitoring for HBV reactivation [^111gTVzA] [^111u8Vn2].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Treat HCV first**: Use DAAs to achieve SVR and improve liver function [^111u8Vn2].

- **Initiate HBV therapy if indicated**: Start HBV therapy if HBV DNA ≥ 2,000 IU/mL or ALT elevated.

- **Provide HBV prophylaxis**: Give HBV prophylaxis during HCV treatment and continue for 12 weeks after DAAs [^111u8Vn2] [^111APYbu].

- **Monitor HBV DNA**: Check HBV DNA monthly during and after HCV treatment to detect reactivation [^111u8Vn2].

---

Treat HCV first in HBV/HCV co-infected cirrhosis, with **HBV prophylaxis** and **close monitoring** to prevent reactivation and optimize liver outcomes [^111u8Vn2].

### Implementing evidenced-based practice guidelines for the management of chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^111jt352]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

In the past two years, evidenced-based guidelines and statements on screening, diagnosis, and management of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from several organizations and experts have been published. The purpose of this article is to take the recommendations from these documents and help guide clinicians — whether they are primary care providers, hepatologists, gastroenterologists, or public health workers — about how to incorporate these guidelines into practice.

The first task is for all providers to be involved in identifying persons with chronic HBV infection (CHB). New recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advocate screening for the HBV in those at highest risk, especially persons from countries where HBV is endemic. Using information from the clinical and laboratory evaluation of the patient infected with HBV, especially the hepatitis B e antigen/antibody status, clinicians can classify the patient into one of the four phases of HBV infection.

Because CHB is a dynamic process and patients can move from inactive to active infection status, and vice versa, all patients must be followed with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase monitoring every 3 to 12 months for life. Those with elevated ALT and HBV DNA levels (> 2,000 IU/mL) should be referred to a specialist for evaluation for possible treatment. Patients selected for antiviral therapy with nucleoside analogues should be followed every 3 to 6 months to detect the emergence of antiviral resistance to the agent chosen. In addition, alpha-fetoprotein should be tested and ultrasound.

### Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and mortality among HIV-positive individuals [^116AuEQ2]. AIDS (2017). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for the treatment of HIV infection, rates of AIDS-related morbidity and mortality have fallen. HIV-positive individuals who are diagnosed promptly and have good access to cART are now expected to live a near-normal lifespan. When HIV-positive individuals do die, they are less likely to die from AIDS-related causes than in the pre or early cART era. However, the proportion of people who die from liver-related causes has increased, with these deaths largely being related to coinfection with either hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV).

HIV-positive individuals coinfected with HBV and/or HCV have higher rates of progression to chronic hepatitis infection and faster progression to fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease than individuals with hepatitis infection alone. Meta-analyses investigating the impact of HBV and/or HCV coinfection on mortality among HIV-positive individuals have shown that, overall, coinfection is associated with increased mortality compared with HIV alone. However, findings from individual studies are inconsistent, possibly because of variations in underlying mortality rates in the cohorts studied as well as differences in treatment and management strategies for both HIV and hepatitis.

In a number of studies, the association between HIV/HCV coinfection and increased mortality is lost after adjusting for HIV infection-related parameters, such as use of cART and CD4+ cell count. This could suggest that the observed increase in mortality…

### Adherence to chronic hepatitis B treatment guideline recommendations for laboratory monitoring of patients who are not receiving antiviral treatment [^114VBaxu]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

An estimated 400 million people are believed to be chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) worldwide. Within the United States, over 1 million residents have chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection, with a prevalence estimated between 0.3% and 0.5%. Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, the number of US residents with CHB infection remains high, primarily due to the slow progression of CHB and the influx of immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of chronic infection.

Approximately 15% to 40% of untreated CHB patients will develop serious hepatic sequelae during their lifetime, including cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CHB is currently estimated to contribute to between 2,000 and 4,000 deaths annually in the US. As a major cause of cirrhosis and HCC, CHB represents a substantial public health burden, not only in terms of human suffering but also in terms of social and economic costs, with over $1 billion spent each year on hepatitis B-related hospitalizations in the US.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute hepatitis C virus infection [^1124bvYq]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The first six months after exposure to hepatitis C virus (HCV) are regarded as acute hepatitis C (AHC). Two patient populations worldwide share the highest prevalence of AHC virus infection: injection drug users and HIV-positive men who have sex with men. Diagnosis of AHC is often difficult in both patient populations, as the acute inflammatory phase can be clinically asymptomatic, and patients at highest risk for acquiring AHC (injection drug users) tend to evade regular medical care. This article addresses similarities and differences in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of AHC monoinfection and coinfection.

### When do co-infections matter [^116ZEHRF]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Viral hepatitis is associated with increased morbidity in people living with HIV (PLHIV). End-stage liver disease is most common in patients with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV co-infection; it is less prevalent in dual infections and much less common in HIV monoinfection. Viral hepatitis is also linked with extrahepatic complications in PLHIV, such as an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, kidney disease, osteoporosis and fractures, as well as more severe cognitive impairment. Hepatitis virus co-infection slows immunological recovery in pregnant women and children with HIV, while HCV contributes to ongoing immune activation and dysfunction even in controlled HIV infection.

Direct-acting antivirals now allow cure rates of more than 95% for HCV, regardless of HIV co-infection. Eradication of HCV reduces mortality, HIV progression, liver-related events, and diabetes mellitus. Well-tolerated and effective regimes for PLHIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are now achievable.

### New paradigms in the management of hepatitis C virus co-infections [^113rYuvA]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Liver disease has emerged as a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV infection. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a key element in the etiology of liver-associated injury in this population. Increased rates of fibrotic progression have been described and are mediated by alcohol use, the severity of immunosuppression, the use of antiretroviral therapy, and other factors. Large clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin and highlighted issues related to the management of patients with HIV/HCV co-infection. Although treatment for HCV infection in this group remains a challenge, achievement of a sustained virologic response is feasible in approximately 35% of patients. Treatment must be individualized, and attention must be paid to the potential for drug-drug interactions.

### Hepatitis B virus-related care quality in patients with hepatitis B/human immunodeficiency virus coinfection versus hepatitis B monoinfection: A national cohort study [^115vd6Ke]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Guideline-adherent hepatitis B virus (HBV) care is critical for patients with HBV, particularly those with HBV-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, given the increased risks of liver-related complications. However, a comprehensive assessment of HBV-related care in patients with HBV-HIV is lacking.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively assessed adherence to HBV-related care guidelines in all patients with HBV-HIV and HBV monoinfection (HBV-M) within the national Veterans Health Administration healthcare system in 2019.

- **Results**: We identified 1021 patients with HBV-HIV among 8323 veterans with chronic HBV. Adherence to HBV guidelines was similar or better in patients with HBV-HIV compared to those with HBV-M. This was evident in several areas: HBV treatment (97% vs. 71%), biannual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance for patients with cirrhosis (55% vs. 55%), hepatitis A virus screening (69% vs. 56%), hepatitis C virus screening (100% vs. 99%), and on-therapy alanine aminotransferase monitoring (95% vs. 96%). Compared with patients seeing gastroenterology (GI) or infectious diseases (ID) providers, those without specialty care were less likely to receive antiviral treatment (none, 39%; GI, 80%; ID, 84%) or HCC surveillance (none, 16%; GI, 66%; ID, 47%). These findings persisted in multivariable analysis. Compared with ID care alone, a higher proportion of patients with HBV-HIV seen by both GI and ID received HCC surveillance (GI+ID 73% vs. ID 31%) and on-therapy HBV-DNA monitoring (GI+ID, 82%; ID, 68%).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with HBV-HIV received similar or higher rates of guideline-adherent HBV-related care compared to patients with HBV monoinfection.

### Optimizing management strategies in special patient populations [^11298KRq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B infection presents numerous challenges to clinicians. There are additional considerations when defining management strategies for individuals with advanced liver disease, coinfection, or those at high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Treatment of decompensated cirrhosis is particularly important. Evidence suggests that suppression of viral replication through nucleos(t)ide analog therapy leads to longer time to transplantation, improved liver function, and better survival times. The use of interferon in patients with decompensated hepatitis B is associated with serious complications and is currently contraindicated for these patients by the AASLD Practice Guidelines.

Hepatitis B coinfection is often associated with more extensive disease. In patients with HBV/HCV coinfection, one disease is usually dominant and should be the focus of therapy. HIV/HBV coinfection increases the risk of progressive liver disease. Therapeutic agents active against both viruses should be utilized at the correct dose to limit the development of resistance. Agents specific for HBV, such as entecavir, enable hepatitis to be treated while avoiding the risk of HIV resistance developing.

Dual infection with HBV and HDV is particularly challenging. Nucleos(t)ide analogs are ineffective in treating HDV infection, and there is limited data concerning the efficacy of interferon in this setting. The association between chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is well established. In patients at high risk of HCC, screening regi

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^116i2cGq]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

The AASLD/IDSA 2020 guidelines specifically address circumstances for hepatitis C virus infection in patients with HIV co-infection. They recommend avoiding the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in patients with an eGFR < 60 mL/min.

### Update on chronic hepatitis C [^112EFuer]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

The burden of chronic hepatitis C infection remains significant in the United States and worldwide. Increased knowledge regarding the natural history of acute and chronic infection, as well as the key factors responsible for disease progression, risk for cirrhosis, and risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, are critical in guiding secondary and tertiary prevention measures. The past decade has seen substantial improvement in antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus, with an increasing number of individuals achieving viral eradication. Decisions regarding whom, when, and how to use antiviral therapy have become more complex and change as new studies become available. This review focuses on the status of hepatitis C virus patient management and future treatment directions.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, care and treatment for people with chronic hepatitis B infection [^116LWd7C]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to patients with HDV co-infection, the WHO 2024 guidelines recommend giving priority to testing for HDV in certain populations of HBsAg-positive individuals. This recommendation applies in settings where a universal anti-HDV antibody testing approach is not feasible due to limited laboratory capacity or other resources:

- **Individuals born in HDV-endemic countries, regions, and areas**: These populations should be prioritized for testing due to the higher prevalence of infection in those areas.

- **Patients with advanced liver disease, receiving HBV treatment, or with features suggesting HDV infection**: Features that may suggest HDV infection include low HBV DNA levels combined with high ALT levels.

- **Patients at increased risk of HDV infection**: This includes hemodialysis recipients, patients with hepatitis C or HIV, people who inject drugs, sex workers, and men who have sex with men (MSM).

### Advances in the management of hepatitis B [^111hVLeQ]. BMJ (2025). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B virus infection remains a pervasive global health challenge, affecting an estimated 254 million people worldwide. This review summarizes the landscape of hepatitis B, including its epidemiology and the clinical spectrum of acute and chronic infection. It discusses the interplay between host and virus that underlies the progression from acute hepatitis to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

The review further examines screening practices, diagnostic methods, and staging tools, as well as providing an in-depth evaluation of antiviral treatment strategies guided by randomized clinical trials and international consensus. Particular emphasis is placed on emerging therapeutic approaches. Drawing on high-quality evidence from large-scale epidemiological studies, rigorous clinical trials, and evolving global guidelines, this review not only encapsulates the state of the art in the management of hepatitis B but also highlights critical gaps and future directions.

This synthesis is intended to inform clinicians and researchers alike, offering insights that may enhance patient care and guide future research toward the ultimate goal of elimination of hepatitis B.

### Hepatitis B virus treatment beyond the guidelines: Special populations and consideration of treatment withdrawal [^116vwim7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

The goal of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatment is to improve survival by preventing disease progression to decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, which is the cause of over 1 million deaths annually. The risk of disease progression is reduced when a sustained reduction of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA to undetectable levels and suppression of HBV replication are obtained. This can result in the regression of liver fibrosis and may even reverse cirrhosis. However, even if HBsAg loss occurs, HBV is not completely eradicated by treatment, and long-term therapy is required in patients who are HBeAg(-) and HBeAg(+) who do not maintain off-treatment virological suppression and in those with advanced liver disease.

The recently updated European Association of the Study of the Liver (EASL) clinical practical guidelines for HBV have clarified:

- **How to treat HBV**: Interferon or the most potent oral drugs with optimal resistance profiles, such as entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, should be used as first-line monotherapies.

- **Who should be treated**: CHB in patients with significant liver disease, patients who are HBsAg(+) and are receiving immunosuppressive treatment, patients coinfected with HBV and human immunodeficiency virus, and mothers who are HBsAg(+) with a high viral load in late pregnancy associated with serovaccination to reduce the risk of vertical transmission of HBV.

- **When to stop antiviral therapies**.

The aim of this review was to clarify how to treat HBV, who should be treated, and when to stop treatment.

### Longitudinal evaluation of viral interactions in treated HIV-hepatitis B co-infected patients with additional hepatitis C and D virus [^111Xczof]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2010). Low credibility.

Virological interactions of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), and hepatitis D (HDV) viruses in HIV-infected patients have been poorly characterized, especially under treatment influences. Undetection rates of hepatitis viruses were longitudinally analyzed in a 3-year cohort of 308 HIV-HBV co-infected patients and compared using Generalized Estimating Equation models adjusted for age, HIV-RNA, CD4 cell-count, and antiviral treatment.

Chronic hepatitis co-infection in HIV-infected patients (age in years, standard deviation) was: 265 HBV (mean age 40.7, SD 8.2); 19 HBV-HCV (mean age 39.7, SD 4.1); 12 HBV-HDV (mean age 35.2, SD 9.9); and 12 HBV-HCV-HDV (mean age 39.2, SD 5.2). At inclusion, treatment with lamivudine/tenofovir was not significantly different between co-infection groups.

- **HBV suppression**: HBV suppression was significantly associated with HDV (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 3.85, 95% CI 1.13–13.10, P = 0.03) and HCV tri-infection (aOR = 2.65, 95% CI 1.03–6.81, P = 0.04), but marginally associated with HIV-HBV-HCV-HDV (aOR = 2.32, 95% CI 0.94–5.74, P = 0.07). In quad-infection, lower HDV-undetectability (vs HIV-HBV-HDV, P = 0.2) and higher HCV-undetectability (vs HIV-HBV-HCV, P = 0.1) were demonstrated. The degree of HBV suppression varied between visits and co-infection groups [range of aOR during follow-up (vs HIV-HBV co-infection): HIV-HBV-HCV = 2.23–5.67, HIV-HBV-HDV = 1.53–15.17].

In treated co-infected patients, HDV expressed continuous suppression over HCV- and HBV-replications. Peaks and rebounds from undetectable hepatitis B, C, and/or D viremia warrant closer follow-up in this patient population. HDV replication was uncontrolled even with antiviral treatment.

### HIV and viral hepatitis coinfections: Advances and challenges [^113fK5GQ]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

With a prevalence affecting over 30% of HIV-infected patients, coinfection with hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) virus remains one of the most frequent comorbidities in this population, significantly impacting morbidity and mortality associated with liver disease. Recent findings in the physiopathology of HIV in the liver have confirmed that it may contribute, along with the hepatotoxicity of antiretrovirals and the burden of metabolic diseases, to a more rapid progression of liver fibrosis, especially when there is underlying chronic hepatitis coinfection.

Both fields of research and clinical appraisal of HBV and HCV coinfection are rapidly evolving, prompting a change in the former paradigms of clinical care and management of chronic hepatic coinfection in the context of HIV. The advent of anti-HCV direct antiviral agents has indeed completely shaken up the treatment guidelines for HCV, and the tricky management of these new agents with antiretrovirals means referring patients to specialized centers. In HBV coinfection, therapeutic options have not changed recently, but new challenges have emerged regarding the management of low replicating HBV-DNA in optimally treated patients and long-term exposure to antivirals.

Finally, the global increase in life expectancy in HIV-infected patients has been accompanied in coinfected patients by a higher risk of emergence of end-stage liver diseases. Access to orthotopic liver transplantation and innovative procedures, such as targeted hepatocellular carcinoma therapies, should be facilitated.

### The impact of HIV therapy on co-infection with hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses [^113WFxAf]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Improving survival for people with HIV has brought the management of co-morbidities into focus. In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy, co-infection with either hepatitis B virus and/or hepatitis C virus, along with HIV therapies themselves, has increased liver disease-related morbidity and mortality. The dual anti-HIV and anti-hepatitis B activity of several established and emerging therapeutic agents provides the opportunity to both restore immune function and prevent liver disease progression in people with HIV-hepatitis B virus co-infection. Improving hepatitis C antiviral therapy also fosters optimism around the management of liver disease in people with HIV-hepatitis C virus co-infection.

However, the formulation of appropriate therapeutic strategies for HIV-hepatitis B and HIV-hepatitis C co-infection requires further research, including clinical trials of combination antiviral therapy with specific anti-hepatitis B and anti-hepatitis C activity. A possible role may also exist for combined antiviral and immune-based therapies.

### Epidemiology of viral hepatitis and HIV co-infection [^111dwTgs]. Journal of Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Worldwide, hepatitis B virus (HBV) accounts for an estimated 370 million chronic infections, hepatitis C virus (HCV) for an estimated 130 million, and HIV for an estimated 40 million. Among HIV-infected persons, an estimated 2–4 million have chronic HBV co-infection and 4–5 million have HCV co-infection. HBV, HCV, and HIV share common routes of transmission, but they differ in their prevalence by geographic region and the efficiency by which certain types of exposures transmit them.

In studies conducted on HIV-positive individuals from Western Europe and the United States, chronic HBV infection has been found in 6–14% overall, including 4–6% of heterosexuals, 9–17% of men who have sex with men (MSM), and 7–10% of injection drug users. HCV infection has been identified in 25–30% of HIV-positive persons overall, with prevalence rates of 72–95% among injection drug users, 1–12% among MSM, and 9–27% among heterosexuals.

The characteristics of HIV-infected persons differ according to the co-infecting hepatitis virus. Their epidemiologic patterns may change over time, and surveillance systems are needed to monitor these infection patterns to ensure that prevention measures are targeted appropriately.

### Treatment considerations in patients with hepatitis C and cirrhosis [^111KNmJv]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C have a high chance of dying from progressive liver disease and thus have much to gain from successful antiviral therapy. The highest sustained virologic responses in patients with cirrhosis have been achieved using pegylated interferon alfa plus Ribavirin; more than 43% remain with undetectable virus six months after the cessation of 48 weeks of treatment. For those who achieve a sustained virologic response, the degree of fibrosis is reduced as judged by post-treatment liver biopsy, and cirrhosis may even regress. In individuals with cirrhosis who achieve a sustained virologic response, the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma is significantly reduced, and it is likely that their chance of developing liver failure is less.

Patients who do not achieve a sustained virologic response can still show histologic improvement, as demonstrated on liver biopsy post-therapy compared to baseline. Patients with compensated cirrhosis can benefit from therapy, while those who are decompensated are prone to more safety issues. Thus, individuals with any evidence of hepatic decompensation should generally not be given interferon-based antiviral therapy, but treatment should be encouraged for those whose status is Child Class A.

### Advances in hepatitis B and C [^112UtXPc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B and C infections are prevalent around the world and represent a major health burden due to associated complications such as hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, which occur in the context of chronic infection. Significant advances are being made in assessing and treating infected patients. Recent studies are now targeting patients who have failed to respond to previous treatments or who have associated co-morbidities. The purpose of this article is to review the recent literature on hepatitis B and C infections, with a particular focus on new treatment options, new approaches in patients who have previously failed therapy, and in those who have co-morbidity.

- **Recent findings**: A large number of studies have been conducted investigating the roles of varying doses, targeting treatment in particular groups, and new treatment options for patients with hepatitis B and C. Several key findings include the value of prolonging treatment in patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C infection, the use of pegylated interferon in chronic hepatitis B infection, and the emergence of new treatments such as adefovir for resistant hepatitis B infection. Additionally, treatment of patients co-infected with hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus has been a significant focus in recent literature. Patients in specific groups, such as those who have undergone liver transplantation or are immunosuppressed, have also received additional attention.

Hepatitis B and C infections continue to receive considerable attention, particularly concerning new and emerging treatments.

### Expert opinion on the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C [^115TiEiH]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

In general, patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 or 3 should not be routinely treated for less than the currently recommended 24 weeks to avoid an increased risk of virologic relapse. However, patients with a low pre-treatment viral load (≤ 400,000 IU/mL) and an RVR (as determined by a highly sensitive assay) have the highest probability of achieving an SVR with 16 weeks of therapy. Such a regimen may be a reasonable option for these patients, especially if tolerability of longer treatment may be a concern. The cut-off for low viral load in patients with genotypes 2 and 3 based on the ACCELERATE data is ≤ 400,000 IU/mL. As with genotype 1, baseline viral load should be determined in two samples, taken at least 4 weeks apart.

- **Overview of the ACCELERATE data**: 16 vs. 24 weeks. SVR: sustained viral response.

Shortening of treatment duration should not be considered for patients with cirrhosis, persistently normal ALT values, or co-infection with HBV, or immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV infection or those who have undergone liver transplantation.

There may be patient subgroups with genotype 2 or 3 infection that might benefit from extended treatment duration to reduce relapse rates. Results from the trial by Hadziyannis et al. found evidence for reduced relapse rates in genotype 2 and 3 patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis as well as high baseline viral load when treated for 48 weeks in comparison with 24 weeks.

### Human immunodeficiency virus and coinfection with hepatitis B and C [^114mbaby]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

In HIV-infected individuals, coinfection with HBV and/or HCV is common because of shared modes of transmission. It is known that HIV accelerates the progression of liver disease, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality associated with viral hepatitis. However, it is less clear if viral hepatitis has a direct effect on HIV. Treatment of viral hepatitis improves outcomes and should be considered in all HIV-infected patients. Treatment of HBV without concurrent treatment of HIV is risky because resistance can occur in both viruses if regimens are not carefully chosen.

AST and ALT abnormalities appeared more frequently in hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infected subjects across both treatment groups. In the INTELENCE-treated co-infected subjects, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities, indicating a worsening from baseline, occurred in 27.8% for AST, 25.0% for ALT, and 7.1% for total bilirubin. This compares to 6.7%, 7.5%, and 1.8% respectively, in non-co-infected INTELENCE-treated subjects.

In general, adverse events reported by INTELENCE-treated subjects with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection were similar to those reported by subjects without such co-infections.

### Therapeutic approach to the treatment-naive patient with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection: A step-by-step approach [^117HUqsC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Recent advances in the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) have led to high rates of viral cure. However, the use of newly approved protease inhibitors with activity against HCV still requires careful patient selection, counseling, and decision-making before initiation of treatment. Laboratory work-up, staging of liver disease, and careful review of comorbid conditions are mandatory. Patients with cirrhosis may require treatment regimens that differ from those without cirrhosis. Because pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin remain a key part of the treatment regimen, absolute and relative contraindications to their use must be considered. Management of common adverse events, including anemia and rash, must be embraced by the healthcare provider.

The updated EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines on the management of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection provide comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for its management. Spanning ten thematic sections, the guidelines address diagnostics, treatment goals, treatment indications, therapeutic options, hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance, management of special populations, HBV reactivation prophylaxis, post-transplant care, HBV prevention strategies, and open questions and future research directions. Chronic HBV remains a global health challenge, with over 250 million individuals affected and significant mortality due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. These guidelines emphasize the importance of early diagnosis, risk stratification based on viral and host factors, and tailored antiviral therapy. Attention is given to simplified algorithms, vaccination, and screening to support global HBV elimination targets. The guidelines also discuss emerging biomarkers and evolving definitions of functional and partial cure. Developed through literature review, expert consensus, and a Delphi process, the guidelines aim to equip healthcare providers across disciplines with practical tools to optimize HBV care and outcomes worldwide.

### The 2024 updated WHO guidelines for the prevention and management of chronic hepatitis B: Main changes and potential implications for the next major liver society clinical practice guidelines [^116h7Fuf]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Progress towards the global elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been slow, and most countries are far from reaching the elimination targets set out by the World Health Organization (WHO). The burden of chronic hepatitis B is mainly borne by resource-limited countries, where only a minority of people living with HBV are diagnosed and treated, and international guidelines are hardly applicable in real life. In March 2024, the WHO released its revised guidelines for the prevention and management of chronic hepatitis B. Simplification of care and expansion of treatment criteria represent the core of this revision. Whether and how these updated WHO guidelines will influence the next hepatitis B recommendations from the international liver societies (EASL, AASLD, and APASL) remain uncertain. However, the European, American, and Asian regions encompass multiple low, middle, and intermediate-income countries with high HBV endemicity and vulnerable populations that should benefit from simplified clinical algorithms. Here, from an analysis of the WHO guideline development process and its new recommendations, we aimed to identify the anticipated areas of agreement and controversies with the next liver society hepatitis B guidelines, which will have to balance clinical risks and benefits for patients.

### Long-term outcome of hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus co-infection and single HBV infection acquired in youth [^112hokSP]. Journal of Medical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

Co-infection with HBV and HCV is associated with more severe liver disease in retrospective and cross-sectional studies in adults, but no data have been available when co-infection is acquired in youth. The long-term outcome of infection acquired in youth was assessed in patients co-infected with HBV and HCV and in patients with HBV infection only. Twenty-seven patients with HBV and HCV co-infection and 27 patients infected with HBV only were enrolled. Seventy-six percent of the patients were treated with alpha-interferon for 1 year.

After a median follow-up of 23 years, the annual progression rate of fibrosis was 0.07 in patients co-infected with HBV and HCV. For patients infected with HBV, the progression rates were 0.07 for HBe-positive and 0.11 for anti-HBe-positive patients (P < 0.004). In co-infected patients, the development of cirrhosis was observed in 2 (7.4%) and of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 1 (3.7%); meanwhile, in those with HBV, cirrhosis appeared in one patient (3.7%).

- **Alcohol intake**: Independently associated with cirrhosis and HCC (OR = 9.5 ± 1.2; 95% CI = 6.6–13.9; P < 0.0001).
- **Alpha-interferon**: Showed no efficacy during treatment, but the treated group demonstrated higher HCV RNA clearance during post-treatment follow-up.

Co-infection with HBV and HCV and single HBV infection acquired in youth showed a low rate of progression to liver fibrosis, no liver failure, and low development of HCC during a median follow-up of 23 years (range 17–40).

### Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with hepatitis C and hepatitis B co-infection, Georgia, 2017–2023 [^113DzACL]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2025). Low credibility.

Persons co-infected with hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus (HCV-HBV) are at increased risk of developing liver disease compared with mono-infected individuals. In Georgia, all patients undergoing hepatitis C treatment are eligible for free testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). However, further hepatitis B evaluations and treatment are not free. We explored demographic and clinical characteristics associated with HCV-HBV co-infection among persons treated for HCV infection.

Persons aged ≥ 18 years with HCV infection who initiated HCV treatment during 2017–2023 were included. Patients were grouped as HCV mono-infected, HCV-HBV co-infected (HBsAg positive), and HBV exposed (total HBV core antibody positive, HBsAg negative). We present descriptive analysis and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

Of 54,994 adults treated for hepatitis C, 68.1% had HCV mono-infection, 29.3% were previously exposed to HBV, and 2.6% had HCV-HBV co-infection. Persons who were aged 18–45 years (aPR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.48–2.08), male (aPR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.11–1.71), reported ever injecting drugs (aPR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.19–1.66), had end-of-HCV treatment, alanine transaminase (ALT) levels > 80 IU/L (aPR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.40–3.29) and did not achieve hepatitis C cure after treatment (aPR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.13–2.95) were more likely to have HCV-HBV co-infection versus HCV mono-infection. Patients who did not achieve cure and had persistently higher ALT levels after hepatitis C treatment were more likely to have HCV-HBV co-infection. Expanded access to hepatitis B care is needed.

In the context of follow-up and surveillance for hepatitis C virus infection, especially regarding the management of recurrence after liver transplantation, the AASLD/IDSA 2020 guidelines recommend administering any of the following daily fixed-dose combination regimens for 12–24 weeks in patients with treatment-naïve and experienced HCV infection in the allograft with decompensated cirrhosis:

- **Ledipasvir 90 mg/sofosbuvir 400 mg**: Administer with a low initial dose of ribavirin (600 mg, increase as tolerated) in patients with genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6 HCV infection.

- **Sofosbuvir 400 mg/velpatasvir 100 mg/ribavirin**: Start ribavirin at 600 mg and increase as tolerated in patients with genotype 1–6 HCV infection.

### Hepatitis B and C virus infections in the immune compromised [^113AEckX]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

This review compares and contrasts the natural history and treatment of hepatitis B and C virus infections in three principal populations of immune-compromised individuals: (1) patients co-infected with HIV; (2) patients with liver failure secondary to hepatitis B or C virus infection who undergo liver transplantation; and (3) patients with hepatitis B or C virus infection who undergo anticancer chemotherapy.

- **Recent findings**: Chronic liver disease resulting from hepatitis B or C virus infection progresses more rapidly in patients co-infected with HIV than in HIV-negative patients. Treatment protocols for antiviral therapy are similar to those used in immunocompetent individuals. Although few long-term results are available, the efficacy of interferon and ribavirin therapy in hepatitis C virus/HIV infection and lamivudine in HIV/hepatitis B virus infection has been proven in the short term.

	- Perhaps the most important consideration is the timing of administering treatments to co-infected patients. For patients with well-preserved CD4 counts and hepatitis C virus/HIV co-infection, the hepatitis infection should be treated as early as possible to avoid drug interactions of hepatitis C virus antivirals with antiretroviral therapy. Additionally, the response to hepatitis C virus treatment appears better when administered in the context of preserved immune function. Conversely, in hepatitis B virus/HIV co-infection, hepatitis B virus antivirals are best administered with antiretroviral therapy, preventing the selection of HIV viral species.

### Treatment of hepatitis C [^111ftAq2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, with over 170 million people infected worldwide. It is also the leading indication for liver transplantation. Complications from chronic hepatitis C infection include cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Consequently, treatment strategies to prevent such complications have been widely researched, although many questions remain unanswered. At the time of writing, the standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection is the combination of peginterferon and ribavirin.

Treatment strategies differ based on factors such as genotype and liver biopsy results. Other strategies must be considered for special groups, such as patients with acute hepatitis C infection, hepatitis C/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, and those with prior nonresponse to interferon or relapse after its use. The goal of therapy is to achieve a sustained virologic response, meaning no detectable hepatitis C ribonucleic acid 6 months after completion of therapy. The substantial adverse effects associated with both interferon alfa and ribavirin often make it difficult for patients to continue with their therapies.

### Prevention of viral hepatitis in HIV co-infection [^11647asg]. Journal of Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Co-infection of HIV-positive patients with hepatitis viruses worsens the long-term prognosis, and this cumulative risk increases with each new infection in any individual. Vaccination against hepatitis A or B may be effective, but response rates are reduced in HIV-infected patients. Improvement in response can be achieved through extra doses, higher doses, and HAART-induced increase in the CD4 count. Hepatitis B and C may also be prevented through counseling about safer sex, particularly condom use. For intravenous drug users, harm reduction strategies, counseling, and the use of needle/syringe exchange schemes may be helpful.

A significant proportion of this cohort, 15 out of 40 patients (37.5%), did not receive any treatment, mainly due to the physician's decision or a contraindication (12 out of 15; 80%). Eight of these patients (53.5%) presented with acute HBV superinfection: spontaneous HCV clearance was recorded in 5 out of 8 (62.5%), while HBsAg clearance occurred in 6 out of 8 (75%). Three of them (20%) presented with acute HCV superinfection: spontaneous HCV clearance was recorded in one of them (33.5%). Four patients (26.5%) presented with dual HBV/HCV infection: two of them (50%) did not receive any treatment due to contraindication, one patient (25%) did not wish to receive treatment, and one patient (25%) was lost during the follow-up.

### Late presentation of chronic viral hepatitis for medical care: A consensus definition [^1155YtXN]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Over 13 million adults are living with hepatitis B and 15 million with hepatitis C in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region. The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (commonly defined as the persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen for six months or more) and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (as determined by the persistence of hepatitis C nucleic acid or HCV core antigen for more than six or 12 months) ranges from 0.1% to 6% across Europe, with major differences between countries and population subgroups. Chronic HBV and HCV infections may remain clinically silent for decades, with symptoms occurring at a late stage. Diagnosis, in the absence of widespread screening programs, may therefore be based on signs of late-stage liver disease such as hepatic decompensation, variceal bleeding, or hepatocellular carcinoma.

Many people with chronic HBV and/or HCV infection go undiagnosed. Of those already diagnosed, many are not necessarily linked to parts of the healthcare system that are able to provide comprehensive care (e.g. to accurately classify the extent of liver disease and provide treatment when indicated). Consequently, a large (but undetermined) proportion of the chronically infected population enters comprehensive care only after developing liver disease-related clinical symptoms.

Effective and well-tolerated treatments for both HBV and HCV infection have greatly improved our ability to treat patients successfully, especially if they are diagnosed early. In asymptomatic individuals, treatment is indicated for…

### Hepatitis C [^115ubQYC]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a hepatotropic RNA virus that can cause acute and chronic hepatitis, with progressive liver damage resulting in cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for the elimination of HCV infection as a public health threat by 2030. Despite some progress, an estimated 57 million people were living with HCV infection in 2020, and 300,000 HCV-related deaths occur per year. The development of direct-acting antiviral therapy has revolutionized clinical care and generated impetus for elimination. However, simplified and broadened HCV screening, enhanced linkage to care, and higher coverage of treatment and primary prevention strategies are urgently required.

### Management of chronic hepatitis B [^117T7RaE]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B continues to be a major global health burden. It accounts for a substantial impact on healthcare resources and finances in many parts of the world, including Europe. The natural history and disease spectrum are varied, depending on when and how the infection is acquired. The chronic infective state increases patients' risk of progression to liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Several treatment options are currently available, but their use depends on the stage of the patient's infection, which is influenced by both host and viral factors. The ultimate goals in hepatitis B treatment are to prevent disease progression, hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. Patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis should be referred to specialized transplant centers in a timely manner.

### Virological significance of low-level hepatitis B virus infection in patients with hepatitis C virus associated liver disease [^111V2iLh]. Journal of Medical Virology (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical and virological significance of low-level viremia by hepatitis B virus (HBV) in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients remains unclear. Therefore, HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA were quantitatively analyzed in livers and sera from co-infected patients. HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA were quantitated using real-time detection of polymerase chain reaction (RTD-PCR) based on Taq-Man chemistry, in 220 non-HCV-infected healthy volunteers and 93 HCV-infected patients without detectable HBsAg. Serum HBV-DNA was detected in 4 (1.8%) of 220 non-HCV-infected healthy volunteers and 32 (34.4%) of 93 HCV-infected patients without detectable HBsAg.

HCV-infected patients displayed a higher frequency of HBV infection than healthy volunteers (P < 0.0001). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was more frequent among co-infected patients than among HCV mono-infected patients (P < 0.001). However, quantities of HBV-DNA in sera from co-infected patients were very low (8–19,000 copies/ml). HBV-DNA was detected in liver tissue from co-infected patients at 2–20 copies per 100 hepatocytes, accounting for 1/1,000 to 1/10,000 of HBsAg positive patients.

In livers of patients with HCC and HCV or HBV mono-infection, the viruses existed predominantly in non-cancerous tissue, with levels 10- to 1,000-fold and 1- to 100-fold higher than in cancerous tissue, respectively. In contrast, patients co-infected with HCV and HBV displayed decreased HBV levels in non-cancerous tissue, but no change in cancerous tissue. These results indicate that low-level HBV infection exists in HCV-infected patients. HCC was more common among co-infected individuals.

Regarding specific circumstances for hepatitis B virus infection, particularly concerning patients with HDV co-infection, the WHO 2024 guidelines recommend the diagnosis of HDV infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBsAg-positive). This involves using a serological assay to detect total anti-HDV antibodies, followed by nucleic acid testing to detect HDV RNA and active (viremic) infection in anti-HDV antibody-positive patients. It is imperative to ensure that assays meet minimum quality, safety, and performance standards.

### Hepatitis B and hepatitis C co-infection in patients with HIV [^115PKFfm]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has increased the life expectancy of patients with HIV. However, as their life expectancy increases, it becomes increasingly important to focus on the management of concurrent illnesses such as chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, which have the potential to increase mid- to long-term morbidity and mortality.

Shared epidemiological risks have resulted in the HIV-infected population having a higher incidence of both HBV and HCV than those uninfected with HIV. Co-infection with HIV modifies the natural history of HBV infection, increasing the rate of viral replication, risk of carriage, and chronic hepatitis without increasing liver necroinflammatory processes. In chronic HCV infection, the presence of HIV enhances the risk of severe liver disease.

There is no evidence yet that HBV directly impacts HIV disease progression, but HCV infection increases the risk of death or an AIDS-defining illness and impairs CD4+ T cell recovery during antiretroviral therapy. Treatment of either hepatitis virus is complex due to pharmacokinetic interactions with components of HAART regimens.

### Meeting vaccination quality measures for hepatitis A and B virus in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection [^112wWDKD]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Coinfection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has identified HAV and HBV vaccination as a priority area for quality measurement in HCV. It is unclear to what extent patients with HCV meet these recommendations. We used national data from the Department of Veterans Affairs HCV Clinical Case Registry to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of meeting the quality measure (QM) of receiving vaccination or documented immunity to HAV and HBV in patients with chronic HCV.

We identified 88,456 patients who had overall vaccination rates of 21.9% and 20.7% for HBV and HAV, respectively. The QM rates were 57.0% and 45.5% for HBV and HAV, respectively. Patients who were nonwhite or who had elevated alanine aminotransferase levels, cirrhosis, or human immunodeficiency virus were more likely to meet the HBV QM. Factors related to HCV care were also determinants of meeting the HBV QM. These factors included receiving a specialist consult, genotype testing, or HCV treatment. Patients who were older, had psychosis, and had a higher comorbidity score were less likely to meet the HBV QM. With a few exceptions, similar variables were related to meeting the HAV QM. The incidence of superinfection with acute HBV and HAV was low, but it was significantly lower in patients who received vaccination than in those who did not.

Quality measure rates for HAV and HBV are suboptimal for patients with chronic HCV.

### Hepatitis C treatment update [^11587t6b]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C is a leading cause of chronic liver disease in the United States, and the prevalence of hepatitis C-associated complications is increasing. Therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin has become the standard of care for chronic hepatitis C; the sustained response rate for treatment-naïve patients is about 55%. If certain patients fail to achieve a 12-week treatment milestone, an early virologic response, they may be taken off treatment early, potentially sparing them from unnecessary medication. Adherence is critical for treatment success. Although side effects continue to be a hindrance to the success of therapy, agents such as growth factors and antidepressants may help patients to maintain medication dosing and complete treatment.

Therapy is generally recommended for those in whom the infection is most likely to progress to cirrhosis; however, there is continued debate about the suitability of certain patients for treatment, including those with persistently normal aminotransferase levels or acute hepatitis C and nonresponders to conventional treatment. Four broad groups of investigational therapeutic agents appear promising for future therapy: modified interferons and ribavirins, immunomodulators, viral life-cycle targets, and antifibrotic agents.

### Viral interaction and clinical implications of coinfection of hepatitis C virus with other hepatitis viruses [^114qy6BC]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Coinfection with other hepatitis viruses modifies the viral profile in serum and leads to more liver damage and a more rapid progression during the course of hepatitis C virus infection. The viral interference is not only carried out by virus-virus or by virus-cell interactions but also by an enhanced immune response. A superinfecting viral infection does not cross-activate protective immune responses to the pre-existing virus, although the latter can become undetectable. The induced cytokine stimulation might enhance the hepatic inflammation.

Moreover, hepatitis B virus coinfection increases the risk of development of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis C virus patients through common necro-inflammatory pathways or by the direct oncogenic activity of hepatitis B virus. Viral interaction also complicates the management of the coinfection because hepatitis C virus impairs the humoral response to hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus vaccines. Pharmacological suppression of hepatitis C virus endangers dually infected patients with reactivation of coinfected hepatitis B virus.

Optimized strategies and follow-up are thus necessary in the treatment of infection with multiple viruses. It seems necessary to look for markers of hepatitis B virus and/or hepatitis D virus infection in chronic hepatitis patients positive for hepatitis C virus antibodies but negative for hepatitis C virus RNA. It is equally important to search for hepatitis C virus RNA in HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive patients with a low level of serum hepatitis B virus DNA.

### Combination therapy for hepatitis B [^1115q6a4]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B virus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Effective therapies were first introduced in the mid-1980s; however, frequent and sometimes severe side effects limit their use. Combination therapy represents the future of treatment for chronic hepatitis B, likely consisting of two or more nucleoside analogues, although interferon may form part of some combinations. New drugs acting by different antiviral mechanisms may be particularly potent in combination.
