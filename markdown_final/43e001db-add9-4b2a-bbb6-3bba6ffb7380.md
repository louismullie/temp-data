## Question

What are symptoms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) across the lifespan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and major phenotypes of CAH to anchor symptom patterns. Then, I should delineate acute neonatal salt-wasting and adrenal crisis symptoms. Next, I will review virilization and sex-specific findings, followed by growth and pubertal effects, endocrine and reproductive manifestations, and metabolic and cardiovascular complications. After that, I should map age-dependent presentations, integrate psychosocial and quality-of-life aspects, and consider special contexts like stress dosing, pregnancy, and diagnostic pitfalls. Finally, I will synthesize a concise symptom narrative and double-check any points that might be mistaken or conflated, correcting them explicitly as needed [^1114eNNi].

> Let me first confirm the basic framework. CAH comprises autosomal recessive defects in adrenal steroidogenesis, with 21-hydroxylase deficiency responsible for roughly 90–95% of cases and presenting along a spectrum from classic (salt-wasting and simple virilizing) to non-classic forms, which dictates the timing and severity of symptoms through combined cortisol ± aldosterone deficiency and androgen excess; I should verify that these epidemiologic anchors are consistent with contemporary summaries, and they are, including the estimate of approximately 1:15–16,000 births for classic disease and a higher prevalence for non-classic presentations, which often surface in adolescence or adulthood with hyperandrogenism [^1114eNNi] [^112Go9s2] [^115L4XZZ].

> I will now examine the neonatal and early-infant risk for adrenal crisis, because missing this is life-threatening. In salt-wasting classic CAH, infants can present in days to weeks with vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia (sometimes with ECG changes), metabolic acidosis, and rapid hemodynamic collapse; wait, let me verify specific clinical patterns and timing, which are well-documented in case series and reviews, and align with endocrine guidance emphasizing early recognition and treatment to prevent shock and death in this window [^111jpiuH] [^1114eNNi] [^116FuJ5a].

> Next, I should review genital and sex-specific features driven by prenatal and postnatal androgen excess. In 46, XX infants, virilized external genitalia (clitoromegaly, posterior labial fusion, urogenital sinus) are typical and graded by the Prader scale; hold on, I should confirm that 46, XY infants typically lack genital ambiguity at birth and are therefore more likely to be missed until they develop salt-wasting or later androgen-related sequelae, which is consistent across sources; in males and during adolescence/adulthood, I also need to remember the risk of testicular adrenal rest tumors (TARTs) contributing to infertility and gonadal dysfunction [^1114eNNi] [^113xLnMP] [^113jGsax] [^112uWk1F].

> Let me consider growth and skeletal maturation effects next, since they evolve over childhood. Chronic androgen excess often causes accelerated linear growth, advanced bone age, premature adrenarche/pubarche, and eventual compromise of adult height due to early epiphyseal closure; I should double-check the dose-response relationship with glucocorticoid therapy and the trade-off between androgen control and growth, which multiple high-credibility sources highlight as a core management challenge when titrating hydrocortisone to balance androgen suppression with avoiding iatrogenic Cushingoid effects [^112Go9s2] [^116PE7cz] [^114VFNjH].

> I need to check endocrine and reproductive manifestations that persist beyond childhood. In females, hirsutism, acne, menstrual irregularity, anovulation, and subfertility are common when androgen excess is inadequately controlled, while both sexes remain at risk for adrenal crises if undertreated; let me verify that guidelines emphasize monitoring for undertreatment (fatigue, salt craving, orthostasis) and overtreatment (weight gain, hypertension, low bone mass), which is correct and central to lifelong follow-up and biomarker-guided titration of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids [^111dDM1M] [^1114eNNi] [^111deyXt].

> Hold on, let me not jump past the metabolic and cardiovascular sequelae linked to disease activity and therapy. Long-term glucocorticoid exposure and persistent androgen excess are associated with higher adiposity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and bone complications; I should confirm that contemporary reviews and syntheses acknowledge these risks while also cautioning against over-screening beyond general population recommendations, which the Endocrine Society notes, even as individual risk may be elevated and requires routine clinical vigilance [^114VFNjH] [^111dDM1M] [^112K26vg].

> I will now map symptoms by age and phenotype to keep the presentation patterns clear. Classic salt-wasting disease typically declares itself in the neonatal period with crisis unless detected by screening, classic simple virilizing disease often presents in early childhood with virilization and precocious pubarche, and non-classic CAH emerges later with hyperandrogenic features such as hirsutism, acne, and ovulatory dysfunction that can mimic PCOS; let me verify that screening recommendations for suspected non-classic CAH include early morning follicular-phase 17-hydroxyprogesterone, which is consistent with guideline advice [^1114eNNi] [^116mk9XX] [^11154sxd].

> Next, I should review psychosocial and quality-of-life symptoms, because these directly affect care goals and adherence. Women with CAH may report virilized voice characteristics and lower fundamental frequency, which can be associated with delayed diagnosis or suboptimal control; mental health burdens, including anxiety and depression with variable impacts on quality of life, are described, and guidelines recommend access to mental and behavioral health support, which I need to ensure is highlighted in the overall symptom burden framework [^1149F9ud] [^111eUeoy] [^115iZbKX].

> Let me consider special clinical scenarios that modulate symptom expression or risk. Intercurrent illness, dehydration, major surgery, or trauma can precipitate adrenal crisis and require stress-dose glucocorticoids to prevent decompensation; pregnancy necessitates continuation and adjustment of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid therapy based on clinical features of insufficiency; and I should double-check diagnostic pitfalls such as assay cross-reactivity of adrenal precursors with aldosterone in early infancy that can obscure mineralocorticoid deficiency, which has been reported and can delay accurate diagnosis without LC-MS/MS profiling and careful interpretation [^112EHKdV] [^111e1HaJ] [^1179GgQp].

> Before synthesizing, I should briefly verify the screening and detection context because it affects when symptoms appear. Newborn screening with 17-hydroxyprogesterone identifies many classic cases, but simple virilizing and non-classic CAH may be missed on a single screen and present later; missed diagnoses occur more often in males due to absence of genital ambiguity at birth, reinforcing the need to recognize early crisis symptoms and early virilization patterns in unscreened settings [^117Mfzbf] [^115eKcSA] [^111QP1KB].

> Now, I will synthesize the symptom profile in narrative form, and I need to ensure clinical prioritization. Acutely, life-threatening salt-wasting crisis presents with vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and progression to shock if untreated; in the neonatal and infant period, 46, XX virilization with clitoromegaly, labial fusion, and urogenital sinus is common, while 46, XY infants often appear phenotypically normal and may present when salt wasting declares itself; throughout childhood, early pubarche, accelerated growth with advanced bone age, and early adiposity rebound may be seen; in adolescence and adulthood, females may have hirsutism, acne, oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, anovulatory infertility, and sexual dysfunction, while males may develop TARTs and infertility, with both sexes at risk for central precocious puberty, hyperandrogenic features, and adrenal crises during stress; systemic complications can include hypertension, increased adiposity and insulin resistance, and bone health compromise, alongside psychosocial distress and quality-of-life impacts including virilized voice characteristics in some women [^1114eNNi] [^111jpiuH] [^112Go9s2] [^116PE7cz] [^113jGsax] [^1149F9ud].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should verify a detail from the initial trace about carriers to avoid propagating a conflation. The draft "Final Synthesis" mentioned "Heterozygous carriers typically asymptomatic (1:1000 prevalence)"; hold on, I should verify what the 1:1000 figure refers to, because that number corresponds to the estimated prevalence of non-classic CAH in some populations, not to heterozygous carrier frequency, and while carriers are typically asymptomatic, their frequency is higher than 1:1000, so I need to correct the association while preserving the clinical point that carriers generally lack overt symptoms [^116Thygh].

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) presents with symptoms due to **cortisol deficiency**, **androgen excess**, and variable aldosterone deficiency [^115L4XZZ]. The most common form is **21-hydroxylase deficiency** [^113gTaHn], which has classic and non-classic variants [^1114eNNi].

- **Classic CAH (severe)**: Neonatal salt-wasting crisis (vomiting, dehydration, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, shock) [^1114eNNi], ambiguous genitalia in 46, XX infants [^112Go9s2] [^111jpiuH], and early virilization in both sexes [^113gTaHn].

- **Non-classic CAH (mild)**: Later-onset hyperandrogenism [^116hDdRN] (hirsutism, acne, irregular menses, infertility in females [^113PTKDT]; early pubarche, rapid growth, advanced bone age in children) [^113gTaHn].

- **Long-term complications**: Short stature [^114VFNjH], obesity [^113axbNu], hypertension, insulin resistance [^115L4XZZ], osteoporosis, and reduced fertility [^113gTaHn].

Early diagnosis [^1114eNNi] and lifelong glucocorticoid therapy (with mineralocorticoid when indicated) [^114C9buo] are **essential** to prevent adrenal crises [^113gTaHn] and control androgen excess.

- **Obesity and cardiometabolic health**: In meta-analyses, individuals with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) not only have an increased risk of hypertension but also insulin resistance and increased carotid intima thickness. There is limited data on cardiometabolic risk factors in youth, with most data focusing on obesity. Youth with CAH have higher leptin and fasting insulin levels and lower insulin sensitivity compared to youth without CAH.

Several studies show increased rates of obesity among adults and youth with CAH. Higher glucocorticoid doses, compared to those used in other forms of adrenal insufficiency, are a risk factor for obesity and iatrogenic Cushing syndrome. Youth with CAH have an increased prevalence of obesity, higher total body fat, and greater amounts of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue compared to matched controls without CAH. Patients with CAH also experience earlier adiposity rebound compared to the general population.

Body mass index (BMI) typically rises during the first year of life, decreases until it reaches a nadir in early childhood, and then undergoes adiposity rebound, defined as a second rise in BMI due to an increase in the number and size of adipocytes, typically occurring between ages 5 to 7 years. In cohorts of youth with CAH, the average age of adiposity rebound was 3.4 ± 1.3 years, which was earlier in those with obesity compared to those without. An earlier age of adiposity rebound predicts BMI at ages 7 and 12 years. However, it is important to account for, or correct height age or tall stature in childhood related to advanced bone age, as this changes the prevalence of obesity.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia-when clinical symptoms are missing [^111jpiuH]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is an autosomal recessive condition. The most common mutation is in the CYP21A2 gene situated in chromosome 6, leading to a 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Clinical presentation ranges from light hyperandrogenism to potentially fatal adrenal salt-losing crisis. In this study, we describe a case of congenital adrenal hyperplasia in a male newborn.

- **Case**: A male newborn was brought to the emergency department due to an episode of regurgitation after feeding, followed by pallor of the skin and decreased activity. On physical examination, he was found to be hypotonic with an irregular respiratory pattern. His heart rate was 180 beats per minute, blood pressure levels were 93/63 mm Hg, and peripheral oxygen saturation ranged from 80% to 84%, associated with a sine wave pattern in the electrocardiogram. No scrotal hyperpigmentation was present. The venous blood gas analysis revealed metabolic acidosis (pH, 7.28; pCO2, 41 mmHg; sodium bicarbonate, 18.2 mmol/L; and base excess of -7), hyperkalemia (9.3 mmol/L), and hyponatremia (112 mmol/L). Based on these findings, the most probable diagnosis was a salt-wasting form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Treatment of hyperkalemia and sodium deficit correction were initiated, along with glycocorticoid therapy. The concentration of 17-hydroxyprogesterone in the dried blood spot confirmed the diagnosis.

- **Conclusions**: Due to the severity of this disease and the risk of rapid hemodynamic collapse, clinicians should be aware of this condition. In this specific case, we highlight the absence of testicular hyperpigmentation, which is not always present in similar cases.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^1114eNNi]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a group of autosomal recessive disorders leading to multiple complex hormonal imbalances caused by various enzyme deficiencies in the adrenal steroidogenic pathway. The most common type of congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to steroid 21-hydroxylase (21-OHase, henceforth 21OH) deficiency. The rare, classic (severe) form caused by 21OH deficiency is characterized by life-threatening adrenal crises and is the most common cause of atypical genitalia in neonates with a 46, XX karyotype. After the introduction of life-saving hormone replacement therapy in the 1950s and neonatal screening programs in many countries, neonatal survival rates in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia are now high. However, disease-related mortality is increased, and therapeutic management remains challenging, with multiple long-term complications related to treatment and disease affecting growth and development, metabolic and cardiovascular health, and fertility. Non-classic (mild) forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia caused by 21OH deficiency are more common than the classic ones; they are detected clinically and primarily identified in female patients with hirsutism or impaired fertility. Novel treatment approaches are emerging with the aim of mimicking physiological circadian cortisol rhythm or reducing adrenal hyperandrogenism independent of the suppressive effect of glucocorticoids.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^113gTaHn]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a group of autosomal recessive disorders encompassing enzyme deficiencies in the adrenal steroidogenesis pathway that lead to impaired cortisol biosynthesis. Depending on the type and severity of steroid block, patients can have various alterations in glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and sex steroid production that require hormone replacement therapy. Presentations vary from neonatal salt wasting and atypical genitalia to adult presentation of hirsutism and irregular menses. Screening of neonates with elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations for classic (severe) 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the most common type of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, is in place in many countries; however, cosyntropin stimulation testing might be needed to confirm the diagnosis or establish non-classic (milder) subtypes.

Challenges in the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia include avoiding glucocorticoid overtreatment and controlling sex hormone imbalances. Long-term complications include abnormal growth and development, adverse effects on bone and the cardiovascular system, and infertility. Novel treatments aim to reduce glucocorticoid exposure, improve excess hormone control, and mimic physiological hormone patterns.

Regarding medical management for congenital adrenal hyperplasia, specifically in the context of non-classic CAH, the 2018 ES guidelines recommend considering the initiation of corticosteroid treatment in pediatric and adolescent patients. This is particularly relevant for those who experience an inappropriately early onset and rapid progression of pubarche or bone age, as well as in adolescent patients who present with overt virilization.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^113zxDkq]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

The congenital adrenal hyperplasias are a group of autosomal recessive disorders associated with impaired steroidogenesis. Several types of congenital adrenal hyperplasias are linked with decreased cortisol production and excessive adrenal sex steroid secretion. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common and prototypic example of this group of disorders.

We review the clinical features, pathophysiology, molecular genetics, and treatment of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. There is also a brief discussion of other steroidogenic enzyme defects associated with clinical features due to excessive androgen secretion.

### NIH conference. Future directions in the study and management of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^116mk9XX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia describes a group of inherited autosomal recessive disorders characterized by an enzymatic defect in cortisol biosynthesis, compensatory increases in corticotropin secretion, and adrenocortical hyperplasia. 21-Hydroxylase deficiency is responsible for more than 95% of cases and is one of the most common known autosomal recessive disorders. The classic or severe type presents in the newborn period or early childhood with virilization and adrenal insufficiency, with or without salt loss; the mild or nonclassic form presents in late childhood or early adulthood with mild hyperandrogenism and is an important cause of masculinization and infertility in women. This wide range of phenotypic expression is mostly explained by genetic variation, although genotype-phenotype discrepancies have been described.

Reproductive, metabolic, and other comorbid conditions, including risk for tumors, are currently under investigation in both forms of the disease. A high proportion of patients with adrenal incidentalomas may be homozygous or heterozygous for 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia often develop polycystic ovary syndrome. Ectopic adrenal rest tissue is often found in the testes of men with congenital adrenal hyperplasia; characteristic clinical and radiologic findings help differentiate this tissue from other tumors. Levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone are elevated in patients with depression and anxiety and are expected to be elevated in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

### Life with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency: Challenges and burdens [^111gkTUM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is an autosomal recessive condition caused by loss of function variants in the 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2) gene. Clinically, this condition ranges from classic salt-losing forms with complete loss of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid secretion, to simple virilizing with adequate mineralocorticoid secretion to avoid overt salt loss, to the milder nonclassic forms where symptoms are largely attributed to excessive adrenal C-19 steroid secretion. This article focuses on the classic forms. The frequency of classic CAH is approximately 1 in 16,000.

CAH is a chronic disorder. Children with the classic forms are diagnosed in infancy and young childhood. They grow up adhering to routines of taking regular medications and being aware of the need for extra medications when ill. As the child grows, caregivers/parents/guardians need to learn how to instill independence in their children in a safe environment. Goals for individuals with CAH include attaining a good quality of life and becoming productive members of society.

Despite these reasonable goals, persons with CAH may encounter various challenges. The medical community has achieved a broad consensus that treatment involves glucocorticoid (and, if necessary, mineralocorticoid) replacement therapy, "stress doses" for intercurrent illnesses/trauma/surgery, and regular interactions with knowledgeable healthcare providers. Nevertheless, the humanistic and economic burdens associated with CAH vary widely among regions of the world and even between individuals.

### Analysis of therapy monitoring in the International Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Registry [^116PE7cz]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive condition leading to glucocorticoid deficiency, androgen excess, variable degrees of mineralocorticoid deficiency, salt wasting, and a risk of life‐threatening adrenal crisis. Poorly controlled CAH causes abnormal growth, resulting in reduced adult height, reduced quality of life, increased comorbidities, and shorter life expectancy. Significant variation in treatment strategies has been noted in the United Kingdom and internationally, including using different formulations and dosing regimens. An international consensus statement in 2002 was followed by a 2010 Endocrine Society guideline, updated in 2018, that improved guidance for clinicians, but there remain points of contention. The optimal balance of glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid replacement, and need for salt replacement in infants is debated. It is acknowledged that treatment should be individualized, but precisely how to use the results from biochemical markers in the context of biometric measurements in children is unknown.

The recommended daily dose range of hydrocortisone (HC) is 10–15 mg/m²/day, with a recent review advocating doses up to 18 mg/m²/day. However, others suggest doses over 17 mg/m²/day should only be used with care during puberty as adult height has been shown to correlate negatively with glucocorticoid dose. Maintaining 17‐OH progesterone (17OHP) concentrations in the upper end of the normal range is suggested, with alternative targets including 17OHP of 10–20, 12–36 or 3–36 nmol/l across all ages and sexes.

### Clinical manifestations and treatment challenges in infants and children with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^116FuJ5a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) refers to a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by pathogenic variants in specific genes encoding proteins important for adrenal steroidogenesis, thereby altering the function of adrenal steroidogenic enzymes. The most common form of CAH is secondary to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD), caused by biallelic mutations or deletions in CYP21A2. The phenotype of 21OHD is variable depending on the degree of 21OH enzyme activity. Although 21OHD is a continuous spectrum, it is broadly categorized into the more severe classic type and the less severe non-classic type. Historically, classic CAH has been further divided into the more severe salt-wasting type with no enzyme activity and the less severe simple virilizing type with 1% to 2% enzyme activity, although these designations are somewhat arbitrary and have fallen out of favor. Impaired synthesis of both cortisol and aldosterone leads to adrenal insufficiency and salt-wasting. Inadequate cortisol feedback leads to elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which promotes accumulation of steroid precursors proximal to the 21OH enzyme action, resulting in excessive androgen secretion and virilization.

The aims of CAH treatment are to replace glucocorticoid and/or mineralocorticoid deficiencies and to reduce adrenal androgen excess. This is achieved with glucocorticoid treatment that re-establishes negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Patients with classic CAH also require mineralocorticoid therapy (fludrocortisone) along with appropriate salt intake.

### Cross-reactivity of adrenal steroids with aldosterone may prevent the accurate diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^1179GgQp]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

During the first weeks of life, salt-wasting crisis, hyperkalemia, acidosis, hypoglycemia, and shock are the main findings of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is a rare disease of mineralocorticoid resistance characterized by high aldosterone levels, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia, without clinical findings of glucocorticoid deficiency. Patients with PHA1 are often initially diagnosed with CAH; however, it is unusual for a CAH patient to be misdiagnosed as having PHA1.

In this report, we describe two cases with severe salt-losing crisis, hyperkalemia, and mild acidosis, initially diagnosed with PHA1 due to high aldosterone levels along with normal adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels. However, subsequent investigation and genetic analysis led to the diagnosis of CAH with a homozygous I2 splice mutation in both alleles of the CYP21 gene.

With this report, we emphasize that high blood levels of adrenal steroid precursors may cross-react with aldosterone, leading to confusing laboratory results that prevent making the accurate differential diagnosis between CAH and PHA1.

### Lessons from 30 years of clinical diagnosis and treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia in five middle European countries [^115eKcSA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Despite the fact that congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is one of the most common inborn endocrine disorders, some patients are not identified or may even die in an acute salt-losing crisis. In a retrospective study covering the last 30 years, we examined the time elapsing before diagnosis of CAH patients in five Middle European countries and the mortality rate in diagnosed patients and their siblings during childhood. We also attempted to estimate how many patients are not diagnosed clinically each year.

Basic and follow-up clinical data, along with the family histories of 484 patients with classical forms of CAH diagnosed between 1969 and 1998, were collected and recorded in five Middle European countries. The sex ratio, time elapsing before diagnosis, and mortality among siblings and patients were calculated, and the number of undiagnosed patients was estimated.

We found significantly fewer genetic males (43.0%) than females (57.0%) among the 484 classic CAH patients. The percentage of diagnosed boys did not increase with time. Of these patients, 64.7% suffered from the salt-wasting (SW) form and 35.3% from the simple virilizing (SV) form of the disease. The diagnosis of CAH was established significantly later in males than in females for both forms [SW: 26 vs. 13 days (median), P < 0.0001; SV: 5.0 vs. 2.8 years, P = 0.03].

Infant mortality in the general population was significantly lower than in either siblings (1.8% vs. 7.0%; P < 0.0001) or in SW patients (2.29% vs. 11.3%; P < 0.0001). According to our calculations based on our praxis of clinical ascertainment, 2–2.5 SW and up to 5 SV patients remain undiagnosed annually.

### Clinical manifestations and challenges in adolescent and adult females with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^113xLnMP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), commonly caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) in the steroid hormone production of the adrenal cortex, results in varying degrees of cortisol and aldosterone deficiency and concomitant increased androgen production. The most severe forms of CAH are lethal in the newborn period if left untreated. Neonatal screening programs are now in place in more than 35 countries and all states in the United States.

- **Prenatal hormonal imbalance**: The hormonal imbalance is present already in utero, leading to increased androgen exposure. This results in virilization of female fetuses with clitoral enlargement, fusion of labia majora, and formation of a urogenital sinus. The extent of virilization of the external genitalia is graded according to Prader (Fig. 1).

- **Increased androgen levels**: Several researchers have shown that steroid hormone production in CAH results in increased levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) produced via the so-called back door pathway. DHT is an even more potent androgen than testosterone in binding to the androgen receptor. It is also the androgen required for masculine development of the external genitalia during fetal development.

- **Alternative androgen synthesis pathways**: Moreover, the increased levels of 21-deoxycortisol produced in 21OHD are converted to the 11-ketoform of testosterone and 11-keto-DHT, which have the same potencies. These additional pathways to androgen synthesis in 21OHD likely accentuate the virilization of external genitalia in 46, XX fetuses and explain the relatively marked virilization seen in girls and women with severe forms of classic CAH.

Prenatal exposure to these conditions…

### Clinical manifestations and treatment challenges in infants and children with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^114haJnX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is secondary to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD). This review summarizes the clinical manifestations, recommended treatments, monitoring, clinical challenges, management strategies, and treatment challenges in special situations for infants and children with classic CAH due to 21OHD. Specifically, we review newborn screening and the initial diagnosis, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid treatment, and recommended monitoring, including anthropometric and laboratory measures.

Children with CAH may experience premature adrenarche, precocious puberty, early growth plate closure, and have an increased risk of hypertension and overweight/obesity. Many 46, XX individuals will also have genital differences, which may include clitoromegaly and/or a urogenital sinus.

We review psychosocial and surgical considerations, including suggestions on how to talk with children, family, and caregivers about bodily differences. These suggestions may be used by families and/or providers caring for individuals with CAH.

### Bilateral adrenalectomy in congenital adrenal hyperplasia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1126EyJN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

Management of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) involves suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis using supraphysiological doses of exogenous glucocorticoids. This can pose a challenge, with Cushing syndrome being a frequent complication of adequate suppression. Bilateral adrenalectomy, followed by the replacement of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids at physiological doses, has been proposed as an alternative therapeutic strategy.

The objective of this study is to review the outcomes after bilateral adrenalectomy for CAH.

- **Data sources**: A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science was conducted, identifying relevant reports published up to January 10, 2018.

- **Study selection**: Case reports or case series were included if they reported individual patient data from patients with CAH who had undergone bilateral adrenalectomy.

- **Data extraction**: Information was extracted regarding the following: first author, country, sex, age at adrenalectomy, year of adrenalectomy, diagnosis, molecular abnormality, pre- and postoperative biochemistry, pre- and postoperative medications, pre- and postoperative body mass index, indication for adrenalectomy, surgical technique, gross and microscopic adrenal characteristics, follow-up duration, and short- and long-term postoperative outcomes.

- **Data synthesis**: We identified 48 cases of bilateral adrenalectomy for CAH, with patients aged from 4 months to 56 years at surgery. The most common indication for surgery was the inability to control hyperandrogenism/virilization and/or Cushing syndrome (n = 30; 62%). Most patients (n = 34; 71%) reported significant postoperative improvements in symptom management and overall health outcomes.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia: From genetics and biochemistry to clinical practice, part 1 [^112oWHTf]. Clinical Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) refers to a group of genetic disorders with defects in the synthesis of cortisol. The synthesis of other steroids, such as mineralocorticoids and adrenal/gonadal sex steroids, may also be affected. The clinical presentation of the various forms of CAH depends on the following factors: (1) the affected enzyme, (2) the residual enzymatic activity, and (3) the physiological consequences of deficiencies of the end-products and excess of precursors.

The first part of this two-part review discusses the genetics, biochemistry, and clinical presentation of the different forms of CAH. Understanding the genetics and pathophysiology of each of the various enzyme mutations is essential for the evaluation and management of the different clinical forms of CAH.

### Future directions in the management of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^111ZJBDw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The traditional management of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) is difficult and often suboptimal. The objective of this study is to review improvements in the diagnosis and management of 21OHD through literature review, synthesis, and authors' experience from two centers in the United States.

- **Results**: The 11-oxygenated androgens are abundant in 21OHD, and their measurement might improve diagnosis and medication titration. Several new treatments are under development.

- **Conclusion**: Circadian delivery of hydrocortisone improves disease management of 21OHD compared to conventional glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoid-sparing therapies such as crinecerfont and atumelnant offer the potential for a block-and-replace strategy, with physiologic replacement dosing of hydrocortisone.

Clinical trial registration: None.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a term that encompasses a wide range of conditions that affect the adrenals. Diagnosis and treatment before birth are important as irreparable birth defects can be avoided, decreasing the need for surgical intervention later in life, especially regarding genitalia anomalies. Although early implementation of dexamethasone in the prenatal treatment of CAH has been controversial, there is recent evidence that this treatment can reduce long-term complications.

### Approach to androgen excess in women: Clinical and biochemical insights [^116hDdRN]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a rare monogenic form of androgen excess with a prevalence rate of approximately 1:14,000 to 1:18,000 births, depending on the population studied. A 21-hydroxylase deficiency resulting from a homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the CYP21A2 gene on chromosome 6 accounts for 95% of cases. This deficiency leads to defective conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) to 11-deoxycortisol, resulting in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency in most cases, along with adrenal androgen excess due to a compensatory rise in ACTH.

Affected female infants are typically diagnosed at birth due to ambiguous genitalia, while male infants usually present after 2 to 4 weeks with a salt-wasting adrenal crisis. In nonclassic CAH (NCCAH), there is typically 20%–70% residual activity of the 21-hydroxylase enzyme, resulting in a less severe phenotype, with adrenal androgen excess but preserved glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production. NCCAH typically presents in adolescence or even adulthood, with hirsutism, acne, or ovulatory dysfunction in women, often clinically indistinguishable from PCOS.

Clinical history should focus on family history or any history of familial consanguinity as a risk factor for inherited metabolic disease. Confirmatory biochemical testing for NCCAH is outlined in the section on diagnostics. In certain ethnic groups, the incidence of consanguinity in parents of patients with CAH is relatively high. One study examining consanguinity rates in Saudi Arabia showed positive consanguinity between parents in 22.2% of cases.

### Clinical manifestations and challenges in adolescent and adult females with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^11341TEE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The fetal virilization of female genitalia in severe forms of CAH can lead to difficulties in determining the sex at birth (ambiguous genitalia) (see Fig. 1). After a diagnosis of 46, XX CAH, feminizing surgical procedures (clitoroplasty, vaginoplasty, and labioplasty) have traditionally been performed early in life. However, during the last decades, the indication for surgery has become more restrictive to operate only on severely virilized girls and to postpone surgery to puberty when the patient can make her own informed decision. Even so, most patients and their parents are in favor of early surgery. Advocacy groups have questioned this and recommend informed consent since early surgery is performed mainly due to aesthetic reasons. The timing of surgery is still controversial, and there is a lack of evidence for early vs. late surgery or a 2-stage approach with clitoroplasty performed in infancy and vaginoplasty at puberty.

Complications of feminizing surgery are not uncommon and include vaginal stenosis, reduced clitoral sensitivity, risk of fistulae, poor aesthetic outcomes, and sexual problems. Particularly amputation of the clitoris, which was performed until the 1970s, was associated with reduced sensitivity and inability to orgasm, while modern surgical techniques using neurovascular-sparing clitoroplasty have led to improved outcomes. A systematic review and meta-analysis reported that many patients who underwent genital reconstructive surgery, of whom the majority were heterosexual, continued to report substantial impairment of clitoral sensitivity.

### Clinical manifestations and treatment challenges in infants and children with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^116ZEAJS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Adrenarche, the onset of adrenal androgen production, can occur as early as 6 to 8 years of age. In some children, this can result in physical changes such as the development of pubic hair, axillary hair, apocrine body odor, and acne. In clinical experience, children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) may experience this onset as an indicator of a period of more challenging control of the condition. This can lead to growth acceleration and increased levels of 17-OHP, androstenedione, and testosterone, along with bone age advancement. Therefore, providing anticipatory guidance to parents and guardians about this possibility and ensuring consistency with hydrocortisone dosing are crucial to mitigating risks.

Children with CAH are also at risk of developing central precocious puberty, marked by early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This results in breast development before the age of 8 years in females and testicular enlargement before the age of 9 years in males. Thus, careful monitoring for growth acceleration, pubertal evaluation, and laboratory assessments to evaluate for central precocious puberty are necessary. Treatment for bone age advancement in CAH involves optimizing hydrocortisone dosing and potentially considering aromatase inhibitors and gonadotropic-releasing hormone agonist treatment in cases of central precocious puberty.

Many infants do not routinely have blood pressure assessments during well-child checks or clinic visits. However, it is important that infants and children with CAH receive regular blood pressure evaluations.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia cases identified by newborn screening in one- and two-screen states [^117Mfzbf]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

There is no clear consensus among state newborn screening programs on whether routine second screening of newborns identifies clinically relevant cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). This retrospective study evaluated laboratory practices, along with biochemical and medical characteristics of CAH cases detected on the first newborn screen in one-screen compared to two-screen states, as well as those detected on the first versus the second screen in the two-screen states to determine the effectiveness of a second screen.

A total of 374 confirmed cases of CAH from two one-screen states and five two-screen states were included in this study. Demographic data and diagnostic information on each reported case were collected and analyzed. Additionally, laboratory data, including screening methodologies and algorithms, were evaluated. The one-screen states reported 99 cases of CAH out of 1,740,586 newborns screened (1 in 17,500): 88 (89%) identified on the first screen and 5 (5%) identified on the targeted second screen. The two-screen states reported 275 cases of CAH out of 2,629,627 newborns screened (1 in 9,500): 165 (60%) identified on the first screen and 99 (36%) identified on the second screen.

Using a multivariate model, the only significant predictor of whether a case was identified on the first or the second screen in the two-screen states was the type of CAH. Compared with classical salt-wasting CAH, classical simple virilizing and non-classical CAH cases were less likely to be detected on the first versus the second screen.

### Clinical manifestations and treatment challenges in infants and children with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^111QP1KB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Classic CAH is often detected in the neonatal period due to virilization of the external genitalia in 46, XX infants, although some 46, XX infants with mild virilization are not identified on physical examination. Infants with 46, XY karyotype can be missed, as there are no overt physical characteristics. Additionally, 46, XX infants with significantly virilized genitalia (e.g. Prader 4–5) may be misclassified and assumed to be 46, XY individuals with undescended testes. They are also at risk of salt-wasting crisis if they do not have a newborn screen performed or are born in a region without newborn screening. Missed or late diagnoses of salt-wasting CAH are associated with early neonatal morbidity and mortality. Early detection and prevention of morbidity and mortality is the goal of newborn screening.

Alaska was the first state to initiate screening for 21OHD on the newborn screen in 1978. By 2009, all states in the United States and more than 35 countries worldwide had mandatory screening for CAH. Guidelines recommend that first-tier screens use 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) assays standardized to a common technology with norms by gestational age. First-tier screens are typically performed with automated time-resolved dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluoroimmunoassay. A minority of states in the United States have a second newborn screen. Second newborn screens improve sensitivity and positive predictive value and should be performed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

### Prenatal diagnosis and treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia owing to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^117MAvZW]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Classical forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia are caused by a severe deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in steroid biosynthesis, which triggers excessive androgen production before birth. Affected females experience virilization both physically and psychologically. Prenatal diagnosis and treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia have been implemented for more than 20 years. In utero gene-specific diagnosis is now feasible for fetal cell samples derived from chorionic villi or amniotic cells in culture, and this diagnosis guides the treatment of the affected female fetus. Appropriate dexamethasone administration to the at-risk pregnant mother is effective in reducing genital virilization in the fetus, thus avoiding unnecessary genitoplasty in affected females. Data from large human studies show the benefit and safety of prenatal treatment. Long-term follow-up of the safety of prenatal treatment is currently underway. This practice is a rare example of effective prenatal treatment to prevent a malformation caused by an inborn error of metabolism.

### Crinecerfont lowers elevated hormone markers in adults with 21-hydroxylase deficiency congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^112Go9s2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) refers to a group of rare autosomal recessive disorders that result in disordered adrenal steroidogenesis, including impaired cortisol synthesis. Excess adrenal androgen production occurs in patients with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD), a population that accounts for approximately 95% of all CAH cases. The cortisol deficiency removes normal negative feedback inhibition on the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, resulting in increased secretion of corticotropin-releasing factor from the hypothalamus and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) from the pituitary, leading to excess production of adrenal androgens.

The "classic" form of CAH due to 21OHD, associated with more severe enzyme deficiency, occurs in approximately 1:15,000 births. The androgen excess during fetal life leads to virilization of 46, XX newborns; 21OHD is the leading cause of atypical genitalia in female infants. Continued androgen excess during childhood and adolescence causes sexual precocity, virilization, and accelerated somatic growth with advanced bone age, which ultimately results in below-predicted adult height. During adulthood, hirsutism and irregular menses are common in women, and men and women with 21OHD suffer from reduced fertility and psychiatric disorders. In addition, all patients with 21OHD are at risk for adrenal crises that can result in death if untreated.

### The impact of adherence and therapy regimens on quality of life in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^111eUeoy]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a rare endocrine disorder of adrenal steroid biosynthesis and is characterized by impaired cortisol synthesis, hypoaldosteronism, and hyperandrogenism. Life‐long oral glucocorticoid supplementation is essential for patients with classic CAH, including the salt‐wasting (SW) and simple virilizing (SV) forms. As standard glucocorticoid supplementation cannot entirely mimic the normal circadian cortisol rhythm, supraphysiological doses are often needed to reduce excessive levels of androgen, which can lead to long‐term adverse effects. In nonclassic (NC) CAH, which is the milder form of the disorder, glucocorticoid supplementation is not vital but is often used to control the symptoms of excessive androgen levels.

Impaired quality of life (QoL) and psychological morbidity have been more frequently observed in patients with adrenal insufficiency than in normal populations. Studies investigating health‐related outcomes, including QoL in patients with CAH, have shown conflicting results. Some have reported poor QoL, while others have reported better, similar, or only mildly impaired QoL in patients with CAH when compared with controls or the general population.

Patients' nonadherence to medical therapy regimens is a prevalent and persistent healthcare problem for healthcare providers. External factors, such as the healthcare system, therapy characteristics, the duration of the disease, and internal factors including patients' attitudes and beliefs regarding medication, can all affect adherence. An earlier retrospective, matched cohort study highlighted the complexity of managing adherence in this patient population.

### Clinical manifestations and challenges in adolescent and adult females with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^116AfiCF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

21OHD is a monogenic and recessively inherited disorder. The gene CYP21A2, located in tandem with a pseudogene on chromosome 6p21.2, encodes 21-hydroxylase. More than 300 pathogenic variations have been described, but 10 pseudogene-derived common pathogenic variants and deletions account for more than 90% of the affected alleles. The clinical severity of 21OHD can generally be predicted from the CYP21A2 genotype; the mildest allele typically determines severity, with very few exceptions.

Patients homozygous for null pathogenic variants with completely abolished enzymatic activity on both alleles are more significantly affected by salt-wasting (SW) CAH than those with SW caused by compound heterozygosity for I2G (g.655A/C > G). The simple virilizing (SV) form is less severe, resulting in varying degrees of prenatal virilization, and retains mineralocorticoid synthesis with about a 10% risk of SW crisis in highly stressful situations. The I172N variant is the most prevalent among individuals with SV CAH.

Nonclassic (NC) or late-onset CAH presents generally less pronounced symptoms and no prenatal virilization at birth. Patients with NC-CAH are often identified during puberty due to increased growth velocity as well as androgen symptoms, and in some cases, clitoral enlargement. Adult diagnosis frequently occurs due to androgen symptoms and fertility issues.

### Precocious pubarche: distinguishing late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia from premature adrenarche [^112vTXeT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Because precocious pubarche (PP) reveals late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia (LO-CAH) in 5 to 20% of cases, an adrenal stimulation test is recommended in all patients presenting with it. This test is stressful and expensive, and results are normal in more than 80% of cases.

Our objective was to identify clinical and plasma predictors of LO-CAH among patients presenting with PP. We conducted a retrospective cohort study that included all patients seen for PP at our hospital between 1999 and 2006 (n = 238). All had undergone an ACTH test.

LO-CAH was defined by a post-ACTH 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) plasma level greater than 10 ng/ml and confirmed by mutational analysis of the CYP21 gene. The association of standard clinical and laboratory indicators with LO-CAH was assessed.

Ten (4%) of 238 patients had LO-CAH. Basal 17-OHP, Delta4-androstenedione, and testosterone plasma levels were significantly higher in these patients. A 2-ng/ml threshold for basal 17-OHP plasma levels offered 100% (95% CI, 69–100) sensitivity for the diagnosis of LO-CAH and 99% (95% CI, 96–100) specificity.

We identified three plasma predictors of LO-CAH in patients presenting with PP. A selective strategy based on a 2-ng/ml basal 17-OHP plasma level threshold would have safely avoided 99% of the unnecessary ACTH tests among our patients.

### The presentation of congenital adrenal hyperplasia in an unscreened population [^114CdAdh]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe the incidence and spectrum of early clinical presentations of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in an unscreened population.

- **Methods**: A national retrospective observational study was undertaken to identify all children diagnosed with CAH in the Republic of Ireland, between January 2005 and December 2019. Reporting clinicians completed anonymized clinical questionnaires.

- **Results**: There were 103 cases of CAH reported, and 69 cases met the study inclusion criteria. The estimated annualized incidence of CAH in the Republic of Ireland was 1:14,754 or 0.07 cases per 1,000 live births. Forty-seven children presented clinically in the first six months of life, but only 17 of these had a confirmed diagnosis by day 10. Of these early presentations, there were 28 infants with salt-wasting, 15 females presented with virilized genitalia, and four infants were detected due to a family history of CAH. Female infants presented at a median age of 0 days [IQR 0–1] and males at 14 days [IQR 9–21]. Seventy-eight percent of salt-wasting presentations occurred after day 10. Delays in clinical presentation, biochemical diagnosis, and treatment initiation were identified.

- **Conclusions**: The incidence of CAH is higher in Ireland than in other unscreened populations. In the absence of screening, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of CAH and appropriate investigations should be urgently requested. Life-threatening salt-wasting is the most frequent clinical presentation and many cases could be detected prior to decompensation if newborn screening were implemented.

### Clinical manifestations and treatment challenges in infants and children with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^115csn3x]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is secondary to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD). This review summarizes the clinical manifestations, recommended treatments, monitoring, clinical challenges, management strategies, and treatment challenges in special situations for infants and children with classic CAH due to 21OHD.

Specifically, we review newborn screening and the initial diagnosis, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid treatment, and recommended monitoring, including anthropometric and laboratory measures. Children with CAH may experience premature adrenarche, precocious puberty, early growth plate closure, and an increased risk of hypertension and overweight/obesity. Additionally, many 46, XX individuals may have genital differences, such as clitoromegaly and/or a urogenital sinus.

We also review psychosocial and surgical considerations, including suggestions on communicating with children, family, and caregivers about bodily differences. These suggestions may be used by families and/or providers caring for individuals with CAH.

### Challenges in adolescent and adult males with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^113jGsax]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of rare autosomal recessive disorders caused by pathogenic variants in genes involved in steroid synthesis in the adrenal glands. These variants are associated with a continuum of CAH phenotypes, ranging from a mild nonclassic form to the more severe classic form. Approximately 95% of CAH cases are due to a 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD), leading to impaired production of cortisol and aldosterone. The cortisol deficiency in patients with CAH causes a loss of negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which leads to oversecretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and excess adrenal androgen production. The severely increased prenatal adrenal androgen concentrations lead to virilization of external genitalia in females; however, males have normal external genitalia. Aldosterone deficiency can lead to life-threatening "salt-wasting" crises if left untreated, especially in infants.

Individuals with classic 21OHD typically require lifelong treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) to replace deficient cortisol and suppress excess production of ACTH and adrenal androgens. Without GC treatment, or in patients whose CAH is poorly controlled due to lack of monitoring and/or adherence, ACTH and adrenal androgen levels remain elevated, leading to advanced bone age, precocious puberty, and below predicted final height. Usually, supraphysiologic GC doses are required to adequately suppress overproduction of ACTH and adrenal androgens, which can lead to serious metabolic, cardiovascular, and skeletal complications.

### Interpretation of steroid biomarkers in 21-hydroxylase deficiency and their use in disease management [^114VFNjH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD), which in the classic (severe) form occurs in roughly 1:16,000 newborns worldwide. Lifelong treatment consists of replacing cortisol and aldosterone deficiencies, and supraphysiological dosing schedules are typically employed to simultaneously attenuate production of adrenal-derived androgens. Glucocorticoid titration in 21OHD is challenging as it must balance the consequences of androgen excess versus those from chronic high glucocorticoid exposure, which are further complicated by interindividual variability in cortisol kinetics and glucocorticoid sensitivity.

Clinical assessment and biochemical parameters are both used to guide therapy, but the specific purpose and goals of each biomarker vary with age and clinical context. Here we review the approach to medication titration for children and adults with classic 21OHD, with an emphasis on how to interpret adrenal biomarker values in guiding this process. In parallel, we illustrate how an understanding of the pathophysiologic and pharmacologic principles can be used to avoid and to correct complications of this disease and consequences of its management using existing treatment options.

### Should children with isolated premature adrenarche be routinely evaluated for non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^116FFXgk]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical practice is to evaluate children presenting with premature adrenarche (PA) for non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NC-CAH). Our main objective was to assess the prevalence of NC-CAH among children presented with PA. Additional objectives were to ascertain whether subpopulations were prone to NC-CAH, thus justifying testing, and if obesity is a factor that can exclude the need for CAH testing.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review of all children ≤ 11 years who presented to our clinic with PA between January 2012 and May 2015 (n = 103) was conducted. PA was defined based on commonly accepted clinical criteria.

- **Results**: We did not identify any subjects with NC-CAH, but one was affected with previously undiagnosed classical simple virilizing CAH (SV-CAH). The subject was born prior to the implementation of CAH newborn screening in the state of birth. The affected subject was of Middle Eastern origin and also obese (BMI > 95 percentile for age and sex).

- **Conclusions**: Undiagnosed CAH is an uncommon cause of PA, and therefore routine screening for NC-CAH in every case of PA may not be justified, although it should still be considered in high-risk ethnicities. Obesity does not appear to exclude the possibility of being affected with mild or NC-CAH.

### Clinical manifestations and treatment challenges in infants and children with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^1153jdEG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Infants who have a positive newborn screen for CAH should be referred to a pediatric endocrinologist, if available, for confirmatory testing and determination of the need for treatment.

- **Screening for symptomatic children**: For children who are symptomatic or suspected to have CAH and present to care after infancy, the Endocrine Society guidelines recommend screening with a serum 17-OHP before 8 a.m., measured using LC-MS/MS. Individuals with borderline 17-OHP should undergo cosyntropin stimulation with a complete adrenocortical profile to evaluate both the type of 21OHD and to assess for other causes of CAH or other enzymatic defects.

	- **Cosyntropin administration**: Typical doses of cosyntropin are 250 mcg given intravenously. However, infants, particularly premature or low birth weight infants, may be given 125 mcg intravenously.

	- **Laboratory measures**: Laboratory measures are assessed at baseline and 60 minutes after cosyntropin administration. At a minimum, cortisol and 17-OHP are measured. To differentiate 21OHD from other enzymatic defects, measurements should also include 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, 17-OH-pregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone, as well as androstenedione. Commonly available assays for measuring critical hormone levels such as cortisol and testosterone may cross-react with adrenal metabolites, leading to falsely increased levels in measured cortisol and testosterone in the immunoassays. To avoid this issue, measurement of hormones in the LC-MS/MS assays is recommended.

In our clinical experience, obtaining a complete profile is often not possible in infants, and especially in preterm infants, due to blood volume constraints.

### Prenatal diagnosis for congenital adrenal hyperplasia in 532 pregnancies [^114tTT9n]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) refers to a family of monogenic inherited disorders of adrenal steroidogenesis, most often caused by enzyme 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). In the classic forms of CAH, such as simple virilizing and salt wasting, androgen excess causes external genital ambiguity in newborn females and progressive postnatal virilization in both males and females. Prenatal treatment of CAH with dexamethasone has been successfully used for over a decade. This article serves as an update on 532 pregnancies prenatally diagnosed using amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling between 1978 and 2001 at New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Medical College of Cornell University.

Of the 532 pregnancies, 281 were prenatally treated for CAH due to the risk of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Follow-up telephone interviews with mothers, genetic counselors, endocrinologists, pediatricians, and obstetricians were performed in all cases. Of the pregnancies evaluated, 116 babies were affected with classic 21-OHD. Of these, 61 were female, 49 of whom were treated prenatally with dexamethasone. Dexamethasone administered at or before 9 weeks of gestation (in proper doses) was effective in reducing virilization.

There were no statistical differences in the symptoms during pregnancy between mothers treated with dexamethasone and those not treated, except for weight gain, edema, and striae, which were greater in the treated group. No significant or enduring side effects were noted in the fetuses, indicating that dexamethasone treatment is safe. Unfortunately, the completed data on prenatally treated newborns is missing from the supplied text.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia: Diagnostic advances [^1155vaq8]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a group of autosomal recessive disorders resulting from the deficiency of one of the five enzymes required for the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal cortex. The most frequent is steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency, accounting for more than 90% of cases. Much has been learned about the genetics of the various clinical forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency, and correlations between the genotype and the phenotype have been studied extensively. Gene-specific diagnosis is now feasible, and neonatal screening and prenatal treatment have been widely implemented. This discussion will be limited to the most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, with a focus on the diagnostic advances in this disease.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^116ZcBtX]. Lancet (2005). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to deficiency of 21-hydroxylase is a disorder of the adrenal cortex characterized by cortisol deficiency, with or without aldosterone deficiency, as well as androgen excess. Patients with the most severe form also have abnormalities of the adrenal medulla and epinephrine deficiency. The severe classic form occurs in one in 15,000 births worldwide, and the mild non-classic form is a common cause of hyperandrogenism. Neonatal screening for CAH and gene-specific prenatal diagnosis are now possible. Standard hormone replacement fails to achieve normal growth and development for many children with CAH, and adults can experience iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome, hyperandrogenism, infertility, or the development of metabolic syndrome.

This seminar reviews the epidemiology, genetics, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of CAH and provides an overview of clinical challenges and future therapies.

### Voice characteristics in women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^1149F9ud]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder resulting in a lack of cortisol and often aldosterone, with an overproduction of androgens. Raised levels of androgens can lead to increased mass in the laryngeal tissues, potentially lowering the fundamental frequency (F0) of the voice.

- **Design/Patients**: A follow-up study involving 38 women with CAH and 24 age-matched controls (aged 18 to 63 years) used subjective self-ratings of voice symptoms, along with acoustic and perceptual analyses. The results were correlated to mutation and treatment.

- **Measurements**: Subjects rated the degree of hoarseness, dark voice, voice problems, and vocal fatigue on visual analogue scales. Audio recordings of a standard reading passage were made in a sound-treated booth. Acoustic analyses were conducted on the subjects' mean, minimum, and maximum F0 in the habitual speech range. Three voice clinicians performed perceptual evaluations of dark voice in terms of timbre.

- **Results**: Women with CAH rated higher values than controls regarding the statement 'my voice is a problem in my daily life'. They spoke with significantly lower mean, lower minimum, and lower maximum F0, as well as darker voice quality compared to the controls. Affected voice symptoms were associated with a late diagnosis or problems with medication.

- **Conclusion**: The voices in women with CAH can become virilized due to late diagnosis or suboptimal treatment with glucocorticoids. These voice problems may warrant referral for voice assessment and should be considered when treating CAH.

### Pubertal delay, hypokalemia, and hypertension caused by a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^116r7N3z]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

A 17-year-old female presented with diffuse muscle weakness secondary to severe hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypertension. Additional findings included delayed puberty with primary amenorrhea. Laboratory evaluation led to a diagnosis of 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (P450c17) deficiency, a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Her symptoms and metabolic derangements improved with glucocorticoid replacement to suppress ACTH production and mineralocorticoid excess, although she continues to require antihypertensive therapy. Estrogen replacement was initiated due to sex hormone insufficiency. This rare disorder should be considered when evaluating patients with pubertal delay and hypertension, particularly if there is associated hypokalemia.

### Management of adolescents with congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^112uWk1F]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

The management of congenital adrenal hyperplasia involves suppression of adrenal androgen production, in addition to treatment of adrenal insufficiency. Management of adolescents with congenital adrenal hyperplasia is especially challenging because changes in the hormonal milieu during puberty can lead to inadequate suppression of adrenal androgens, psychosocial issues often affect adherence to medical therapy, and sexual function plays a major part in adolescence and young adulthood. For these reasons, treatment regimen reassessment is indicated during adolescence. Patients with non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia require reassessment regarding the need for glucocorticoid drug treatment. No clinical trials have compared various regimens for classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia in adults; thus, therapy is individualized and based on the prevention of adverse outcomes.

Extensive patient education is key during the transition from pediatric care to adult care and should include education of females with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia regarding their genital anatomy and surgical history. Common issues for these patients include urinary incontinence, vaginal stenosis, clitoral pain, and cosmetic concerns; for males with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, common issues include testicular adrenal rest tumors. Transition from pediatric to adult care is most successful when phased over many years. Education of health-care providers on how to successfully transition patients is greatly needed.

### Clinical manifestations and challenges in adolescent and adult females with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^111dDM1M]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The treatment of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) consists of life-long replacement with glucocorticoids and, when indicated, mineralocorticoids such as fludrocortisone. Glucocorticoid replacement therapy reduces androgen excess by inhibiting adrenocorticotropin. In girls and women with CAH, the treatment goals include avoiding adrenal crisis and sudden death, ensuring normal growth and development, achieving normal bone maturation and timing of puberty, and preventing symptoms of hyperandrogenism, infertility, and long-term complications like cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and fractures. Additionally, good cognitive development, self-esteem, and quality of life are crucial, as these may pose specific issues for these women.

- **Clinical symptoms management**: Symptoms of undertreatment, such as fatigue, hyperandrogenic symptoms, anovulation, salt-craving, and orthostatic hypotension, as well as overtreatment symptoms like inhibited growth, weight gain, loss of bone mass, and hypertension, must be monitored continuously. Good disease control is particularly important during puberty, to optimize fertility, and during pregnancy. Serum levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), androstenedione, and testosterone are used for monitoring glucocorticoid treatment, whereas sodium, potassium, and renin are monitored for mineralocorticoid treatment.

### Caring for patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia throughout the lifespan [^112MgirR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting cortisol and aldosterone biosynthesis, which can lead to virilization in fetuses with a 46, XX karyotype. A 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of CAH, accounting for 90–99% of all patients with the condition. The management of patients with CAH should be conducted by a multidisciplinary team to address all complex components of their care throughout their lifespans. Many multidisciplinary teams have adopted shared decision-making approaches to genital surgery in which parents and patients can be part of the decision-making process. Continued research is needed to best serve these patients throughout their lifespans.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia-current insights in pathophysiology, diagnostics, and management [^115L4XZZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders affecting cortisol biosynthesis. Reduced activity of an enzyme required for cortisol production leads to chronic overstimulation of the adrenal cortex and accumulation of precursors proximal to the blocked enzymatic step. The most common form of CAH is caused by steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency due to mutations in CYP21A2. Since the last publication summarizing CAH in Endocrine Reviews in 2000, there have been numerous new developments, including a more detailed understanding of steroidogenic pathways, refinements in neonatal screening, improved diagnostic measurements utilizing chromatography and mass spectrometry coupled with steroid profiling, and improved genotyping methods. Clinical trials of alternative medications and modes of delivery have been recently completed or are underway. Genetic and cell-based treatments are being explored. A large body of data concerning long-term outcomes in patients affected by CAH, including psychosexual well-being, has been enhanced by the establishment of disease registries. This review provides the reader with insights into CAH with special attention to these new developments.

### Genetics and pathophysiology of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^117TTxVh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive disease that manifests clinically in varying forms depending on the degree of enzyme deficiency. CAH is most commonly caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) due to mutations in the CYP21A2 gene. Whereas there is a spectrum of disease severity, 21OHD is generally categorized into three forms:

- **Classic form**: Encompasses salt-wasting and simple virilizing CAH. This form of 21OHD occurs in approximately 1 in 16,000 births, with the most severe salt-wasting cases presenting in the neonatal period with cortisol and aldosterone deficiencies and virilization of external female genitalia. Cortisol deficiency removes normal feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to elevations in ACTH and adrenal androgen levels, which often accelerate skeletal maturation and lead to premature epiphyseal growth plate closure. Supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids are necessary to suppress androgen levels, adversely affecting final adult height.

- **Nonclassic form**: This is the least affected form and is termed nonclassic CAH.

This paper highlights a brief history of 21OHD and provides an overview of the genetic basis and pathophysiology of 21OHD.

Regarding the medical management of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, particularly in the context of non-classic CAH, the 2018 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend considering hydrocortisone stress dosing for patients undergoing major surgery, experiencing trauma, or during childbirth. This is advised if the cortisol response to cosyntropin or iatrogenic adrenal suppression is suboptimal, specifically when levels are below 14–18 mcg/dL or 400–500 nmol/L.

### The classic and nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasias [^116Thygh]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Adrenal Scientific Committee has developed a series of articles to update members on the genetics of adrenal diseases.

- **Methods**: Case presentation, discussion of literature, table, and bullet point conclusions.

- **Results**: The congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) syndromes are autosomal recessive defects in cortisol biosynthesis. The phenotype of each CAH patient depends on the defective enzyme and the severity of the defect. Clinical manifestations derive from both a failure to synthesize hormones distal to the enzymatic block and consequences from cortisol precursor accumulation proximal to the block, often with diversion to other biologically active steroids. The most common form of CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, occurring in the classic form in 1 in 16,000 newborns and a milder or nonclassic form in at least 1 in 1,000 people.

This article reviews the various forms of CAH and pitfalls in the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency presenting as adrenal incidentaloma: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111YY8Ex]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Adrenal incidentalomas (AIs) may be due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) resulting from homozygous CYP21A2 mutations or potentially from heterozygous carrier status. It remains unclear whether genetic or biochemical testing of CYP21A2 status in AI is justified, despite its potential to prevent adrenal crises for those referred for adrenalectomy.

- **Methods**: We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE for articles published up to October 19, 2015, including terms associated with adrenal tumors and CAH. Meta-analyses estimated the CAH or carrier prevalence in AI and assessed clinical factors that may guide testing.

- **Results**: Thirty-six publications were included. Among AI patients biochemically screened for CAH, 58 out of 990 (5.9%) were diagnosed with CAH. Genetic screening of all AIs revealed only 2 out of 252 (0.8%) with clear CAH. The carrier prevalence was 10.2% (36/352). The rate of 0.8% (8/1,000) genetically confirmed CAH is higher than the 1/15,000 affected by classic CAH or 1/1,000 by nonclassic CAH in the Caucasian population. The rate of heterozygous CYP21A2 mutation frequency is similar to those reported in population studies. Levels of both basal and stimulated 17-hydroxyprogesterone positively correlated with AI diameter. Although bilateral incidentalomas were frequent in CAH, their presence did not predict CYP21A2 status.

- **Conclusion**: The presence of an AI does not increase the probability of detecting CAH or CYP21A2 carrier status to the extent that routine genetic testing is justified. Screening with 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels appears to lack specificity in the diagnosis.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^117Aqdue]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

We developed clinical practice guidelines for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).

- **Participants**: The Task Force included a chair selected by The Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS), ten additional clinicians experienced in treating CAH, a methodologist, and a medical writer. Additional experts were also consulted. The authors received no corporate funding or remuneration.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions. The guidelines were reviewed and approved sequentially by The Endocrine Society's CGS and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

- **Conclusions**: We recommend universal newborn screening for severe steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency, followed by confirmatory tests. We recommend that prenatal treatment of CAH continue to be regarded as experimental. The diagnosis rests on clinical and hormonal data; genotyping is reserved for equivocal cases and genetic counseling. Glucocorticoid dosage should be minimized to avoid iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome. Mineralocorticoids and, in infants, supplemental sodium are recommended in classic CAH patients. We recommend against the routine use of experimental therapies to promote growth and delay puberty; we suggest patients avoid adrenalectomy. Surgical guidelines emphasize early single-stage genital repair for severely virilized girls, performed by experienced surgeons. Clinicians should consider patients' individual needs and circumstances when choosing treatment options.

*Figure 1.* Suggested diagnostic algorithm for CAH in the neonatal period. Note that these suggestions include fewer labs than guidelines recommend. Many neonates, particularly premature babies, cannot have a complete adrenocortical profile drawn as suggested by guidelines due to blood volume limitations. For premature infants or small for gestational age infants with abnormal newborn screens and/or those with repeatedly minimal elevated 17-OHP values, we suggest periodic 17-OHP draws until normal or until the value meets criteria for additional workup based on the algorithm. These are suggested labs when blood draw volume limits a complete adrenocortical profile and will evaluate for the most common causes of CAH, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency. ‡A negative newborn screen or normal 17-OHP does not rule out CAH due to other enzymatic defects; if there are signs/symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, additional evaluation should be performed. Note that not all regions have a second newborn screen.

Fetal adrenal steroidogenesis is unique from adults. The fetal adrenal gland comprises an inner fetal zone and an outer adult zone. In term infants, the ratio of the fetal to adult zone is 4:1. However, the ratio is higher in premature infants, as the permanent zone matures later in gestation.
