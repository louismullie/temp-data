## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage severe pain after a motor vehicle collision with bilateral hip fractures in a 48-year-old male who remains in severe pain despite an opioid injection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate reassessment and safety. Then, I should verify the adequacy of the current opioid regimen and whether dose escalation is appropriate. Next, I will consider regional anesthesia options and their evidence base. After that, I need to implement a multimodal non-opioid foundation. I will then evaluate NSAID use and fracture-healing concerns. I should also review special populations such as chronic opioid use or opioid use disorder. Finally, I will outline perioperative planning, nonpharmacologic strategies, and discharge opioid stewardship with risk mitigation, while continuously checking for contraindications and monitoring needs throughout.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: reassess pain severity, vitals, neurovascular status, and screen for red flags such as compartment syndrome, expanding hematoma, or neurologic deficits, because severe pain out of proportion to expected injury warrants urgent evaluation for complications and may change analgesic choices or urgency of intervention. I should double-check the exact opioid dose and timing already given, clarify whether the patient is opioid-naive or tolerant, and document pain scores at rest and with movement to guide escalation and track response, since movement-related pain is typically more intense in hip fractures and drives functional impairment [^112fy8ze] [^115WLTAR].

> Wait, let me verify the opioid strategy before escalating. If the patient is opioid-naive and received a standard parenteral dose such as 5–10 mg IV morphine, it may be insufficient for severe fracture pain; guidelines support cautious titration with small, frequent increments while monitoring for sedation and respiratory depression, and in older adults or those at risk, dose reductions of about 25–50% are advised, though at 48 years he is not elderly and may tolerate standard adult dosing with vigilance [^116hYAa1] [^113JxhyQ]. I should confirm whether a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) option is available, as PCA with short-acting agents like fentanyl can provide effective, titratable relief while maintaining alertness in selected patients, particularly when incident pain is prominent and fixed-interval boluses are inadequate [^115T8k2m].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about opioids alone; regional anesthesia is a cornerstone here. I need to check for contraindications to peripheral nerve blocks such as overlying infection, allergy to local anesthetics, or significant coagulopathy, and if none are present, proceed with a fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) or femoral nerve block (FNB), ideally ultrasound-guided for accuracy and safety, because these blocks reduce pain on movement within 30 minutes and decrease opioid requirements and delirium risk in hip fracture patients [^115WLTAR] [^112uHBCj] [^113kwiPH]. Let me consider newer options too; a pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block may outperform suprainguinal FICB for pain reduction and respiratory complications in elderly hip fracture patients, and while evidence is emerging, it is reasonable to involve acute pain or regional anesthesia specialists early for advanced techniques if available [^114JpbPT] [^111wGMwV].

> I should confirm the multimodal foundation next. Scheduled acetaminophen 1 g every 6 hours is first-line and opioid-sparing; if enteral absorption is uncertain, IV acetaminophen can be used initially, and I need to ensure total daily acetaminophen dose stays within safe limits to avoid hepatotoxicity, especially if combination products are used [^115ProLb] [^112uXayQ]. Let me also consider gabapentinoids for neuropathic components and perioperative anxiolysis, but I must avoid sedative co-administration that increases fall and respiratory risk, particularly benzodiazepines with opioids, and I should screen for drug–drug interactions that amplify CNS depression before adding agents [^112xRTKB].

> Next, I should review NSAIDs carefully. Ketorolac 15–30 mg IV can meaningfully reduce pain and opioid consumption after traumatic fractures without clear increase in nonunion risk in the acute setting, though I need to check for renal impairment, GI bleeding risk, and anticoagulation status before use, and I should avoid NSAIDs in patients with CKD, active peptic ulcer disease, or high bleeding risk; the fracture nonunion concern is largely based on observational and conflicting data, and guidelines conditionally support short-course NSAID use when benefits outweigh risks [^114FtZQ8] [^116ovdwJ] [^1124bCwg]. But wait, what if healing is a priority and risk is high? In that case, I should favor acetaminophen, regional anesthesia, and judicious opioids, and revisit NSAIDs once the acute severe pain window passes or if regional techniques are contraindicated [^1124bCwg].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. If the patient is on chronic opioids or has opioid use disorder, I should confirm his baseline regimen and consider continuation with close monitoring, anticipate higher opioid requirements, and coordinate with addiction specialists; for patients on buprenorphine, strategies include using full mu-agonists for breakthrough pain while maintaining buprenorphine, or in select cases switching to methadone perioperatively with a plan to transition back, all with careful inpatient oversight and discharge planning to avoid withdrawal or uncontrolled pain [^1131bPUk] [^116NniJd]. Hold on, I should verify whether he is on naltrexone; if so, I need to plan for its discontinuation 48–72 hours preoperatively if feasible or consider alternative strategies in consultation with pain and addiction services [^115pDsDH].

> Let me consider perioperative planning because pain control and timing of surgery are intertwined. Early operative fixation within 24–48 hours is associated with improved pain control, fewer complications, and shorter length of stay when medically safe, so I should expedite surgical consultation and preoperative optimization while maintaining multimodal analgesia and regional blocks to facilitate positioning and reduce preoperative opioid exposure [^114nD76G] [^116VwFjh] [^116cATT2]. I should confirm anesthesia plans; both spinal and general anesthesia are acceptable, and regional techniques can be continued intra- and postoperatively to sustain analgesia and reduce systemic opioid needs [^112XqvAR] [^114jBAFh].

> I will now examine nonpharmacologic strategies that synergize with medications. Proper limb alignment, splinting or traction when indicated, ice, and psychologically informed physical therapy timing around medication peaks can reduce pain during mobilization; early mobilization itself is protective against complications, so I should coordinate with PT to medicate 20–30 minutes before therapy and use cue-based pain assessment if needed [^117PFdYS] [^114p72Y5]. Let me reconsider traction; while skeletal traction can aid pain in femoral shaft or acetabular fractures, it is less commonly used for isolated hip fractures, so I should align this with the fracture pattern and surgical plan rather than applying traction reflexively.

> Next, I should review discharge planning and opioid stewardship. I need to calculate 24-hour inpatient opioid requirements to guide a short, tapering outpatient prescription, avoid automatic refill, and screen for risk of persistent use using validated tools or clinical judgment; for high-risk patients, co-prescribe naloxone and provide education on safe storage and disposal, with a plan for early follow-up to reassess pain and function [^113P6tBa] [^115fx3ZA] [^111uqd7K]. Hold on, I should verify that we are not inadvertently sending the patient home with combination opioids that obscure acetaminophen or NSAID dosing; when possible, prescribe opioids separately to avoid confusion and overdose of the non-opioid component [^115fx3ZA].

> Putting this together, my immediate action is to reassess pain and vitals, then place an ultrasound-guided regional block (FICB, FNB, or PENG) if no contraindications, while initiating scheduled acetaminophen and adding a short-acting opioid with careful titration or PCA for breakthrough/incident pain; if pain remains refractory, I should add ketorolac after screening for renal, GI, and bleeding risks, and escalate opioids only with vigilant monitoring for sedation and respiratory depression, all while arranging urgent surgical consultation for early fixation and continuing multimodal analgesia perioperatively [^115WLTAR] [^112uHBCj] [^115ProLb] [^114FtZQ8] [^114nD76G]. I should double-check at each step for contraindications, reassess pain within 30–60 minutes after interventions, and adjust the plan dynamically based on response and patient-specific risks to balance analgesia with safety and functional recovery [^111ygQdE] [^116vTb6R].

For a 48-year-old male with severe hip fracture pain despite opioid injection, implement a **multimodal analgesic regimen** [^112GxytJ] with scheduled acetaminophen [^115ProLb], NSAIDs if no contraindications [^114FtZQ8], and a regional nerve block (fascia iliaca or femoral) [^112uHBCj] for rapid, opioid-sparing relief [^114p72Y5]. If pain persists, use **patient-controlled analgesia** with short-acting opioids (e.g. fentanyl) [^115T8k2m] and titrate to effect, monitoring for sedation and respiratory depression [^116hYAa1]. Address contraindications (renal, GI, bleeding risk) before NSAIDs [^112xRTKB], and consider ketamine or dexmedetomidine in refractory cases. Early regional anesthesia and multimodal therapy reduce opioid requirements, improve mobility, and lower complication risk [^115WLTAR] [^112uHBCj].

---

## Multimodal analgesic regimen

Multimodal analgesia combines different drug classes and techniques to target distinct pain pathways, thereby improving pain control while reducing opioid use and adverse effects [^114EKAEE].

---

### Acetaminophen (paracetamol)

- **Mechanism**: Central COX inhibition and serotonergic modulation.
- **Dosing**: 1 g IV/PO every 6 hours; max 4 g/day.
- **Benefits**: Opioid-sparing, low adverse-effect profile, safe in most patients [^115ProLb].

---

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

- **Mechanism**: Peripheral COX inhibition, reducing inflammation and prostaglandin-mediated pain [^111V5mup].
- **Options**: Ibuprofen 600 mg PO TID or ketorolac 15–30 mg IV q6h (short-term only).
- **Benefits**: Significant opioid-sparing effect; improves mobility and reduces opioid-related adverse effects [^114swZEV].
- **Risks**: GI bleeding, renal impairment, bleeding risk; avoid in patients with renal disease, peptic ulcer disease, or coagulopathy [^notfound].

---

### Regional anesthesia (nerve blocks)

Regional anesthesia provides **targeted analgesia** with minimal systemic effects and is strongly recommended for hip fracture pain [^112uHBCj].

| **Block type** | **Coverage** | **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) | Femoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, obturator nerves | - Rapid pain relief <br/> - Reduced opioid use <br/> - Improved mobility <br/> - Lower delirium risk [^115WLTAR] | - Femoral nerve injury <br/> - Local anesthetic toxicity <br/> - Infection (rare) [^111wGMwV] |
| Femoral nerve block (FNB) | Femoral nerve | - Effective for anterior hip pain <br/> - Reduced opioid requirements <br/> - Improved postoperative mobility [^117YKyab] | - Femoral nerve injury <br/> - Local anesthetic toxicity <br/> - Infection (rare) [^111wGMwV] |
| Pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block | Articular branches of femoral and accessory obturator nerves | - Superior analgesia for intracapsular fractures <br/> - Preserves motor function <br/> - Reduced opioid use [^114JpbPT] | - Local anesthetic toxicity <br/> - Infection (rare) [^111wGMwV] |

---

Regional blocks should be performed by trained personnel with **ultrasound guidance** to maximize efficacy and safety [^113kwiPH].

---

## Adjunctive pharmacological interventions

If multimodal therapy is insufficient, consider **adjunctive agents**:

- **Ketamine**: Low-dose infusion (0.1–0.3 mg/kg/h) for refractory pain; monitor for hallucinations and hypertension.
- **Dexmedetomidine**: Alpha-2 agonist infusion for analgesia and anxiolysis; monitor for bradycardia and hypotension.
- **Gabapentinoids**: Gabapentin or pregabalin for neuropathic pain; monitor for sedation and dizziness [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological measures enhance analgesia and reduce opioid needs:

- **Physical therapy**: Early mobilization with proper limb alignment and assistive devices [^115h8dKX].
- **Psychological support**: Cognitive-behavioral strategies and relaxation techniques [^114P6qgk].
- **Positioning and immobilization**: Proper limb alignment and splinting to reduce pain [^114p72Y5].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

Continuous monitoring is essential to balance analgesia with safety:

- **Pain assessment**: Regular pain scores (NRS/VAS) at rest and during movement [^117PCeAQ].
- **Respiratory monitoring**: Pulse oximetry and frequent vital checks during opioid titration [^notfound].
- **Neurological monitoring**: Assess for regional block complications (nerve injury, local anesthetic toxicity) [^111ygQdE].
- **Renal and hepatic function**: Monitor for NSAID- and acetaminophen-related toxicity [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acetaminophen | First-line | - Opioid-sparing <br/> - Safe | Hepatotoxicity at high doses |
| NSAIDs | No contraindications | - Opioid-sparing <br/> - Improved mobility | - GI bleeding <br/> - Renal impairment |
| Regional anesthesia | Severe pain | - Rapid relief <br/> - Reduced opioids <br/> - Improved mobility | - Nerve injury <br/> - Infection |
| Ketamine/Dexmedetomidine | Refractory pain | Effective adjuncts | Sedation, cardiovascular effects |
| Physical therapy | Early mobilization | Improved function, reduced pain | Minimal |

---

A multimodal approach with regional anesthesia is the most effective strategy for severe hip fracture pain refractory to opioids. This approach **reduces opioid requirements**, improves mobility, and lowers complication risk.

Hip fractures pose significant challenges, particularly in managing severe incident pain in people who are not fit for surgery. We present the case of an older man with multiple comorbidities who was managed non-operatively. Standard opioids caused sedation with limited pain relief. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with intravenous fentanyl provided effective, short-acting relief, allowing the patient to remain alert and engage in care. This case highlights PCA as a practical option for managing incident pain in selected palliative patients.

Early management of pain

Only a minority of elderly patients with hip fracture receive adequate analgesia prior to arrival at hospital. Oberkirche et al found that 72% of patients received no prehospital analgesia, despite all of the patients in the study reporting significant pain at first assessment.

In this study, by contrast, the administration of prehospital analgesia was found to significantly relieve pain at the time of arrival to hospital, without meaningful side effects. High levels of early pain correlate with increased complications, possibly due to immobilization as a result of pain.

Opioid analgesia dominates current pain management regimens in hip fracture and is recommended for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pain as part of the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder, as an adjunct to oral paracetamol. Given that an estimated two-thirds of patients with hip fracture experience moderate-to-severe pain, opioid analgesics are widely used perioperatively to manage both baseline and breakthrough pain.

Due to the elderly nature of patients presenting with hip fracture, physicians are often reluctant to prescribe opioids for fear of side effects. Closs et al and Feldt et al have found that 61.3% of older orthopedic patients were given less than 25% of their prescribed opioid analgesics during the first 48 hours after surgery, no patients received > 50% of their prescribed opioids, and patients aged ≥ 65 years hospitalized for a hip fracture received < 25% of the mean amount of opioid analgesics prescribed.

Additionally, Feldt et al reported 66.1% of patients received ≤ 50% of their prescribed nonopioid analgesics.

Although the deleterious effects and the poor delivery of opioids are transparent, the literature regarding the use of paracetamol for perioperative pain in hip fracture is comparatively scarce. There are no placebo-controlled trials investigating the efficacy of preoperative administration of paracetamol in this patient group, as it is considered "unethical" by the NICE in view of the perceived severity of pain experienced by patients with hip fracture, particularly on movement. However, given the reluctance of some health-care professionals to administer IV morphine prior to diagnosis, this may be an argument for the prehospital period being the ideal opportunity for such a trial.

The existing evidence base regarding the impact of paracetamol on this vulnerable group with unique analgesia requirements has been described as "low-to-moderate quality". This poor evidence underpins the management of patients with complex medical needs, difficulty in pain assessment, and substantial potentially modifiable societal costs. We aim to review the current evidence regarding the efficacy and extent of use of paracetamol, particularly intravenously (IV) and prehospital, as this is highlighted as an area lacking in evidence by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines. We will describe methods used to assess pain and detail how they can be used to optimize care and assessment of pain interventions. The literature identified by NICE suggests that intravenous paracetamol (IVP) may be advantageous when compared to morphine and nerve block analgesia regimens.

### Acute pain management after trauma: what you need to know [^114X9juv]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Effective acute pain control is mandatory after injury. Opioids continue to be a pillar acute pain management of strategies despite not being as effective as some nonnarcotic alternatives. An acute pain management strategy after trauma should be thoughtful, effective, and responsible. A thoughtful approach includes managing a patient's expectations for acute pain control and ensuring that interventions purposefully and rationally affect the domain of pain that is uncontrolled. An effective pain management strategy includes a multimodal approach using acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and regional anesthesia. A responsible acute pain management approach includes knowing the relative strengths of the opioids prescribed and standardized approach to opioid prescribing at discharge to minimize diversion. Acute pain management is quite understudied, and future considerations include a reliable objective measurement of pain and the evaluation of nonmedication acute pain interventions.

Results

The Assessment of Pain

A comprehensive multidimensional assessment of patients presenting with hip fracture should be undertaken preoperatively. This assessment should routinely include nutritional, cognitive, frailty, and pain assessments.

A number of barriers have been identified that can make the assessment of pain in the hip fracture demographic challenging. These include, but are not limited to:
Absence of a standardized, "gold-standard", pain intensity tool suitable for elderly patients.
Assumption that pain is a "normal part of aging" or that the "elderly patients feel less pain".,
Sensory and/or cognitive impairment of patients.–
Age-related stoicism and reticence to report and quantify pain.

Additionally, Zanker et al identified the inability to offer analgesics until diagnosis as the primary barrier to pain control in the emergency setting, followed by the lack of understanding of the pharmacology of analgesia by health-care professionals.

### Current challenges in pain management in hip fracture patients [^111qjpHQ]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2016). Low credibility.

The high incidence of hip fracture, together with considerable associated morbidity, mortality, and cost of care, makes this injury a major clinical challenge. Of particular importance is the pain associated with hip fracture, which can have potentially severe consequences and may lead to delayed recovery. The prevailing opioid-dependent model of analgesia, however, presents multiple drawbacks and risks that can compromise outcomes in the hip fracture population. The pain management process has essential preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative components, yet data on the comparative effectiveness of different pain management interventions in patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture are not clear cut. A Cochrane database review that included 83 different pain management studies indicated that there are not enough well-designed studies to show unequivocally which pain management approaches work well after hip fracture surgery. Yet a growing body of data on certain interventions, such as nerve blocks and multimodal analgesia, supports consideration of these options.

Conclusions

Surgical treatment of geriatric hip fractures in 24 hours or less from the time of ED presentation is achievable and was associated with reduced inpatient opiate use. Establishing institutional TTOR goals as part of an interdisciplinary hip fracture co-management clinical pathway can facilitate prompt care and contribute to recovery in these patients with highly morbid injuries.

### Pain relief management following proximal femoral fractures: options, issues and controversies [^11167bpq]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

The majority of proximal femoral fractures occur in the elderly population. Safe and adequate pain relief is an integral part of the overall management of hip fractures. Inherent difficulties in the assessment of pain in elderly need to be taken into account and unique considerations should be made regarding the effective analgesia due to different elderly physiology, and their response to trauma and subsequent surgery. The pain management should start as soon as possible and special emphasis should be paid to contemporary methods of regional anaesthesia whilst a multimodal approach should be adopted in the perioperative period. The present review summarises the contemporary treatment options and controversies pertaining to the management of pain in elderly patients with proximal femoral fractures.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of hip fractures in older adults [^114nD76G]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Surgical timing in older adults with hip fracture — hip fracture surgery within 24–48 hours of admission may be associated with better outcomes, with Quality of Evidence: Low and Strength of Recommendation: Moderate (Upgraded). The majority of studies favored improved outcomes in regard to pain, complications, and length of stay with decreased time to surgery. After controlling for patient comorbidities, the influence of delay to surgery on mortality was mixed but increased delay was in general associated with increased mortality. The studies varied on the optimal time frame from admission to surgery (24 hours to 4 days); however, the majority favored surgery within 24–48 hours. There is minimal harm in adopting early surgical timing of hip fractures, and decreasing time to surgery decreases cost and health care resources. Intervention has been used extensively and has been proven feasible, while decreased time to surgery from admission should always be the goal, in some cases this target may not be met due to patient comorbidities, or factors related to the medical center (staffing, OR availability, surgeon availability, medical sub-specialist availability). Evidence from one or more "Low" quality studies with consistent findings or evidence from a single "Moderate" quality study recommending for or against the intervention, and the recommendation was upgraded based on EtD framework.

### Multimodal analgesia in the hip fracture patient [^114EKAEE]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2016). Low credibility.

Hip fracture is one of the most common injuries among the elderly and, because the population is aging, it is expected to remain a major clinical challenge and public health problem for the foreseeable future. The clinical importance of early mobilization and prompt participation in physical therapy after hip fracture surgery is now widely recognized. Because postoperative pain can impair mobility and delay physical therapy, much attention is now being paid to finding more effective ways of controlling pain after hip fracture. Oversedation with opioid drugs inhibits communication between the patient and the health care team, can delay ambulation and rehabilitation therapy, and may increase the probability of the patient requiring a skilled nursing facility, which adds further cost to the overall health care system. Multiple pain pathways contribute to the perception of postoperative pain, and although opioids are highly effective in blocking nociceptive pain through inhibition of the mu receptors, they do not block other pain pathways. Multimodal analgesia involves the use of several anesthetic and analgesic modalities that are strategically combined to block pain perception at different sites in the peripheral and central nervous systems. This balanced, multifaceted approach provides more effective control of postoperative pain than opioid drugs alone, allows lower doses of opioids to be used as part of the multimodal regimen (thereby reducing the risk of opioid-related adverse events and complications), and may facilitate more rapid recovery and improve certain outcome measures related to recovery time. One prospective randomized study evaluating the clinical value of multimodal pain management in elderly patients undergoing bipolar hip hemiarthroplasty found that a multimodal regimen, including preemptive pain medication and intraoperative periarticular injections, reduced pain on postoperative days 1 and 4, and reduced overall opioid use. This article describes an effective multimodal pain management regimen for hip fracture patients.

### Analgesia in hip fractures. Do fascia-iliac blocks make any difference? [^113v3tQR]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

The fascia-iliac block is a relatively new component of the hip fracture analgesia armament. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends the use of simple oral analgesia including opioids, with fascia-iliac blocks used as an adjunct. Small scale studies have suggested superior analgesic effect with pre-operative fascia-iliac blocks. Fascia-iliac blocks provided superior analgesia to intramuscular morphine in a randomised controlled trial of 48 hip fracture patients. The analgesic effects were significant both at rest and 15 degree flexion of the hip. In a different study, 24/30 patients who received a FIB were able to assume a semi-recumbent position pre-operatively due to improved hip flexion which provided comfort whilst waiting for surgical intervention. FIB allows for ease of lateral patient positioning in the anaesthetic room prior to induction of spinal anaesthesia when compared to intravenous alfentanil. Spinal induction was achieved more quickly and patients found this method more acceptable. FIB significantly reduced the incidence of delirium in intermediate risk patients.

The fascia-iliac block is a safe and simple technique that can be administered by junior doctors, A&E personnel, and specialist pain nurses with training. Knowledge of the local anatomy and use of the landmark technique should almost eliminate the potential for intraneural or intravascular local anaesthetic administration. Single shot fascia-iliac blocks administered in the emergency department by an emergency physician provided significant decrease in pain from 15 minutes - 8 hours post block when compared to standard parenteral medications. Post block analgesic requirements for patients in the FIB group were minimal.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^117HNFaU]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Geriatric hip fracture — injury assessment, imaging, timing, anesthesia, and fracture categorization emphasize early suspicion and coordinated care: when a geriatric patient presents with severe hip pain, particularly following a fall, a hip fracture should be suspected, and a thorough history and physical examination should be performed with evaluation for concurrent injuries; early consultation with an inpatient medical or geriatric specialist may be beneficial, geriatric specialists or hospitalists may help streamline preoperative testing and serve as an effective liaison to the anesthesia team, and a well-coordinated and multidisciplinary approach is encouraged; diagnosis is typically evident on standard radiographic assessment, and when a hip fracture is suspected in the setting of normal radiographs, it is recommended that additional imaging (for example, MRI) be obtained to evaluate for the presence of a nondisplaced fracture; once diagnosed, patients are typically admitted, medically optimized, and should be surgically treated as soon as able, preferably within 48 hours; there is strong evidence that regional anesthesia improves perioperative management in patients with hip fracture and may reduce postoperative delirium and cardiac events; geriatric fractures of the proximal femur broadly fall into three categories: femoral neck fractures, intertrochanteric fractures, and subtrochanteric fractures.

Multimodal analgesia — hip fracture pain management: Multimodal analgesia incorporating preoperative nerve block is recommended to treat pain after hip fracture, with Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Regional anesthesia techniques including fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) or femoral nerve block (FNB) were associated with decreased pain severity compared to control and with decreased requirements for parenteral analgesia versus control; however, results varied with regard to the association between regional anesthesia receipt and adverse outcomes, and findings were inconsistent across studies reviewed. One high-quality study observed improved recovery of ambulation at post-operative day 3 and at 6 weeks with regional anesthesia; in one high-quality study, analgesic requirements and rates of nausea were lower with FNB vs FICB, and one high-quality study found better pain control and lower systemic analgesic requirements with intra-articular hip injection vs preoperative FICB.

### Fascia-iliaca compartment block vs intra-articular hip injection for preoperative pain management in intracapsular hip fractures: a blind, randomized, controlled trial [^115Mnzqf]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to compare the fascia-iliaca compartment block and the intra-articular hip injection in terms of pain management and the need for additional systemic analgesia in the preoperative phase of intracapsular hip fractures.

Methods

Patients > 65 years old with an intracapsular hip fracture were randomized in this prospective, blind, controlled, parallel trial in a Level-I trauma center. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the fascia-iliaca compartment block (cohort FICB) or the intra-articular hip injection (cohort IAHI) upon admission to the emergency department. The primary outcome was pain relief at 20min, 12h, 24h and 48h after the regional anesthesia, both at rest and during internal rotation of the fractured limb. The Numeric Rating Scale was used. Residual pain was managed with the same protocol in all patients. Additional analgesic drug administration during the 48h from admission was recorded.

Results

A total of 120 patients with comparable baseline characteristics were analyzed in this study: the FICB group consisted of 70 subjects, while the IAHI group consisted of 50 subjects. Pain was significantly lower in the IAHI group during movement of the fractured limb at 20min (p < 0.05), 12h (p < 0.05), 24h (p < 0.05) and 48h (p < 0.05). In the FICB cohort 72.9% of patients needed to take oxycodone, in contrast to 28.6% of the IAHI cohort (p < 0.05). In the FICB cohort 14.09 ± 11.57mg of oxycodone was administered, while in the IAHI cohort 4.38 ± 7.63mg (p < 0.05). No adverse events related to either technique were recorded.

Conclusions

Intra-articular hip injection provides better pre-operatory pain management in elder patients with intracapsular hip fractures compared to the fascia-iliaca compartment block. It also reduced the need for supplementary systemic analgesia.

### Postacute management of older adults suffering an osteoporotic hip fracture: a consensus statement from the international geriatric fracture society [^114P6qgk]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Pain Control

A multimodal pain regimen should be started in every patient at the time of arrival to a PAC facility. Pain regimen treatments should include nonpharmacologic and pharmacological modalities.

Perioperative pain control is an important component on the management of geriatric patients following a hip fracture. The American College of Surgeons endorsed the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery program which recommends the use of multimodal pain control in the perioperative period for geriatric patients. Similarly, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and IGFS recommend the same approach in their respective recommendations for the management of hip fractures in older adults. This approach to treat pain has not only shown efficacy in pain management but also reduction in opioid use and opioid-related side effects.

The American Medical Directors Association (AMDA) Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for Pain Management in Long-Term Care Setting offers a systematic approach to pain management. At the time of this publication, the above-mentioned CPG was being revised. One of the major challenges to achieve adequate pain control is lack of recognition by care providers. The presence of pain can present atypically in the older adults, especially those with dementia. Patients could present with restlessness, sleep disturbances, changes in mood, and changes in level of function. It is important to establish expectations regarding pain control with patients and families to avoid frustration and fear of participating in PT. Pharmacology treatment of acute pain always should start with the lowest effective dose of a medication and titrate rapidly.

A multimodal approach to pain control that starts in the hospital setting has led to improved outcomes without increase in complications or readmissions. The net benefit of these improved outcomes can be extrapolated from cardiac surgery patients in improving rehabilitation potential in older adults with hip fracture. Nonpharmacological approaches include application of heat and cold modalities, as well as other techniques such as relaxation, cushioning, and repositioning. Pharmacological approaches to pain control should include scheduled nonopiate medications, such as topical creams, patches, and scheduled acetaminophen, in addition to as needed opioids if not contraindicated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released in 2016 guidelines for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain in the United States. The guidelines are intended for primary care providers who need to treat chronic pain. The recommendations include special populations such as older adults which they identify as high risk for harm including falls and fractures. Contrariwise, the document also recognizes the risk associated with the use of nonopioid pharmacologic treatment in older adults. Overall, CDC recommends the use of opioids with caution and for the shortest time possible.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of hip fractures in older adults [^111ygQdE]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

AAOS hip fracture pain management — implementation considerations state that risks associated with pain treatment approaches are likely to vary across modalities and should be interpreted with regard to the risks of alternative treatments, such as opioids, and certain techniques, such as epidural anesthesia, may be contraindicated in the presence of anticoagulant therapy or coagulopathy; appropriate provider training, adequate monitoring for potential procedure-related complications, and availability of rescue medications is essential to ensuring patient safety. Treatment of pain represents a major priority for many hip fracture patients and their families, additional outcomes such as delirium and functional recovery may also carry substantial importance, and identified studies did not assess cost-effectiveness or resource utilization. Preoperative FNB and FICB both appear to be broadly acceptable to patients, FNB and FICB can be performed feasibly in emergency departments, perioperative care settings, and other hospital areas with appropriate provider training and access to necessary monitors and rescue treatments, and future research may focus on impacts on complications and patient-centered end-outcomes, additional research is needed to define optimal strategies for multimodal analgesia, and such research should evaluate impacts on complications and patient-centered end outcomes in addition to pain outcomes.

### Assessment and early management of pain in hip fractures: the impact of paracetamol [^116vTb6R]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study set out to provide a narrative review of the available literature evaluating the current assessment and management of acute pain in patients with hip fracture, focusing on the impact of paracetamol for the early management of pain. Several key themes were identified in review of the literature.

Hip fracture is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in older people in the United Kingdom and is expected to increase in scale as a burden on health care in the future. – Patients with hip fracture regularly experience severe pain on admission. The approach to management of this pain is often inconsistent and inadequate to achieve sufficient pain control, with significant side effects as a result of analgesic choice. Furthermore, many patients do not receive any analgesia prehospital.

Pain is often underappreciated in patients with hip fracture, with cognitive impairment cited as a barrier to effective assessment of pain. Cognitively intact patients often receive better pain management than those with some decline, the challenging nature of ongoing assessment being a contributing factor. Visual scales with verbal descriptors are felt to be preferential to the commonly used numerical scales in this patient group. Clinicians should also assess nonverbal communicators of pain if the patient struggles to self-report. A standardized pain intensity rating scale has been proposed, and the importance of repeated assessment following analgesic intervention has been stressed.

### Operative management of hip fractures within 24 hours in the elderly is achievable and associated with reduced opiate use [^112tBUdw]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

We sought to better understand 2 aspects of early surgical intervention that have not yet been fully addressed by existing literature and guidelines. Firstly, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of early operative intervention. While many retrospective cohort studies have dichotomized TTOR as 'early' and 'late', there is no pre-specified goal for TTOR. As a result, due to institutional, regional and national variation, the TTOR varies widely between studies. For example, in studies looking at TTOR < 24 hours, the percentage receiving surgery within this time ranges from 24–55%, In those looking at TTOR < 48-hours, percentages range from 31.2–84.6%. Secondly, we quantified opioid pain medication use in the acute care setting, and the impact of surgical timing on oral morphine equivalent (OME) exposure. Opioids are commonly employed in this setting, yet most studies do not measure total opioid use in the pre- and post-operative setting of geriatric hip fractures.

The primary outcomes of this study were: to measure the impact of early (≤ 24 hr) vs delayed (> 24 hr) TTOR on 1) hospital length of stay and 2) total and post-operative opiate use. Additional outcomes were: 1) the feasibility of reaching a prespecified target TTOR < 24 hrs and 2) to identify potentially preventable etiologies associated with delayed TTOR.

Especially in opioid-naïve patients, begin with low initial doses and titrate gradually to decrease the risk of overdose. Compared with dosing for a healthy adult, decrease the initial dose by 25% in 60-year-old patients and by 50% for 80-year-old patients, while administering at the same intervals. Oral opioid administration is preferred over parenteral opioid administration.

### Perioperative pain management intervention in older patients with hip fracture in an orthogeriatric unit. A controlled before / after study assessing an audit and feedback intervention (PAIN-AGE) [^115ProLb]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pain management in hip fractured patients poses a challenge to the healthcare teams. Postoperative pain has been identified as an unfavorable prognostic factor. Pain delays ambulation, extends hospital stay, reduces the probability of recovery, and finally increases risk of long-term functional impairment. Pre- and postoperative (perioperative) pain management is based on multimodal analgesia that consists of the use of several analgesic medications and techniques combined with non-pharmacological interventions. Multimodal analgesia improves perioperative pain management and reduces analgesic doses leading to a reduction in the incidence of adverse events.

Acetaminophen (or Paracetamol) is an effective analgesic for musculoskeletal pain and represents the front-line therapy for the management of pain in the geriatric population, especially during perioperative periods. Acetaminophen is safe despite old age and associated polypharmacy and polymorbidity. Acetaminophen is recommended as part of the multimodal analgesia. It is the only analgesic that brings a morphine-sparing effect compared to other analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Its systematic administration following a preestablished protocol is preferred to administration on demand. Older adults are more vulnerable to opioid-associated side effect and it is primordial to minimize their exposure to opioids. Acetaminophen increases the efficacy of oxycodone in adults confronted with acute moderate to severe perioperative pain. Acetaminophen is associated with reduced opioid use so we need to focus on acetaminophen use in first-line analgesia. Learned societies recommend assessment, prevention, and management of perioperative pain. Nurses play a crucial role in this perioperative pain management. By providing care to patients, they serve as the essential link between patients and physicians, ensuring the proper implementation of prescribed treatments.

Introduction

Globally over 1 million hip fractures occur annually, with the highest numbers occurring in Europe and North America. An aging population with an increased prevalence of bone fragility, who are better able to maintain activity level into old age, will drive the global cost of this injury up to $446 billion by 2050.

In the United Kingdom, an average of 65 000 patients attend hospital with hip fractures each year, representing the most common cause of admission to orthopedic wards. Burdened with significant comorbidities, at least one short-term complication is seen in half of this patient group. Characterizing the population, 20% to 25% of patients have moderate cognitive impairment consistent with delirium as assessed by the 4AT screening tool or a score less than 7 on the Abbreviated Mental Test Score. The tail of the comorbid burden does not end at the admitting unit as half of the patients are left with long-term disability and one-quarter require long-term nursing care. Despite significant progress in the structured delivery of care to this vulnerable patient group, 1-year mortality remains high at up to 30%. –

In an era of austerity, societal cost features highly in health-care interventions. The average UK treatment cost of a proximal femur fracture is £25 424.00 with an annual combined health and social care economic burden to the United Kingdom for this specific patient group in the region of £1 billion. Both the incidence and cost of hip fracture are expected to increase in the future, with an estimated incidence of 101 000 hip fractures annually in the United Kingdom by 2020.

At rest, one-third of patients with a proximal femur fracture will have mild or no pain, one-third will have moderate pain, and one-third will have severe pain. Extracapsular fractures are more painful than intracapsular fractures due to the greater degree of periosteal damage.

Effective pain management is associated with significantly improved outcomes, while poor pain control predisposes patients with hip fracture to delirium, which itself greatly increases 1-year mortality and morbidity. Postoperatively, optimizing analgesia aids early mobilization and reduces length of hospital stay, thus reducing costs and preventing patients being exposed to the threats of the health-care environment.

### Navigating pain management in orthopedic trauma: the unintended consequences of combined analgesic regimens [^1128y6uR]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, the study's findings underscore the complexity of pain management and the need for a nuanced, individualize approach to analgesia prescribing practices. While opioids and non-opioids remain a valuable tool in managing acute pain from fractures, their use must be carefully considered and monitored. The study highlights the importance of thorough patient education regarding the risks associated with opioid use, even when combined with seemingly benign non-opioid analgesics.

Clinicians should increasingly consider alternative pain management strategies, such as staggered administration of different analgesics or prioritizing non-pharmacological interventions. While the goal of minimizing opioid-related risks is laudable, this study reveals that well-intentioned strategies may have unintended consequences. As we move forward, a balanced approach that considers both the benefits and risks of various analgesic regimens is crucial.

- skeletal traction is a common method for preoperative fracture stabilization and pain control in patients with femoral shaft and acetabular fractures, and it has been suggested to reduce pain scores during immobilization of isolated femur fractures

- appropriate positioning in complex fractures, for example with a back slab for wrist/arm fractures, can alleviate pain and is widely recommended

- peripheral nerve block provides rapid reduction in pain within 30 min with a low risk of adverse effects in patients with hip fracture in the emergency department

-, while reducing the requirement for opioids

- intra-articular lidocaine has demonstrated comparable analgesia to IV analgesia/sedation in patients with acute shoulder dislocation, with a shorter duration of hospitalization and lower risk of complications

- IV lidocaine has demonstrated efficacy in patients with renal colic, with a faster onset to pain relief and greater pain relief than IV morphine

- IV lidocaine and lidocaine patches provide effective analgesia in patients with acute traumatic extremity pain

- and rib fracture.

### Preoperative nerve blocks for hip fracture patients: a pilot randomized trial [^11313zQg]. Injury (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine the: 1) impact of pre-operative femoral nerve block(PreopFNB) on: a) pain; b) opioid use; and c) early post-operative mobilization relative to usual care(CONTROL) and 2) feasibility of a definitive randomized clinical trial(RCT).

Methods

This pilot RCT, performed in a Canadian tertiary center, compared PreopFNB to CONTROL in 73 participants aged ≥ 65 years, who a) were ambulatory pre-hip fracture, b) had Mini Mental Status Examination(MMSE) score ≥ 13 and c) provided consent(direct/proxy). Participants were randomized to PreopFNB or CONTROL using 2 PreopFNB:1 CONTROL(48 PreopFNB:25 CONTROL) allocation. Pain, opioid use and early post-operative mobilization were compared between groups. Inclusion of those with cognitive impairment and PFNB treatment fidelity were also assessed.

Results

The PreopFNB group was slightly older than CONTROL(mean ± SD: 79.9 ± 8.9 versus 76.8 ± 9.0; p = 0.15) with more males(21[42%] versus 5[22%]; p = 0.04). The overall mean MMSE score was ≥ 24. Mean pain scores were not significantly different between groups at rest(p = 0.17), with activity(p = 0.21) or non-verbal assessment(p = 0.79). Opioid use(oral morphine equivalents) was non-significantly higher and more variable in CONTROL than PreopFNB pre-operatively(Median [25,75 quartiles] 13.1[0,398] versus 7.5[0,125]) and post-operatively(15.0[0,950] versus 10.0[0,260])(p = 0.28). On day 1 post-operative, 40(87%) PFNB and 17(71%) CONTROL participants mobilized(p = 0.10).

Conclusion

We found similar reported pain between groups. Although not significant, opioid use was higher and more variable in CONTROL and more PreopFNB patients mobilized day 1 post-operatively. Participants with cognitive impairment were not frequently enrolled. With modification, a definitive RCT is feasible and would inform pain management after hip fracture.

### Assessment and early management of pain in hip fractures: the impact of paracetamol [^113uokH9]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

As the number of patients sustaining hip fractures increases, interventions aimed at improving patient comfort and reducing complication burden acquire increased importance. Frailty, cognitive impairment, and difficulty in assessing pain control characterize this population. In order to inform future care, a review of pain assessment and the use of preoperative intravenous paracetamol (IVP) is presented.

Materials and Methods

Systematic review of preoperative IVP administration in patients presenting with a hip fracture.

Results

Intravenous paracetamol is effective in the early management of pain control in the hip fracture population. There is a considerable decrease in use of breakthrough pain medications when compared with other pain relief modalities. Additionally, IVP reduces the incidence of opioid-induced complications, reduces length of stay, and lowers mean pain scores. Another significant finding of this study is the poor administration of all analgesics to patients with hip fracture with up to 72% receiving no prehospital analgesia.

Discussion

The potential benefits of IVP as routine in the early management of hip fracture-related pain are clear. Studies of direct comparison between analgesia regimes to inform optimum bundles of analgesic care are sparse. This study highlights the need for properly constructed pathway-driven comparator studies of contemporary analgesia regimes, with IVP as a central feature to optimize pain control and minimize analgesia-related morbidity in this vulnerable population.

Application Scenarios in Trauma Emergency Care

Hip Fractures

In elderly patients, hip fractures often require rapid analgesia to mitigate the risk of delirium associated with the administration of systemic opioids. The PENG block outperforms the suprainguinal fascia iliaca blocks (US-guided) in reducing pain (change in visual analogue scale score (ΔVAS) = 2.26 vs 3.04) and can reduces respiratory complications by 68% in elderly patients with hip fractures patients.

Pelvic Fractures

For pubic ramus fractures, combining the PENG block with femoral lateral cutaneous nerve blockade achieves a 72% reduction in opioid use while preserving quadriceps muscle strength. Ultrasound guidance ensures precise anaesthetic delivery to the pelvic ring, addressing both osseous and soft tissue pain sources.

Polytrauma

In polytrauma patients, the PENG block can be integrated into multimodal analgesia protocols, reducing the length of ICU stays by 1.8 days compared with opioid-centric approaches. Its compatibility with other regional techniques (eg, thoracic epidurals) improves systemic analgesia without increasing respiratory risks.

### Fascia iliaca block in the emergency department for hip fracture: a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial [^114fGJkH]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This randomized-controlled trial suggests that anatomic landmark-based FIB does not provide additional analgesia benefit for patients in the emergency department suffering from hip fracture. While previous double-blinded investigations concluded that FIB reduces pain scores at 15 min and 3 h after the procedure, when compared to non-steroidal inflammatory drugs or intramuscular morphine, respectively, we were unable to reproduce these results. Several factors may explain the differences seen in the present trial.

First, the reduction in pain scores in these two reports was not consistent through the timeline, as authors found a difference only at a single time interval and only for one modality of pain score. Second, and more importantly, we did not exclude patients who received prehospital opioids and therefore the baseline pain scores of our population were found to be much lower than those reported in the literature. Indeed, in our setting, the median pre-procedure pain score at rest was 2 (mean 3.2), while other authors have described a median of 8. Of note, despite randomisation, patients in the FIB group reported a lower baseline pain score than those in the Sham injection group both at rest and on movement. This difference was explained by a higher pre-procedure morphine consumption in the FIB group. As a result, in the multivariable analyses we adjusted for both pre-procedure and post-intervention morphine consumption, in addition to ASA group and gender. Both adjusted and unadjusted analyses confirm the parallel longitudinal pain profile of the two groups, reinforcing the conclusion that FIB may not offer a significant supplementary analgesic benefit when patients report low pain scores after receiving prehospital morphine. We therefore believe that our methodology echoes the daily practice of emergency departments and reflects effectiveness of the intervention in the real-world environment.

Similarly, the between group difference in mean pain scores on movement was also unchanged from baseline to 45 min after the procedure (baseline difference: -0.9, 95%CI [− 2.7; 0.9]; difference at 45 min: -1.6, 95%CI [− 3.4; 0.2]; test of equality of the two differences (i.e. parallelism): p = 0.45; Fig. 3). This equality of the two differences (i.e. the parallelism) persisted after adjustment for gender, ASA score, and pre-procedure intravenous morphine consumption (p = 0.50 for the test of equality of the two differences (i.e. parallelism) at rest and p = 0.45 on movement). Likewise, analyses over the periods of 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h after the procedure showed parallelism in the longitudinal pain scores at rest (p = 0.82; Fig. 4) and on movement (p = 0.12; Fig. 5), after adjustment for the same co-variables (p = 0.80 and p = 0.11, respectively).

### Perioperative pain management intervention in older patients with hip fracture in an orthogeriatric unit. A controlled before / after study assessing an audit and feedback intervention (PAIN-AGE) [^115h8dKX]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Setting

The study took place in the Grenoble Alpes University Hospital (France): the orthogeriatric unit was located in the North hospital and the conventional orthopedic unit in the South hospital. The orthogeriatric unit (experimental group) belongs to the orthopedic and traumatological surgery department. It receives patients from the emergency department. There is a daily comanagement between orthopedic surgeons, anesthesiologists, and geriatricians for perioperative care. In this unit, a set of standard pain assessment and management protocols are employed. This set consists of the following: (1) pain assessment through a numerical scale or visual analog scale (VAS) performed systematically 3 times a day and then repeated as many times as necessary; (2) non-pharmacological pain management included during the preoperative period: the limitation of the movements of the traumatized limb by aligning it properly, blocking rotations by avoiding muscular contractions of the traumatized limb, mobilization by trained paramedical teams, and ice during perioperative period; (3) routine prescription of 1 g of acetaminophen 3 times a day, and 5 mg per os of oxycodone (or equivalent) systematically distributed in the morning, before the nursing and the mobilization procedures; (4) conditional prescription of strong opioids based on pain intensity during all day. A pain intensity level greater than 6 induces opioid use. Data tracking of the numerical scale of prescriptions and analgesics given was performed by nursing staff. In the conventional orthopedic unit, no analgesic prescription protocol was used.

Participant patients

The study consecutively included 75 + hospitalized with hip fracture. The recruitment period lasted from December 2018 to April 2020. Patients were excluded in case of death before the surgery, admission after the surgery, multiple concomitant fractures, metastatic fractures, or functional management of the fracture. Patients who stayed less than 48 h in the unit or under any form of legal protection, or without collected data were also excluded from the study. Other reason such as acetaminophen allergy, early orthopedic complications (luxation within 48 h) could lead to study exclusion.

### A comparison of ultrasound-guided three-in-one femoral nerve block versus parenteral opioids alone for analgesia in emergency department patients with hip fractures: a randomized controlled trial [^117YKyab]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of ultrasound (US)-guided three-in-one femoral nerve blocks to standard treatment with parenteral opioids for pain control in elderly patients with hip fractures in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

A randomized controlled trial was conducted at a large urban academic ED over an 18-month period. A convenience sample of older adults (age ≥ 55 years) with confirmed hip fractures and moderate to severe pain (numeric rating score ≥ 5) were randomized to one of two treatment arms: US-guided three-in-one femoral nerve block plus morphine (FNB group) or standard care, consisting of placebo (sham injection) plus morphine (SC group). Intravenous (IV) morphine was prescribed and dosed at the discretion of the treating physician; physicians were advised to target a 50% reduction in pain or per-patient request. The primary outcome measure of pain relief, or pain intensity reduction, was derived using the 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) and calculated as the summed pain-intensity difference (SPID) over 4 hours. Secondary outcome measures included the amount of rescue analgesia and occurrence of adverse events (respiratory depression, hypotension, nausea, or vomiting). Outcome measures were compared between groups using analysis of variance for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical data.

Results

Thirty-six patients (18 in each arm) completed the study. There was no difference between treatment groups with respect to age, sex, fracture type, vital signs (baseline and at 4 hours), ED length of stay (LOS), pre-enrollment analgesia, or baseline pain intensity. In comparing pain intensity at the end of the study period, NRS scores at 4 hours were significantly lower in the FNB group (p < 0.001). Over the 4-hour study period, patients in the FNB group experienced significantly greater overall pain relief than those in the SC group, with a median SPID of 11.0 (interquartile range [IQR] = 4.0 to 21.8) in the FNB group versus 4.0 (IQR = -2.0 to 5.8) in the SC group (p = 0.001). No patient in the SC group achieved a clinically significant reduction in pain. Moreover, patients in the SC group received significantly more IV morphine than those in the FNB group (5.0 mg, IQR = 2.0 to 8.4 mg vs. 0.0 mg, IQR = 0.0 to 1.5 mg; p = 0.028). There was no difference in adverse events between groups.

Conclusions

Ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block as an adjunct to SC resulted in 1) significantly reduced pain intensity over 4 hours, 2) decreased amount of rescue analgesia, and 3) no appreciable difference in adverse events when compared with SC alone. Furthermore, standard pain management with parenteral opioids alone provided ineffective pain control in our study cohort of patients with severe pain from their hip fractures. Regional anesthesia has a role in the ED, and US-guided femoral nerve blocks for pain management in older adults with hip fractures should routinely be considered, particularly in cases of refractory or severe pain.

### Clinical practice guidelines for pain management in acute musculoskeletal injury [^115FyMbp]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2019). Medium credibility.

With regard to the effectiveness of NSAIDs for pain control, there are now some head-to-head clinical comparisons available between NSAIDs and opioids for the acute management of musculoskeletal complaints in both the pediatricand adult, populations. To date, these studies have demonstrated NSAIDs to provide equally effective analgesia.

To summarize, there is simply no conclusive clinical evidence to prohibit the use of NSAIDs in fracture care. Furthermore, risks to the population from oral opioid use, and the prolonged use after resolution of musculoskeletal injury, are well established. NSAIDs also provide effective analgesia in the setting of musculoskeletal pain. Taking all these factors and the existing clinical evidence into account, we recommend the routine use of NSAIDs as part of a comprehensive analgesic plan for operative and nonoperative fracture care.

Nerve/Regional/Field Blocks

This section is organized around the following 3 periods: (1) during a hospital admission before fracture surgery, (2) intraoperatively and the immediate postoperative period, and (3) the remote (> 3 months) postoperative period. In each of these temporal periods, in relation to fracture surgery, we asked what is the evidence that nerve, or regional, or field blocks improve pain control and decrease use of opioids?

During a Hospital Admission Before Fracture Surgery

- The panel recommends that regional nerve blocks (femoral nerve or fascia iliaca) should be placed in patients with acute hip fractures at the time of presentation to the ED (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

The evidence for this recommendation is confined to hip fracture patients. Multiple studies show that nerve blocks placed in the ED can be accomplished by trained personal with minimal risks or complications. – These blocks have consistently been found to be effective in comparison to standard of care (parenteral opioids alone) in decreasing opioid use and improving patient's pain in the preoperative period. These results have been confirmed in multiple RCTs, and some of these studies are placebo controlled with blinded assessment of the outcome. Although there is high-quality evidence for these benefits of nerve blocks, instituting routine nerve blocks for hip fracture patients cannot be accomplished by the surgeon in isolation. System-wide changes in practice with involvement of other care providers (emergency medicine and anesthesia) are required.

Pain management at hospital discharge — opioid selection and overdose risk mitigation: When an opioid pill is used alone or in combination with acetaminophen or ibuprofen, no difference in efficacy, tolerability, or risk of abuse or misuse was found. To optimize the use of acetaminophen or NSAIDS before opioids, prescribe oral opioids alone to eliminate confusion about the maximum dose of the nonopioid component when used in combination form. For patients believed to require longer prescription duration, consider consultation with a pain management service for delineation of an optimal outpatient pain management regimen. In line with Centers for Disease Control recommendations, consider providing naloxone as a co-prescription for patients felt to be at high risk for opioid overdose.

The initiative providing fascia iliaca blocks in the Emergency Department for pain relief in acute hip fracture patients was launched in fiscal year 2019. All patients diagnosed with an acute (less than 24 hours) hip fracture presenting to the ED would be eligible for a fascia iliaca block once x-ray confirmed a femoral neck, intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture. Contraindications to a fascia iliaca block for a hip fracture included: known allergy or anaphylaxis to local anesthetic, open fracture, cellulitis at injection site, anticoagulation with warfarin or a Xa inhibitor, or an abnormal neurovascular exam of the affected extremity. In addition to contraindications, patients would be excluded from receiving this intervention due to patient refusal, inability to provide consent or being sent directly to Operating Room (OR) from the Emergency Department. Pain blocks were performed on all appropriate patients regardless of age, sex, or socioeconomic factors.

Pharmacologic analgesia — lidocaine: Intravenous lidocaine infusions decrease pain by multiple mechanisms, but while some perioperative evidence exists, studies on trauma patients are lacking; in a high-quality, prospective randomized controlled trial in total hip arthroplasty, no difference in pain scores or opioid requirements was observed with perioperative lidocaine infusions versus placebo. Consider regional blocks (neuraxial/peripheral nerve blocks) in localized injury patterns, and the assistance of an acute pain service is recommended. Topical lidocaine patches may offer pain reduction with minimal concern for systemic absorption, but efficacy remains unclear; use patches with caution near open wounds. Do not administer a continuous infusion of lidocaine to patients with a regional block when also infusing an amide anesthetic due to risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST), and protocols for recognizing LAST are recommended.

### Use of nonopioid analgesics and the impact on patient outcomes [^112uXayQ]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2016). Low credibility.

Although opioids are widely used for the management of pain in patients with hip fracture, these medications are known to have a wide range of adverse effects that can result in suboptimal outcomes or serious life-threatening complications. Common opioid-related adverse events include gastrointestinal effects, central nervous system effects, and respiratory depression. Hip fractures occur most frequently among the elderly-the very population that is most susceptible to the adverse effects of opioids and the risks of serious physiological complications. There has been much interest during recent years in identifying alternative analgesic approaches that are less opioid-dependent. There is good evidence to show that nerve blocks can be effective in managing the acute pain associated with hip fracture. However, sciatic and femoral nerve blocks seem to increase the risk of several clinically significant adverse events. A retrospective cohort study that examined the effectiveness of scheduled intravenous acetaminophen as part of the pain management protocol for hip fracture patients revealed significant improvement in pain scores, narcotic use, length of stay, and missed physical therapy sessions. Limited data exist in patients with hip fracture on the effects of infiltration of the surgical site with the local anesthetic agent, bupivacaine. However, extensive use of bupivacaine in hip arthroplasty surgery suggests that it may be highly beneficial in the patient with hip fracture.

PICO 2

Should ketorolac be used in analgesic regimens for adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with traumatic fracture versus routine analgesic regimens that do not include ketorolac to improve analgesia and reduce OMEs, without increasing non-union rates?

Qualitative synthesis

Three studies compared ketorolac use to no ketorolac use in patients with traumatic fractures (table 5). McDonald et al randomized 128 patients undergoing fixation or ankle fractures to receive 30 mg intravenous ketorolac intraoperatively and 20 tablets of 10 mg ketorolac postoperatively. Additionally, both groups were prescribed 81 mg of ASA for deep vein thrombosis prevention. Opioid consumption was lower in patients randomized to receive ketorolac (21 OMEs compared with 29 OMEs, p = 0.04). Like the reduction in OMEs, pain scores were lower on postoperative days 1 to 3 in the patients receiving ketorolac. Finally, there was no difference in the proportion of patients with complete union (83% in ketorolac group compared with 77% in control group) at 12 weeks.

Table 5
PICO 2 – summary of all outcomes

Xu et al randomized 63 patients to receive a post-operative pump containing ketorolac+sufentanil or sufentanil alone. There was no significant difference in pain at 48 hours but significantly less sufentanil was used in the group randomized to receive ketorolac.

Eftekharian et al randomized patients with mandible fractures to receive a single dose of 30 mg ketorolac or placebo in the postanesthesia unit at the onset of pain. There was a significant reduction in analgesic requirements but no difference in pain intensity at any time points.

Quantitative synthesis

Quantitative synthesis was not possible for any of the outcomes due to either a lack of two or more studies and inconsistent outcome definitions with respect to the timing of pain and methods to measure pain.

PICO 2 recommendation

We conditionally recommend ketorolac be used in analgesic regimens for adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with traumatic fracture. Ketorolac is associated with reduced opioid use and improved postoperative analgesia and is not associated with non-union. Five authors voted for a strong recommendation and 14 authors voted for conditional recommendation.

### Assessment and early management of pain in hip fractures: the impact of paracetamol [^117NAKEK]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Intravenous paracetamol (and its prototype, propacetamol) has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective analgesic when managing preoperative pain for patients with hip fracture. When used with opiates such as morphine for breakthrough pain, IVP has been found to significantly reduce morphine requirements, with no adverse effects or compromise in pain management when compared to standard oral paracetamol regimes. No adverse effects associated with the use of IVP for hip fracture were reported in the literature reviewed. Intravenous paracetamol may be considered as a more cost-effective alternative to peripheral nerve block, the literature having reported comparable pain control and a superior opioid-sparing effect when compared to FNB. Indirectly, IVP would also seem to have the potential to reduce delirium and constipation, through reduction of pain and opioid analgesia.

While it is compelling to declare benefits in efficacy, a decreased side effect profile, and possible economic advantage of IVP, this is not a robust premise. The evidence base cannot fully support any of these claims fully, but there is sufficient literature suggestive of benefit across multiple domains for further investigation to be prioritized. Differences between funding models influence any health-care economic analysis. For example, when a nerve block is billed separately and/or is covered by a separate funding stream, this prevents meaningful comparison. In addition, the cost of differing formulations of paracetamol varies widely, strengthening the requirement for a controlled study. Equally, factors impacting on length of stay are influenced by patient, department, and health-care-specific factors. The current literature that we have analyzed is heterogenic in that it represents several low-level evidence studies from differing health-care systems. The limitations of this work are, therefore, construed by the literature on which it is based. We have provided a narrative summary pertinent to specific features of pain management and the role of paracetamol that should serve as a primer for any unit considering its analgesic management in this population. We have highlighted the need for a properly controlled stratified trial of preadmission IVP, given the independently demonstrated benefits of both IVP and preadmission paracetamol. The importance of a properly controlled trial (in which all of the previously mentioned variables can be more tightly matched and controlled) is thrown into greater context by the established size of the problem as we have discussed, both to the patient group and the health systems looking after them. Many significant advantages have been identified for the use of IVP compared to oral paracetamol. Additionally, administration of oral paracetamol prehospital improves pain management and reduces pain at point of admission. A potential for the improvement of pain management by the administration of IVP prehospital has therefore been identified as an emergent theme from review of the current literature.

### A bad break: mechanisms and assessment of acute and chronic pain after bone fracture [^111V5mup]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the standard of care treatment for postfracture pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs effectively relieve musculoskeletal pain and work by inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity upstream of the prostaglandins that trigger inflammation. However, several prominent studies have found that NSAIDs can delay fracture healing. Despite the fact that other studies find the evidence to be weak or contradictory, in the United States, the perceived risk has led to widespread avoidance of NSAIDs to treat pain during fracture healing. This clinical perception has resulted in opioids becoming the most prescribed and dispensed pain medications used during fracture management. The number and type of opioid prescribed varies by geographical region and injury, but the published numbers are staggering. For example, 1 study found that among 41 different conditions associated with acute pain, fractures had the highest opioid prescription rate in patients with Medicaid (56.3%) and those who are privately insured (44.8%). In patients with ankle or hip fractures that require surgery, over 60% fill prescriptions for opioids, and ∼21% of them still filled the prescription at 9 months postop. Although the long-term effects of childhood treatment with opioids are still unknown, recent evidence suggests that 37% to 51% of pediatric fractures treated in the emergency department receive an opioid prescription.

Although NSAID addiction is exceedingly rare, opioids have garnered significant attention because of the associated risks of substance misuse and long-term addiction, which have contributed to our current opioid epidemic. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort from professional societies, such as the IASP and the Orthopaedic Trauma Association, to produce comprehensive guidelines and recommendations for multimodal pain management protocols. These protocols are designed to improve acute pain management and include adjunctive therapies to reduce reliance on opioids. To date, however, whether these protocols will transfer to the management of chronic fracture pain has not been well studied. Taken together, current evidence-based protocols for managing the spectrum of acute to chronic fracture pain remain inadequate. The goal of this review article is to motivate the development of novel therapies for managing fracture pain, without inhibition of bone healing. This effort requires a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and pathophysiology of the onset and persistence of pain after fracture.

Intervention and data collection

Patients with a suspected hip fracture were transported by ambulance directly to the department of radiology. After X-ray verification of hip fracture, the patients were transferred to an orthopaedic ward where those included in the study were randomised to either an intervention group or a control group. The FICB was performed in accordance with Dalen's technique and administered as a complement to regular analgesia. The medication used in the study was either 30 mL of ropivacaine 2 mg/ml (active substance) or 30 mL of isotonic saline (placebo). This dose was recommended by the Swedish Medical Products Agency. During office hours, the physician on the ward was contacted for study inclusion and FICB administration. After office hours, until midnight, the orthopaedic surgeon on duty was paged. All tests conducted on the study participants were carried out and registered in a case report form. A computer program was used for randomisation. The randomisation (Fig. 1) and preparation of the study material were carried out by a statistics expert not involved in the study evaluation. The medication used for each individual patient was prepared by a nurse not otherwise involved in the collection of patient data.

Fig. 1
Flow diagram CONSORT 2010 showing the inclusion and analysis process of the trial

All staff members were trained in using the pain assessment instrument, the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ), filling out case report forms, randomisation and blinding according to the study protocol. All personnel involved in the study were blinded to the study medication. The study was conducted under the surveillance of an external monitor. Typical symptoms indicating adverse events (AE) associated with the injection of which the staff needed to be aware were hypotension, bradycardia, nausea, vomiting, paraesthesia, dizziness and headache.

Regular analgesia

Morphine was given using an on-demand model with nurse-initiated analgesia. In Sweden, ambulances are staffed by prehospital emergency nurses (PENs). For PENs, it is standard procedure to titrate intravenous (iv) morphine for pain relief from the site of injury, during transport and until the time of admission to hospital. The titration of morphine was continued by nurses on the ward. Before surgery, paracetamol was prescribed on demand. This was a routine that was considered to work acceptably. There were no formal standards with regard to the preoperative dosage of either morphine or paracetamol. In hospital, preoperative iv morphine was usually prescribed as 1–2 or 2.5–5 mg on demand, repeated if necessary.

### Peripheral nerve blocks for hip fractures in adults [^115WLTAR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This review was published originally in 1999 and was updated in 2001, 2002, 2009, 2017, and 2020. Updating was deemed necessary due to the high incidence of hip fractures, the large number of official societies providing recommendations on this condition, the possibility that perioperative peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) may improve patient outcomes, and the major role that PNBs may play in reducing preoperative and postoperative opioid use for analgesia.

Objectives

To compare PNBs used as preoperative analgesia, as postoperative analgesia, or as a supplement to general anaesthesia versus no nerve block (or sham block) for adults with hip fracture. Outcomes were pain on movement at 30 minutes after block placement, acute confusional state, myocardial infarction, chest infection, death, time to first mobilization, and costs of an analgesic regimen for single-injection blocks. We undertook the update to look for new studies and to update the methods to reflect Cochrane standards.

Search Methods

For the updated review, we searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 11), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1966 to November 2019); Embase (Ovid SP, 1974 to November 2019); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCO, 1982 to November 2019), as well as trial registers and reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing use of PNBs compared with no nerve block (or sham block) as part of the care provided for adults 16 years of age and older with hip fracture. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened new trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias-2 tool, and extracted data. When appropriate, we pooled results of outcome measures. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 49 trials (3061 participants; 1553 randomized to PNBs and 1508 to no nerve block (or sham block)). For this update, we added 18 new trials. Trials were published from 1981 to 2020. Trialists followed participants for periods ranging from 5 minutes to 12 months. The average age of participants ranged from 59 to 89 years. People with dementia were often excluded from the included trials. Additional analgesia was available for all participants. Results of 11 trials with 503 participants show that PNBs reduced pain on movement within 30 minutes of block placement (standardized mean difference (SMD) -1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.25 to -0.86; equivalent to -2.5 on a scale from 0 to 10; high-certainty evidence). Effect size was proportionate to the concentration of local anaesthetic used (P = 0.0003). Based on 13 trials with 1072 participants, PNBs reduce the risk of acute confusional state (risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 12, 95% CI 7 to 47; high-certainty evidence). For myocardial infarction, there were no events in one trial with 31 participants (RR not estimable; low-certainty evidence). From three trials with 131 participants, PNBs probably reduce the risk for chest infection (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.89; NNTB 7, 95% CI 5 to 72; moderate-certainty evidence). Based on 11 trials with 617 participants, the effects of PNBs on mortality within six months are uncertain due to very serious imprecision (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.60; low-certainty evidence). From three trials with 208 participants, PNBs likely reduce time to first mobilization (mean difference (MD) -10.80 hours, 95% CI -12.83 to -8.77 hours; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial with 75 participants indicated there may be a small reduction in the cost of analgesic drugs with a single-injection PNB (MD -4.40 euros, 95% CI -4.84 to -3.96 euros; low-certainty evidence). We identified 29 ongoing trials, of which 15 were first posted or at least were last updated after 1 January 2018. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: PNBs reduce pain on movement within 30 minutes after block placement, risk of acute confusional state, and probably also reduce the risk of chest infection and time to first mobilization. There may be a small reduction in the cost of analgesic drugs for single-injection PNB. We did not find a difference for myocardial infarction and mortality, but the numbers of participants included for these two outcomes were insufficient. Although randomized clinical trials may not be the best way to establish risks associated with an intervention, our review confirms low risks of permanent injury associated with PNBs, as found by others. Some trials are ongoing, but it is unclear whether any further RCTs should be registered, given the benefits found. Good-quality non-randomized trials with appropriate sample size may help to clarify the potential effects of PNBs on myocardial infarction and mortality.

### Opioid prescribing for acute pain management in children and adolescents in outpatient settings: clinical practice guideline [^114T23MH]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) considerations in adolescents — a specific instance potentially requiring daily opioid agonists is care of adolescents with an OUD who receive buprenorphine or methadone; it is important to discuss pain management goals, and although opioids are not needed for most common procedures and injuries, some patients with an OUD may nonetheless require opioids, with patients on buprenorphine who may be able to use increased doses or, alternatively, individuals on buprenorphine or methadone who can receive short-acting opioid medications administered in addition to their medications for OUD; patients with OUD on oral naltrexone who may need opioids postoperatively should discontinue the medication 48 to 72 hours before planned surgery, whereas those on long-acting injectable naltrexone may consider switching to the oral formulation at least 1 month before surgery and then discontinue the medication 48 to 72 hours before planned surgery; some individuals with OUD may wish to avoid opioids entirely, and close collaboration of PHCPs with addiction treatment providers can be critical, with the goal to support ongoing OUD treatment and recovery while ensuring appropriate pain control.

### Fascia iliaca block in the emergency department for hip fracture: a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial [^116Jw3CF]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hip fracture causes moderate to severe pain and while fascia iliaca block has been reported to provide analgesic benefit, most previous trials were unblinded, with subsequent high risks of performance, selection and detection biases. In this randomized, control double-blind trial, we tested the hypothesis that a fascia iliaca block provides effective analgesia for patients suffering from hip fracture.

Methods

Thirty ASA I-III hip fracture patients over 70 years old, who received prehospital morphine, were randomized to receive either a fascia iliaca block using 30 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine 1:200,000 or a sham injection with normal saline. The fascia iliaca block was administered by emergency medicine physicians trained to perform an anatomic landmark-based technique. The primary outcome was the comparison between groups of the longitudinal pain score profiles at rest over the first 45 min following the procedure (numeric rating scale, 0–10). Secondary outcomes included the longitudinal pain score profiles on movement and the comparison over 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h after the procedure, along with cumulative intravenous morphine consumption at 24 h.

Results

At baseline, the fascia iliaca group had a lower mean pain score than the sham injection group, both at rest (difference = − 0.9, 95%CI [− 2.4, 0.5]) and on movement (difference = − 0.9, 95%CI [− 2.7; 0.9]). These differences remained 45 min after the procedure and the two longitudinal pain score profiles were parallel both for patients at rest and on movement (test of parallelism for patients at rest p = 0.53 and on movement p = 0.45). The same parallel change in pain scores over time was observed over 24 h of follow-up (test of parallelism for patients at rest p = 0.82 and on movement p = 0.12). These results were confirmed after adjustment for gender, ASA score, and cumulative sums of intravenous morphine received pre-procedure and during-follow-up. In addition, there was no difference between the two groups in total cumulative intravenous morphine consumption at 24 h.

Conclusion

Fascia iliaca block following anatomic landmarks may not provide supplementary analgesia for patients suffering from hip fracture, when low pain scores are reported after prehospital morphine. Additional larger trials will help reach definitive conclusion.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary management of osteoarthritis of the hip [^112Gwg5H]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis of the hip — prescription opioid as conservative treatment: In the absence of sufficient evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that oral opioids not be utilized for nonoperative treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip (Quality of Evidence: Consensus; Strength of Option: Consensus ★★☆). The systematic literature review yielded no studies that met inclusion criteria for this option, and outside the inclusion criteria there is high quality evidence that oral opioids, including tramadol, result in a significant increase of adverse events and are not effective at improving pain or function for treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. Preoperative opioid use is associated with increased risks of adverse events, complications, and revision in total hip arthroplasty, and patients who wean their opioid use before total hip arthroplasty have significant improvements in clinical outcomes after surgery compared to those who continue use. Opioids have limited clinical benefit, are associated with significant adverse events, and increase the risk of complications after total hip arthroplasty. The most important consideration will be removal of oral opioids from the medications prescribed in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip, and it is the opinion of the workgroup that opioids do not lead to improvements in pain and function and increase the risk of adverse events. For most patients, this option should be readily implemented, though patients who fail other nonoperative treatments such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen or injections may resist; these patients should be counseled on the significant risks and lack of efficacy. This option should be easily implemented with no apparent barriers to adoption.

### Evaluating postoperative pain management using the Detroit interventional pain management tool after fracture surgery: how well are we really doing? [^115Xy71a]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The ideal scenario for postoperative care is to transition patients off opioids in a timely manner while still delivering adequate pain management practice. In this study, every cohort (total patients, major fracture, and minor fracture) experienced a significant decrease in prescribed MMEs and in the percentage of patients who reported using opioids from 2 weeks to 6 months (P < 0.001). This indicates that surgeons made a conscious effort to adhere to the opioid policy of reducing prescriptions to 2 weeks for minor fractures and 6 weeks for major fractures and prescribed fewer opioids at subsequent postoperative periods. However, although surgeons prescribed fewer opioids indicated by the smaller MMEs, the decrease in patient-reported opioid usage may be due to some patients opting not to use their opioid prescription. Despite the practice of surgeons following their opioid prescription plans, patients sought pain medication and treatment from outside prescribers, particularly at 3 months and 6 months. This signals the necessity for patients, particularly those who suffered polytrauma fractures, to seek pain management from outside prescribers (primary care providers or pain management specialists) to ensure they receive appropriate pain control following the acute surgical aftercare prescription window.

Even with the practice of opioid tapering, pain management efficiency needed improvement at 2 weeks for the total cohort of patients, evidenced by a 67.2% efficiency score, with 15.7% of patients taking OTC pain medication reporting inadequacy. When considering all patients reporting intolerable pain at 2 weeks, patients on OTC pain medications accounted for 47.8%. These patients had run out of opioids prescribed at discharge. The same trend was seen for the minor fracture cohort exhibiting the lowest efficiency score at 2 weeks. Owing to state prescribing guidelines, surgeons limited prescriptions to a week's supply of pain medication upon discharge. Therefore, it was suggested for patients to follow up after 1 week with a phone call, if needed, especially if they underwent surgical intervention for minor fractures.

For patients still using opioids at 6 months and 2 years, all underwent previous orthopaedic surgeries, had more than one fracture pattern (polytrauma), or were classified as obese based on their BMI. This suggests that these are all possible risk factors that could potentially increase pain sensitivity, opioid usage, and dependence. Patients experiencing these possible risk factors should be closely monitored throughout the postoperative period for adequate pain control. Additional surgical interventions for patients with polytrauma should aim to be completed within 6 weeks to reduce the potential risk of prolonged opioid usage.

### A practical analgesia approach to fragility hip fracture: a single-center, retrospective, cohort study on femoral nerve block [^114napy9]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether an effective opioid-sparing pain control modality is desirable for an aging population.

Design

Retrospective observational study SETTING:: Academic medical center PATIENTS:: 192 patients with various types of fragility hip fractures INTERVENTION:: A single-injection femoral nerve block (FNB) MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS:: Pain score, opioid consumption RESULTS:: We observed statistically significant effects of FNB on visual analogue scale pain score and the rate of opioid consumption diminution in all commonly encountered types of fragility hip fractures. The pain score reduction by FNB in subcapital femoral neck fracture, transcervical femoral neck facture, and intertrochanteric fracture are all statistically significant (P < 0.0001). There was a statistically more significant pain score reduction in intracapsular fractures than in extracapsular fractures (P = 0.006). On average, the hip fracture patients required 0.9 and 0.1 mg morphine equivalent/hour before and after FNB block placement. This decrease in opioid consumption when calculated per unit time was statistically significant in subcapital femoral neck fracture, transcervical femoral neck facture, and intertrochanteric fracture (P < 0.0001). There were no complications related to FNB placement.

Conclusions

FNB is a sustainable, safe, and useful analgesic modality for commonly encountered fragility hip fractures.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of hip fractures in older adults [^114jBAFh]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Anesthesia for hip fracture — Either spinal or general anesthesia is appropriate for patients with a hip fracture. Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Across comparative studies of spinal versus general anesthesia, findings included no difference in mortality at up to 120 days, a decreased mortality rate at two weeks postoperatively in the spinal anesthesia group that did not persist at two months, and increased mortality with spinal versus general anesthesia at 1 year; other outcomes showed no difference in in-hospital complications and no difference in length of stay, with one study reporting lower postoperative pain scores with spinal versus general anesthesia. Implementation notes state that spinal anesthesia and general anesthesia each have a longstanding record of use with established safety in appropriately selected patients, and in patients undergoing anticoagulation, available external guidance should be consulted regarding the timing of block placement relative to anticoagulant dosing to limit potential harms for patients undergoing spinal anesthesia. Additional considerations include that no data were identified to characterize the relative cost-effectiveness of spinal versus general anesthesia and that both spinal and general anesthesia may be acceptable to patients and providers, with acceptability varying by patient preferences, provider experience, and case characteristics.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^116NniJd]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Trauma patients with chronic opioid use or opioid use disorder (OUD) show high prevalence and worse outcomes. Over the past 15 years a marked increase in opioid use is noted, and chronic opioid use is particularly prevalent in patients presenting with traumatic injuries. Between 4 and 5% of all adults in the U.S. use opioids regularly, yet 16–18% of patients presenting to a trauma center were taking opioids pre-injury, and the increased incidence of opioid mentions in emergency department admissions far outpaced the increase in opioid prescriptions. In a retrospective review of 4,352 consecutive adults admitted to a level 1 trauma center over one year, preinjury opioid use was linked to a significant increase in length of stay with lower levels of trauma severity, and such patients required more operative interventions, were more likely to be admitted to the ICU, had a longer length of stay, and experienced more major complications and unplanned readmissions.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain… [^115UsGuX]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

This guideline provides recommendations for clinicians providing pain care, including those prescribing opioids, for outpatients aged ≥ 18 years. It updates the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain — United States, 2016 and includes recommendations for managing acute, subacute, and chronic pain. The recommendations do not apply to pain related to sickle cell disease or cancer or to patients receiving palliative or end-of-life care. The guideline addresses the following four areas: 1) determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain, 2) selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages, 3) deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up, and 4) assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use.

CDC developed the guideline using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. Recommendations are based on systematic reviews of the scientific evidence and reflect considerations of benefits and harms, patient and clinician values and preferences, and resource allocation. CDC obtained input from the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, the public, and peer reviewers. CDC recommends that persons with pain receive appropriate pain treatment, with careful consideration of the benefits and risks of all treatment options in the context of the patient's circumstances. Recommendations should not be applied as inflexible standards of care across patient populations.

This clinical practice guideline is intended to improve communication between clinicians and patients about the benefits and risks of pain treatments, including opioid therapy; improve the effectiveness and safety of pain treatment; mitigate pain; improve function and quality of life for patients with pain; and reduce risks associated with opioid pain therapy, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death. Opioids can be essential medications for the management of pain; however, they carry considerable potential risk. A systematic review published in 2014 by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found insufficient evidence to demonstrate long-term benefits of prescription opioid treatment for chronic pain, and long-term prescription opioid use was found to be associated with increased risk for overdose and opioid misuse, among other risks ensure that clinicians and patients considered safer and more effective pain treatment; 2) improve patient outcomes, such as reduced pain and improved function; and 3) reduce the number of persons who developed opioid use disorder, experienced overdose, or experienced other prescription opioid–related adverse events. To facilitate uptake and implementation of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline in clinical practice, CDC used a broad-reaching strategy that included clinician education and training, partnerships with health systems and payers, and multiple clinical tools and fact sheets. Rationale Since release of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline, new evidence has emerged on the benefits and risks of prescription opioids for both acute and chronic pain, comparisons with nonopioid pain treatments, dosing strategies, opioid dose-dependent effects, risk mitigation strategies, and opioid tapering and discontinuation (.

### Pain management after orthopedic trauma: guidelines from the… [^1124bCwg]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- NSAIDs improve pain control and decrease opioid use in adults with traumatic fractures and should be used in most patients.
- NSAIDs may slightly increase the likelihood of nonunion.
- Opioid use after fracture also appears to increase the risk of nonunion.
- Intravenous ketorolac is beneficial in the acute care of adult patients with a traumatic fracture without increasing fracture nonunion. From the AFP Editors Opioids have been traditionally used for analgesia after orthopedic trauma because of concern that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use increases fracture nonunion. Because opioid misuse and abuse have risen to critical levels and opioid use has also been associated with fracture nonunion, the safety of NSAID use after orthopedic trauma is an open question.

The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma and the Orthopaedic Trauma Association conducted systematic reviews to publish guidelines for the use of NSAIDs after traumatic orthopedic fractures in adults with regard to acute pain control and risk of nonunion. Risk of Nonunion NSAIDs are recommended after fracture because the benefit of improved acute pain control outweighs the low risk of nonunion. Although NSAID use increased fracture non-union in more than 600, 000 patients studied, the number needed to harm was 105 compared with not using an NSAID. The risk might be slightly higher with chronic NSAID use before fracture, with indomethacin, and in patients with hip fracture. SubscribeFrom $180

### Hip fractures: diagnosis and management… [^113WoTwY]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Several medications also increase risk. Corticosteroids, levothyroxine, proton pump inhibitors, and loop diuretics can all decrease BMD, leading to higher fracture risk. 12, 18, 19 Antihypertensives increase risk for postural hypotension and, therefore, falls and subsequent fractures. 18 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and opioids may cause sedation and postural hypotension, increasing fall and fracture risk. 12, 18 Moderate to high alcohol intake, smoking, and high caffeine intake increase the odds of fracture by 1. 5 to two times, likely secondary to appetite suppression and decreased BMD. 15, 19. Presentation Patients typically present with anterior groin pain referring to the thigh or buttock and inability to bear weight on the affected limb after a fall or other trauma. Management Physicians caring for patients with acute hip fractures face three questions. Is surgery an option.

How quickly should surgery be performed. What type of procedure is best. IS SURGERY AN OPTION. Operative management of hip fractures is usually the preferred treatment because it reduces mortality rates, whereas nonoperative treatment carries a fourfold increased risk of death at one year. 9, 27 Nonoperative management may be considered for patients who are nonambulatory, severely debilitated, or who have end-stage terminal illness; it requires shared decision-making regarding goals of care.
27. HOW QUICKLY SHOULD SURGERY BE PERFORMED. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons 2021 clinical practice guideline recommends operative management within 24 to 48 hours of injury unless a delay is needed to stabilize comorbidities. 28 Early operative management improves pain control, decreases length of hospitalization, and reduces complications.

28 In an international randomized controlled trial of 3, 000 patients, no difference in mortality rates was demonstrated with accelerated surgery time, but accelerated surgery did show a decreased risk of perioperative complications, faster postoperative mobilization, and decreased time to discharge. 29 Prolonged wait time to surgery is associated with increased 30-day mortality.
30. WHAT TYPE OF PROCEDURE IS BEST. The surgeon involved in the patient's care will determine the optimal procedure. In general, however, internal fixation is used for nondisplaced femoral neck fractures in younger patients. For displaced femoral neck fractures, closed reduction and pinning is often used in younger patients to avoid hip arthroplasty, although this carries risk of avascular necrosis. 9, 28 For those older than 65 years, arthroplasty is generally preferred 9.

Intertrochanteric and extracapsular fractures are typically repaired with open reduction and internal fixation 12,
28. Subtrochanteric fractures usually require an intramedullary rod and nail to stabilize the fem-oral head and shaft. 12, 28. Perioperative Management ANTIBIOTICS Antibiotics with activity against Staphylococcus aureus are recommended one to two hours before surgery and 24 hours postoperatively to prevent joint infection. 12 Typical regimens are cefazolin or, if allergic to cephalosporins, vancomycin. 12, 31. ANESTHESIA Spinal or general anesthesia are used intraoperatively. A randomized superiority trial of 1, 600 patients demonstrated that incidence of death or the ability to ambulate at 60 days did not differ between spinal vs. general anesthesia. 32 Peripheral nerve blocks on admission and postoperatively offer additional pain management and improve outcomes.
