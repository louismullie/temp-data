## Question

Dietary recommendations for PCOS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dietary recommendations for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle from the 2023 international guideline on whether any single diet composition is superior. Then, I should verify the core dietary advice that applies to all women with PCOS. Next, I will examine weight management targets and the role of modest weight loss. After that, I need to review macronutrient composition evidence, including low-glycemic index and low-carbohydrate approaches. I will then consider special populations such as adolescents, those with normal weight, and those with obesity. I should also integrate behavioral strategies, screen for eating disorders, and address supplements like inositol. Finally, I will synthesize practical, individualized recommendations and close with a concise clinical takeaway aligned with guideline strength and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle so I don't jump to conclusions: the 2023 international evidence-based guideline states there is no evidence that any one diet composition is superior to another for anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal, reproductive, or psychological outcomes in PCOS, so recommendations should align with general healthy eating patterns and be tailored to individual preferences and goals [^113sngUN] [^113PpF2p].

> Wait, let me verify the core dietary advice that applies across the board: emphasize sustainable, population-consistent healthy eating patterns with high fiber, fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and unsaturated fats. Avoid overly restrictive or nutritionally unbalanced regimens. And co-develop goals with the patient to enhance adherence and long-term success [^113sngUN] [^113PpF2p].

> I need to check the weight management targets next. For women with higher weight, a modest energy deficit of roughly 500–750 kcal/day aiming for 5–10% weight loss is reasonable and associated with clinically meaningful improvements in metabolic and reproductive outcomes. Importantly, benefits occur even without full weight normalization, and prevention of further weight gain is a lifelong priority given the propensity for longitudinal weight gain in PCOS [^113DHG3q] [^113to1WH].

> Hold on, let's not conflate macronutrient trends with proven superiority. I initially thought low-glycemic index (GI) diets might be broadly superior, but I should double-check: while some studies suggest improved insulin sensitivity and menstrual cyclicity with low-GI approaches, the overall evidence remains mixed and not sufficient to mandate low-GI as the default diet for all. Thus, low-GI can be considered when acceptable and feasible, but it is not superior to other healthy eating patterns for PCOS outcomes [^1135mbHF] [^113sngUN].

> Let me consider low-carbohydrate strategies. Very low-carb or ketogenic diets can reduce insulin and androgens and may aid short-term weight loss, but long-term adherence is challenging and nutrient adequacy must be safeguarded. Therefore, if used, they should be individualized, time-limited, and supervised, with transition back to a balanced, sustainable pattern once goals are met.

> Next, I should review Mediterranean-style patterns. Mediterranean diets are reasonable and consistent with general healthy eating, offering cardiometabolic benefits, but again, there is no PCOS-specific evidence that they outperform other balanced patterns; they remain a good option when culturally acceptable and sustainable for the individual [^113sngUN] [^113PpF2p].

> I will now examine special populations. In adolescents, I need to ensure we avoid overly restrictive diets and instead focus on age-appropriate, family-supported healthy eating and activity, with attention to growth and development. In those with normal weight, the emphasis is on preventing excess weight gain and maintaining metabolic health rather than weight loss. In those with obesity, structured, intensive support and realistic 5–10% targets are appropriate, with consideration of anti-obesity medications or bariatric surgery per general population criteria when indicated [^116nbmP1] [^113PpF2p] [^1151h5BG] [^114DncuV].

> But wait, what about behavioral strategies that make diet changes stick? I should confirm that multicomponent interventions combining diet, physical activity, and behavioral techniques improve adherence and outcomes. Addressing barriers, using motivational interviewing, and integrating psychological support are key, and any physical activity consistent with population guidelines is beneficial — there is no single exercise prescription superior to others for PCOS-specific outcomes [^113PpF2p] [^1114xTno].

> I need to ensure we screen for and manage eating disorders because restrictive diets can trigger or worsen disordered eating in PCOS. Clinicians should proactively assess for eating disorders and, if present, prioritize stabilization of eating behaviors with qualified professionals before pursuing weight-loss goals [^113sbaiQ].

> Let me reconsider supplements, especially inositol, since patients often ask. Inositol may modestly improve metabolic parameters but shows limited clinical benefits for ovulation, hirsutism, or weight. It is not a substitute for metformin when metabolic indications exist, and product quality varies, so shared decision-making and caution are warranted. Metformin remains the preferred pharmacologic option for metabolic features in adults with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² or those with impaired glucose tolerance after lifestyle therapy [^1122iLFP] [^111WRzTZ] [^111GXWnL].

> Next, I should review how to operationalize this into practical counseling. Co-create a flexible plan built on the patient's preferences, cultural foods, and routines. Set a modest energy deficit if weight loss is desired. Distribute carbohydrates across the day with emphasis on fiber and lower-GI choices when acceptable. Include lean protein and unsaturated fats. Pair with regular, enjoyable physical activity and behavioral supports to sustain change [^113sngUN] [^113PpF2p].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence strength and guideline framing so I don't overstate anything. The 2023 international guideline issues strong recommendations for lifestyle as first-line therapy and conditional recommendations emphasizing individualized, sustainable approaches without endorsing a specific diet composition; this aligns with the GRADE framework and reflects the generally low-to-moderate certainty of diet-composition evidence in PCOS [^114FgqtA] [^116p3z9t] [^111wRuA6].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical takeaway is precise: there is no single best diet for PCOS. Prioritize sustainable, population-consistent healthy eating tailored to the individual, use modest energy deficits for those with higher weight, consider low-GI or lower-carb patterns selectively if acceptable and supervised, and embed behavioral strategies and eating-disorder screening to maximize adherence and safety. Metformin is the preferred pharmacologic adjunct for metabolic indications when lifestyle alone is insufficient [^113sngUN] [^115gjgoa] [^111WRzTZ].

For PCOS, **no single diet is superior** [^113sngUN]; any sustainable, balanced pattern with modest energy restriction and regular exercise is effective [^113PpF2p]. Emphasize **high-fiber, low-GI carbohydrates** [^1135mbHF], lean protein, and unsaturated fats; limit refined carbs, added sugars, and saturated fats [^notfound]. Aim for **5–10% weight loss** [^113DHG3q] if overweight to improve insulin resistance, menstrual regularity, and androgen levels [^112KNJQq]. Individualize plans to preferences, culture, and goals [^113sngUN], and use behavioral strategies to support adherence [^115Xc7BU].

---

## General dietary principles

- **Balanced intake**: Emphasize whole foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats [^116ZeJgx].
- **Calorie awareness**: Modest energy restriction (500–750 kcal/day) supports weight loss and metabolic health [^notfound].
- **Individualization**: Tailor to preferences, culture, and goals to improve adherence [^113sngUN].
- **Sustainability**: Avoid overly restrictive diets; focus on long-term habits [^113sngUN].

---

## Macronutrient composition

Evidence does not support a **specific macronutrient ratio** as superior [^113sngUN]; individualize within general health guidelines [^113sngUN].

| **Macronutrient** | **Recommended intake** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Carbohydrates | 45–55% of total calories | - Emphasize low-GI, high-fiber sources [^1135mbHF] <br/> - Limit refined carbs and added sugars [^notfound] |
| Protein | 15–20% of total calories | - Promote satiety <br/> - Preserve lean mass <br/> - Include lean meats, fish, legumes, and dairy [^116ZeJgx] |
| Fat | 25–35% of total calories | - Prioritize unsaturated fats <br/> - Limit saturated/trans fats [^notfound] |

---

## Specific dietary patterns

Several patterns have been studied; **none is clearly superior** [^113sngUN], so choose based on preference and sustainability [^113sngUN].

- **Mediterranean diet**: High in monounsaturated fats, fiber, and antioxidants; improves insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular risk [^notfound].
- **Low-GI diet**: Improves insulin sensitivity and menstrual regularity [^1135mbHF]; may be beneficial for insulin-resistant patients [^1135mbHF].
- **Low-carbohydrate diet**: Short-term improvements in insulin resistance and weight; long-term adherence and safety require caution [^notfound].

---

## Weight management

Weight loss of **5–10%** [^113DHG3q] significantly improves insulin sensitivity, menstrual regularity, and androgen levels [^112KNJQq]. Even without weight loss, **healthy eating and activity** improve metabolic health and quality of life [^113PpF2p].

---

## Role of supplements

- **Inositol**: May improve insulin sensitivity and ovulation; evidence is limited and heterogeneous [^1122iLFP].
- **Omega-3 fatty acids**: May reduce inflammation and improve lipid profiles; more research is needed [^notfound].
- **Vitamin D**: Correct deficiencies; no clear benefit beyond repletion [^notfound].

---

## Practical dietary recommendations

- **Breakfast**: Oatmeal with berries and nuts; Greek yogurt with flaxseed [^notfound].
- **Lunch**: Grilled chicken salad with olive oil vinaigrette; lentil soup with whole-grain bread [^notfound].
- **Dinner**: Baked salmon with quinoa and roasted vegetables; tofu stir-fry with brown rice [^notfound].
- **Snacks**: Apple with almond butter; hummus with raw vegetables [^notfound].

---

## Barriers and facilitators

Barriers include **weight stigma**, psychological factors, socioeconomic constraints, and lack of support [^115NyoUo] [^113sngUN]; facilitators include **education**, family involvement, and access to dietitians [^1123bnaD] [^113sngUN].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no one-size-fits-all diet** for PCOS [^113sngUN]; emphasize balanced, sustainable eating with modest energy restriction and regular exercise. Individualize plans, address barriers, and use behavioral support to improve adherence and outcomes [^113PpF2p].

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^115gjgoa]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) lifestyle and weight management — In those with higher weight, weight management can be associated with significant clinical improvements and key points need to be considered including a lifelong focus on prevention of further weight gain, a tailored energy deficit when weight loss is the goal, the value of improvement in central adiposity or metabolic health, and the need for ongoing assessment and support. Healthcare professionals should be aware of weight stigma when discussing lifestyle management with women with PCOS. Healthy lifestyle and optimal weight management, in the context of structured, intensive, and ongoing clinical support, appears equally effective in PCOS as in the general population. In those who are not overweight, in the adolescent and at key life points, the focus should be on healthy lifestyle and the prevention of excess weight gain. Although insulin resistance is a pathophysiological factor in PCOS, clinically available insulin assays are of limited clinical relevance and should not be used in routine care.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — inositol for infertility: Inositol in any form alone, or in combination with other therapies, should be considered experimental therapy in women with PCOS with infertility, with benefits and risks currently too uncertain to recommend the use of these agents as fertility therapies. There is limited evidence with uncertain results, on the effect of inositol on ovulation, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. Side effects and safety are not known for inositol. Women need to be aware that these agents can have limited regulation with variable dose, quality, consistency, and combination with other agents. Women's personal goals and preferences should be considered when discussing complimentary therapies.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) guideline — scope and development: The international evidence-based guideline addresses prioritized questions and outcomes and include 254 recommendations and practice points, to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS. The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from six continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. The 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline update reengaged the 2018 network across professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages, and extensive evidence synthesis was completed. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant processes were followed, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength. Governance included a six-continent international advisory and management committee, five guideline development groups, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees.

### Defining the impact of dietary macronutrient balance on PCOS traits [^112zktGP]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Lifestyle, mainly dietary, interventions are first-line treatment for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but the optimal diet remains undefined. We combined a hyperandrogenized PCOS mouse model with a systematic macronutrient approach, to elucidate the impact of dietary macronutrients on the development of PCOS. We identify that an optimum dietary macronutrient balance of a low protein, medium carbohydrate and fat diet can ameliorate key PCOS reproductive traits. However, PCOS mice display a hindered ability for their metabolic system to respond to diet variations, and varying macronutrient balance did not have a beneficial effect on the development of metabolic PCOS traits. We reveal that PCOS traits in a hyperandrogenic PCOS mouse model are ameliorated selectively by diet, with reproductive traits displaying greater sensitivity than metabolic traits to dietary macronutrient balance. Hence, providing evidence to support the development of evidence-based dietary interventions as a promising strategy for the treatment of PCOS, especially reproductive traits.

### Lifestyle management in polycystic ovary syndrome-beyond diet and physical activity [^115Xc7BU]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition affecting reproductive-aged women with reproductive, metabolic and psychological consequences. Weight and lifestyle (diet, physical activity and behavioural) management are first-line therapy in international evidence-based guidelines for PCOS. While these recommend following population-level diet and physical activity guidelines, there is ongoing interest and research in the potential benefit of including psychological and sleep interventions, as well as a range of traditional, complimentary and integrative medicine (TCIM) approaches, for optimal management of PCOS. There is limited evidence to recommend a specific diet composition for PCOS with approaches including modifying protein, carbohydrate or fat quality or quantity generally having similar effects on the presentations of PCOS. With regards to physical activity, promising evidence supports the provision of vigorous aerobic exercise, which has been shown to improve body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness and insulin resistance. Psychological and sleep interventions are also important considerations, with women displaying poor emotional wellbeing and higher rates of clinical and subclinical sleep disturbance, potentially limiting their ability to make positive lifestyle change. While optimising sleep and emotional wellbeing may aid symptom management in PCOS, research exploring the efficacy of clinical interventions is lacking. Uptake of TCIM approaches, in particular supplement and herbal medicine use, by women with PCOS is growing. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to support integration into routine clinical practice. Research investigating inositol supplementation have produced the most promising findings, showing improved metabolic profiles and reduced hyperandrogenism. Findings for other supplements, herbal medicines, acupuncture and yoga is so far inconsistent, and to reduce heterogeneity more research in specific PCOS populations, (e.g. defined age and BMI ranges) and consistent approaches to intervention delivery, duration and comparators are needed. While there are a range of lifestyle components in addition to population-recommendations for diet and physical activity of potential benefit in PCOS, robust clinical trials are warranted to expand the relatively limited evidence-base regarding holistic lifestyle management. With consumer interest in holistic healthcare rising, healthcare providers will be required to broaden their knowledge pertaining to how these therapies can be safely and appropriately utilised as adjuncts to conventional medical management.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^117KpfYo]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — risks, outcomes, and management guidance — notes that women with PCOS who desire a pregnancy may be at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes (level B), and babies born from women with PCOS may have increased morbidity and mortality (level B). Miscarriage rates are not increased in natural conceptions in women with PCOS, independent of obesity, and miscarriage rates after induction of ovulation mirror those found in other infertile populations (level A). During pregnancy, there is a higher incidence of gestational diabetes (GDM) (40% to 50%), gestational hypertensive disorders (5%), and birth of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) babies (10% to 15%), with associated fetal macrosomia. Women with PCOS should be observed closely during pregnancy as they may be at increased risk for the development of GDM, gestational hypertension, and associated complications (level B), and health should be optimized before conception with advice about smoking cessation, lifestyle, diet, and appropriate vitamin supplementation (e.g., folic acid) (GPP). Regarding metformin, the use of metformin for women with anovulatory PCOS has no benefit with respect to enhancing either fertility or live-birth rates, and its routine use is not recommended, and there is no evidence for improved live-birth rates or decreased pregnancy complications with the use of metformin either before conception or during pregnancy (level A). Pregnancy-associated risks are greater in women diagnosed by more classic (NIH) criteria as opposed to nonhyperandrogenic women (level B).

### Dietary advice before and during pregnancy… [^116ZeJgx]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Food Safety for Moms-To-Be Main Page Nutritionists recommend that everyone consume a balanced diet, including:

- A variety of vegetables from all the subgroups — dark green, red and orange, legumes, starchy, and other
- Fruits, especially whole fruits
- Fat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and or fortified soy beverages
- A variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes and nuts, seeds, and soy products
- Oils
- Grains, at least half of which are whole. In addition to the information above, if you are or might become pregnant, you can find information to help you make informed food choices in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. This page includes more resources about folic acid and eating fish and grains for your developing baby's health. On this page:

- Consume Folic Acid Before and During Pregnancy
- Follow Our Advice About Eating Fish
- Eat a Variety of Grains.

Consume Folic Acid Before and During Pregnancy Hispanic women/Latinas face unique challenges when trying to meet folic acid recommendations and are more likely to have a child born with a neural tube defect than non-Hispanic White and Black women. To address this health disparity and help others who eat foods made with corn masa flour get the recommended daily value of folic acid, the FDA is encouraging food manufacturers to add folic acid to corn masa flour. If you are or may become pregnant, you should consume 400 micrograms of folic acid daily. You can get folic acid from dietary supplements or foods fortified with folic acid.

Folic acid is sometimes added to staple foods to help people meet their daily needs, including:

- Enriched breads, pasta, rice, and breakfast cereals
- Fortified corn masa flour It's important to check ingredient lists on products before you buy them to make sure they contain folic acid. Eat a Variety of Grains If you are or might become pregnant you should consume a variety of foods, including whole grains such as wheat, oats, and barley for good nutrition. In addition to vegetables and fruits, grains are some of the important sources of many nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber that help support a healthy pregnancy.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112Yj7r7]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — treatment of dyslipidemia — Therapeutic management of dyslipidemia in PCOS should be focused on reversing all components of the metabolic syndrome through diet, exercise, and medication, if needed. Metformin is frequently used to improve insulin sensitivity and is low cost, and relatively safe, but metformin is not first line therapy for ovulation induction in PCOS women who desire pregnancy. First-line therapy for ovulation induction through reducing insulin resistance is lifestyle modification, and weight loss should be targeted in all overweight/obese women with PCOS. All lipid-lowering medications, including statins, have been used in women with PCOS to treat lipid disturbances, and it is necessary to educate women on the importance of pregnancy avoidance with some lipid lowering agents.

### Effect of a low glycemic index compared with a conventional healthy diet on polycystic ovary syndrome [^1135mbHF]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are intrinsically insulin resistant and have a high risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Weight loss improves risk factors, but the optimal diet composition is unknown. Low-glycemic index (low-GI) diets are recommended without evidence of their clinical effectiveness.

Objective

We compared changes in insulin sensitivity and clinical outcomes after similar weight losses after consumption of a low-GI diet compared with a conventional healthy diet in women with PCOS.

Design

We assigned overweight and obese premenopausal women with PCOS (n = 96) to consume either an ad libitum low-GI diet or a macronutrient-matched healthy diet and followed the women for 12 mo or until they achieved a 7% weight loss. We compared changes in whole-body insulin sensitivity, which we assessed using the insulin sensitivity index derived from the oral-glucose-tolerance test (ISI(OGTT)); glucose tolerance; body composition; plasma lipids; reproductive hormones; health-related quality of life; and menstrual cycle regularity.

Results

The attrition rate was high in both groups (49%). Among completers, ISI(OGTT) improved more with the low-GI diet than with the conventional healthy diet (mean ± SEM: 2.2 ± 0.7 compared with 0.7 ± 0.6, respectively; P = 0.03). There was a significant diet-metformin interaction (P = 0.048), with greater improvement in ISI(OGTT) among women prescribed both metformin and the low-GI diet. Compared with women who consumed the conventional healthy diet, more women who consumed the low-GI diet showed improved menstrual cyclicity (95% compared with 63%, respectively; P = 0.03). Among the biochemical measures, only serum fibrinogen concentrations showed significant differences between diets (P < 0.05).

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines including 166 recommendations and practice points, addressed prioritized questions to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes of women with PCOS.

What Is Known Already

Previous guidelines either lacked rigorous evidence-based processes, did not engage consumer and international multidisciplinary perspectives, or were outdated. Diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial and assessment and management are inconsistent. The needs of women with PCOS are not being adequately met and evidence practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

International evidence-based guideline development engaged professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II-compliant processes were followed, with extensive evidence synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

Governance included a six continent international advisory and a project board, five guideline development groups (GDGs), and consumer and translation committees. Extensive health professional and consumer engagement informed guideline scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included pediatrics, endocrinology, gynecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, and translation experts. Thirty-seven societies and organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty face-to-face meetings over 15 months addressed 60 prioritized clinical questions involving 40 systematic and 20 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels.

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: (a) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; (b) reducing unnecessary testing; (c) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and (d) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

Metformin — adults and adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): Metformin alone should be considered in adults with PCOS and a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 for anthropometric and metabolic outcomes including insulin resistance, glucose, and lipid profiles; metformin alone could be considered in adolescents at risk of or with PCOS for cycle regulation, acknowledging limited evidence; and metformin alone may be considered in adults with PCOS and BMI < 25 kg/ m2, acknowledging limited evidence. Where metformin is prescribed the following need to be considered: shared decision making needs to consider feasibility and effectiveness of active lifestyle intervention and women should be informed that metformin and active lifestyle intervention have similar efficacy; mild adverse effects, including gastrointestinal side-effects are generally dose dependent and self-limiting; starting at a low dose, with 500mg increments 1–2 weekly and extended-release preparations may minimize side effects and improve adherence; suggested maximum daily dose is 2.5 g in adults and 2g in adolescents; use appears safe long-term, based on use in other populations, however indications for ongoing requirement needs to be considered; and use may be associated with low vitamin B12 levels, where monitoring should be considered.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) dietary intervention — Healthcare professionals and women should consider that there is no evidence to support any one type of diet composition over another for anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal, reproductive or psychological outcomes. Any diet composition consistent with population guidelines for healthy eating will have health benefits and, within this, healthcare professionals should advise sustainable healthy eating tailored to individual preferences and goals. Tailoring of dietary changes to food preferences, allowing for a flexible, individual and co-developed approach to achieving nutritional goals, and avoiding unduly restrictive and nutritionally unbalanced diets, are important, as per general population guidelines. Barriers and facilitators to optimize engagement and adherence to dietary change should be discussed, including psychological factors, physical limitations, socioeconomic and sociocultural factors, as well as personal motivators for change. The value of broader family engagement should be considered. Referral to suitably trained allied healthcare professionals needs to be considered when women with PCOS need support with optimizing their diet.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) eating disorders — Eating disorders and disordered eating should be considered in PCOS, regardless of weight, especially in the context of weight management and lifestyle interventions (see sections 2.4 and 3.6). If disordered eating or eating disorders are suspected, appropriately qualified practitioners should further assess via a full diagnostic interview. If an eating disorder or disordered eating is detected, appropriate management and support should be offered.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome [^114NbQzh]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5–18% of women, and is a reproductive, metabolic, and psychological condition with impacts across the lifespan. The cause is complex, and includes genetic and epigenetic susceptibility, hypothalamic and ovarian dysfunction, excess androgen exposure, insulin resistance, and adiposity-related mechanisms. Diagnosis is recommended based on the 2003 Rotterdam criteria and confirmed with two of three criteria: hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical), irregular cycles, and polycystic ovary morphology. In adolescents, both the criteria of hyperandrogenism and irregular cycles are needed, and ovarian morphology is not included due to poor specificity. The diagnostic criteria generates four phenotypes, and clinical features are heterogeneous, with manifestations typically arising in childhood and then evolving across adolescent and adult life. Treatment involves a combination of lifestyle alterations and medical management. Lifestyle optimisation includes a healthy balanced diet and regular exercise to prevent excess weight gain, limit PCOS complications and target weight reduction when needed. Medical management options include metformin to improve insulin resistance and metabolic features, combined oral contraceptive pill for menstrual cycle regulation and hyperandrogenism, and if needed, anti-androgens for refractory hyperandrogenism. In this Review, we provide an update on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and clinical features of PCOS, and discuss the needs and priorities of those with PCOS, including lifestyle, and medical and infertility treatment. Further we discuss the status of international evidence-based guidelines (EBG) and translation, to support patient self management, healthcare provision, and to set research priorities.

### Habitual dietary intake, eating pattern and physical activity of women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^1156E3gY]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

Diet and lifestyle modifications may be of benefit in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but there is a paucity of data on these behaviours in women with PCOS. This study aims to address this through a comprehensive investigation of the habitual diet and activity patterns of UK women with PCOS and their alignment with dietary recommendations for health.

Subjects/Methods

A 7-day-estimated food and activity diary and questionnaire was completed by 210 women with PCOS for calculation of activity levels, energy and nutrient intakes and dietary glycaemic index (GI).

Results

Mean (s.d.) body mass index (BMI) was 27.4 (7.3)kg/m(2) (n = 183), with 53% of women with PCOS having a BMI > 25kg/m(2). Of the overweight women, approximately half were not achieving sufficient physical activity to promote weight loss. More frequent eating episodes and a lower BMI were weakly associated (r = -0.158, P = 0.034). Mean percentage energy from fat was 38 (7)% (12% energy from saturated fat), with 68% of women with PCOS consuming > 35% energy from fat. Mean dietary GI was higher in obese women with PCOS, compared with healthy weight women with PCOS (55.7 (3.4) and 53.8 (4.0), respectively; P = 0.043).

Conclusion

Many women with PCOS are not achieving dietary intakes and levels of physical activity that optimise symptom management and disease prevention. Advice should focus on fat quality and quantity and carbohydrate modification. There is a need for further robust research into the role of dietary GI in the PCOS population.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114NHTfG]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — androgen assessment while on combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) and monitoring: It is very difficult to reliably assess for biochemical hyperandrogenism in women on the COCP as the pill increases sex hormone-binding globulin and reduces gonadotropin-dependent androgen production, and if assessment is imperative the pill should be withdrawn for a minimum of three months and contraception should be managed otherwise during this time. For follow-up, repeated androgen measures for the ongoing assessment of PCOS in adults have a limited role, and in development, in most adolescents, androgen levels reach adult ranges at 12–15 years of age.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) preconception risk factors and counselling include that women with PCOS should be counselled on the adverse impact of excess weight on clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and live birth rates, following infertility treatment. Consistent with routine preconception care, in women with PCOS planning pregnancy, weight, blood pressure, smoking, alcohol, diet and nutritional status, folate supplementation (higher dose in those with BMI > 30 kg/ m2), exercise, sleep and mental, emotional and sexual health should be considered and optimized to improve reproductive and pregnancy outcomes and overall health. A reproductive life plan and age-appropriate education on optimizing reproductive health is recommended in adolescents and women with PCOS, including healthy lifestyle, prevention of excess weight gain, and optimizing preconception risk factors. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to seek permission and, if given, to assess weight and BMI and initiate a dialogue on the importance of weight and lifestyle on women's health before pregnancy. Chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions, should be optimally managed and women should be counselled regarding the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

### A review of therapeutic options for managing the metabolic aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome [^113JbPEF]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. Metabolic sequelae associated with PCOS range from insulin resistance to type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Insulin resistance plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of PCOS and it is a reliable marker for cardiometabolic risk. Although insulin sensitising agents such as metformin have been traditionally used for managing metabolic aspects of PCOS, their efficacy is low in terms of weight reduction and cardiovascular risk reduction compared with newer agents such as incretin mimetics and SGLT2 inhibitors. With current pharmaceutical advances, potential therapeutic options have increased, giving patients and clinicians more choices. Incretin mimetics are a promising therapy with a unique metabolic target that could be used widely in the management of PCOS. Likewise, bariatric procedures have become less invasive and result in effective weight loss and the reversal of metabolic morbidities in some patients. Therefore, surgical treatment targeting weight loss becomes increasingly common in the management of obese women with PCOS. Newer emerging therapies, including twincretins, triple GLP-1 agonists, glucagon receptor antagonists and imeglemin, are promising therapeutic options for treating T2DM. Given the similarity of metabolic and pathological features between PCOS and T2DM and the variety of therapeutic options, there is the potential to widen our strategy for treating metabolic disorders in PCOS in parallel with current therapeutic advances. The review was conducted in line with the recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome 2018.

### Treatment of obesity in polycystic ovary syndrome: a position statement of the Androgen Excess and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Society [^113b8a35]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize current evidence on lifestyle management (dietary, exercise, or behavioral interventions) of obesity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), to indicate gaps in knowledge, and to review the medical and surgical alternatives for weight management.

Design

Expert panel appointed by the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AEPCOS Society) to review the literature and draft the initial report after a consensus process via electronic communication. The initial report was reviewed and critiqued by all expert panel members and the AEPCOS Society Board of Directors and modified based on their comments.

Conclusion(S)

Lifestyle management should be used as the primary therapy in overweight and obese women with PCOS for the treatment of metabolic complications. For reproductive abnormalities, lifestyle modification may improve ovulatory function and pregnancy. Data are preliminary for improvement in pregnancy and live-birth rates, and further research is needed. There is currently no evidence that modifying dietary macronutrient composition offers additional benefits over conventional dietary approaches for weight loss, and further research is needed. Emerging evidence suggests that exercise offers additional benefits to dietary energy restriction for reproductive features of PCOS.

### Randomized comparison of the influence of dietary management and / or physical exercise on ovarian function and metabolic parameters in overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^114Pc6oo]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the influence of dietary management and/or physical exercise on ovarian function and metabolic variables in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Design

Randomized 4-month trial with three interventions and a long-term follow-up.

Setting

Women's health clinical research unit at a university hospital.

Patient(S)

Fifty-seven overweight/obese women with PCOS.

Intervention(S)

Dietary management, physical exercise, or both, using programs individually adapted and supervised by a dietician and/or a physical therapist.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Ovarian function, endocrinologic, and metabolic status and body composition.

Result(S)

On average, body mass index was reduced 6% by the dietary management, 3% by the exercise, and 5% by the combined interventions. Lower body fat and lean body mass were significantly decreased in the dietary groups, whereas upper body fat was lowered and lean body mass maintained by exercise alone. The menstrual pattern was significantly improved in 69% and ovulation confirmed in 34% of the patients, with no differences among the groups. The strongest predictor of resumed ovulation was a high serum level of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 after the intervention. Follow-up of one-half of the patients for a median of 2.8 years revealed sustained weight reduction and improvement in menstrual pattern.

Conclusion(S)

Dietary management and exercise, alone or in combination, are equally effective in improving reproductive function in overweight/obese women with PCOS. The underlying mechanisms appear to involve enhanced insulin sensitivity. Supportive individualized programs for lifestyle change could exert long-term beneficial effects.

### Special considerations for the adolescent with obesity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2024 [^113Qfaci]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescents with obesity — management focuses on insulin resistance reduction, lifestyle change, and selective adjuncts: Treatment of adolescent PCOS in the setting of obesity focuses on both reducing insulin resistance to improve androgen levels and restore menstrual function and fertility, and there is no consensus regarding what treatment to first initiate and then add a second or third line of treatment. The 2018 guidelines for management of PCOS recommend a low-calorie diet to promote weight loss in women with PCOS and obesity, but there are no recommendations on which diet works best; in general, a diet that results in lower caloric intake and weight loss will improve insulin sensitivity and can improve biochemical and clinical parameters of PCOS. Micronutrients and supplements are often suggested, but there is not enough evidence to recommend supplements in the treatment of PCOS, whereas at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity at least 3 days a week have been suggested. Adjunctive weight loss options such as AOMs or MBS are considered to optimize weight loss and improve insulin resistance; GLP-1 agonists have been studied in women with obesity and PCOS and found to reduce body weight and improve hyperandrogenism and ovulatory function, and MBS as a treatment for PCOS has not been studied in adolescents, with adult studies indicating weight loss and improvement in ovarian function, insulin resistance, and menstrual regulation.

### A randomized pilot study of dietary treatments for polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents [^115La5nY]. Pediatric Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence is lacking to recommend one diet over another when treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Objectives

To obtain preliminary data, comparing the impact of a low-glycaemic load (LGL) vs. low-fat (LF) diet on biochemical hyperandrogenism in overweight and obese adolescents with PCOS. To ascertain feasibility of recruiting study participants, in partnership with an adolescent clinic, and implementing dietary interventions.

Methods

Randomized controlled trial of 19 overweight and obese adolescents with PCOS and not using hormonal contraceptives (HCs). Interventions comprised nutrition education, dietary counselling and cooking workshops to foster adherence to a LGL (45% carbohydrate, 35% fat, 20% protein) or LF (55% carbohydrate, 25% fat, 20% protein) diet over 6 months. Serum bioavailable testosterone was the primary outcome.

Results

Sixteen (LGL, n = 7; LF, n = 9) participants completed the study. Body fat percentage decreased (P < 0.05) in response to the interventions, with no difference between the LGL and LF groups (-1.2% vs. -2.2%; P = 0.16). Bioavailable testosterone did not change for either group (-0.4 vs. -1.8ngdL(-1); P = 0.35). Regarding feasibility, recruiting adolescents posed a challenge, and use of HCs was a main reason for ineligibility. Participants attended 5.9 of 6 in-person visits and 2.6 of 3 cooking workshops, completed 4.9 of 6 telephone counselling calls, and reported high satisfaction with the diets and cooking workshops (≥ 8 on a 10-cm scale).

Conclusions

Dietary interventions were beneficial for weight control but did not attenuate biochemical hyperandrogenism. Innovative strategies are needed to recruit adolescents for studies aimed at assessing independent effects of diet on features of PCOS.

### Effect of lifestyle modifications on polycystic ovary syndrome in predominantly young adults: a systematic review [^1166HFWL]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To improve counseling and outcomes for the adolescent population (ages 10–24-years-old), with polycystic ovary syndrome we conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with the primary objective to generate evidence-based recommendations for which lifestyle interventions with or without medications lead to the best outcomes.

Methods

A literature search was conducted. Randomized controlled trials on lifestyle interventions with or without medications in the adolescent population were included. Nonrandomized trials, case-control studies, observational studies, and animal studies were excluded. Of 3,699 articles, 13 studies including 789 participants were included. Each included study was assessed for bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. Due to significant interstudy heterogeneity, meta-analysis was infeasible; we synthesized results across lifestyle intervention/control types and outcome.

Results

Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria. These studies offer mixed support for lifestyle interventions improving hyperandrogenism. There is some evidence that lifestyle interventions improve menstrual regularity, cardiometabolic health, and metabolic function. Almost all studies found reduced body mass index, adiposity among participants who completed combined exercise and diet, exercise only, and diet only interventions.

Conclusions

The studies in this systematic review demonstrated that lifestyle interventions incorporating increased physical activity and/or healthy dietary choices show beneficial effects in the adolescent population aged ≥ 18-years-old with polycystic ovary syndrome. Medications may also play a key role in treating the disorder. More quality research is needed to identify specific lifestyle interventions that optimize the management of polycystic ovary syndrome amongst those aged 10–17-years-old as well.

### International evidence-based recommendations for polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents [^116nbmP1]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

During adolescence, accurate diagnostic criteria and/or identification of adolescents "at risk" of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are critical to establish appropriate screening, treatment, and lifelong health plans. The 2023 International Evidence-Based Guideline for PCOS aimed to provide the most up-to-date evidence-based recommendations to improve health outcomes for individuals with PCOS, emphasizing accurate and timely diagnosis of PCOS from adolescence.

Methods

The best practice methods following the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE-II) criteria were applied. Healthcare professionals and patients/consumers reviewed extensive evidence synthesis/meta-analysis for 55 prioritized clinical questions. Databases (OVID MEDLINE, All EBM, PsycInfo, EMBASE, CINAHL) were searched until August 2022 as part of the 2023 update of the Guideline. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework guided experts on evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation, and ultimately recommendation strength.

Results

This manuscript focuses on the adolescent-specific recommendations of the 2023 Guideline. The diagnosis is based on the presence of both irregular menstrual cycles (defined according to the time postmenarche) and clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism following the exclusion of other disorders that mimic PCOS. Adolescents with only one of these features can be considered "at risk" of PCOS requiring the management of symptoms and ongoing follow-up. Polycystic ovarian morphology on pelvic ultrasonography or anti-Müllerian hormone levels should not be used for diagnosis during adolescence. Lifelong health planning is recommended to include healthy lifestyles, screening for depression and metabolic features and the transition to adult care, all underpinned by shared decision-making. Healthcare professionals should explain weight-related health risks to adolescents, while minimizing weight stigma. In adolescents with PCOS or "at risk" of PCOS, combined oral contraceptive pills are indicated for menstrual irregularity and clinical hyperandrogenism, focusing on low dose preparations, and metformin could be considered for metabolic features and cycle regulation. Overall, the evidence is limited in adolescents with PCOS, and recommendations are based on low to moderate certainty evidence.

Conclusions

Extensive international engagement and rigorous processes generated International Guideline diagnostic criteria for adolescents that differ from adult criteria and clarified appropriate screening and management strategies for PCOS during adolescence.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^113PpF2p]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — lifestyle management recommends that lifestyle intervention (exercise alone or multicomponent diet combined with exercise and behavioural strategies) should be recommended for all women with PCOS, for improving metabolic health including central adiposity and lipid profile. Healthy lifestyle behaviours encompassing healthy eating and/or physical activity should be recommended in all women with PCOS to optimize general health, quality of life, body composition and weight management (maintaining weight, preventing weight gain and/or modest weight loss). Healthcare professionals should be aware that lifestyle management is a core focus in PCOS management, lifestyle management goals and priorities should be co-developed in partnership with women with PCOS, and value women's individualized preferences, and there are benefits to a healthy lifestyle even in the absence of weight loss.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk, screening, and management: PCOS is a major risk factor for developing IGT and T2D (level A), and obesity is an exacerbating factor in this development in PCOS (level A). Screening for IGT and T2D should be performed by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (75 g, 0- and 2-hour values), with no utility for measuring insulin in most cases (level C). Screening should be performed in hyperandrogenism with anovulation, acanthosis nigricans, and obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2, or > 25 in Asian populations), and in women with a family history of T2D or GDM (level C). Diet and lifestyle are first choice for improving fertility and prevention of diabetes (level B). Metformin may be used for IGT and T2D (level A), and clinicians should avoid use of other insulin sensitizing agents such as thiazolidinediones (GPP).

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^115NyoUo]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Weight-inclusive care and stigma in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — Healthcare professionals should be aware of weight-inclusive practices which promote acceptance of and respect for body size diversity and focus on improvement of health behaviours and health outcomes for people of all sizes. In PCOS this includes acknowledging that whilst higher weight is a risk factor for PCOS and its complications, it is only one indicator of health and broader factors should be assessed, asking permission to discuss and measure weight and using strategies to minimize discomfort (e.g., blind weighing), recognizing that the terms "overweight" and "obese/obesity" can be stigmatizing with suggested alternatives including "higher weight", explaining how weight information will be used to inform risks, prevention and treatment, ensuring appropriate equipment is available for women of all sizes, offering options of weight-centric care or weight-inclusive care tailored to individual goals and preferences, and offering all women best practice assessment, treatment and support regardless of weight. Increasing awareness of weight stigma among family members of women and adolescents with PCOS should be considered.

### Assessment of cardiovascular risk and prevention of cardiovascular disease in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome: a consensus statement by the androgen excess and polycystic ovary syndrome (AE-PCOS) society [^114JRaVf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) often have cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The Androgen Excess and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (AE-PCOS) Society created a panel to provide evidence-based reviews of studies assessing PCOS-CVD risk relationships and to develop guidelines for preventing CVD.

Participants

An expert panel in PCOS and CVD reviewed literature and presented recommendations.

Evidence

Only studies comparing PCOS with control patients were included. All electronic databases were searched; reviews included individual studies/databases, systematic reviews, abstracts, and expert data. Articles were excluded if other hyperandrogenic disorders were not excluded, PCOS diagnosis was unclear, controls were not described, or methodology precluded evaluation. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were confirmed by at least two reviewers and arbitrated by a third.

Consensus Process

Systematic reviews of CVD risk factors were compiled and submitted for approval to the AE-PCOS Society Board.

Conclusions

Women with PCOS with obesity, cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, and subclinical vascular disease are at risk, whereas those with metabolic syndrome and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus are at high risk for CVD. Body mass index, waist circumference, serum lipid/glucose, and blood pressure determinations are recommended for all women with PCOS, as is oral glucose tolerance testing in those with obesity, advanced age, personal history of gestational diabetes, or family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Mood disorder assessment is suggested in all PCOS patients. Lifestyle management is recommended for primary CVD prevention, targeting low-density and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and adding insulin-sensitizing and other drugs if dyslipidemia or other risk factors persist.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114FgqtA]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) guideline — recommendation categories are defined and applied as follows: "Guideline recommendations are presented by category, terms used, evidence quality and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework considerations" and "Category includes evidence-based (sufficient evidence in PCOS) or consensus (insufficient evidence in PCOS, hence evidence in general or relevant populations was considered) recommendations and accompanying practice points (implementation considerations) (Table 1)". Evidence Based Recommendations (EBR) are defined as "Evidence sufficient to inform a recommendation made by the guideline development group". Consensus Recommendations (CR) state "In the absence of adequate evidence, a consensus recommendation has been made by the guideline development group, also informed by evidence from the general population". Practice Points (PP) indicate "Evidence not sought. A practice point has been made by the guideline development group where important issues arose from discussion of evidence-based or consensus recommendations".

### Clinical management of pregnancy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: an expert opinion [^115a69gA]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with a higher risk for pregnancy and birth complications according to the specific features associated with PCOS. The features include obesity before and during pregnancy, hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, infertility, cardiometabolic risk factors, and poor mental health. PCOS is not often recognized as a risk factor for poor pregnancy and birth outcomes in pregnancy care guidelines, while its associated features are. Pregnancy-related risk profile should ideally be assessed for modifiable risk factors (e.g., lifestyle and weight management) at preconception in women with PCOS. Hyperglycaemia should be screened using a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test at preconception or within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy if it has not been performed at preconception and should be repeated at 24–28 weeks of pregnancy. In the absence of evidence of benefit for strategies specific to women with PCOS, the international evidence-based guidelines for the assessment and management of PCOS recommend screening, optimizing, and monitoring risk profile in women with PCOS (at preconception, during and postpregnancy) consistent with the recommendations for the general population. Recommended factors include blood glucose, weight, blood pressure, smoking, alcohol, diet, exercise, sleep and mental health, emotional, and sexual health among women with PCOS. The guidelines recommend Metformin in addition to lifestyle for assisting with weight management and improving cardiometabolic risk factors, particularly in those with overweight or obesity. Letrozole is considered the first-line pharmacological treatment for anovulatory infertility in PCOS. Individualized approach should be considered in the management of pregnancy in PCOS.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and quality assessment study [^112Mm9gy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are key instruments to implement the practice of evidence-based medicine. We aimed to evaluate the methodological quality and variations in CPGs recommendations on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Evidence Acquisition

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL until December 2020 for all evidence-based CPGs and consensus statements on PCOS. We extracted data in duplicate to map clinical recommendations across prespecified disease domains and assessed CPGs methodological quality of using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research & Evaluation II tool.

Evidence Synthesis

We included 13 PCOS CPGs published between 2007 and 2018. CPGs recommendations were mostly focused on screening for and managing metabolic disease (12/13, 92%), followed by cardiovascular risk assessment (10/13, 77%). Mental health (8/13, 62%) and diagnosis in adolescents (7/13, 54%) were the least reported domains. Most CPGs had a high quality for scope and purpose description (12/13, 92%) while stakeholder's involvement and applicability of recommendations to clinical practice were appropriate in only 2 CPGs (2/13, 15%). We identified inconsistency in recommendations on PCOS diagnosis in adolescents, optimal lifestyle interventions, hirsutism and acne treatments, interventions to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, the frequency and screening criteria for metabolic and cardiovascular disease, and optimal screening tools for mental health illness in women with PCOS.

Conclusion

Current CPGs on the diagnosis and management of PCOS vary in their scope and methodological quality, which may hinder evidence translation into clinical practice. We identified disease domains with existing evidence gap to guide future research and guideline updates.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114sxcpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Participants

An Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer developed the guideline.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines. Two systematic reviews were conducted to summarize supporting evidence.

Conclusions

We suggest using the Rotterdam criteria for diagnosing PCOS (presence of two of the following criteria: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries). Establishing a diagnosis of PCOS is problematic in adolescents and menopausal women. Hyperandrogenism is central to the presentation in adolescents, whereas there is no consistent phenotype in postmenopausal women. Evaluation of women with PCOS should exclude alternate androgen-excess disorders and risk factors for endometrial cancer, mood disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line management for menstrual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne in PCOS. Clomiphene is currently the first-line therapy for infertility; metformin is beneficial for metabolic/glycemic abnormalities and for improving menstrual irregularities, but it has limited or no benefit in treating hirsutism, acne, or infertility. Hormonal contraceptives and metformin are the treatment options in adolescents with PCOS. The role of weight loss in improving PCOS status per se is uncertain, but lifestyle intervention is beneficial in overweight/obese patients for other health benefits. Thiazolidinediones have an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio overall, and statins require further study.
