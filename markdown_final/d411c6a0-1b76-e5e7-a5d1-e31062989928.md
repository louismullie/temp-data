## Question

Does the injection route (interlaminar vs transforaminal) modify the benefit of adding epidural corticosteroid in lumbar spinal stenosis according to LESS?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the injection route (interlaminar vs transforaminal) modifies the benefit of adding epidural corticosteroid in lumbar spinal stenosis, specifically according to the LESS trial and related evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the LESS trial's design and prespecified subgroup analysis. Then, I should verify the exact results and statistical interpretation. Next, I will review corroborating or conflicting evidence from other randomized trials and meta-analyses. After that, I need to consider mechanistic plausibility and guideline positions. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and note limitations and exceptions, making sure I anchor each claim to the best available sources.

> Let me first confirm the trial and its analytic plan. LESS was a multicenter, double-blind RCT of 400 patients with lumbar central spinal stenosis and moderate-to-severe leg pain/disability, randomized to epidural glucocorticoid plus lidocaine versus lidocaine alone, with the primary outcome at 6 weeks and a prespecified subgroup analysis by injection approach (interlaminar vs transforaminal), which directly addresses the user's question about route-specific effects of adding steroid [^1ab58d4c] [^d067a274].

> Wait, let me verify the exact results before drawing conclusions. The NEJM report states that at 6 weeks there was no significant between-group difference in Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire scores overall, and critically, the prespecified subgroup analysis by injection type likewise showed no significant differences at 6 weeks, indicating that neither interlaminar nor transforaminal routes conferred a steroid benefit over local anesthetic alone in this population and timeframe [^d067a274] [^1ab58d4c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check whether any secondary signals contradict this. A secondary analysis of LESS found that short-term disability change mediated patient satisfaction, but this does not imply a steroid-specific benefit by route; it reflects that early functional gains drive satisfaction irrespective of injectate, which aligns with the null between-group findings for steroid addition in LESS [^eec5f399]. I should also confirm that imaging severity did not identify a responsive subgroup; indeed, a secondary analysis showed no interaction between stenosis severity on imaging and injectate type at 3 weeks, reinforcing the lack of a steroid advantage even when considering anatomic severity [^3efbfdd2].

> Next, I should review corroborating evidence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of epidural corticosteroids for spinal stenosis concluded there was no clear benefit for ESIs in stenosis, and importantly, the LESS trial is a major contributor to that conclusion, which supports the inference that route-specific steroid effects are unlikely in this pathology [^edaaa74c]. Let me also consider comparative effectiveness data; multiple high-quality syntheses indicate that local anesthetic alone performs similarly to local anesthetic plus steroid for spinal stenosis symptoms, again arguing against a route-modified steroid benefit in this condition [^a2b8e0b6] [^4fea79b8].

> But wait, what if other randomized trials suggest route-specific advantages that LESS missed? I need to check. Some interventional pain society guidelines and reviews cite studies showing modest benefits of epidural injections for stenosis, yet these often include heterogeneous populations, non-placebo active controls, or allow repeat injections that confound attribution to steroid versus local anesthetic or natural history; in contrast, LESS's rigorous, blinded, head-to-head design and its prespecified route subgroup provide the clearest direct test and found no route-specific steroid advantage [^b6b8f8b9] [^d067a274]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a small study might have shown transforaminal superiority at 6 months, but on rechecking, those comparative-route claims are inconsistent across trials and not replicated in high-quality, blinded designs for stenosis, so I should not over-interpret them against LESS's null finding [^9e6fd376].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility to see if there is a reason to expect route-specific steroid effects in central stenosis. Central canal stenosis involves multilevel, bilateral neural element compromise where targeted delivery to a single nerve root may be less relevant, and both interlaminar and transforaminal approaches distribute medication differently; however, LESS's null results suggest that steroid distribution nuances did not translate into clinically meaningful differences in pain or function at 6 weeks, which tempers enthusiasm for route-specific steroid benefits in this pathology [^a3622cff] [^d067a274].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. Major guidelines diverge: some interventional societies allow consideration of ESIs in stenosis with attention to response and repeat intervals, whereas others advise against routine use for stenosis; notably, none assert a route-specific steroid advantage, and the most definitive RCT signal from LESS supports a conservative interpretation that adding steroid does not improve outcomes regardless of interlaminar or transforaminal approach in central stenosis [^9144f408] [^19967d31] [^d067a274].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. According to LESS, the injection route (interlaminar vs transforaminal) does not modify the benefit of adding epidural corticosteroid in lumbar central spinal stenosis; there was no significant between-group difference overall and no significant interaction by route at 6 weeks, and this is consistent with broader evidence showing no clear steroid benefit in stenosis and similar performance of local anesthetic with or without steroid in this condition [^d067a274] [^edaaa74c] [^a2b8e0b6]. I should confirm the clinical implication: for short-term symptom relief in central stenosis, both routes appear acceptable, but adding steroid does not reliably improve outcomes, so shared decision-making should weigh limited benefit against potential risks and costs, and if injections are used, they should be viewed as a time-limited diagnostic/therapeutic trial rather than a disease-modifying strategy [^d067a274] [^c080c703].

> Finally, I need to ensure I note limitations and exceptions. LESS evaluated one or two injections over 6 weeks and did not test repeated dosing strategies or caudal approaches; some studies and guidelines allow repeat injections only if there is meaningful, durable benefit, and they caution about systemic steroid effects with repeated dosing, so our conclusions are most secure for the short-term, single- or dual-injection context of LESS and may not generalize to long-term serial regimens or different pathoanatomy such as isolated foraminal stenosis or radiculopathy from disc herniation, where steroid effects may differ [^69628a92] [^6daa3116] [^d067a274].

---

The LESS trial found that **adding corticosteroid to epidural injections provides no significant benefit over local anesthetic alone** for lumbar spinal stenosis, and this lack of benefit is consistent across interlaminar and transforaminal approaches [^d067a274]. Both routes produced similar short-term improvements in pain and function, with **no clinically meaningful difference between interlaminar and transforaminal injections** [^d067a274]. Therefore, the injection route does not modify the effect of adding corticosteroid, and clinicians should not expect superior outcomes with either approach when steroids are added [^d067a274].

---

## Study design and methodology

The LESS trial was a **multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial** that enrolled 400 patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and moderate-to-severe leg pain and disability [^1ab58d4c]. Participants were randomized to receive either epidural injections of corticosteroids plus lidocaine or lidocaine alone, with the injection approach (interlaminar or transforaminal) selected at the discretion of the treating physician [^d067a274]. The primary outcome was the change in the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score at 6 weeks, with secondary outcomes including leg pain intensity, back pain intensity, and patient satisfaction [^1ab58d4c].

---

## Key findings

- **Primary outcome**: At 6 weeks, there was no significant difference in RMDQ scores between the corticosteroid plus lidocaine group and the lidocaine-alone group (adjusted difference, -1.0 points; 95% CI, -2.1 to 0.1; P = 0.07) [^1ab58d4c].

- **Secondary outcomes**: No significant differences were observed in leg pain intensity, back pain intensity, or patient satisfaction between the two groups [^1ab58d4c].

- **Subgroup analysis**: Prespecified subgroup analysis stratified by injection type (interlaminar vs. transforaminal) likewise showed no significant differences at 6 weeks [^d067a274].

---

## Clinical implications

The LESS trial's findings have **important clinical implications**:

- **Lack of benefit**: Adding corticosteroids to epidural injections does not provide significant clinical benefit over local anesthetic alone in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis [^d067a274].

- **Route independence**: The injection route (interlaminar vs. transforaminal) does not modify the lack of benefit associated with corticosteroid addition [^d067a274].

- **Cost and safety considerations**: Given the lack of benefit, clinicians should consider the potential risks and costs associated with corticosteroid injections, including systemic cortisol suppression and other adverse effects [^b60944c0].

---

## Comparison with other studies

The LESS trial's findings align with other studies and systematic reviews that have questioned the **effectiveness of epidural corticosteroid injections** for lumbar spinal stenosis. A systematic review published in the Annals of Internal Medicine concluded that there was limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of epidural corticosteroid injections for spinal stenosis, with small, short-term benefits at best [^edaaa74c]. Similarly, the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) guidelines recommend against routine use of epidural corticosteroid injections for spinal stenosis due to lack of significant benefit [^9f0ab70a].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While the LESS trial provides robust evidence, certain limitations should be considered:

- **Short-term follow-up**: The primary outcome was assessed at 6 weeks, limiting the ability to evaluate long-term benefits or harms [^1ab58d4c].

- **Variability in injection technique**: The injection approach and corticosteroid dose were left to the discretion of the treating physician, introducing potential variability in technique and dosing [^fce0f8f8].

- **Patient selection**: The trial included patients with moderate-to-severe leg pain and disability, and the findings may not generalize to patients with milder symptoms or different clinical presentations [^1ab58d4c].

---

## Conclusion

The LESS trial demonstrates that **adding corticosteroids to epidural injections does not provide significant clinical benefit over local anesthetic alone** in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, and this lack of benefit is consistent across interlaminar and transforaminal approaches [^d067a274]. Clinicians should carefully consider the limited evidence supporting corticosteroid use and weigh potential risks and costs when deciding on treatment options for lumbar spinal stenosis.

Study Design

Secondary analysis of lumbar epidural steroid injections for spinal stenosis randomized controlled trial data.

Objective

To reevaluate whether outcomes for older adults receiving epidural steroid injections with or without corticosteroid improve after using patient-prioritized Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) items.

Summary Of Background Data

Epidural corticosteroid injections are commonly used to treat lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms, despite limited evidence for their effectiveness in clinical trials. It is unclear whether evaluating patient-prioritized outcomes would alter results of a large clinical trial.

Methods

Outcomes from the trial of lumbar epidural corticosteroid injections for spinal stenosis (LESS) trial were reanalyzed using RDQ, Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) weights assigned to the RDQ items, and patient-prioritized RDQ items. Differences between corticosteroid+lidocaine versus lidocaine-alone groups and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using analysis of covariance with adjustment for baseline values of the RDQ and recruitment site.

Results

At 6 weeks, both the corticosteroid+lidocaine group and the lidocaine-alone group had improvement in the RDQ scores (RDQ, RDQ using SIP weights, patient-prioritized RDQ) as compared with baseline scores (corticosteroid+lidocaine: -4.2 points, -4.1 points, -4.2; lidocaine-alone: -3.1 points, -2.9 points, and -3.1 points, respectively). However, there was no significant between-group difference in the RDQ or patient-prioritized RDQ (average treatment effect -1.0 points, 95% CI -2.1 to 0.1, P = 0.07; -1.0 points, 95% CI -2.0 to 0.1, P = 0.08, respectively). Although the between-group difference of RDQ using SIP weights was statistically significant (average treatment effect -1.1, 95% CI -2.2 to -0.1, P = 0.04), this was not clinically important.

Conclusion

Results of the LESS trial did not substantively differ based on reanalysis of data using RDQ with SIP weights or patient-prioritized RDQ outcomes. This provides additional evidence that epidural injection of corticosteroid+lidocaine offered minimal or no short-term benefit as compared with epidural injection of lidocaine alone for older adults with lumbar spinal stenosis.

### A randomized trial of epidural glucocorticoid injections for spinal stenosis [^1ab58d4c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The study LESS was published by Friedly JL and colleagues in 2014 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Lumbar spinal stenosis. In the LESS study, the trial question was: what is the role of epidural corticosteroid injections in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis? In the LESS study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the LESS study, the population was: 400 patients (221 female, 179 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who had lumbar central spinal stenosis and moderate-to-severe leg pain and disability. The key exclusion criteria were no stenosis of the central canal, spondylolisthesis requiring surgery, and a history of lumbar surgery or received epidural corticosteroid injections within the previous 6 months. In the LESS study, the interventions were: n = 200 corticosteroid plus lidocaine (1 to 3 mL of 0.25% to 1% lidocaine followed by 1 to 3 mL of triamcinolone (60 to 120 mg), betamethasone (6 to 12 mg), dexamethasone (8 to 10 mg), or methylprednisolone (60 to 120 mg)) n = 200 lidocaine (equivalent volume of 0.25% to 1% lidocaine alone). In the LESS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in change in Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire score at 6 weeks (4.2 points vs. 3.1 points; AD 1 points, 95% CI -0.1 to 2.1). In the LESS study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in intensity of leg pain (-2.8 vs. -2.6; AD -0.2, 95% CI -0.8 to 0.4) No significant difference in intensity of back pain at 6 weeks (4.3 vs. 4.4; AD -0.1, 95% CI -0.7 to 0.4) No significant difference in BPI interference scale score at 6 weeks (3.5 points vs. 3.8 points; AD -0.4 points, 95% CI -1 to 0.2). In the LESS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in ≥ 1 adverse event, serious adverse events. significant difference in total adverse events (0.17 events vs. 0.29 events). In the LESS study, the conclusion was: in patients who had lumbar central spinal stenosis and moderate-to-severe leg pain and disability, corticosteroid plus lidocaine was not superior to lidocaine with respect to change in Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire score at 6 weeks.

### Epidural steroid injections are associated with less improvement in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis: a subgroup analysis of the spine patient outcomes research trial [^1e92b39b]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Subgroup analysis of prospective, randomized database from the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT).

Objective

The hypothesis of this study was that patients who received ESI during initial treatment as part of SPORT (The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial) would have improved clinical outcome and a lower rate of crossover to surgery than patients who did not receive ESI.

Summary Of Background Data

The use of epidural steroid injection (ESI) in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis is common, although there is little evidence in the literature to demonstrate its long-term benefit in the treatment of lumbar stenosis.

Methods

Patients with lumbar spinal stenosis who received ESI within the first 3 months of enrollment in SPORT (ESI) were compared with patients who did not receive epidural injections during the first 3 months of the study (no-ESI).

Results

There were 69 ESI patients and 207 no-ESI patients. There were no significant differences in demographic factors, baseline clinical outcome scores, or operative details between the groups, although there was a significant increase in baseline preference for nonsurgical treatment among ESI patients (ESI 62% vs. no-ESI 33%, P < 0.001). There was an average 26-minute increase in operative time and an increased length of stay by 0.9 days among the ESI patients who ultimately underwent surgical treatment. Averaged over 4 years, there was significantly less improvement in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Function among surgically treated ESI patients (ESI 14.8 vs. no-ESI 22.5, P = 0.025). In addition, there was significantly less improvement among the nonsurgically treated patients in SF-36 Body Pain (ESI 7.3 vs. no-ESI 16.7, P = 0.007) and SF-36 Physical Function (ESI 5.5 vs. no-ESI 15.2, P = 0.009). Of the patients assigned to the surgical treatment group, there was a significantly increased crossover to nonsurgical treatment among patients who received an ESI (ESI 33% vs. no-ESI 11%, P = 0.012). Of the patients assigned to the nonoperative treatment group, there was a significantly increased crossover to surgical treatment in the ESI patients (ESI 58% vs. no-ESI 32%, P = 0.003).

Conclusion

Despite equivalent baseline status, ESIs were associated with significantly less improvement at 4 years among all patients with spinal stenosis in SPORT. Furthermore, ESIs were associated with longer duration of surgery and longer hospital stay. There was no improvement in outcome with ESI whether patients were treated surgically or nonsurgically.

### A randomized trial of epidural glucocorticoid injections for spinal stenosis [^d067a274]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Epidural glucocorticoid injections are widely used to treat symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis, a common cause of pain and disability in older adults. However, rigorous data are lacking regarding the effectiveness and safety of these injections.

Methods

In a double-blind, multisite trial, we randomly assigned 400 patients who had lumbar central spinal stenosis and moderate-to-severe leg pain and disability to receive epidural injections of glucocorticoids plus lidocaine or lidocaine alone. The patients received one or two injections before the primary outcome evaluation, performed 6 weeks after randomization and the first injection. The primary outcomes were the score on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ, in which scores range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating greater physical disability) and the rating of the intensity of leg pain (on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating "pain as bad as you can imagine").

Results

At 6 weeks, there were no significant between-group differences in the RMDQ score (adjusted difference in the average treatment effect between the glucocorticoid-lidocaine group and the lidocaine-alone group, -1.0 points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.1 to 0.1; P = 0.07) or the intensity of leg pain (adjusted difference in the average treatment effect, -0.2 points; 95% CI, -0.8 to 0.4; P = 0.48). A prespecified secondary subgroup analysis with stratification according to type of injection (interlaminar vs. transforaminal) likewise showed no significant differences at 6 weeks.

Conclusions

In the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis, epidural injection of glucocorticoids plus lidocaine offered minimal or no short-term benefit as compared with epidural injection of lidocaine alone. (Funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01238536.).

### Effect of adding calcitonin to translaminar epidural steroid in degenerative lumbar spinal canal stenosis [^61b90610]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Spinal canal stenosis is one of the most common causes of low back pain and disability. Its management varies from surgical to conservative, and the indications for ideal management are not clearly defined.

Objectives

This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of adding calcitonin to local anesthetic and corticosteroid in epidural injection for patients suffering from degenerative lumbar spinal canal stenosis.

Study Design

Randomized double-blind clinical trial.

Setting

Hospital outpatient setting.

Methods

One hundred thirty-two patients with degenerative spinal canal stenosis were randomly allocated into 2 groups. Group I received C-arm guided epidural injection of local anesthetic and corticosteroid and Group II received 50 international unit calcitonin added to the mixture of local anesthetic and corticosteroid. Both groups received 2 sets of injections, one week apart. Visual analogue scale for pain during movement and walking distance until incidence of neurogenic claudication have been used for pain assessment, and Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire and analgesic consumption were evaluated for one year.

Results

Both groups showed comparable benefits regarding improvement in pain intensity, walking distance, Oswestry scale, and analgesic consumption during the first month follow-up period. These beneficial effects continued in calcitonin group for one year.

Limitations

The present study patients would be graded as having mild or at worst moderate stenosis. So, the present study did not examine the efficacy of epidural calcitonin in severe spinal canal stenosis and did not stratify the results according to degree of stenosis which would also have been useful in determining the validity of calcitonin in different degrees of stenosis.

Conclusion

Adding calcitonin to epidural steroid and local anesthetic injection seems to be more effective than epidural steroid and local anesthesia alone in management of spinal canal stenosis regarding increased walking distance, better Oswestry scale, diminished pain intensity and perception of paresthesia, and less analgesic consumption, all the above mentioned benefits continued up to one year. So, epidural calcitonin may be considered as a new therapeutic modality in the management of pain in spinal canal stenosis.

### Epidural steroids for cervical and lumbar radicular pain and spinal stenosis systematic review summary: report of the AAN guidelines subcommittee [^a350bf86]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) — evidence synthesis approach and effect metrics are specified as follows: standardized mean differences were converted to success rate differences (SRDs) to improve interpretability; in this context the SRD measures the proportion of patients undergoing ESI that have more favorable outcomes compared with patients not receiving an ESI, and from the SRD, numbers needed to treat (NNT) for any improvement can be computed; because adverse events were rare, a narrative review of adverse events was performed; evidence syntheses used the AAN's modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process; outcomes are presented separately by pathology with subsequent analyses by spinal level, and exploratory analyses separated studies by particulate vs nonparticulate corticosteroids, injection types, and control interventions.

Contraindications

An ESI should give at least 3 months of adequate relief between therapeutic injections, depending on the degree of pain and dysfunction, where repeated use of ESIs in this population may be appropriately considered. Although it is reasonable to repeat ESI when patients have sustained pain relief with eventual recurrence of pain, it is important to understand that some payer guidelines (including CMS) now stipulate that patients should have obtained a minimum of 3 months of pain relief with eventual recurrence of pain before it is reasonable to proceed with additional injection therapy. For patients exhibiting shorter-term relief of less than 3 months, the clinician may wish to consider other treatment options.,

Severe and uncontrolled comorbid factors may contraindicate the use of epidural steroids, particularly with uncontrolled diabetes or cardiovascular issues negating the use of corticosteroids, as well as active spinal or systemic infections and coagulopathies or patients on anticoagulants. In these instances, ESI without the use of steroids may be considered, as well as more advanced decompressive therapies within the treatment algorithm. In a double-blinded randomized prospective multicenter trial performed in 2014 with over 400 patients who had central spinal stenosis and moderate-to-severe leg pain and disability, scores to receive epidural injections using lidocaine with and without glucocorticoids revealed that after 6 weeks there was no improvement between interlaminar vs transforaminal, nor between glucocorticoid or not, to treat spinal stenosis, in patients who received one or two injections prior to the 6-week assessment. Similarly, the outcome was likely maintained at 12 months if relief occurred, suggesting that if it was achieved, it should be identified at 6 weeks. If no benefit was achieved, more mechanical therapy options may be needed.

Literature Review

As discussed already, we identified randomized comparative trials of epidural steroids to treat LSS. Methodology varied widely as did outcome measures, length of follow-up, and comparators.

### Effectiveness of epidural steroid injections for low back pain… [^37e6ac96]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Are epidural steroid injections effective for low back pain. Evidence-Based Answer Treatment with epidural steroid injections in the lower spine is not effective for reducing pain and disability. The injections may be more effective than placebo at short-term follow-up, but the effects are not clinically meaningful. Epidural steroid injection has minimal benefit for patients with chronic low back pain. Evidence Summary A 2020 systematic review of 25 RCTs compared the effects of epidural steroid injection using caudal, interlaminar, or transforaminal approaches with placebo in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain.

Epidural steroid injections were marginally more effective than placebo in reducing leg pain at short-term follow-up and in reducing overall pain at long-term follow-up, but no differences in leg pain or overall pain were found at intermediate-term follow-up. Epidural steroid injections were slightly more effective than placebo in reducing disability at short-term follow-up and at intermediate-term follow-up. Mostly minor adverse effects occurred with treatment and placebo injections with no difference between groups.

Limitations mostly involved a lack of appropriate blinding and appropriate allocation concealment, resulting in moderate-certainty evidence. A 2020 meta-analysis.

Lumbar spinal stenosis — randomized trial of epidural steroid injection versus inpatient physical therapy versus control reports small sample allocation and no between-group differences at six months: "Of the 29 consecutive patients included in the study, 10 were randomized to physical therapy, 10 to the injection group and nine to the control group", and "At six month final follow-up, all groups showed improvement with no statistically significant differences", with authors concluding that "epidural ste- roid injections and physical therapy are both effective in treating spinal stenosis at up to six months follow-up". Methodological notes state "This was a very small study of nonmasked patients with short follow-up and an unspecified randomization method", that "Patients in all groups received baseline treatment consisting of a home- based therapeutic exercise program", and that this "provides Level III therapeutic evidence" with "no significant differences in improvement between groups" at six months.

Comparator activity and control interventions in epidural steroid injection (ESI) trials — interpretation caveats include that the effect sizes reported in this review assume that the comparator intervention was inactive and, if the comparator interventions are active, the effect sizes reported here may be inaccurate. The efficacy of epidural saline and a local anesthetic alone has not been established by controlled clinical trials, and thus, it is complete conjecture whether they have therapeutic benefit.

### Lumbar spinal stenosis severity by CT or MRI does not predict response to epidural corticosteroid versus lidocaine injections [^3efbfdd2]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Epidural steroid injections may offer little-to-no short-term benefit in the overall population of patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis compared with lidocaine alone. We investigated whether imaging could identify subgroups of patients who might benefit most.

Materials and Methods

A secondary analysis of the Lumbar Epidural Steroid Injections for Spinal Stenosis prospective, double-blind trial was performed, and patients were randomized to receive an epidural injection of lidocaine with or without corticosteroids. Patients (n = 350) were evaluated for qualitative and quantitative MR imaging or CT measures of lumbar spinal stenosis. The primary clinical end points were the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire and the leg pain numeric rating scale at 3 weeks following injection. ANCOVA was used to assess the significance of interaction terms between imaging measures of spinal stenosis and injectate type on clinical improvement.

Results

There was no difference in the improvement of disability or leg pain scores at 3 weeks between patients injected with epidural lidocaine alone compared with corticosteroid and lidocaine when accounting for the primary imaging measures of qualitative spinal stenosis assessment (interaction coefficients for disability score, -0.1; 95% CI, -1.3 to 1.2; P = 0.90; and for the leg pain score, 0.1; 95% CI, -0.6 to 0.8; P = 0.81) or the quantitative minimum thecal sac cross-sectional area (interaction coefficients for disability score, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.03; P = 0.40; and for the leg pain score, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.03; P = 0.33).

Conclusions

Imaging measures of spinal stenosis are not associated with differential clinical responses following epidural corticosteroid injection.

### Long-term effects of repeated injections of local anesthetic with or without corticosteroid for lumbar spinal stenosis: a randomized trial [^69628a92]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the overall long-term effectiveness of treatment with epidural corticosteroid injections for lumbar central spinal stenosis and the effect of repeat injections, including crossover injections, on outcomes through 12 months.

Design

Multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing epidural injections of corticosteroid plus lidocaine versus lidocaine alone.

Setting

Sixteen clinical sites.

Participants

Participants with imaging-confirmed lumbar central spinal stenosis (N = 400).

Interventions

Participants were randomized to receive either epidural injections with corticosteroid plus lidocaine or lidocaine alone with the option of blinded crossover after 6 weeks to receive the alternate treatment. Participants could receive 1 to 2 injections from 0 to 6 weeks and up to 2 injections from 6 to 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, participants received usual care.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcomes were the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) (range, 0–24, where higher scores indicate greater disability) and leg pain intensity (range, 0 [no pain] to 10 [pain as bad as you can imagine]). Secondary outcomes included opioid use, spine surgery, and crossover rates.

Results

At 12 months, both treatment groups maintained initial observed improvements, with no significant differences between groups on the RDQ (adjusted mean difference, -0.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.6 to 0.9; P = 0.55), leg pain (adjusted mean difference, 0.1; 95% CI, -0.5 to 0.7; P = 0.75), opioid use (corticosteroid plus lidocaine: 41.4% vs lidocaine alone: 36.3%; P = 0.41), or spine surgery (corticosteroid plus lidocaine: 16.8% vs lidocaine alone: 11.8%; P = 0.22). Fewer participants randomized to corticosteroid plus lidocaine (30%, n = 60) versus lidocaine alone (45%, n = 90) crossed over after 6 weeks (P = 0.003). Among participants who crossed over at 6 weeks, the 6- to 12-week RDQ change did not differ between the 2 randomized treatment groups (adjusted mean difference, -1.0; 95% CI, -2.6 to 0.7; P = 0.24). In both groups, participants crossing over at 6 weeks had worse 12-month trajectories compared with participants who did not choose to crossover.

Conclusions

For lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms, epidural injections of corticosteroid plus lidocaine offered no benefits from 6 weeks to 12 months beyond that of injections of lidocaine alone in terms of self-reported pain and function or reduction in use of opioids and spine surgery. In patients with improved pain and function 6 weeks after initial injection, these outcomes were maintained at 12 months. However, the trajectories of pain and function outcomes after 3 weeks did not differ by injectate type. Repeated injections of either type offered no additional long-term benefit if injections in the first 6 weeks did not improve pain.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections for radiculopathy and spinal stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^edaaa74c]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Use of epidural corticosteroid injections is increasing.

Purpose

To review evidence on the benefits and harms of epidural corticosteroid injections in adults with radicular low back pain or spinal stenosis of any duration.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE (through May 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, prior systematic reviews, and reference lists.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of epidural corticosteroid injections versus placebo interventions, or that compared epidural injection techniques, corticosteroids, or doses.

Data Extraction

Dual extraction and quality assessment of individual studies, which were used to determine the overall strength of evidence (SOE).

Data Synthesis

30 placebo-controlled trials evaluated epidural corticosteroid injections for radiculopathy, and 8 trials were done for spinal stenosis. For radiculopathy, epidural corticosteroids were associated with greater immediate-term reduction in pain (weighted mean difference on a scale of 0 to 100, -7.55 [95% CI, -11.4 to -3.74]; SOE, moderate), function (standardized mean difference after exclusion of an outlier trial, -0.33 [CI, -0.56 to -0.09]; SOE, low), and short-term surgery risk (relative risk, 0.62 [CI, 0.41 to 0.92]; SOE, low). Effects were below predefined minimum clinically important difference thresholds, and there were no longer-term benefits. Limited evidence showed no clear effects of technical factors, patient characteristics, or comparator interventions on estimates. There were no clear effects of epidural corticosteroid injections for spinal stenosis (SOE, low to moderate). Serious harms were rare, but harms reporting was suboptimal (SOE, low).

Limitations

The review was restricted to English-language studies. Some meta-analyses were based on small numbers of trials (particularly for spinal stenosis), and most trials had methodological shortcomings.

Conclusion

Epidural corticosteroid injections for radiculopathy were associated with immediate reductions in pain and function. However, benefits were small and not sustained, and there was no effect on long-term surgery risk. Limited evidence suggested no effectiveness for spinal stenosis.

### Randomized trial of epidural injections for spinal stenosis published in the new england journal of medicine: further confusion without clarification [^ea1654db]. Pain Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials are considered the hallmark of evidence-based medicine. This conveys the idea that up-to-date evidence applied consistently in clinical practice, in combination with clinicians' individual expertise and patients own preference/expectations are enjoined to achieve the best possible outcome. Since its inception in 1990s, evidence-based medicine has evolved in conjunction with numerous changes in the healthcare environment. However, the benefits of evidence-based medicine have not materialized for spinal pain including surgical interventions. Consequently, the debate continues on the efficacy and medical necessity of multiple interventions provided in managing spinal pain. Friedly et al published a randomized controlled trial of epidural glucocorticoid injections for spinal stenosis in the July 2014 edition of the highly prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. This was accompanied by an editorial from Andersson. This manuscript provided significant sensationalism for the media and confusion for the spine community. This randomized trial of epidural glucocorticoid injections for spinal stenosis and accompanying editorial concluded that epidural injections of glucocorticoids plus lidocaine offered minimal or no short-term benefit as compared with epidural injections of lidocaine alone, with the editorial emphasizing proceeding directly to surgical intervention. In addition media statements by the authors also emphasized the idea that exercise or surgery might be better options for patients suffereing from narrowing of the spinal canal. The interventional pain management community believes that there are severe limitations to this study, manuscript, and accompanying editorial. The design, inclusion criteria, outcomes assessment, analysis of data and interpretation, and conclusions of this trial point to the fact that this highly sophisticated and much publicized randomized trial may not be appropriate and lead to misinformation. The design of the trial was inappropriate with failure to include existing randomized trials, with inclusion criteria that did not incorporate conservative management, or caudal epidural injections. Simultaneously, acute pain patients were included, multilevel stenosis and various other factors were not identified. The interventions included lumbar interlaminar and transforaminal epidural injections with highly variable volumes of medication being injected per patient. Outcomes assessment was not optimal with assessment of the patients at 3 and 6 weeks for a procedure which provides on average 3 weeks of relief and utilizing an instrument which is more appropriately utilized in acute and subacute low back pain. Analysis of the data was hampered by inadequate subgroup analysis leading to inappropriate interpretation. Based on the available data epidural local anesthetic with steroids was clearly superior at 3 weeks and potentially at 6 weeks. Further, both treatments were effective considering the baseline to 3 week and 6 week assessment, appropriate subgroup analysis seems to have yielded significant superiority for interlaminar epidural injections compared to transforaminal epidural injections with local anesthetic with or without steroids specifically with proportion of patients achieving greater than 50% improvement at 3 and 6 week levels. This critical assessment shows that this study suffers from a challenging design, was premised on the exclusion of available high-quality literature, and had inadequate duration of follow-up for an interventional technique with poor assessment criteria and reporting. Finally the analysis and interpretation of data has led to inaccurate and inappropriate conclusions which we do not believe is based on scientific evidence.

### Diagnosis and management of lumbar spinal stenosis… [^5d3bc202]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor The recent Review1 about the diagnosis and management of lumbar spinal stenosis highlighted nonoperative treatment, injection therapy, and neurosurgical options with evidence from key landmark trials. However, it appears that 2 important trials about lumbar spinal stenosis treatment were omitted from this Review. The MiDAS ENCORE trial, 2 which included 302 patients, investigated 2 therapies for lumbar spinal stenosis: minimally invasive lumbar decompression surgery and epidural steroid injections. At the 6-month follow-up, participants who received minimally invasive lumbar decompression surgery achieved significantly greater improvements in the Oswestry Disability Index, a numeric rating scale, and the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire compared with participants who received epidural steroid injections. 2 Furthermore, these benefits appeared to be sustained, as shown in the 2-year follow-up trial.

3 Because these 2 studies were not included in their Review article, 1 the authors did not provide detailed information about the favorable outcomes associated with minimally invasive lumbar decompression surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis.

Epidural Steroid Injections

Definitions and Literature Search

The first descriptions of epidural injections for the treatment of lumbar spine-related pain appeared in the early 1900ʹs. Over the ensuing 100-plus years, lumbar epidural injection therapy has evolved to the current practice of image-guided (usually fluoroscopic) interlaminar or transforaminal ESIs. Lumbar epidural steroid injections (LESI) are commonly prescribed in the treatment algorithm for LSS. In most cases, they are considered as an option if a symptomatic patient fails to improve with conservative and noninvasive therapies such as oral medications, physical therapy, and activity modification.

Multiple systematic reviews have been published regarding the use of LESI to treat LSS. The majority of these systematic reviews suggest at least short- to intermediate-term symptom improvement for patients with LSS. Similarly, many prospective clinical trials have been published on this subject. Most trials have demonstrated efficacy but there is considerable variability regarding epidural technique, medication, dosage, and duration of improvement. As a result, treatment efficacy for the modality has been difficult to determine, as foundational studies in support of the procedure come from different eras representing the evolution of evidence-based medicine and evidence-based study standards.

This section will outline the evidence to date in the literature with regard to treatment effect of application of medications delivered via the single-dose epidural route in the treatment of LSS. Studies from 1980 to present were considered. PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases were utilized and yielded 398 potential studies (60 manuscripts reviewed) of which nine studies met inclusion criteria of RCTs with homogenous populations for LSS. When study inclusion criteria were expanded to RCTs with a predominance of LSS subjects, an additional five studies were identified. Taken together, these studies represent the basis for the evaluation and subsequent recommendations.

ASIPP guidelines — systematic reviews of transforaminal, caudal, and interlaminar epidural steroid injections: Bhatia et al included 8 RCTs and concluded that transforaminal epidural steroids provide modest analgesic benefit at 3 months for lumbosacral radicular pain from herniated intervertebral discs with no impact on physical disability or incidence of surgery. Liu et al utilized 6 prospective and 2 retrospective studies involving 664 patients and concluded that both transforaminal and caudal approaches are effective in reducing pain and improving functional scores with similar effectiveness. Meng et al assessed 10 studies on lumbar spinal stenosis and concluded that the inclusion of steroids confers no advantage compared to local anesthetic alone. Sharma et al assessed 71 primary studies and concluded that the body of evidence regarding fluoroscopically guided interlaminar epidural steroid injections is of low-quality and that studies suggested a lack of effectiveness in treating primarily axial pain, regardless of etiology.

Treatment Options

Lifestyle Modification

Improvements and alterations in lifestyle such as regular exercise, core strengthening, balanced diet, and maintaining ideal body weight have been often recommended for overall spinal health. There have not yet been any clinical trials that support this, however. The natural progression of LSS begins slowly with minimal symptoms, followed by a steep increase as critical stenosis is reached. Once LSS symptoms are noticed, it is often too late for lifestyle modifications to be significantly effective.

Epidural Injections (with/Without Steroids)

Targeted injection of local anesthetic with or without corticosteroids has been widely utilized in the treatment of neurogenic claudication due to LSS. When conservative treatments have been exhausted, patients are given the option of interventional pain management, often in the form of spinal epidural injections before surgery. Injected local anesthetics are often combined with corticosteroids to provide pain relief by reduction of local inflammation and ischemia, which are caused by the stenosis. This practice has been accepted as an alternative to more invasive surgical decompression or to help delay surgery by providing short- to medium-term pain relief. The North American Spine Society (NASS) has developed a set of evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis from their Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Work Group. There is a Grade B recommendation (with suggestion of a Level I study and additional Level II or III studies) for the application of interlaminar epidural steroid injections to provide short-term (two weeks to six months) relief of neurogenic claudication. The long-term efficacy of interlaminar epidural steroid injections was considered controversial. Transforaminal and caudal approaches obtained a Grade C recommendation in providing medium-term (three to 36 months) pain relief. Additional evidence for spinal epidural injections to treat LSS came from two randomized controlled trials by Manchikanti et al. showing statistically significant pain relief and improvement of disability in patients with LSS undergoing both interlaminar and caudal epidural injections. Conflicting data were later published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggesting minimal benefit of epidural steroids compared with local anesthetics alone. This article was highlighted for its controversial results and was criticized for study design, inclusion criteria, data analysis, and conclusions, which led to confusion among patients and providers regarding epidural injections for spinal stenosis. Additional systematic reviews of the literature have shown modest benefits in both short- and long-term pain relief for epidural injections in treating LSS. A comprehensive review of 10 studies that included 1,010 subjects indicated a minimal difference between the use of injected epidural steroids vs local anesthetic only.

### Epidural steroids for cervical and lumbar radicular pain and spinal stenosis systematic review summary: report of the AAN guidelines subcommittee [^cc6a4003]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Repeated epidural steroid injections (ESIs) — use and safety considerations note that the SR did not find studies addressing the efficacy of repeated ESIs, yet ESIs are not infrequently used repeatedly every few months in the clinical setting. Repeated ESIs are associated with adverse effects caused by long-term corticosteroid use, and epidural lipomatosis has been described after repeated ESIs and may worsen spinal stenosis. The SR did not find evidence for or against the use of ESIs in changing the requirement for future surgery. Repeated ESIs may be of utility in specific clinical situations based on response and alternatives, and close monitoring for ongoing effectiveness is necessary to justify continuing treatment.

### Epidural steroids: a comprehensive, evidence-based review [^f295fdd2]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are the most widely utilized pain management procedure in the world, their use supported by more than 45 placebo-controlled studies and dozens of systematic reviews. Despite the extensive literature on the subject, there continues to be considerable controversy surrounding their safety and efficacy. The results of clinical trials and review articles are heavily influenced by specialty, with those done by interventional pain physicians more likely to yield positive findings. Overall, more than half of controlled studies have demonstrated positive findings, suggesting a modest effect size lasting less than 3 months in well-selected individuals. Transforaminal injections are more likely to yield positive results than interlaminar or caudal injections, and subgroup analyses indicate a slightly greater likelihood for a positive response for lumbar herniated disk, compared with spinal stenosis or axial spinal pain. Other factors that may increase the likelihood of a positive outcome in clinical trials include the use of a nonepidural (eg, intramuscular) control group, higher volumes in the treatment group, and the use of depo-steroid. Serious complications are rare following ESIs, provided proper precautions are taken. Although there are no clinical trials comparing different numbers of injections, guidelines suggest that the number of injections should be tailored to individual response, rather than a set series. Most subgroup analyses of controlled studies show no difference in surgical rates between ESI and control patients; however, randomized studies conducted by spine surgeons, in surgically amenable patients with standardized operative criteria, indicate that in some patients the strategic use of ESI may prevent surgery.

American Academy of Neurology (AAN) epidural steroid injections (ESIs) — background and epidemiology: In 2007, an AAN technology assessment concluded ESIs "may improve radicular lumbosacral pain between 2 and 6 weeks after the injection but does not improve function or reduce the need for surgery". Lower back pain is common, affecting "50%–80% of adults in their lifetime", and in 2013 lower back and neck pain were "the third largest category of health care spending at $87.6 billion, after diabetes and ischemic heart disease". Incidence estimates include "486/100,000 person-years" for lumbar radiculopathy and "83/100,000 person-years" for cervical radiculopathies, while "only 33%–50% of patients with spinal stenosis improve over time". Prior reviews reported limited benefit: a Cochrane review found ESIs were "probably slightly more effective compared with placebo in reducing leg pain at short-term follow-up", and other reviews concluded benefits were "small and short lived".

### Lack of superiority of epidural injections with lidocaine with steroids compared to without steroids in spinal pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a2b8e0b6]. Pain Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews have been conducted to summarize the evidence for administration of local anesthetic (lidocaine) alone or with steroids, with discordant opinions, more in favor of equal effect with local anesthetic alone or with steroids.

Objective

To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of lidocaine alone and lidocaine with steroids in managing spinal pain to assess superiority or equivalency.

Study Design

A systematic review of RCTs assessing the effectiveness of lidocaine alone compared with addition of steroids to lidocaine in managing spinal pain secondary to multiple causes (disc herniation, radiculitis, discogenic pain, spinal stenosis, and post-surgery syndrome).

Methods

This systematic review was performed utilizing Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) for literature search, Cochrane review criteria, and Interventional Pain Management Techniques-Quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment (IPM-QRB) to assess the methodologic quality assessment and qualitative analysis utilizing best evidence synthesis principles, and quantitative analysis utilizing conventional and single-arm meta-analysis. PubMed, Cochrane Library, US National Guideline Clearinghouse, Google Scholar, and prior systematic reviews and reference lists were utilized in the literature search from 1966 through December 2019. The evidence was summarized utilizing principles of best evidence synthesis on a scale of 1 to 5.

Outcome Measures

A hard endpoint for the primary outcome was defined as the proportion of patients with 50% pain relief and improvement in function. Secondary outcome measures, or soft endpoints, were pain relief and/or improvement in function. Effectiveness was determined as short-term if it was less than 6 months. Improvement that lasted longer than 6 months, was defined as long-term.

Results

Based on search criteria, 15 manuscripts were identified and considered for inclusion for qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis with conventional meta-analysis, and single-arm meta-analysis. The results showed Level II, moderate evidence, for short-term and long-term improvement in pain and function with the application of epidural injections with local anesthetic with or without steroid in managing spinal pain of multiple origins.

Limitations

Despite 15 RCTs, evidence may still be considered as less than optimal and further studies are recommended.

Conclusion

Overall, the present meta-analysis shows moderate (Level II) evidence for epidural injections with lidocaine with or without steroids in managing spinal pain secondary to disc herniation, spinal stenosis, discogenic pain, and post-surgery syndrome based on relevant, high-quality RCTs. Results were similar for lidocaine, with or without steroids.

Epidural steroid injection (ESI) for low back pain (LBP) — evidence synthesis from systematic reviews (SRs) and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) — shows mixed results across timeframes, with the evidence base "assessing ESI outcomes at six and 12 months" including an SR that "found a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in pain when ESI was compared to conservative treatment", contrasted by another SR "(n = 2,470)… found no improvement in back pain or disability at three to 12 months or greater than 12 months". In an RCT of lumbar disc herniation, the trial "favored epidural steroids for function but not pain at three months", yet the "small sample size (n = 28 in each arm) was not sufficient to impact the findings from the multiple SRs". Safety data were limited as "the quality of data assessing AEs and harms in the reviewed studies was insufficient to draw any conclusions", and there was "a lack of studies assessing the efficacy of ESI in spinal stenosis alone or in LBP alone to draw separate conclusions".

A systematic review and meta-analysis by Shanthanna et al included 71 trials and concluded that adding corticosteroids to local anesthetics has only small quantified benefit for pain; they further concluded that injection of local anesthetics alone could be therapeutic and recommended that a shared decision based on patient preferences should be considered and high doses must be avoided, along with a series of steroid injections.

### Diagnosis and management of lumbar spinal stenosis: a review [^c080c703]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a prevalent and disabling cause of low back and leg pain in older persons, affecting an estimated 103 million persons worldwide. Most are treated nonoperatively. Approximately 600 000 surgical procedures are performed in the US each year for lumbar spinal stenosis.

Observations

The prevalence of the clinical syndrome of lumbar spinal stenosis in US adults is approximately 11% and increases with age. The diagnosis can generally be made based on a clinical history of back and lower extremity pain that is provoked by lumbar extension, relieved by lumbar flexion, and confirmed with cross-sectional imaging, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nonoperative treatment includes activity modification such as reducing periods of standing or walking, oral medications to diminish pain such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physical therapy. In a series of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis followed up for up to 3 years without operative intervention, approximately one-third of patients reported improvement, approximately 50% reported no change in symptoms, and approximately 10% to 20% of patients reported that their back pain, leg pain, and walking were worse. Long-term benefits of epidural steroid injections for lumbar spinal stenosis have not been demonstrated. Surgery appears effective in carefully selected patients with back, buttock, and lower extremity pain who do not improve with conservative management. For example, in a randomized trial of 94 participants with symptomatic and radiographic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, decompressive laminectomy improved symptoms more than nonoperative therapy (difference, 7.8 points; 95% CI, 0.8–14.9; minimum clinically important difference, 10–12.8) on the Oswestry Disability Index (score range, 0–100). Among persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and concomitant spondylolisthesis, lumbar fusion increased symptom resolution in 1 trial (difference, 5.7 points; 95% CI, 0.1 to 11.3) on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical dimension score (range, 0–100), but 2 other trials showed either no important differences between the 2 therapies or noninferiority of lumbar decompression alone compared with lumbar decompression plus spinal fusion (MCID, 2–4.9 points). In a noninferiority trial, 71.4% treated with lumbar decompression alone vs 72.9% of those receiving decompression plus fusion achieved a 30% or more reduction in Oswestry Disability Index score, consistent with the prespecified noninferiority hypothesis. Fusion is associated with greater risk of complications such as blood loss, infection, longer hospital stays, and higher costs. Thus, the precise indications for concomitant lumbar fusion in persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis remain unclear.

Conclusions and Relevance

Lumbar spinal stenosis affects approximately 103 million people worldwide and 11% of older adults in the US. First-line therapy is activity modification, analgesia, and physical therapy. Long-term benefits from epidural steroid injections have not been established. Selected patients with continued pain and activity limitation may be candidates for decompressive surgery.

Lumbar epidural injections — caudal, interlaminar, and transforaminal — were compared for lumbar disc herniation, central spinal stenosis, and axial discogenic pain. In three RCTs with 120 patients in each trial (60 receiving local anesthetic only and 60 receiving local anesthetic with steroids), at 12 months significant improvement, defined as at least 50% pain relief and ODI functional improvement from baseline, was 72% in the caudal group, 85% in the interlaminar group, and 57% in the transforaminal group; in responsive patients it was 84%, 86%, and 73%, with overall no significant differences though interlaminar may be somewhat better than caudal. For central spinal stenosis, caudal and interlaminar approaches produced significant improvement up to 2 years, with interlaminar being superior to caudal. In chronic lumbar axial discogenic pain, the 20‑month outcome showed 72% improved with local anesthetic only via lumbar interlaminar versus 54% via caudal, while with local anesthetic plus steroid responses were 67% for interlaminar and 68% for caudal at 12 months, and the response was reported as significantly better with the lumbar interlaminar approach at 20 months.

Lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESI) for lumbosacral radicular pain — evidence from systematic reviews indicates variable certainty and outcomes. Benny and Azari examined 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and concluded there was strong evidence for transforaminal injections in the treatment of lumbosacral radicular pain for both short-term and long-term relief, and another radiology review concluded there was moderate to strong evidence supporting transforaminal therapeutic epidural injections for lumbar nerve-root compression. Roberts et al concluded there was fair evidence supporting transforaminal epidural injections as superior to placebo for treating radicular symptoms and good evidence that they should be used as a surgery-sparing intervention. Rho and Tang concluded there was strong evidence to support the use of transforaminal injection of corticosteroid and local anesthetic in patients with acute to subacute unilateral radicular pain caused by a herniated nucleus pulposus or spinal stenosis, and that a lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injection is an effective surgery-sparing procedure that should be a part of conservative care. Quraishi concluded that when appropriately performed, transforaminal epidural steroid injections should result in an improvement in pain, but not disability, and three RCTs followed patients for 3 months with results illustrating no benefit from adding steroids. Manchikanti et al identified 70 studies of which 25 met inclusion criteria, with 15 randomized trials and 10 nonrandomized studies, with 2 duplicate publications and 3 studies failing to meet inclusion criteria; they reported the evidence for lumbar disc herniation is good for transforaminal epidural with local anesthetic and steroids, fair for local anesthetics alone and the ability to prevent surgery, fair for local anesthetic and steroids in spinal stenosis, and poor, inadequate, limited, or unavailable for axial low back pain and post lumbar surgery syndrome. Macvicar et al assessed 39 publications and reported that for disc herniation lumbar transforaminal epidural injection of steroids is not universally effective but benefits a substantial portion of patients and is not a placebo, whereas for other conditions the available evidence was limited and neither compelling nor conclusive. Pinto et al concluded corticosteroid injections offer only short-term relief of leg pain and disability for patients with sciatica, with long-term effects that were positive but smaller and not statistically significant.

### Epidural injections for lumbar radiculopathy and spinal stenosis: a comparative systematic review and meta-analysis [^d9b08f79]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of chronic low back pain and related disability is rapidly increasing as are the myriad treatments, including epidural injections. Even though epidural injections are one of the most commonly performed procedures in managing low back and lower extremity pain, starting in 1901 with local anesthetic alone, conflicting recommendations have been provided, despite the extensive literature. Recently Chou et al performed a technology assessment review for Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) part of which was published in Annals of Internal Medicine showing lack of effectiveness of epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar radiculopathy and spinal stenosis. In contrast, multiple other publications have supported the efficacy and use of epidural injections.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy of 3 categories of epidural injections for lumbar and spinal stenosis: performed with saline with steroids, local anesthetic alone, or steroids with local anesthetic and separate facts from opinions.

Data Sources

PubMed, Cochrane Library, US National Guideline Clearinghouse, prior systematic reviews, and reference lists. The literature search was performed through August 2015.

Study Selection

Randomized trials, either placebo or active control, of epidural injections for lumbar radiculopathy and spinal stenosis.

Data Extraction

Data extraction and methodological quality assessment were performed utilizing Cochrane review methodologic quality assessment and Interventional Pain Management Techniques - Quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment (IPM-QRB). Evidence was summarized utilizing principles of best evidence synthesis.

Data Synthesis

Thirty-nine randomized controlled trials met inclusion criteria. There were 9 placebo-controlled trials evaluating epidural corticosteroid injections, either with sodium chloride solution or bupivacaine, compared to placebo injections. There were 12 studies comparing local anesthetic alone to local anesthetic with steroid.

Results

A meta-analysis of 5 studies utilizing sodium chloride or bupivacaine with steroid showed a lack of efficacy. A comparison of lidocaine to lidocaine with steroids in 7 studies showed significant effectiveness from baseline to long-term follow-up periods. Meta-analysis showed a similar effectiveness for pain and function without non-inferiority of lidocaine compared to lidocaine with steroid at 3 months and 12 months.

Limitations

The review was restricted to the data available with at least 3 months of follow-up, which excluded some studies. The inclusion criteria were restricted to English language studies.

Conclusion

Epidural corticosteroid injections for radiculopathy or spinal stenosis with sodium chloride solution or bupivacaine were shown to be ineffective. Lidocaine alone or lidocaine in conjunction with steroids were significantly effective.

### Best practices for minimally invasive lumbar spinal stenosis treatment 2.0 (MIST): consensus guidance from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) [^1554f9c6]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

On the topic of stenosis severity, two trials suggest that more severe stenosis may be associated with a poorer response. Ghahreman and Bogduk, in a subgroup analysis of a RCT of TFESI, reported that patients with low grade nerve root compression responded more favorably to ESI compared to patients with high grade compression (75% of patients responding vs 26%, respectively). Similarly, another trial compared outcomes of ILESI in patients with moderate vs severe LSS, and both the number of patients responding to treatment as well as the percentage of overall pain relief was lower in patients with severe stenosis.

A persistent question among practitioners concerns whether there is, in fact, benefit to proceeding directly to a more invasive treatment and bypassing the step of ESI for LSS. While this question has not been addressed with a RCT, a recent retrospective study evaluated the results of a treatment algorithm offering PILD upon presentation with LSS symptoms and LFH in 145 subjects. Seventy-five subjects had zero or one ESI, whereas 79 subjects had two or more ESIs. The authors of the six-center study concluded that multiple ESIs demonstrated no benefit and suggested that moving directly to PILD upon presentation with diagnostic criteria should be considered.

Consensus Point 12: Epidural steroid injections are recommended in the algorithm for the treatment of symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis. Grade B; Level of certainty high; Level of evidence I-A

Consensus Point 13: Epidural steroid injection may be repeated when a patient has significant temporary improvement in symptoms. Be aware that the number and frequency of injections may be limited by insurance and payer rules and regulations. Grade B; Level of certainty moderate; Level of evidence I-B

Epidural Steroid Injection vs PILD

Brown performed a small randomized double-blind prospective trial comparing LESI with 80 mg triamcinolone to minimally invasive PILD in 38 patients. Sixteen of 21 patients in the minimally invasive group (76.2%) experienced the primary efficacy endpoint pain improvement outcome of a 2-point or greater improvement in VAS at 6-week follow-up relative to baseline vs only 6 of 17 ESI patients (35.3%). Six-week overall mean VAS did not show any significant improvement in the ESI group.

The MiDAS ENCORE trial, a multicenter prospective RCT, compared LESI to minimally invasive percutaneous image-guided lumbar decompression in 302 patients. The epidural group could receive up to four injections per year of 40 to 80 mg of triamcinolone or methylprednisolone. At 6 months, 62% of the minimally invasive group achieved the primary outcome endpoint of a 10-point or greater ODI improvement vs 35.7% in the ESI group. Similarly, 56% of the minimally invasive group achieved the secondary outcome endpoint of a 2-point or greater improvement in the numerical pain rating score vs 33.3% in the ESI group.

What can we conclude from the results of these investigations? It appears that ESIs can lead to temporary symptom improvement in patients with LSS, and that epidural local anesthetic injection without steroid may have a therapeutic effect as well. Beyond that, there remain many questions. Does the degree and/or severity of the stenosis affect the response? Does the location of the stenosis (central vs foramen vs lateral recess vs combinations) affect the response? Does the duration of symptoms affect the response? Given that many patients with LSS are elderly and have other medical comorbidities, do other medical problems such as diabetes mellitus affect the response? What is the optimal steroid dose? Can the injections be repeated and, if so, how often and at what interval? These are important questions that can be addressed in future studies on this topic. Many of the trials discussed here allowed repeat injections for patients who had initial temporary improvement. This would seem like a reasonable approach for most patients. On the other hand, repeat injections for patients who experience only short-term improvement should be discouraged. It is important to note that many payers and insurance providers now have limits on the number and frequency of repeat ESIs that are covered.

### Systemic effects of epidural steroid injections for spinal stenosis [^b60944c0]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

This analysis of the lumbar epidural steroid injections for spinal stenosis multicenter randomized controlled trial data identifies the degree of and risk factors for cortisol suppression after epidural steroid injections in older adults with spinal stenosis. Four hundred patients aged 50 years and older with back or leg pain and central lumbar spinal stenosis completed baseline demographic and psychosocial measures. Morning serum cortisol levels were measured at baseline and 3 weeks after initial injection. Patients were randomized to receive epidural injections of either local anesthetic with corticosteroid (n = 200) or local anesthetic only (n = 200). The specific corticosteroid was chosen at the treating physician's discretion (methylprednisolone, betamethasone, triamcinolone, or dexamethasone). Thirty-two patients (20.3%) treated with corticosteroid experienced cortisol reduction at 3 weeks of > 50% compared with 10 patients (6.7%) treated with lidocaine only (adjusted treatment effect = 3.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.6–7.9, P = 0.002). The effect on 3-week cortisol changes did not differ by demographic or patient-level characteristics. Those treated with methylprednisolone or triamcinolone had an average 3-week cortisol reduction of 41.0% (P = 0.005) and 41.6% (P < 0.001) from baseline, respectively, whereas patients treated with betamethasone or dexamethasone were not significantly different than comparable patients in the lidocaine arm. The higher rates of cortisol suppression at 3 weeks in those receiving epidural corticosteroid injections, particularly with longer-acting insoluble corticosteroid formulations, are consistent with sustained systemic absorption of corticosteroid.

### Lumbar interlaminar epidural injections in central spinal stenosis: preliminary results of a randomized, double-blind, active control trial [^8809e96e]. Pain Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic, persistent low back and lower extremity pain is often caused by spinal stenosis. Surgery and other interventions, including epidural injections, have been used to relieve this pain. However, there is little in the medical literature to support interlaminar, or transforaminal epidural injections under fluoroscopy for managing lumbar pain of central spinal stenosis, while the caudal epidural approach has been studied.

Study Design

A randomized, double-blind, active, control trial.

Setting

A private, interventional pain management practice, specialty referral center in the United States.

Objective

This study sought to determine if low back and lower extremity pain secondary to lumbar central stenosis can be managed and long-lasting pain relief can be achieved with interlaminar epidural injections of local anesthetic, with or without steroids.

Methods

The study comprised 2 groups: one that received local anesthetic only and another received local anesthetic combined with nonparticulate betamethasone. A total of 120 patients were randomized by a computer-generated random allocations sequence to one of the 2 groups. The results of 30 patients in each group were assessed.

Outcomes Assessment

Sixty patients were included in this analysis. Outcomes measurements were taken at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. Measurements taken were Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI), employment status and opioid intake. A decrease in both the NRS and ODI of ≥ 50% was considered significant.

Results

Significant pain relief and improvement in ODI scores were seen in both groups at 12 months. Group I's significant pain relief was 70%; Group II's was 63%. The significant ODI improvement in Group I was 70%; in Group II it was 60%. Group I patients on average received 3.8 procedures a year; Group II patients received 4.0 procedures a year in successful group. Over 52 weeks in the successful group, total relief for Group I was 40.8 ± 11.7 weeks; for Group II it was 37.1 ± 12.6 weeks. Combined pain relief and functional status improvement were seen in 80% of patients in Group I and 72% in Group II in successful group.

Limitations

The lack of a placebo group and preliminary results are limitations.

Conclusion

Patients might benefit from receiving lumbar interlaminar injections with or without steroids for lumbar central spinal stenosis.

Clinical Trial

NCT00681447.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^45253109]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Epidural injection recommendations by indication state that the evidence is good for caudal epidural, interlaminar epidural, and transforaminal epidural injections with or without steroids in managing disc herniation or radiculitis. For axial or discogenic pain, the evidence is fair for either caudal epidural or lumbar interlaminar epidural injections with or without steroids, while the evidence is limited for transforaminal epidural injections. For spinal stenosis, the evidence is fair for caudal and interlaminar injections and limited for transforaminal epidural injections with or without steroids. For post surgery syndrome, the evidence is fair for caudal epidural injections with or without steroids. Accordingly, for axial or discogenic pain, either lumbar interlaminar or caudal epidural injections are recommended, and for post surgery syndrome, the preferred modality of treatment is with caudal epidural with or without steroids.

ASIPP guidelines — comparative review/meta-analysis for lumbar radiculopathy and spinal stenosis: Manchikanti et al included 39 RCTs with 9 placebo-controlled trials and also used 12 studies comparing local anesthetic or bupivacaine with steroids; they performed a meta-analysis of 5 studies using sodium chloride or bupivacaine with steroid showing lack of efficacy. A comparison of lidocaine to lidocaine with steroids in 7 studies showed significant effectiveness from baseline to long-term follow-up, and meta-analysis showed similar effectiveness for pain and function without noninferiority of lidocaine compared to lidocaine with steroids at 3 months and 12 months. For lumbar central spinal stenosis with assessment through 2014, Level II evidence was shown for long-term improvement with caudal and lumbar interlaminar injections, Level III evidence for transforaminal injections for short-term improvement only, and the interlaminar approach appears to be superior to the caudal approach and the caudal approach appears to be superior to the transforaminal approach.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^6439cd47]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Lumbar epidural glucocorticosteroid injections (ESIs) — a total of 18 high-quality and 41 moderate-quality studies were included. Evidence is consistent that ESIs result in up to 6 weeks modest improvement compared with placebo injections. As the main alternative is surgery, this Spine Panel's opinion is that an ESI is Recommended (I), Moderate Confidence for select circumstances as an option for treatment of acute or subacute radicular pain syndromes, typically after treatment with NSAID and waiting at least 3 weeks; its purpose is to provide a few weeks of partial pain relief while awaiting spontaneous improvement and remaining as active as practical. Effects of series of injections should be assessed, and there should not be a series of injections (eg, three) ordered. Epidural glucocorticosteroid injections are Moderately Not Recommended (B), Moderate Confidence for treatment of spinal stenosis, and are Not Recommended (D), Evidence (C), High Confidence for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain in the absence of significant radicular symptoms. Fluoroscopic guidance improves placement accuracy, as blind targeting has been shown to be 77% accurate.

Caudal Epidural Steroid Injection

In the Manchikanti review, there were ten high-quality RCTs meeting inclusion criteria. Two compared caudal epidural injections to interlaminar and transforaminal injections in the management of disc herniation, while one study compared transforaminal injections to caudal injections in the management of lumbar disc prolapse. The remaining studies evaluated treatment of spinal stenosis, axial back pain or post-surgery syndrome. None of the RCTs were placebo controlled. Using the criteria methodology from that review the following conclusions were drawn concerning caudal epidural steroid injections: Level III evidence that caudal and interlaminar approaches are equivalent, Level II–III evidence for treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with caudal approaches, Level II in post-surgery syndrome, Level III evidence that transforaminal approaches are superior to caudal approaches.

Evidence Summary

For epidural interventions, RCTs and observational studies with functional status improvement measures were included. Short-term relief was defined as less than six months whereas greater than six months was considered long-term relief. The ASPN consensus guideline committee reviewed the 36 RCTs mentioned above as being of high quality. No additional studies were identified in our search process. For epidural interventions, there was sufficient evidence in the form of RCTs (Table 3), for the committee to make recommendations. Table 4 summarizes those recommendations.

Lumbar interlaminar epidural injections — spinal stenosis study set — include randomized and observational studies summarized in Table 11 and one new SPORT subgroup analysis that was excluded; there were only 69 patients receiving epidural steroid injection, so results may not be applied to contemporary interventional pain management settings and the study failed to meet inclusion criteria. Across eligible studies, there were 5 randomized trials and one non-randomized study with at least moderate methodologic quality, though none utilized 100 or more patients; two randomized trials were performed under fluoroscopy, with a preliminary report by Manchikanti et al showing positive results with local anesthetic as well as steroids and the other randomized fluoroscopically guided trial showing short-term positive results. In randomized trials without fluoroscopy, one study utilized an intermuscular injection control considered as a placebo, and short-term results were positive with blind epidural for spinal stenosis with a small number of patients in one trial.

Suggestions for future research on epidural steroid injections (ESIs) highlight gaps and propose a true placebo control: There was no evidence for the effect of ESIs on other relevant outcomes, including QOL, subsequent surgery rate, functional status, and return to work, and no studies were available addressing the effect of ESIs on subsequent surgery or reduced analgesic or opioid use. Studies of ESIs in cervical radiculopathy and cervical stenosis are limited. To address control effects, the authors propose that the parallel control group would receive an IM saline injection to a lumbar paraspinal muscle with a saline volume of 0.5–1.0 mL.

Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) — short-term disability in cervical and lumbar radiculopathy: Three Class I studies and 6 Class II studies addressed radiculopathies, and all studies evaluated lumbar radiculopathy except for 1 that evaluated cervical radiculopathy. A random-effects (RE) meta-analysis of all 9 studies revealed an SRD of −16.0%, with I2 = 57% and NNT 6, favoring ESIs to reduce short-term disability. The conclusion states that for patients with cervical or lumbar radiculopathy, ESIs probably reduce short-term disability, and this conclusion is driven by lumbar data because only 1 Class II study evaluated cervical radiculopathy.

Friedly et al performed a 400-patient, multicenter double-blind randomized trial comparing epidural local anesthetic plus steroid injection to epidural local anesthetic injection. The ESI technique (transforaminal vs interlaminar) was at the discretion of the procedural physician, as was the choice of steroid and dose (betamethasone, triamcinolone, dexamethasone, or methylprednisolone). At the 6-week follow-up, both groups had significant improvement in the primary outcome of Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire score, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. At the 3-week time point, the steroid group had significantly greater improvement compared to the local anesthetic-alone group. Patients in the steroid group reported significantly greater satisfaction on the Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire compared to the local only group (67% of patients vs 54% of patients, respectively).

Fukusaki et al performed a comparative trial of non-image guided interlaminar epidural saline vs local anesthetic, vs local anesthetic plus 40 mg of methylprednisolone in 53 patients with NC in the setting of lumbar stenosis. All patients received a series of three injections over the first week of the trial. At 1-week follow-up, the local anesthetic group and the steroid group had a significant increase in the primary outcome of improved walking distance; however, by 1 month and 3 months, there was no significant improvement in any of the three groups.

Finally, Wei et al performed a randomized trial of 90 patients with unilateral leg pain in the setting of low-grade mild-to-moderate LSS. Subjects were randomized into one of three fluoroscopic guided transforaminal epidural groups: lidocaine only, lidocaine plus 10 mg etanercept (a TNF-alpha inhibitor drug), or lidocaine plus steroid (2 mL diprospan). All three groups had significant short-term improvement in VAS and ODI at 1-month follow-up. At 3 months, there was an increase in VAS and ODI and by 6 months these measures returned to baseline in the local-only group and the local-plus-steroid group. The local plus TNF-alpha group had greater improvement than the other two groups at 1 month follow-up and that improvement in VAS and ODI was sustained at the 3- and 6-month follow-up period.

### Lumbar interlaminar epidural injections are superior to caudal epidural injections in managing lumbar central spinal stenosis [^b330821e]. Pain Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Epidural injections are performed to manage lumbar central spinal stenosis pain utilizing caudal, interlaminar, and transforaminal approaches. The literature on the efficacy of epidural injections in managing lumbar central spinal stenosis pain is sparse; lacking multiple, high quality randomized trials with long-term follow-up.

Methods

Two randomized controlled trials of the caudal and lumbar interlaminar approaches that assessed 220 patients with lumbar central spinal stenosis were analyzed.

Results

The analysis found efficacy for both caudal and interlaminar approaches in managing chronic pain and disability from central spinal stenosis was demonstrated. In the patients responsive to treatment, those with at least 3 weeks of improvement with the first 2 procedures, 51% reported significant improvement with caudal epidural injections, whereas it was 84% with local anesthetic only with interlaminar epidurals, 57% with caudal and 83% with lumbar interlaminar with local anesthetic with steroid. The response rate was 38% with caudal and 72% with lumbar interlaminar with local anesthetic only and 44% with caudal and 73% with lumbar interlaminar with local anesthetic with steroid when all patients were considered. In the interlaminar approach, results were superior for pain relief and functional status with fewer nonresponsive patients compared to the caudal approach.

Limitations

The data was derived from 2 previously published randomized, controlled trials rather than comparing 2 techniques in one randomized controlled trial. Further, the randomized controlled trials were active control trials without a placebo.

Conclusions

The results of this assessment showed significant improvement in patients suffering with chronic lumbar spinal stenosis with caudal and interlaminar epidural approaches with local anesthetic only, or with steroids in a long-term follow-up of up to 2 years, in contemporary interventional pain management setting, with the interlaminar approach providing significantly better results.

### Role of epidural steroids in the management of chronic spinal pain: a systematic review of effectiveness and complications [^72a9bc66]. Pain Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Epidural steroid injections are commonly used for chronic spinal pain. However, there is no conclusive evidence regarding their effectiveness, and debate continues as to their value in managing chronic spinal pain.

Objective

To evaluate various types of epidural injections (interlaminar, transforaminal, and caudal) for managing chronic spinal pain (axial and radicular).

Study Design

A systematic review utilizing the criteria established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for evaluation of randomized and non-randomized trials, and criteria of the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group for randomized trials.

Methods

Data sources included relevant English literature identified through searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE (January 1966 to November 2004), manual searches of bibliographies of known primary and review articles and abstracts from scientific meetings within the last 2 years. Three reviewers independently assessed the trials for the quality of their methods. Subgroup analyses were performed for trials with different control groups, with different modes of epidurals (interlaminar, transforaminal, and caudal), with different injection sites (cervical/thoracic, lumbar/sacral), and with timing of outcome measurement (short- and long-term).

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was pain relief. Other outcome measures were functional improvement, improvement of psychological status, and return to work. Short-term improvement was defined as less than 6 weeks, and long-term improvement was defined as 6 weeks or longer.

Results

For lumbar radicular pain with interlaminar lumbar epidural steroid injections, the level of evidence was strong for short-term relief and limited for long-term relief. For cervical radicular pain with cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injections, the evidence was moderate. The evidence for lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections for lumbar nerve root pain was strong for short-term and moderate for long term improvement. The evidence for cervical transforaminal epidural steroid injections for cervical nerve root pain was moderate. The evidence was limited for lumbar radicular pain in post lumbar laminectomy syndrome. The evidence for caudal epidural steroid injections was strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief. For managing chronic postlumbar laminectomy syndrome and spinal stenosis the evidence was limited for low back and radicular pain. The evidence was moderate for chronic low back pain.

Conclusion

The evidence for effectiveness of epidural injections in managing chronic spinal pain ranged from limited to strong.

### Improving the safety of epidural steroid injections… [^a3622cff]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

With the interlaminar approach, most of the injected drug remains in the posterior epidural space, whereas with the transforaminal approach, the drug is placed in close proximity to the spinal nerve and dorsal root ganglion and spreads into the lateral and anterior epidural space, the interspace between the spinal nerve and the herniated disk. Practitioners usually use the transforaminal approach when a single nerve root in one extremity is affected from a single lateral herniated disk and use the interlaminar approach when several spinal nerves are involved in one leg or in both legs, as in the case of central disk herniation. All cervical and lumbar interlaminar epidural steroid injections should be performed using image guidance, with appropriate anteroposterior, lateral, or contralateral oblique views and a test dose of contrast medium. Cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injections are recommended to be performed at C7-T1, but preferably not higher than the C6-7 level. No cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injection should be undertaken, at any segmental level, without preprocedural review of prior imaging studies demonstrating sufficient epidural spatial dimensions for needle placement at the target level. Particulate steroids should not be used in therapeutic cervical transforaminal injections.

### A randomized, double-blind controlled trial of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections in central spinal stenosis: 2-year follow-up [^08c5308d]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Background

While low back pain is the number one cause of disability in the United States, lumbar spinal stenosis along with intervertebral disc herniation and degenerative spondylolisthesis is one of the 3 most common diagnosis of low back and leg pain for which surgery is performed. Numerous modalities of treatments including drug therapy and complex surgical fusions have been recommended for treatment of central spinal stenosis. Epidural injections are one of the commonly performed nonsurgical interventions in managing central spinal stenosis; however, there has been paucity of literature in reference to efficacy of epidural injections in managing central spinal stenosis with lumbar interlaminar epidural injections.

Study Design

A randomized, double-blind, active controlled trial.

Setting

Private interventional pain management practice and specialty referral center in the United States.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections with or without steroids in providing effective and long-lasting pain relief with improvement in functional status for the management of chronic low back and lower extremity pain related to lumbar central spinal stenosis.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, active-control trial was designed with the inclusion of 120 patients assigned to 2 groups. Group I patients received lumbar interlaminar epidural injections of local anesthetic (lidocaine 0.5%) 6 mL, whereas Group II received lumbar interlaminar epidural injections with local anesthetic (lidocaine 0.5%) 5 mL mixed with 1 mL of steroids and 6 mg of betamethasone.

Outcomes Assessment

Outcomes were assessed utilizing the numeric pain rating scale (NRS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post treatment. The primary outcome measure was significant improvement, defined as 50% improvement in pain and disability scores.

Results

Significant relief and functional status improvement was seen in 72% and 73% of patients in Groups I and II at the end of 2 years considering all participants; however, this was 84% and 85% in the successful group. Overall significant improvement was achieved for 65.7 ± 37.3 weeks in Group 1 and 68.9 ± 37.7 weeks in Group II at the end of 2 years when all participants were considered; whereas, this was 77 ± 27.8 weeks and 77.9 ± 30.2 weeks when they were separated into successful categories. The average number of procedures per patient was 5 to 6 in both groups.

Limitations

Limitations of this trial include lack of placebo control group and treatment of patients with multiple procedures over a period of 2 years.

Conclusion

Lumbar interlaminar epidural injections of local anesthetic with or without steroids provide relief in a significant proportion of patients with lumbar central spinal stenosis.

Clinical Trial

NCT00681447.

### A protocol for a single-centered, pragmatic, randomized, controlled, parallel trial comparing comprehensive nonsurgical therapy options for individuals with lumbar spinal stenosis [^01cd859d]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The condition, known as lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), is primarily acquired degenerative stenosis, characterized by reduced space in the neural foramen or lumbar spinal canal, resulting in compression of the nerves or blood vessels. More than 100 million patients are affected. Neurogenic claudication (NC) and other neurological symptoms in the lower back and lower limbs, with or without pain, may be brought on by degenerative LSS. Walking makes LSS symptoms worse while lying down makes them go away. When treating LSS, non-surgical procedures are often advised as first-line therapy, with surgical procedures being reserved for individuals who do not improve with conservative care (CC).

Improved pain management, increased walking distance, and relief of neurological symptoms are the three main treatment objectives of the non-surgical CC of LSS. Physiotherapy, including massage, acupuncture, thermotherapy, and kinesiotherapy, are presently regarded as the most effective therapies in rehabilitation. Other therapies, such as steroid epidural injection (ESI) and pharmaceutical treatments, often center on pharmacology. Non-surgical CC is advised for the clinical improvement of LSS, but no particular therapy or combined therapy has been established as a superior intervention.

### Epidural steroid warning controversy still dogging FDA [^3b873b12]. Pain Physician (2014). Low credibility.

On April 23, 2014, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a letter of warning that injection of corticosteroids into the epidural space of the spine may result in rare, but serious adverse events, including "loss of vision, stroke, paralysis, and death". The advisory also advocated that patients should discuss the benefits and risks of epidural corticosteroid injections with their health care professionals, along with the benefits and risks associated with other possible treatments. In addition, the FDA stated that the effectiveness and safety of the corticosteroids for epidural use have not been established, and the FDA has not approved corticosteroids for such use. To raise awareness of the risks of epidural corticosteroid injections in the medical community, the FDA's Safe Use Initiative convened a panel of experts including pain management experts to help define the techniques for such injections with the aim of reducing preventable harm. The panel was unable to reach an agreement on 20 proposed items related to technical aspects of performing epidural injections. Subsequently, the FDA issued the above referenced warning and a notice that a panel will be convened in November 2014. This review assesses the inaccuracies of the warning and critically analyzes the available literature. The literature has been assessed in reference to alternate techniques and an understanding of the risk factors when performing transforaminal epidural injections in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions, ultimately resulting in improved safety. The results of this review show the efficacy of epidural injections, with or without steroids, in a multitude of spinal ailments utilizing caudal, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar interlaminar approaches as well as lumbar transforaminal epidural injections. The evidence also shows the superiority of steroids in managing lumbar disc herniation utilizing caudal and lumbar interlaminar approaches without any significant difference as compared to transforaminal approaches, either with local anesthetic alone or local anesthetic and steroids combined. In conclusion, the authors request that the FDA modify the warning based on the evidence.

### Short-term improvements in disability mediate patient satisfaction after epidural corticosteroid injections for symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis [^eec5f399]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Secondary analysis of data from a double-blind randomized controlled trial.

Objective

To identify mediators of the effect of lumbar epidural injections of corticosteroid plus lidocaine on patient satisfaction at 6 weeks postinjection in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. We hypothesized that short-term (≤ 3 wk) change in leg pain would be a significant mediator of satisfaction.

Summary Of Background Data

No prior studies have identified mediators of effects of epidural injections on patient satisfaction with treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis.

Methods

We used mediation analysis methods to examine selected intermediate variables (adverse events and change in leg pain, back pain, disability, depression, and fatigue at 3 wk) as potential mediators of the effect of lumbar epidural injections of corticosteroid plus lidocaine on patient satisfaction with treatment. We used the overall satisfaction item from the Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire as our primary outcome to measure patient satisfaction with the injection procedure at 6 weeks.

Results

Among 400 patients randomized to receive epidural injections with corticosteroid plus lidocaine or with lidocaine alone, 369 had complete data for the satisfaction outcome and potential mediators and served as the analysis sample. Contrary to our expectations, 3-week change in leg pain intensity did not have significant mediation effects on patient satisfaction. Three-week change in disability as measured by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire was a significant mediator of the effects of lumbar epidural corticosteroid injections on patient satisfaction at 6 weeks, explaining 48% to 60% of the treatment effect on satisfaction. Changes in pain intensity in the leg and back together explained very little of the treatment effect on satisfaction beyond the information contributed by disability change alone. We did not find other intermediate variables to be mediators of patient satisfaction.

Conclusion

These findings support the current approach of examining disability as a primary patient-reported outcome in comparative effectiveness studies of lumbar spinal stenosis.

### Comparative clinical effectiveness of nonsurgical treatment methods in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis: a randomized clinical trial [^ae977599]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a degenerative condition of the spine prevalent in 30% of older adults. Lumbar spinal stenosis is associated with substantial functional limitation of walking, disability, and increased risk of falling. Lumbar spinal stenosis accounts for the fastest growth in lumbar surgery in older adults in the United States. The rate of complex fusion procedures for this condition has increased by 137% between 1998 and 2008. These surgical procedures lead to significant costs, risks, complications, and rehospitalizations. However, evidence is lacking for the effectiveness of nonsurgical interventions and treatment options for patients with LSS.

The North American Spine Society has published a clinical guideline for the treatment of LSS. The only 2 interventions recommended as evidence based and effective were epidural steroid injection and surgical decompression. This guideline concluded that there was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of nonsurgical treatments, including pharmacologic treatments, physical therapy, exercise, and spinal manipulation. Yet, the only nonsurgical intervention favorably recommended by the North American Spine Society has been contradicted by recent reviews that concluded that the evidence for the effectiveness of epidural injections is of low quality.

Since publication of the North American Spine Society guideline, several systematic reviews have corroborated the evidence gap about nonsurgical treatments for LSS. To help bridge this gap, we performed a randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of 3 nonsurgical interventions on symptoms and physical function (primary aims) as well as physical activity (secondary aim) in patients with LSS. Exploratory aims included analyses of the number of adverse events, attrition/adherence rates, fall rates, and number of cointerventions.

### The effect of epidural steroid injection on postoperative outcome in patients from the lumbar spinal stenosis outcome study [^2be10f07]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of data from patients participating in the Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Outcome Study (LSOS).

Objective

The aim of LSOS was to assess clinical outcomes after surgical or nonoperative treatment in patients with and without prior epidural steroid injections.

Summary Of Background Data

Epidural steroid injections (ESI), a common treatment modality, reduce symptoms in the short-term, but according to a subgroup analysis from the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) they reduce the amount of improvement after subsequent surgical or nonoperative treatment.

Methods

The data of 281 patients with lumbar spinal stenosis who had completed baseline and 6-month follow-up assessments were analyzed. Patients completed the Spinal Stenosis Measure (SSM). Changes in the SSM scores from baseline to follow-up were compared between patients with and without prior ESI, for the surgical and nonsurgical treatment groups.

Results

The mean (SD) age of the patients was 75 (8.7) years. 229 patients underwent surgery and 111 of these had received an ESI in the 12 months before surgery. Of the 52 patients treated nonoperatively, 29 had received a prior ESI. The unadjusted changes (improvement) in the SSM-symptom scores between baseline and 6 months' follow up were: surgery and prior ESI 0.95, surgery and no prior ESI 0.78 (P = 0.15); no surgery and prior ESI 0.28, no surgery and no prior ESI 0.29 (P = 0.85). When adjusted for confounding factors, the reduction in SSM-symptom score was greater for surgery than for nonoperative treatment by 0.41 points (P < 0.001); the effect of having had an ESI prior to study entry was -0.08 (P = 0.40).

Conclusion

The analysis of outcomes in the LSOS cohort provided no evidence that ESIs have a negative effect on the short-term outcome of surgery or nonoperative treatment in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (update) [^69968b32]. The Spine Journal (2013). Medium credibility.

X STOP randomized comparison — medical/interventional group outcomes are detailed: patients were randomized to X STOP or medical/interventional management, with nonsurgical treatment including at least one epidural steroid injection, NSAIDs, analgesics and physical therapy. The primary outcome was the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire, with SF-36 and range of motion as secondary outcomes. At follow-up, 81 of the 91 medical/interventional patients were assessable; in this group, 44% reported at least some improvement in pain and 43% reported at least some improvement in physical function. The guideline states this provides Level IV evidence that approximately 40% of patients treated medically/interventionally will show improvements in pain and physical function.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^58bd67c4]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

Lumbar interlaminar epidural injections — of the 13 studies included in this assessment there were no placebo-controlled trials meeting the inclusion criteria, and among these, 4 studies assessed the role of epidural procedures with local anesthetic with or without steroid; one study exclusively included central spinal stenosis and one study was performed on axial or discogenic pain. Based on these high and moderate quality studies, the level of evidence is Level I for disc herniation with strong recommendation, Level I for spinal stenosis with moderate to strong recommendation, Level II for axial or discogenic pain with moderate to strong recommendation. Kaye et al performed analysis separating into caudal, interlaminar, and transforaminal epidural injections with evidence levels of I to II based on the RCTs. Appropriately performed cost utility analysis also showed lumbar interlaminar epidural injections to be cost effective within the range of multiple interventional techniques and significantly better than surgical interventions at 2-year follow-up; however, inappropriately performed cost utility analysis showed highest cost effectiveness of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation, central spinal stenosis, and axial or discogenic low back pain in 360 patients with 3 RCTs, with a total direct cost including direct and indirect costs of $3,425 for disc herniation, $3,527 for axial or discogenic pain without disc herniation, $2,961 for central spinal stenosis, and an overall average cost of $3,301. Comparative studies showed generally superiority of transforaminal epidural injections over interlaminar epidural injections in managing disc herniation; with central stenosis, overall, 3 studies were identified, including one with a 24-month follow-up with 120 patients in a randomization of 60 patients in each group showing positive results at 24 months with repeat injections.

### Effectiveness of therapeutic lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar spinal pain [^8ae25c11]. Pain Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Among the multiple interventions used in managing chronic spinal pain, lumbar epidural injections have been used extensively to treat lumbar radicular pain. Among caudal, interlaminar, and transforaminal, transforaminal epidural injections have gained rapid and widespread acceptance for the treatment of lumbar and lower extremity pain. The potential advantages of transforaminal over interlaminar and caudal, include targeted delivery of a steroid to the site of pathology, presumably onto an inflamed nerve root. However, there are only a few well-designed, randomized, controlled studies on the effectiveness of steroid injections. Consequently, multiple systematic reviews with diverse opinions have been published.

Study Design

A systematic review of therapeutic transforaminal epidural injection therapy for low back and lower extremity pain.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of therapeutic transforaminal lumbar epidural steroid injections in managing low back and lower extremity pain.

Methods

The available literature on lumbar transforaminal epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain was reviewed. The quality assessment and clinical relevance criteria utilized were the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group criteria as utilized for interventional techniques for randomized trials and by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale criteria for observational studies. Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 to December 2011, and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles. The level of evidence was classified as good, fair, or poor based on the quality of evidence developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was pain relief (short-term relief = up to 6 months and long-term > 6 months). Secondary outcome measures were improvement in functional status, psychological status, return to work, and reduction in opioid intake.

Results

For this systematic review, 70 studies were identified. Of these, 43 studies were excluded and a total of 27 studies met inclusion criteria for methodological quality assessment with 15 randomized trials (with 2 duplicate publications) and 10 non-randomized studies. For lumbar disc herniation, the evidence is good for transforaminal epidural with local anesthetic and steroids, whereas it was fair for local anesthetics alone and the ability of transforaminal epidural injections to prevent surgery. For spinal stenosis, the available evidence is fair for local anesthetic and steroids. The evidence for axial low back pain and post lumbar surgery syndrome is poor, inadequate, limited, or unavailable.

Limitations

The limitations of this systematic review include the paucity of literature.

Conclusion

In summary, the evidence is good for radiculitis secondary to disc herniation with local anesthetics and steroids and fair with local anesthetic only; it is fair for radiculitis secondary to spinal stenosis with local anesthetic and steroids; and limited for axial pain and post surgery syndrome using local anesthetic with or without steroids.

### Effect of caudal epidural steroid or saline injection in chronic lumbar radiculopathy: multicentre, blinded, randomised controlled trial [^3dc10f08]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

We did magnetic resonance imaging (n = 110) or computed tomography (n = 6) in all included patients. Experienced radiologists at each centre assessed the images and produced a written report for the investigators. Inclusion in the trial was not dependent on the results from the magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. The results did not have to correspond with those from the clinical examination. To be included, the patients had to have clinically proved radiculopathy. We excluded patients who showed severe intraspinal pathology (large disc herniations occupying more than 50% of the spinal canal, spinal stenosis, tumours, bleeding, dural fistula, synovial cysts, or dysraphia).

Each patient completed self administered questionnaires including the outcome measures, which were identical at baseline and follow-up. The baseline questionnaires contained additional questions about demographics, education, duration of pain, work status, avoidance of movement owing to fear of pain, medication, and lifestyle issues. We also monitored clinical signs of lumbar radiculopathy, need for physiotherapy or surgery during follow-up, whether the patient perceived benefit of the intervention, beliefs about fear avoidance, and working capability at each follow-up. All patients received standardised oral and written information about spine anatomy and function at baseline and follow-up. Patients were encouraged to engage in physical activity, and received an information brochure. Patients using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were told to stop this medical treatment.

Randomisation

The clinical research centre at the University Hospital of North Norway used a computer generated block scheme for randomisation, stratified by intervention hospital. The centre was contacted by telephone on the day of intervention. The individuals undertaking the randomisation did not take any further part in the trial.

Epidural Local Anesthetic vs Epidural Glucocorticoid

Cuckler et al performed a randomized trial comparing non-image guided interlaminar epidural procaine vs 80 mg methylprednisolone in a mixed group of patients with pain from either lumbar disc herniation or LSS. There was no significant difference in the patients with LSS between the two treatment groups achieving the primary outcome of "75% improvement" at short-term follow-up (24 hours) or long-term follow-up (mean approximately 20 months). At long-term follow-up 22% of the steroid group were improved vs 14% of the local anesthetic group. The mixed patient populations, the use of non-image guided injections, and the lack of a standardized outcome measure significantly limits the generalizability of this trial.

Nam and Park in a small randomized comparative trial without a placebo control group compared transforaminal epidural lidocaine vs epidural triamcinolone 20 mg in patients with lumbar scoliosis plus symptomatic LSS. Both groups had improvements in VAS pain scores and ODI functional improvement at all follow-up points up to the final 3-month visit. The steroid group had significantly greater improvement than the local anesthetic group. Manchikanti et al, in a series of randomized double-blind controlled trials, examined the effect of fluoroscopic guided caudal ESI and LESI for the treatment of LSS in a total of 220 patients. In summary, the trials demonstrated that both caudal and lumbar ESI with local anesthetic only and with steroid showed significant pain improvement, with the interlaminar technique showing overall greater improvement than the caudal approach. The primary outcome was 50% or greater improvement in pain (NRS) and disability scores (ODI). Patients were allowed repeat injections if the effects of a prior successful injection waned, and each of the caudal or lumber ESI local or steroid group patients received an average of approximately 5 to 6 injections over the course of the study period.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^6daa3116]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

Therapeutic lumbar epidural interventions — steroid dosing, endocrine effects, and repeat intervals are detailed as follows: Dosing limits have been advocated of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight of steroid, 210 mg per year in an average person, and a lifetime dose of 420 mg of steroid. In patients receiving corticosteroids for spinal stenosis, 32 patients (20.3%) experienced cortisol reduction at 3 weeks of greater than 50% compared with 10 patients (6.7%) treated with lidocaine only, and those treated with methylprednisolone or triamcinolone had an average 3-week cortisol reduction of 41% and 41.6% from baseline respectively. Hooten et al showed triamcinolone concentrations almost 22 days. In a dose dependent methylprednisolone evaluation, Eighty-six percent of patients who received 80 mg had laboratory confirmed HPA axis suppression one week post injection compared to 53% of those receiving 40 mg, and 20% had continued suppression at 4 weeks post injection. Frequency may be based on injectate type, with potential repeat after a 2 week waiting period, for dexamethasone and betamethasone of 2 to 4 weeks and for methylprednisolone and triamcinolone 4 weeks and 4 to 6 weeks based on the dosage. Randomized controlled trials included over 12,000 patients using local anesthetic alone or steroids with a low dose base test injection ranging from 3 mg to 6 mg and reported no major complications.

### Nonoperative treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication [^5fb38bd3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated pathological spinal conditions. It frequently afflicts the elderly population.

Objectives

To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of nonoperative treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication.

Search Methods

CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Index to Chiropractic Literature (ICL) databases were searched up to June 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials published in English, in which at least one arm provided data on nonoperative treatments

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Risk of bias in each study was independently assessed by two review authors using the 12 criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (Furlan 2009). Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as relative risk, continuous outcomes as mean difference or standardized mean difference; uncertainty was expressed with 95% confidence intervals. If possible a meta-analysis was performed, otherwise results were described qualitatively. GRADE was used to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

From the 8635 citations screened, 56 full-text articles were assessed and 21 trials (1851 participants) were included. There was very low-quality evidence from six trials that calcitonin is no better than placebo or paracetamol, regardless of mode of administration or outcome assessed. From single small trials, there was low-quality evidence for prostaglandins, and very low-quality evidence for gabapentin or methylcobalamin that they improved walking distance. There was very low-quality evidence from a single trial that epidural steroid injections improved pain, function, and quality of life, up to two weeks, compared with home exercise or inpatient physical therapy. There was low-quality evidence from a single trial that exercise is of short-term benefit for leg pain and function compared with no treatment. There was low and very low-quality evidence from six trials that multimodal nonoperative treatment is less effective than indirect or direct surgical decompression with or without fusion. A meta-analysis of two trials comparing direct decompression with or without fusion to multimodal nonoperative care found no significant difference in function at six months (mean difference (MD) -3.66, 95% CI -10.12 to 2.80) and one year (MD -6.18, 95% CI -15.03 to 2.66), but at 24 months a significant difference was found favouring decompression (MD -4.43, 95% CI -7.91 to -0.96).

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate and high-quality evidence for nonoperative treatment is lacking and thus prohibits recommendations for guiding clinical practice. Given the expected exponential rise in the prevalence of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication, large high-quality trials are urgently needed.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^7de1e29f]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — systemic cortisol effects after epidural steroid injections in spinal stenosis are reported with 32 of 200 patients (20.3%) having a 3-week cortisol reduction ≥ 50% versus 10 patients (6.7%) with lidocaine only; methylprednisolone or triamcinolone produced average 3-week reductions of 41% and 41.6%, betamethasone or dexamethasone showed no significant changes, and higher suppression rates at 3 weeks were noted particularly with longer acting insoluble corticosteroid formulations.

### Effect of caudal epidural steroid or saline injection in chronic lumbar radiculopathy: multicentre, blinded, randomised controlled trial [^b55bd12f]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

At baseline, all patients had clinically verified lumbar radiculopathy (table 1). At 52 week follow-up, 27 (27%) patients still had a lumbar radiculopathy, with no significant differences seen between the groups (P = 0.95). At 52 week follow-up, 49 (50%) patients stated that they had received "much" or "some" benefit from the treatment, with no significant differences seen between the groups (P = 0.81).

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — comparative effectiveness of epidural injections for sciatica and chronic pain: A network meta-analysis of management strategies for sciatica reviewing 122 relevant studies and 21 treatment strategies showed a statistically significant improvement with epidural injections, and a comparative network meta-analysis found that epidural steroid with local anesthetic was superior to epidural steroid without local anesthetic and to intramuscular steroid; subcutaneous antitumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) was superior to epidural local spinal anesthetic at reducing pain, but epidural steroids produced superior reductions in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores compared to subcutaneous anti-TNF-α. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reported after review of 73 trials that adding corticosteroids to local anesthetic had only small benefits with a potential for harm and no meaningful improvement in pain scores or duration of pain relief, and the authors recommended that clinical decisions should consider the potential for harm with steroids and the therapeutic benefit by the local anesthetic alone; additionally, a prior systematic review of 4 randomized trials was rated very low in methodologic quality, and despite numerous systematic reviews there have not been guidelines systematically developed to assess clinical and cost effectiveness of epidural injections, including percutaneous adhesiolysis, in managing spinal pain.

ASIPP lumbar epidural steroid injection approaches and steroid type — One trial showed the transforaminal approach to be superior to interlaminar and caudal in a small study with only a 6-month follow-up, while other studies found no significant difference between specific technique variations (pre-ganglionic vs ganglionic at 6 months; supraneural safe triangle vs Kambin triangle at 3 months). In steroid formulation comparisons, transforaminal injections with particulate versus nonparticulate corticosteroid showed effectiveness of triamcinolone and dexamethasone with pain relief and functional improvement up to 6 months without clear group differences. In a comparative evaluation with randomization into 3 groups, 140 patients were allocated to caudal (80 patients), transforaminal (40 patients), or interlaminar (8 patients), with one-year JOA score improvement in 74.3% for caudal, 77.7% for interlaminar, and 90% for transforaminal; the transforaminal route was significantly more effective than caudal and interlaminar at both 6 months and one-year, with no significant difference between caudal and interlaminar. Another study randomized 90 patients to caudal, interlaminar, or transforaminal (30 patients in each group), followed patients for 12 months but presented only 6-month results, reporting that change in pain scores was statistically different at 1- and 6-month intervals.
