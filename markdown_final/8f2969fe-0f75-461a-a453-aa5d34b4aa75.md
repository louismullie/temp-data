## Question

Spontaneous bacterial prophylaxis alternative regimens

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about alternative regimens for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis in cirrhosis, including when and how to use them, and how to navigate resistance and stewardship concerns. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts that warrant prophylaxis. Then, I should verify the standard-of-care regimens and their evidence base. Next, I will examine validated alternatives and their comparative data. After that, I need to consider resistance patterns and stewardship constraints. Finally, I will synthesize practical, scenario-based recommendations and highlight knowledge gaps and future directions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts where prophylaxis is indicated, because I need to ensure we are not overgeneralizing. Secondary prophylaxis is indicated after a prior episode of SBP due to the high recurrence risk, typically around 70% at one year, and guidelines endorse long-term daily norfloxacin in this setting [^114itsjs] [^1176ftEF]. Primary prophylaxis is considered in selected high-risk patients without prior SBP, particularly those with low ascitic protein (< 1.5 g/dL) plus advanced liver disease or renal dysfunction, recognizing that the 1-year SBP risk can be 20–60% in this subgroup [^11277hDs] [^115DA4bU]. For acute variceal bleeding, short-term prophylaxis is recommended for 5–7 days, historically with norfloxacin, but contemporary guidance favors IV ceftriaxone due to rising quinolone resistance and superior infection prevention in advanced cirrhosis [^114nncfC] [^1137TFiH].

> Now, I should verify the standard-of-care regimens and their evidence. For secondary prophylaxis, norfloxacin 400 mg daily is first-line and supported by randomized data showing a marked reduction in 1-year SBP recurrence versus placebo, from about 68% to 20% [^114itsjs] [^116wtfuc]. For primary prophylaxis in high-risk low-protein ascites, norfloxacin reduced first SBP from 61% to 7% in a pivotal trial, though mortality benefit beyond 3 months has been inconsistent in more recent studies, so I need to be cautious in extrapolating survival gains [^113FbXwy] [^1114RNB2]. For GI bleeding, IV ceftriaxone 1 g daily for up to 7 days is preferred in advanced cirrhosis, with older guidance allowing norfloxacin 400 mg twice daily when ceftriaxone is unavailable, but I should emphasize the resistance-driven shift toward ceftriaxone [^114nncfC] [^114VXy8p].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about alternatives; I should review comparative data carefully. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily is a reasonable alternative when norfloxacin is unavailable, though direct head-to-head evidence is limited and guidelines frame this as acceptable rather than preferred [^114itsjs] [^116wtfuc]. Rifaximin has been explored as an alternative, with some trials suggesting lower SBP recurrence than norfloxacin in secondary prophylaxis, but EASL notes insufficient evidence to recommend rifaximin as a routine alternative to norfloxacin, and a recent randomized trial of rifaximin for primary prophylaxis failed to improve 12-month survival, tempering enthusiasm despite signals of fewer complications in adherent patients [^111h1hjV] [^115Vp2DD]. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 160/800 mg daily is endorsed by some guidelines as an alternative, particularly for secondary prophylaxis, but I should confirm that evidence quality is low and resistance concerns persist, especially with long-term use [^111kxgCY] [^113A1SnX].

> Wait, let me verify the resistance landscape because it directly shapes regimen choice. Long-term fluoroquinolone prophylaxis is associated with increased quinolone resistance and gram-positive SBP, and colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms predicts prophylaxis failure and worse outcomes, so I need to ensure local antibiograms inform decisions and consider MDRO screening in high-risk patients on prophylaxis [^1121eQ4v] [^112URD1Z]. National VA data show higher fluoroquinolone and TMP-SMX resistance among patients on prophylaxis who later develop SBP, reinforcing the need for stewardship and periodic reassessment of ongoing prophylaxis [^1154Jg3o]. In settings with high quinolone resistance, ceftriaxone is favored for bleeding-related prophylaxis, and broader empiric therapy may be needed for nosocomial or healthcare-associated infections [^114nncfC] [^1145bFR9].

> I should double-check stewardship principles and how they apply here. Prophylaxis should be reserved for clearly indicated subgroups, reassessed regularly, and discontinued when risk profiles change or transplant occurs, aligning with antimicrobial stewardship frameworks that target overuse, excessive spectrum, and prolonged durations in medical prophylaxis [^1148Gx5x]. The Cochrane network meta-analysis concludes there is very low certainty about which antibiotic is most beneficial and whether prophylaxis improves mortality, underscoring the need for individualized risk–benefit discussions and shared decision-making, especially for primary prophylaxis [^113ddbNg]. But wait, what if we consider cycling strategies to mitigate resistance? Alternating regimens have been proposed, yet evidence remains limited and heterogeneous, so I should avoid recommending cycling outside trials or carefully selected cases [^1148Gx5x] [^112u92kQ].

> Let me synthesize practical, scenario-based recommendations while keeping these constraints in mind. For secondary prophylaxis after a prior SBP episode, continue norfloxacin 400 mg daily if tolerated. If norfloxacin is unavailable or not tolerated, ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily is acceptable, and TMP-SMX 160/800 mg daily is a reasonable alternative in selected patients, with explicit counseling about resistance risks and monitoring for adverse effects such as hyperkalemia and cytopenias [^114itsjs] [^111kxgCY] [^113A1SnX]. For primary prophylaxis in high-risk low-protein ascites with advanced liver or renal dysfunction, consider norfloxacin 400 mg daily after discussing uncertainties and potential harms. If norfloxacin is unsuitable, ciprofloxacin or TMP-SMX may be considered off-label, recognizing weaker evidence and resistance concerns, and rifaximin should not be used routinely for primary prophylaxis outside trials given the neutral survival data [^11277hDs] [^115DA4bU] [^115Vp2DD]. For acute variceal bleeding, use IV ceftriaxone 1 g daily for up to 7 days in advanced cirrhosis, reserving oral norfloxacin only if ceftriaxone is unavailable and local resistance permits, with prompt de-escalation when appropriate [^114nncfC] [^1137TFiH].

> I need to ensure we address special populations and operational details. In patients with concomitant hepatic encephalopathy managed with rifaximin, some clinicians consider dual-purpose use for HE control and potential SBP prevention, but I should confirm that high-quality evidence for rifaximin in SBP prophylaxis remains limited and that guideline endorsement is cautious at best, so shared decision-making is essential [^113ZTM6z] [^111h1hjV]. For patients with documented MDRO colonization or prior resistant infections, I should reconsider fluoroquinolone prophylaxis and coordinate with infectious diseases for tailored strategies, including periodic MDRO screening and alternative agents when indicated [^112URD1Z] [^1145bFR9].

> Next, I should review monitoring and discontinuation criteria to avoid indefinite prophylaxis. Reassess the indication at each visit, discontinue prophylaxis after liver transplantation, and consider stopping if ascites resolves, renal function normalizes, or the patient experiences repeated breakthrough infections suggesting resistance or nonadherence, with vigilance for adverse effects such as QT prolongation with fluoroquinolones and electrolyte disturbances with TMP-SMX [^1148Gx5x] [^112RF3hn]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines also emphasize documenting rationale and counseling patients about uncertain long-term benefits and resistance risks to support informed consent and stewardship alignment [^112qsq2X].

> Finally, I will examine knowledge gaps and future directions so we do not overstate current certainties. High-quality, adequately powered randomized trials are needed to clarify comparative effectiveness, mortality impact, and resistance outcomes across norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, TMP-SMX, and rifaximin, and to test novel strategies such as cycling or biomarker-guided prophylaxis, while expanding non-antibiotic preventive approaches to reduce reliance on long-term antimicrobials [^113ddbNg] [^117P11Zv]. Until then, I should continue to individualize prophylaxis, anchor decisions in guideline-supported indications, and embed antimicrobial stewardship at every step to balance benefit and harm in this high-risk population [^112qsq2X].

For SBP prophylaxis, **norfloxacin 400 mg daily** is first-line [^1176ftEF]; if unavailable, use **ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily** or **trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 1 double-strength tablet daily** [^111kxgCY] [^113A1SnX]. Rifaximin is **not recommended** for SBP prophylaxis due to insufficient evidence [^111h1hjV] [^113ZTM6z]. For GI bleeding, use **ceftriaxone 1 g IV daily** for up to 7 days [^114nncfC] [^1137TFiH]. Prophylaxis should be individualized based on local resistance patterns and patient risk factors, with regular monitoring for resistance and adverse effects [^112qsq2X] [^112URD1Z].

---

## Indications for SBP prophylaxis

SBP prophylaxis is indicated for patients with cirrhosis and ascites who are at **high risk** of developing SBP:

- **Secondary prophylaxis**: Patients with a prior episode of SBP [^114itsjs] [^1176ftEF].
- **Primary prophylaxis**: Patients with low ascitic protein (< 1.5 g/dL) and advanced liver disease or renal dysfunction [^1122X7i3] [^11277hDs].
- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^114nncfC] [^113fqeic].

---

## Standard prophylactic regimens

| **Clinical scenario** | **Standard regimen** | **Alternative regimen** |
|-|-|-|
| Secondary prophylaxis | Norfloxacin 400 mg orally once daily [^111kxgCY] [^1176ftEF] | Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily [^111kxgCY] [^116wtfuc] or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 1 double-strength tablet orally once daily [^111gh16z] |
| Primary prophylaxis (low ascitic protein) | Norfloxacin 400 mg orally once daily [^113X57wm] [^11277hDs] | Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily [^112R1Xap] or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 1 double-strength tablet orally once daily [^111kxgCY] [^113A1SnX] |
| Gastrointestinal bleeding | Ceftriaxone 1 g IV once daily for up to 7 days [^114nncfC] [^1137TFiH] | Norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily or ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily if ceftriaxone is unavailable [^114VXy8p] |

---

## Alternative prophylactic regimens

Several **alternative regimens** have been studied, including:

- **Rifaximin**: Poorly absorbed antibiotic with minimal systemic side effects. Some studies suggest rifaximin may be as effective as norfloxacin in preventing SBP recurrence, but evidence is limited and conflicting [^113ZTM6z] [^115sSNcT] [^113Gj5f1]. EASL guidelines state there is insufficient evidence to recommend rifaximin as an alternative to norfloxacin for secondary prophylaxis [^111h1hjV].
- **Weekly ciprofloxacin**: A randomized controlled trial found weekly ciprofloxacin (500 mg once weekly) was as effective as daily norfloxacin in preventing SBP, but this regimen is not widely adopted due to concerns about resistance and adherence [^113X57wm].
- **Alternating regimens**: Alternating norfloxacin and rifaximin has been proposed to reduce resistance, but evidence is limited and not supported by major guidelines [^112u92kQ].

---

## Factors influencing regimen selection

Regimen selection should be **individualized** based on:

- **Local resistance patterns**: Quinolone resistance is increasing, necessitating careful selection and monitoring [^1137TFiH] [^112URD1Z].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Renal function, allergies, and tolerability [^11277hDs].
- **Cost and availability**: Norfloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are generally more affordable and widely available than rifaximin [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of prophylactic regimens

Regular monitoring is essential to ensure **effectiveness** and minimize **resistance**:

- **Clinical monitoring**: Regular assessment for breakthrough infections, adherence, and adverse effects [^113Gj5f1].
- **Microbiological monitoring**: Periodic surveillance of local resistance patterns and patient-specific colonization status [^112URD1Z].
- **Adjustment**: Regimens should be adjusted based on resistance data, patient response, and adverse effects [^1145bFR9].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Norfloxacin remains the **first-line prophylactic agent** for SBP, with ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as acceptable alternatives. Rifaximin is not currently recommended due to insufficient evidence. Prophylaxis should be individualized based on local resistance patterns, patient-specific factors, and regular monitoring for effectiveness and adverse effects.

### Long-term prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis [^117Y663m]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature regarding long-term prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with cirrhosis.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE (1967-September 2004) and bibliographic search of the English-language literature was conducted using the search terms spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, cirrhosis, antimicrobial, and prophylaxis.

Data Synthesis

Long-term antimicrobial prophylaxis has been shown to decrease recurrent SBP in cirrhotics with a prior episode. Prophylaxis in patients with low ascitic fluid protein has also been shown to reduce the incidence of SBP; however, studies are too in-homogeneous to identify subgroups that benefit the most.

Conclusions

Long-term antimicrobial therapy should be considered for secondary prophylaxis of SBP. Studies should be done to confirm this benefit and identify subsets of patients with low ascitic fluid protein who clearly benefit.

### Daily norfloxacin vs. weekly ciprofloxacin to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a randomized controlled trial [^113X57wm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

For the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients with ascites, norfloxacin 400mg per day is recommended as a standard regimen. This study aims to investigate whether ciprofloxacin once weekly administration is not inferior to norfloxacin once daily administration for the prevention of SBP.

Methods

This is an investigator-initiated open-label randomized controlled trial conducted at seven tertiary hospitals in South Korea. Liver cirrhosis patients with ascites were screened, and enrolled in this randomized controlled trial if ascitic protein ≤ 1.5g/dL or the presence of history of SBP. Ascitic polymorphonucleated cell count needed to be < 250/mm 3. Patients were randomly assigned into norfloxacin daily or ciprofloxacin weekly group, and followed-up for 12 months. Primary endpoint was the prevention of SBP.

Results

One hundred twenty-four patients met enrollment criteria and were assigned into each group by 1:1 ratio (62:62). Seven patients in the norfloxacin group and five patients in the ciprofloxacin group were lost to follow-up. SBP developed in four patients (4/55) and in three patients (3/57) in each group, respectively (7.3% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.712). The transplant-free survival rates at 1 year were comparable between the groups (72.7% vs. 73.7%, P = 0.970). Incidence of infectious complication, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal bleeding rates were not significantly different (all P = ns). The factors related to survival were models representing underlying liver function.

Conclusion

Once weekly ciprofloxacin was as effective as daily norfloxacin for the prevention of SBP in cirrhotic patients with ascites.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^117REDHR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Preoperative management of cirrhosis-related decompensations — elective surgery planning should maintain routine cirrhosis care and continue key therapies. The guideline states: "Remaining current with routine cirrhosis-related management prior to elective surgery, including hepatocellular carcinoma screening, optimization of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, variceal screening and/or bleeding prophylaxis, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis when indicated, may mitigate operative risk". It further specifies that "Patients with hepatic encephalopathy should have lactulose and/or rifaximin continued through the perioperative period, with close attention to serum sodium and minimization of medications that may exacerbate encephalopathy", and that "Patients taking nonselective beta blockers (NSBBs, e.g., carvedilol) for CSPH or secondary prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding should continue these medications in the peri-operative period, provided that the systolic blood pressure is over 90 mm Hg". For unclear variceal status, "upper endoscopy should be performed and NSBBs or band ligation should be pursued for large varices or medium varices with high-risk stigmata", and "Hepatocellular carcinoma screening should be up-to-date, especially as diagnosis of liver cancer may affect surgical decision-making and transplant consideration in selected patients".

### Quinolone and multidrug resistance predicts failure of antibiotic prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^112URD1Z]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients colonized with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) is unknown. We evaluated the effectiveness of fluoroquinolone-based SBP prophylaxis in an era and area of frequent antibiotic resistance.

Methods

This is a prospective observational study in patients with liver cirrhosis and an indication for fluoroquinolone-based prophylaxis of SBP. Patients were recruited and followed in a large German tertiary reference center with comprehensive microbiological and clinical monitoring performed at baseline and after 30, 60, 90, and 180 days of prophylaxis.

Results

Overall, 77 patients received antibiotic prophylaxis for an average of 93 days. Baseline prevalence of colonization with MDROs was high (N = 39, 50.6%). At least one de novo MDRO was detected in 27 patients (35.1%) during antibiotic prophylaxis; 33 patients (42.9%) developed secondary infections, including 14 cases (17.9%) of infections with MDROs, and 13 cases (16.9%) of de novo/recurrent SBP. Thirty patients (39.0%) died during follow-up. Significantly higher risks of SBP development during antibiotic prophylaxis were observed for patients with versus without any apparent MDROs (P = 0.009), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (P = 0.008), multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (P = 0.016), or quinolone-resistant gram-negative bacteria (QR-GNB) (P = 0.015). In competing risk analysis, QR-GNB were independently associated with prophylaxis failure (hazard ratio, 3.39; p = 0.045) and infections with QR-GNB were independently associated with death before SBP (subdistribution hazard risk, 6.47; p = 0.034).

Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis of SBP appears to be less efficient in patients with known MDROs. Regular MDRO screening seems to be useful to tailor treatment of secondary infections and re-evaluate antibiotic prophylaxis in case of selection of quinolone resistance.

### Ciprofloxacin in primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled study [^112R1Xap]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Low protein concentration in ascitic fluid has been identified as a risk factor for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Until now, primary prophylaxis has not been recommended in these patients. The aim was to investigate the efficacy of long-term administration of ciprofloxacin to prevent SBP.

Methods

One hundred cirrhotic patients with < 1.5 g/dl of total protein in ascitic fluid were randomized prospectively, in a double blind fashion to receive ciprofloxacin 500 mg/day (n = 50) or placebo (n = 50) for 12 months.

Results

Baseline data were similar in both groups. In the ciprofloxacin group, SBP occurred almost four times less frequently than in the placebo group but it was not statistically significant. The probability of survival at 12 months was significantly higher in patients receiving ciprofloxacin (86% versus 66%) (p < 0.04). SBP and sepsis were the most frequent causes of death in the placebo group whereas gastrointestinal bleeding was responsible for the most deaths in the ciprofloxacin group. The probability of remaining free of bacterial infections was higher in patients receiving ciprofloxacin (80% versus 55%) (p = 0.05).

Conclusions

Patients with cirrhosis and low protein concentration in ascitic fluid are candidates to receive long-term prophylaxis to reduce the risk of infections and improve survival.

### Indications for medical antibiotic prophylaxis and potential targets for antimicrobial stewardship intervention: a narrative review [^1148Gx5x]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Most of the antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) literature has focused on antimicrobial consumption for the treatment of infections, for the prophylaxis of surgical site infection and for the prevention of endocarditis. The role of AMS for medical antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) has not been adequately addressed.

Aims

To identify targets for AMS interventions for medical AP in adult patients.

Sources

Targeted searches were conducted in PubMed.

Content

The various indications for medical AP and relevant evidence from practice guidelines are outlined. The following were identified as potential targets for AMS interventions: (a) addressing under-utilization of antibiotic-sparing strategies (e.g. for recurrent urinary tract infections, recurrent soft-tissue infections, recurrent exacerbations associated with bronchiectasis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), (b) reducing unnecessary AP beyond recommended indications (e.g. for acute pancreatitis, bite wounds, or urinary catheter manipulations), (c) reducing the use of AP with a broader spectrum than necessary, (d) reducing the use of AP for longer than the recommended duration (e.g. AP for prevention of osteomyelitis in open fractures or AP in high-risk neutropenia), (e) evaluating the role of antibiotic cycling to prevent the emergence of resistance during prolonged AP (e.g. in recurrent urinary tract infections or prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), and (f) addressing research gaps regarding appropriate indications or antibiotic regimens for medical prophylaxis.

Implications

This review summarizes current trends in AP and proposes targets for AMS interventions.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^1122X7i3]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, more specifically with respect to primary prevention, advanced liver disease, BASL/BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to administer primary prophylaxis for SBP in high-risk patients, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL, with a discussion of potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties with patients.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112qsq2X]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis — AASLD 2021 guidance states that evidence for primary prophylaxis with antibiotics is not strong and is restricted to patients with very advanced cirrhosis, and SBP prophylaxis should be individualized based on estimated risks and benefits. SBP should receive long-term prophylaxis with daily norfloxacin; in settings in which norfloxacin is unavailable, oral ciprofloxacin is acceptable. In patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, antibiotic prophylaxis for SBP should be instituted; IV ceftriaxone 1 g/24 hours is the antibiotic of choice and should be used for a maximum of 7 days. In patients with cirrhosis and low protein (< 1.5 g/dL) ascites, primary SBP prophylaxis can be considered in selected patients with renal dysfunction (serum creatinine level > 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level > 25 mg/dL, or serum sodium level < 130 mEq/L) or liver failure (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score > 9 and bilirubin > 3 mg/dL).

### Rifaximin for the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome in cirrhosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115qdrCB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Prophylactic antibiotics have been recommended in patients with a previous history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Recently, there has been interest in the use of rifaximin for the prevention of SBP and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate this association of rifaximin. We searched several databases from inception through 24 January 2017, to identify comparative studies evaluating the effect of rifaximin on the occurrence of SBP and HRS. We performed predetermined subgroup analyses based on the type of control group, design of the study, and type of prophylaxis. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a random effects model. We included 13 studies with 1703 patients in the meta-analysis of SBP prevention. Pooled OR [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.22–0.73) (I = 58%). On sensitivity analysis, adjusted OR was 0.29 (95% CI: 0.20–0.44) (I = 0%). The results of the subgroup analysis based on type of control was as follows: in the quinolone group, pooled OR was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.14–1.25) (I = 55%), and in the no antibiotic group, pooled OR was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.18–0.86) (I = 64%). However, with sensitivity analysis, benefit of rifaximin was demonstrable; pooled ORs were 0.32 (95% CI: 0.17–0.63) (I = 0%) and 0.28 (95% CI: 0.17–0.45) (I = 0%) for the comparison with quinolones and no antibiotics, respectively. Pooled OR based on randomized controlled trials was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22–0.75) (I = 13%). For the prevention of HRS, the pooled OR was 0.25 (95% CI: 0.13–0.50) (I = 0%). Rifaximin has a protective effect against the development of SBP in cirrhosis. However, the quality of the evidence as per the GRADE framework was very low. Rifaximin appeared effective for the prevention of HRS.

### Antibiotic regimens for secondary peritonitis of gastrointestinal origin in adults [^1147nMTt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Secondary peritonitis is associated with a high mortality rate and if not treated successfully leads to development of abscesses, severe sepsis and multi-organ failure. Source control and adjunctive antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment. However, no conclusive evidence suggest that one antibiotic regimen is better than any other but at the same time have a lower toxicity.

Objectives

To ascertain the efficacy and adverse effects of different antibiotic regimens in treating intra-abdominal infections in adults. Outcomes were divided into primary (clinical success and effectiveness in reducing mortality) and secondary (microbiological success, preventing wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess, clinical sepsis, remote infection, superinfection, adverse reactions, duration of treatment required, effectiveness in reducing hospitalised stay, and time to defervescence).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (from 1966 to November 2004), EMBASE (from 1980 to November 2004) and Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group specialised register SR-COLOCA. Bibliographies of identified studies were screened for further relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic regimens in the treatment of secondary peritonitis in adults were selected. Trials reporting gynaecological or traumatic peritonitis were excluded from this review. Ambiguity regarding suitability of trials were discussed among the review team.

Data Collection and Analysis

Six reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data collection was standardised using data collection form to ensure uniformity among reviewers. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as odds ratio for dichotomous outcomes, or weight mean difference for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

Fourty studies with 5094 patients met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen different comparative antibiotic regimens were reported. All antibiotics showed equivocal comparability in terms of clinical success. Mortality did not differ between the regimens. Despite the potential high toxicity profile of regimens using aminoglycosides, this was not demonstrated in this review. The reason for this could be the inherent bias within clinical trials in the form of patient selection and stringency in monitoring drug levels.

Authors' Conclusions

No specific recommendations can be made for the first line treatment of secondary peritonitis in adults with antibiotics, as all regimens showed equivocal efficacy. Other factors such as local guidelines and preferences, ease of administration, costs and availability must therefore be taken into consideration in deciding the antibiotic regimen of choice. Future trials should attempt to stratify patients and perform intention-to-treat analysis to allow better external validity.

### The role of rifaximin in the primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with liver cirrhosis [^111joXBE]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) may provide a survival advantage in cirrhotic patients with ascites and has become an integral part of clinical practice. Rifaximin is a poorly absorbable antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antibacterial action and has low risk of introducing bacterial resistance.

Aim

To determine whether rifaximin is associated with decreasing the risk of SBP and improving transplant-free survival in cirrhotic patients with ascites.

Methods

The medical records of all adult patients with liver cirrhosis and large ascites justifying paracentesis evaluated in our clinic (2003 to 2007) were reviewed. Patients were stratified into 2 groups by the use of rifaximin. Patients were excluded if they had received another antibiotic for SBP prophylaxis or had a history of SBP before rifaximin therapy.

Results

A total of 404 patients were included, of whom 49 (12%) received rifaximin. The rifaximin and nonrifaximin groups were comparable with regards to age, sex, and race. The median follow-up time was 4.2 [1.0, 17.1] months. During this time period, 89% of patients on rifaximin remained SBP free compared with 68% of those not on rifaximin (P = 0.002). After adjusting for Model of End-Stage Liver Disease score, Child-Pugh score, serum sodium, and ascitic fluid total protein, there was a 72% reduction in the rate of SBP in the rifaximin group (hazard ratio = 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.11–0.71; P = 0.007). The group treated with rifaximin also demonstrated a transplant-free survival benefit compared with those not on rifaximin (72% vs. 57%, P = 0.045).

Conclusions

Intestinal decontamination with rifaximin may prevent SBP in cirrhotic patients with ascites. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this finding.

Bordetella hinzii is a gram-negative aerobic coccobacilli respiratory pathogen in poultry and rodents. Human infections are rare but occur in immunocompromised persons or upon exposure to infected animals. Most reported human infections are pulmonary; however, other manifestations include cholangitis and periaortic abscess. We report a case of B. hinzii spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) complicated by bacteremia.

A 71-year-old man with alcoholism, hepatitis C, and decompensated cirrhosis, on day 28 of a 28-day regimen of intravenous vancomycin for Streptococcus salivarius bacteremia and SBP, underwent outpatient paracentesis. After paracentesis (7.8 L of fluid removed), the patient experienced hypotension and orthostasis, which resolved after intravenous albumin, and returned home. He later sought care at an emergency department for weakness, abdominal pain, hypotension (68/42 mm Hg), and tachycardia (heart rate 130 beats/min).

Despite intravenous fluid and albumin (1.5 g/kg) resuscitation, daptomycin, and piperacillin/azobactam, the patient experienced septic shock and hepatorenal syndrome, necessitating pressors. We substituted meropenem for piperacillin/tazobactam. On day 3, we discontinued daptomycin; administered albumin (1 g/kg); and initiated octreotide, midodrine, and rifaximin. We discontinued pressors on day 4. The patient improved clinically and his SBP resolved, as indicated by results of serial peritoneal fluid studies. On day 12, we replaced meropenem with ertapenem. After discharge (day 15), the patient completed 2 weeks of ertapenem, followed by daily trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis… [^117Nk29Y]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Background Prophylaxis of SBP is indicated in three high-risk populations: patients with acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage, patients with low total protein content in ascitic fluid, and patients with a previous history of SBP. Selective intestinal decontamination with norfloxacin, a quinolone with relatively poor gastrointestinal absorption and with antibacterial activity against GNB, is the most commonly used regimen, but several concerns have been recently raised in this regard. Given the high mortality rate and the risk of developing hepato-renal syndrome, prophylaxis of SBP is indicated particularly in three high-risk populations: patients with acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage, patients with low total protein content in ascitic fluid, and patients with a previous history of SBP 2.

The ideal prophylactic agent should be safe, affordable, and effective particularly against anaerobic bacteria translocating from the gut as most episodes of SBP are thought to result from the translocation of enteric Gram-negative bacilli
3. Selective intestinal decontamination with norfloxacin, a quinolone with relatively poor gastrointestinal absorption and with antibacterial activity against GNB, is the most commonly used regimen4, but several concerns have been recently raised in this regard. In fact, the epidemiology of bacterial infections in cirrhosis is evolving with an increasing incidence of infections caused by quinolone-resistant bacteria5; moreover, primary prophylaxis in low-protein ascitic patients requires long-term antibiotic regimens, hence less expensive and better tolerated agents such as rifaximin have been tested with conflicting results6.

Protocol Treatments
- The Treatment arm will undergo rifaximin 1200 mg/day in 3 doses.
- The Control arm will undergo norfloxacin 400 mg 1/die for 6 months Protocol. Medications will be interrupted when patients develop an episode of SBP, or have upper gastrointestinal bleeding or receive a liver transplant. Diagnostic paracentesis will be performed when clinically indicated. Diagnosis of spontaneous bacteremia, SBP, urinary infection, and other infections will be made by biological fluid cultures and analysis; type-1 and type-2 HRS will be diagnosed according to the criteria of the International Ascites Club. Spontaneous bacteremia and SBP will be treated with ceftriaxone.

### AAP updates guidelines for the management of at-risk infants… [^11269QmK]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Maternal screening for GBS and intrapartum antibiotics for positive screening are important for reducing early-onset GBS disease risk.
- For well-appearing infants born at 35 weeks' gestation or later, determining treatment with a risk calculator and clinical monitoring for 36 to 48 hours are alternatives to empiric antibiotics, even with maternal intrapartum fever. Prevention of Early-Onset GBS Disease Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis prevents newborn GBS through two mechanisms. Maternal antibiotic treatment temporarily decreases vaginal GBS colonization, preventing newborn surface and mucous membrane colonization during birth. Newborn bloodstream antibiotic levels also exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration for GBS. Early-onset GBS antibiotic prophylaxis is effective within two to four hours of administration and penicillin G and ampicillin continue to be recommended for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.

Cefazolin is recommended for women allergic to penicillin who are at low risk of anaphylaxis. For women allergic to penicillin who are at high risk of anaphylaxis, clindamycin should be administered to those colonized with GBS that is known to be susceptible to clindamycin. Erythromycin is not recommended because GBS is increasingly resistant to macrolide antibiotics. For women colonized with clindamycin-resistant GBS isolates who are allergic to penicillin and at high risk of anaphylaxis, vancomycin is recommended. If the indicated antibiotic prophylaxis was not adequately administered, infants born before 35 weeks for these indications should receive empiric antibiotics. Otherwise, these infants should not be empirically treated with antibiotics without signs of sepsis or maternal intrapartum fever. Routinely performing blood cultures in these infants is a reasonable option.

If NAAT results are obtained for an intrapartum patient with unknown GBS status, ACOG recommends that patients receive antibiotic prophylaxis if they have a positive GBS NAAT result or a negative GBS NAAT result with risk factors of gestational age less than 37 weeks, rupture of membranes longer than 18 hours, or maternal fever. A negative GBS NAAT result can eliminate the need for antibiotic prophylaxis if none of these risk factors are present. — Michael Arnold, MD, Medical Editing Fellow.

### Guidelines for the management of adult acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure in the ICU: neurology, peri-transplant medicine, infectious disease, and gastroenterology considerations [^1145bFR9]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) — empiric antimicrobial therapy and resistance considerations emphasize early, targeted treatment and resistance-aware selection. Delayed administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is associated with increased mortality. Systematic reviews report multidrug-resistant pathogens in nosocomial SBP at 30–66% and higher third-generation cephalosporin resistance in nosocomial versus community settings, with nosocomial SBP having higher resistance risk (RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.14–2.44; p = 0.008). For healthcare-associated SBP, carbapenem-based empirical therapy showed lower mortality and treatment failure than third-generation cephalosporin regimens (6% vs 25%; p = 0.01, 18% vs 51%; p = 0.001) and better cost effectiveness. Accordingly, "we recommend limiting the use of third-generation cephalosporins in the initial empirical treatment to low-risk community-acquired SBP patients in the setting of low prevalence of drug resistance", and "Active agents against ESBL-producing pathogen (Carbapenems) should be considered for the empirical treatment of healthcare-associated SBP". In high-risk critically ill or nosocomial cases, a "tailored approach… covering resistant pathogens (ESBL, MRSA, ± VRE) would be best suited", with de-escalation after cultures since "antibiotic therapy should be tailored to the narrowest spectrum based on organism sensitivities".

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^1167R7yJ]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Similarly, the role of albumin for improving outcomes in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is unclear. The trial data specific to this patient population are limited. The two largest RCTs failed to provide an explicit fluid resuscitation protocol for the patients randomized to no albumin, raising the concern for underresuscitation in the control arms of both studies. When similar albumin dosing strategies were used in trials examining patients with cirrhosis and extraperitoneal infections, no benefit was seen and concern for harm was expressed. The panel suggested the use of albumin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (conditional recommendation), but raised concerns regarding the dosing protocol used in two of the four trials and the risk of fluid overload (1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1.0 g/kg on day 3) and the lack of data suggesting this specific regimen is beneficial compared with alternative dosing (eg, lower dose daily for 3 days). The panel also considered the lack of clarity on whether albumin is necessary for all patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or whether it could be used selectively (ie, patients at high risk of kidney failure or death: serum bilirubin > 4 mg/dL or serum creatinine > 1 mg/dL). Additional studies are necessary to address dosing, to address the benefit for patients with and without kidney impairment, and to clarify the risks of adverse events. The panel also noted that not all physicians currently adhere to the trial dosing strategy, although it continues to be recommended in current guidelines. A careful assessment of the patient's volume status, cardiovascular status, and degree of kidney impairment before transfusion is advised and the dose, frequency, or both being modified accordingly. In contrast, the RCTs find no support for the use of albumin in patients with cirrhosis and extraperitoneal infections.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^117DnpCa]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Liver cirrhosis, a major global health burden, accounts for ∼1 million deaths every year. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is one of the most serious and life-threatening complications of cirrhosis, now carrying an in-hospital mortality of 16–23% in the USA. The proposed mechanism for development of SBP is translocation of intestinal bacteria into mesenteric lymph nodes and the ascitic fluid. On surviving an incident episode of SBP, the recurrence rate is ∼70% at 1 year. High recurrences coupled with substantial mortality warrant long-term antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent SBP. Various oral antibiotics have been studied to reduce the risk of occurrence and recurrence of SBP by achieving 'selective intestinal decontamination'. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) recommend norfloxacin, a systemic antibiotic, as the first-line therapy for this purpose.

Rifaximin is a broad-spectrum ansamicin antibiotic that is poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby reaches high levels in the gut lumen. Its role as an initial and add-on therapy for hepatic encephalopathy has been well established. Moreover, it has recently been evaluated as a prophylactic antibiotic to reduce the risk of recurrence of SBP. We conducted a systematic review to compare rifaximin to the standard of care (norfloxacin) for primary or secondary prevention of SBP.

Four studies were eligible for our systematic review (table 1). Three were randomised trials and one was a prospective longitudinal study. All studies were published in English language. Three studies were conducted in Egypt and one was a multicentre study involving centres in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Baseline characteristics of the patients in individual studies were also examined (table 2).

Comparison of rifaximin and norfloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis event rate

In 2015, Mostafa et al conducted a single-centre randomised trial and enrolled 70 patients at the National Liver Institute in Egypt who were previously diagnosed with SBP — the definition of which was any prior ascitic fluid with > 250 PMNL, with or without positive culture, and an absence of other source of intraabdominal infection. The aetiology of cirrhosis in all patients was hepatitis C. Patients were excluded if they had hepatocellular carcinoma or active/recent gastrointestinal bleeding. Forty patients were assigned to the rifaximin group, receiving 800 mg per day, and 30 patients to the norfloxacin group, receiving 400 mg per day. Therapy was given for 6 months. Three months after initiation of therapy, there were five patients in the norfloxacin group (16.67%) who developed SBP compared with none in the rifaximin group. The study was designed specifically to measure outcomes of blood levels of liver function tests, cytokines and other markers of inflammation with time, thus no p value for the outcome of recurrent SBP was stated.

Acute kidney injury prevention in cirrhosis — key measures emphasize that the use of albumin in addition to antibiotics is recommended in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) to prevent HRS-AKI and subsequent organ failures but not recommended in non-SBP infections, with additional strategies including judicious use of laxatives and diuretics, albumin infusions with large-volume paracentesis, prompt treatment of gastrointestinal bleeds with antibiotic prophylaxis in established gastrointestinal bleeds, avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs or radiographic dye, and primary SBP prophylaxis in high-risk individuals with secondary prophylaxis after the first SBP episode; because repeated AKI episodes can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CKD predisposes to AKI, treating causes of CKD is important to break the AKI/CKD cycle.

### Bacterial infections in cirrhosis: epidemiological changes with invasive procedures and norfloxacin prophylaxis [^1121eQ4v]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

The extensive use of invasive procedures and of long-term norfloxacin prophylaxis in the management of cirrhotic patients may have influenced the epidemiology of bacterial infections in cirrhosis. We conducted a prospective evaluation of all bacterial infections diagnosed in patients with cirrhosis in a Liver Unit between April 1998 and April 2000. A total of 405 patients presented 572 bacterial infections in 507 admissions. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was the most frequent infection (138 cases). Gram-positive cocci were responsible for 53% of total bacterial infections in the study, being the main bacteria isolated in nosocomial infections (59%). Patients requiring treatment in an intensive care unit and those submitted to invasive procedures presented a higher rate of infections caused by gram-positive cocci (77% vs. 48%, P < .001 and 58% vs. 40%, P < .02, respectively). Fifty percent of culture-positive spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients on long-term norfloxacin administration (n = 93) and 16% in patients not receiving this therapy (n = 414) were caused by quinolone-resistant gram-negative bacilli, P = 0.01. The rate of culture-positive spontaneous bacterial peritonitis caused by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant gram-negative bacilli was also very high in patients on long-term norfloxacin administration (44% vs. 18%, P = 0.09). In conclusion, infections caused by gram-positive cocci have markedly increased in cirrhosis. This phenomenon may be related to the current high degree of instrumentation of cirrhotic patients. Quinolone-resistant spontaneous bacterial peritonitis constitutes an emergent problem in patients on long-term norfloxacin prophylaxis, with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole not being a valid alternative.

### Outcomes in patients with cirrhosis on primary compared to secondary prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^116vdkCY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for prevention of the first episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP; primary prophylaxis 1°) and subsequent episodes (secondary prophylaxis 2°). We aimed to compare outcomes in cirrhotic inpatients on 1° vs 2° SBP prophylaxis.

Methods

Data from North American Consortium for the Study of End-Stage Liver Disease were evaluated for cirrhosis details, reasons for admission/medications, inpatient course recorded, and outcomes over 90 days. Outcomes (intensive care units, acute kidney injury, inpatient/90-day mortality) were compared between the 2 groups after propensity-matching on admission model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and serum albumin.

Results

Among the 2,731 patients enrolled, 305 were on 1° and 187 on 2° SBP prophylaxis. After propensity-matching, 154 patients remained in each group. Patients on 1° prophylaxis were more likely to have admission systemic inflammatory response syndrome (P = 0.02), with higher intensive care unit admissions (31% vs 21%; P = 0.05) and inpatient mortality (19% vs 9%; P = 0.01) than the 2° prophylaxis group. Patients on 2° prophylaxis had higher total (22% vs 10%; P = 0004), readmission (16% vs 9%; P = 0.03), and nosocomial (6% vs 0.5%; P = 0.01) SBP rates with predominant Gram-negative organisms compared to 1° prophylaxis patients. At 90 days, 1° prophylaxis patients had a higher mortality (35% vs 22%; P = 0.02) and acute kidney injury incidence (48% vs 30%; P = 0.04) compared to 2° prophylaxis patients.

Discussion

In this inpatient cirrhosis study, despite prophylaxis, a high proportion of patients developed SBP, which was associated with mortality. Cirrhotic inpatients on 1° prophylaxis had worse outcomes than those on 2° prophylaxis when propensity-matched for the MELD score and serum albumin during the index admission and 90-day follow-up.

### Response-guided therapy with cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a randomized trial: a validation study of 2021 AASLD practice guidance for SBP [^115mUNrS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin were used as first-line agents. However, considering the increasing rate of antibiotic resistance, it is unclear which of these drugs can be initially recommended. This study aimed to compare the current efficacy of the 3 antibiotics, namely cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin, for the treatment of SBP in patients with cirrhosis with ascites, when guided by therapeutic responses.

Methods

This study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial. The inclusion criteria were 16- to 75-year-old patients with liver cirrhosis with ascites, having polymorphonuclear cell count of > 250/mm 3. We performed a follow-up paracentesis at 48 hours to decide continuing or changing the assigned antibiotics and then assessed the resolution rates at 120 and 168 hours of treatment.

Results

A total of 261 patients with cirrhosis who developed SBP were enrolled. Most of the patients were diagnosed as those with SBP within 48 hours of admission. The resolution rates at 120 hours, which is the primary endpoint, were 67.8%, 77.0%, and 73.6% in the cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin groups, respectively (P = 0.388), by intension-to-treat analysis. The 1-month mortality was similar among the groups (P = 0.770). The model for end-stage liver disease score and the SBP resolution were significant factors for survival.

Conclusion

The efficacy of empirical antibiotics, such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin, against SBP was not significantly different. In addition, these antibiotics administered based on response-guided therapy were still efficacious as initial treatment for SBP, especially in those with community-acquired infections.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^112u92kQ]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Another trial in 2015 was conducted in Egypt by Shamseya and Madkour. They enrolled 86 patients in a prospective observational study. All patients had cirrhosis as a result of hepatitis C. They excluded patients with other aetiologies for cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and hypersensitivity to the study drugs. More than 70% of patients received the medications for primary prophylaxis of SBP, while the rest received them for secondary prophylaxis. A prior episode of SBP was defined as ascitic fluid with > 250 PMNL. The groups were equally divided into the norfloxacin group, receiving 400 mg per day, and rifaximin group, receiving 1200 mg per day in three divided doses. They were matched for age, sex and Child-Pugh class. Renal function and ascitic fluid albumin concentrations were also similar across both groups. At the end of 1 year of follow-up, six patients developed SBP in the norfloxacin group (14%) compared with two patients in the rifaximin group (4.7%), with a p value of 0.265.

Assem et al conducted a multicentre randomised controlled trial to compare rifaximin, norfloxacin and combined therapy for primary prevention of SBP at five centres across Saudi Arabia and Egypt. All aetiologies for cirrhosis were included. Patients were enrolled so long as no prior history of SBP existed — defined as ascitic fluid > 250 PMNL. Patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. Patient were divided into three groups — norfloxacin 400 mg per day, rifaximin 1100 mg per day in two divided doses and alternating norfloxacin/rifaximin receiving 1100 mg per day rifaximin for 1 month alternating with 400 mg per day norfloxacin. The patients were followed up for a duration of 6 months. Thirty-four patients in the norfloxacin group (34/78 = 43.6%) developed SBP as compared with 26 patients in the rifaximin group (26/82 = 31.7%) with a p value of 0.121. These results were based on intention-to-treat principle, though data for per-protocol analysis were also presented. Of interest, in the comparison of all three groups, the highest rate of success in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis was in the combined group which used alternating norfloxacin and rifaximin regimen.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^114Mhe2i]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this systematic review is to compare the efficacy of rifaximin with the standard of care (norfloxacin) in the prevention of SBP. Our review is based on summarising evidence from three randomised controlled trials and 1 prospective observational study. In brief, the trial by Elfert et al was remarkable for significantly superior efficacy of rifaximin, while Shamseya and Madkour and Assem et al showed statistically insignificant difference between rifaximin and norfloxacin. Another trial by Mostafa et al showed a numerical difference in event rate favouring rifaximin for SBP prevention. It appears that rifaximin may have a role in prophylaxis of SBP in patients with cirrhosis. It may also be associated with a greater reduction in the risk of death in these patients, compared with norfloxacin. The clinical relevance of this review stems from the high mortality associated with SBP in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Hanouneh et al first studied rifaximin for prevention of SBP. They compared it with placebo in a group of 404 patients with cirrhotic ascites and found a 72% reduction in the occurrence rate of SBP for rifaximin as compared with placebo. Another study by Vlachogiannakos et al demonstrated significantly lower risks of variceal bleeds, SBP, hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome in the rifaximin group compared with matched controls. Lutz et al conducted a study evaluating the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis with rifaximin versus ciprofloxacin for SBP prevention in 152 patients with cirrhotic ascites. They found the SBP prevention rate to be higher in the ciprofloxacin group, than both rifaximin and placebo groups. However, the follow-up duration was extremely short (4 weeks) and the patient population was small (17 patients in ciprofloxacin group). We limited our review to studies evaluating long-term SBP prophylaxis and excluded studies with follow-up periods < 3 months.

Effects of Rifaximin on Bacterial Infections

Based on its pharmacological characteristics and the putative effects on pathogenetic mechanisms of cirrhosis, rifaximin is considered by many hepatologists to be the logical alternative to quinolones or other systemic antibiotics for the prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and potentially of non‐SBP bacterial infections, with the belief that rifaximin is active on a broader range of intestinal gram‐positive and gram‐negative bacteria, is safer, and carries a low risk of inducing resistance to antibiotics.

Unfortunately, after more than a decade of clinical research, a conclusive indication on the use of rifaximin in prevention of bacterial infections cannot currently be given. Almost all the published data are related to primary or secondary prophylaxis for SBP. In general, retrospective studies have shown that the use of rifaximin is associated with lower incidence of SBP and other complications of the disease. Conversely, prospective observational studies have yielded less consistent results. Only a few RCTs have been performed so far, in Egypt and South Arabia, comparing the efficacy of rifaximin versus norfloxacin; in these studies, an advantage was seen in favor of rifaximin given for primary or secondary SBP; in the former study, rifaximin was also given alternated to norfloxacin and compared with norfloxacin alone. However, the strength of these positive results is undermined by some methodological drawbacks.

To overcome the limitations inherent to each single study, several systematic reviews and meta‐analysis assessing both the observational cohort studies and the RCTs have been performed. Again, results suggest that only low‐quality evidence supports the superiority of rifaximin over norfloxacin or other systemic antibiotics for either primary or secondary SBP prophylaxis. In all these studies, the high heterogeneity in terms of patient inclusion criteria, type and modalities of administration of the comparative prophylactic therapies, primary and secondary endpoints, and the moderate‐to‐high risk of methodological biases related to randomization, blinding, attrition, and intention‐to‐treat analysis preclude the possibility to reach solid conclusions.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^117Rk9tS]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

The high cost might limit the use of rifaximin. A cost and outcome analysis of using rifaximin ± lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, in addition to norfloxacin for SBP prophylaxis, compared with using rifaximin ± lactulose alone would be of clinical interest. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that Assem et al proposed an alternating regimen of norfloxacin and rifaximin, which presumably has differing bioeffects on the body and had better efficacy than norfloxacin.

There are several limitations to our review. The number of studies and the patient groups in each study are independently small. Elfert et al presented data regarding SBP as per-protocol treatment analysis. However, lost to follow-up information was explicitly stated in the study, thus minimising the risk of bias. There is clinical heterogeneity among the individual studies, particularly in relation to the indication for SBP prophylaxis (primary vs secondary) and the aetiology of chronic liver disease. Our conclusion may only be applicable to a particular group of patients with ascites, notably that the vast majority of included patients had hepatitis C-related cirrhosis. There is some literature suggesting that alcoholic cirrhotics are at a higher risk of bacterial infections than patients with non-alcoholic cirrhosis. Whether a particular cause of cirrhosis leads to a higher risk of development of SBP is still largely unknown and requires further investigation. These studies are incidentally from the same geographic region and thus the results may not be applicable to the demographics and characteristics of cirrhotics in the Western world, where other aetiologies such as alcohol may be more prevalent.

Regarding preventative measures for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, more specifically with respect to primary prevention, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, BASL/BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to administer prophylactic antibiotic treatment (chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP in patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^117QMzV2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Another trial was conducted by Elfert et al, who enrolled a total of 262 patients with cirrhosis and one prior episode of SBP — again defined as ascitic fluid with > 250 PMNL. Follow-up period was 6 months, with patients enrolled to receive either norfloxacin 400 mg per day or rifaximin 1200 mg per day in three divided doses. The recurrence rate of SBP was 3.9% in the rifaximin group compared with 14.1% in the norfloxacin group, with a p value of 0.04 when analysing the reported per-protocol results.

Question 2: Mortality benefit with rifaximin as compared with norfloxacin

Elfert et al observed a distinct mortality benefit with rifaximin (13.8% vs 24.4%), which was statistically significant when compared with norfloxacin with a p value of 0.044. Both trials from Shamseya and Madkour and Assem et al demonstrated a numerical difference in mortality rates between rifaximin and norfloxacin groups, though they were not statistically significant. Shamseya and Madkour showed a reduction in mortality rate from 9.3% in the norfloxacin compared with 7% with rifaximin group. Assem et al similarly showed a reduction in mortality rate with the rifaximin group (2.4%) versus the norfloxacin group (7.6%). There were no deaths during the 6 month follow-up in the Mostafa et al study groups. The leading causes of mortality across all studies were hepatorenal syndrome, sepsis, variceal bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy.

Question 3: Safety profile of rifaximin as compared with norfloxacin

No serious adverse events were reported in any of the trials with either of the drugs. Minor adverse events such nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence and headache were reported, with similar incidences in the trials conducted by Shamseya and Madkour and Assem et al. The Elfert et al trial, however, reported a statistically significant lower overall incidence of these adverse events in the rifaximin group as compared with norfloxacin (p = 0.033). Though the adverse symptom event rates were different, they did not appear to be limiting enough to suspend consumption of the drug or alter the outcomes of SBP or death.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111RuPDB]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) initial management — First-line empirical antibiotic therapy for community-acquired SBP/SBE is IV third-generation cephalosporin, whereas in patients with a health care–associated or nosocomial infection or recent exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics or who are admitted with sepsis or septic shock, empirical therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated as the first line. Response to empirical antibiotic therapy may be assessed by repeating diagnostic paracentesis/thoracentesis 2 days after initiation, and a decrease in fluid PMN < 25% from baseline indicates lack of response and should lead to broadening of antibiotic coverage and further evaluation to rule out secondary bacterial peritonitis. Patients with SBP should be treated with IV albumin in addition to antibiotics (1.5 g/kg at day 1 and 1 g/kg at day 3), and patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and/or jaundice at time of diagnosis of SBP are more likely to benefit from albumin. Nonselective beta blockers (NSBBs) should be temporarily held in patients with SBP who develop hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 65 mm Hg) or AKI.

### Antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotics [^111muvfP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is mainly a complication of cirrhotic ascites that occurs in the absence of any intra-abdominal, surgically treatable source of infection. Antibiotics have been recommended as the mainstay treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. However, this recommendation is not based on convincing evidence. It has been proposed that treatment should cover Gram-negative enteric bacteria and Gram-positive cocci, that are responsible for up to 90% of cases.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different types and ways of antibiotic therapy for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches on the Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2000), the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Trials Register (March 2000), EMBASE (1980–2000), MEDLINE (1966–2000); scanning the references of all identified studies; contacting the first author of each included trial.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing different types of antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by two reviewers. Relative risks or weighted mean differences, with their 95% confidence intervals were estimated using 'intention-to-treat' analyses.

Main Results

Nine trials dealing with 684 patients diagnosed with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were included. No placebo-controlled trial was found. Each of the included trials compared different antibiotics, and no meta-analysis could be performed. We were unable to establish the optimal dose or duration of antibiotic therapy and found no convincing evidence that cefotaxime is more effective than ampicillin-tobramycin or that oral quinolones should be recommended for patients with less severe manifestations of the disease.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review provides no clear evidence for the treatment of cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Until large, well-conducted, trials provide adequate evidence, treatment must be based on clinical experience.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: benefit or risk? [^114x6Nhh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is associated with risk of acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). Current guidelines recommend primary and secondary antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with cirrhosis and ascites who are at risk of a first episode and to prevent recurrence, respectively. Factors associated with prophylaxis failure leading to SBP, ACLF, and increased mortality are not well established. Gram-positive and multidrug-resistant organisms have become more frequently associated with SBP, particularly in the setting of ACLF. Efforts to understand how long-term antibiotic therapy may affect individual risk of SBP in this population will be critical to developing optimal preventive strategies.

Antibiotics for infections in cirrhosis — hospitalized patients: For spontaneous infections (peritonitis, bacteremia, empyema), community-acquired infection is treated with a third-generation cephalosporin, while nosocomial infection uses piperacillin/tazobactam AND daptomycin (if known VRE in past or evidence of GI colonization) OR meropenem if known to harbor MDR gram-negative organisms. For pyelonephritis, uncomplicated disease uses a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin); severe pyelonephritis uses a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone), and if recent antibiotic exposure is present, piperacillin/tazobactam OR a carbapenem is recommended.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^114MB2np]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — perioperative management of ascites in cirrhosis — states that ascites should be managed aggressively before surgical procedures and that, in patients with symptomatic ascites, large-volume total abdominal paracentesis should be performed preoperatively with intravenous albumin in a dose of 6–8 g for each liter of ascites fluid removed; once oral medications are tolerated, daily antibiotic prophylaxis can be resumed in patients with a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or low ascites total protein; although preoperative antibiotics are of uncertain efficacy, an antibiotic such as ceftriaxone can be administered prophylactically in a dose of 1 g of every 24 hours intravenously until oral intake is possible again; preoperative thoracentesis is only recommended for moderate to large pleural effusions that compromise respiratory function, and administration of intravenous fluid and blood products should be limited perioperatively to avoid increasing extracellular volume, ascites, and portal venous pressure.

### Norfloxacin vs ceftriaxone in the prophylaxis of infections in patients with advanced cirrhosis and hemorrhage [^1137TFiH]. Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Oral norfloxacin is the standard of therapy in the prophylaxis of bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage. However, during the last years, the epidemiology of bacterial infections in cirrhosis has changed, with a higher incidence of infections caused by quinolone-resistant bacteria. This randomized controlled trial was aimed to compare oral norfloxacin vs intravenous ceftriaxone in the prophylaxis of bacterial infection in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding.

Methods

One hundred eleven patients with advanced cirrhosis (at least 2 of the following: ascites, severe malnutrition, encephalopathy, or bilirubin > 3 mg/dL) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were randomly treated with oral norfloxacin (400 mg twice daily; n = 57) or intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g/day; n = 54) for 7 days. The end point of the trial was the prevention of bacterial infections within 10 days after inclusion.

Results

Clinical data were comparable between groups. The probability of developing proved or possible infections, proved infections, and spontaneous bacteremia or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was significantly higher in patients receiving norfloxacin (33% vs 11%, P = 0.003; 26% vs 11%, P = 0.03; and 12% vs 2%, P = 0.03, respectively). The type of antibiotic used (norfloxacin), transfusion requirements at inclusion, and failure to control bleeding were independent predictors of infection. Seven gram-negative bacilli were isolated in the norfloxacin group, and 6 were quinolone resistant. Non-enterococcal streptococci were only isolated in the norfloxacin group. No difference in hospital mortality was observed between groups.

Conclusions

Intravenous ceftriaxone is more effective than oral norfloxacin in the prophylaxis of bacterial infections in patients with advanced cirrhosis and hemorrhage.

### Authors' reply [^111K7CUN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

We appreciate the comments of Dr. Basyigit on our recent study showing that antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients can reduce recurrence of cellulitis mainly caused by gram-negative bacteria. Dr. Basyigit's concern on the increased gram-negative cellulitis found in our cirrhotic patients is based on a recent study that reported gram-positive bacteria as a common cause of cellulitis in the general population, and not particularly in cirrhotics. To support our findings, relative literature has already been cited. In a position statement, based on EASL special conference 2013, the role of bacterial translocation as cause for infection in cirrhotic patients has clearly been pointed out. Dr. Basyigit posed the possibility that drug-resistant bacteria might emerge using antibiotic prophylaxis. Though it might be true, antibiotic prophylaxis is still being used to prevent conditions such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis thereby reducing mortality. Finally, Dr. Basyigit claimed that antibiotic prophylaxis will lead to resistant microorganisms rather than prevention from skin infection. We strongly oppose this view because bacterial infection increases 3.75-fold the mortality of patients with decompensated cirrhosis, reaching a rate of 30% at 1 month and 63% at 1 year. If we can prevent recurrence of bacterial cellulitis in cirrhotic patients as we have shown in our study, it might help reduce mortality. However, since we have not examined the benefit from the prevention of cellulitis recurrence on the mortality of cirrhotic patients, further studies are warranted to elucidate this issue.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1179yLrQ]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis management — IV antibiotics should be started empirically (before obtaining culture results) in all patients with an ascites PMN count > 250/mm^3; patients with a focal intraabdominal inflammatory entity (e.g., diverticulitis, cholecystitis) may have an ascites PMN count > 250/mm^3 and should be treated not for SBP but for the specific condition per standard of care, including a surgical consult; traditionally, third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) were recommended in all patients with SBP, with resolution rates of approximately 90%, and currently they are recommended as the first-line antibiotics (e.g. IV cefotaxime 2 g every 12 hours) in settings where MDROs are not prevalent; inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy in patients admitted with septic shock increases the risk of death by 10 times.

Prophylaxis with norfloxacin has been shown to be effective in preventing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in liver cirrhosis. This therapy is associated with the appearance of quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli. However, only four cases of SBP caused by quinolone-resistant E. coli have been reported so far. We present four cases of quinolone-resistant E. coli SBP in three patients receiving oral quinolones, and who were on corticosteroid therapy to treat associated disorders.

### Pharmacologic treatment of portal hypertension in the prevention of community-acquired spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^115t3VBK]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Given that beta-blockers reduce the incidence of bacterial translocation in cirrhotic rats, the aim of this study was to compare the long-term incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients submitted to pharmacologic versus endoscopic treatment to prevent variceal rebleeding.

Patients and Methods

Two hundred and thirty patients with variceal hemorrhage were included in two previous randomized trials performed to compare the efficacy of medication (nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate, n = 115) versus endoscopic treatment (n = 115) with sclerotherapy or ligation for the prevention of rebleeding.

Results

The mean follow-up was 23 ± 1.4 months. The characteristics of the patients and the number of patients on long-term prophylaxis with norfloxacin were similar in both groups. The incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was lower in the medication group (9 versus 14.7%, P = NS). The probability of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was also lower in the medication group (6 versus 12% at 1 year, 22 versus 36% at 5 years; P = 0.08), due to a significantly lower probability of community-acquired spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in this group (1 versus 10% at 1 year, 18 versus 32% at 5 years; P = 0.02). Patients with no hemodynamic response to therapy had a significantly higher probability to develop community-acquired spontaneous bacterial peritonitis during follow-up than hemodynamic responders (P < 0.03). Long-term probability of developing community-acquired spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is lower in patients submitted to pharmacologic treatment for preventing variceal rebleeding than in those submitted to endoscopic treatment.

Conclusion

Long-term pharmacologic prophylaxis of variceal rebleeding contributes to the prevention of community-acquired spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

### Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure: part II. complications and treatment [^112RxNzd]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Major complications of cirrhosis include ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome. Diagnostic studies on ascitic fluid should include a differential leukocyte count, total protein level, a serum-ascites albumin gradient, and fluid cultures. Therapy consists of sodium restriction, diuretics, and complete abstention from alcohol. Patients with ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts of 250 cells per mm3 or greater should receive empiric prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with cefotaxime and albumin. Patients who survive an episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis should receive long-term prophylaxis with norfloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage and cirrhosis should receive norfloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole twice daily for seven days. Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy is directed toward improving mental status levels with lactulose; protein restriction is no longer recommended. Patients with cirrhosis and evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding should undergo upper endoscopy to evaluate for varices. Endoscopic banding is the standard treatment, but sclerotherapy with vasoconstrictors (e.g., octreotide) also may be used. Prophylaxis with propranolol is recommended in patients with cirrhosis once varices have been identified. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt has been effective in reducing portal hypertension and improving symptoms of hepatorenal syndrome, and can reduce gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with refractory variceal hemorrhage. When medical therapy for treatment of cirrhosis has failed, liver transplantation should be considered. Survival rates in transplant recipients have improved as a result of advances in immunosuppression and proper risk stratification using the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and Child-Turcotte-Pugh scoring systems.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^112aQeSp]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods

Standard Cochrane guidelines and PRISMA statement for systematic review were followed during the review process(figure 1).

Figure 1
PRISMA flow diagram.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of interventions

We included trials that studied long-term (> 3 months) administration of rifaximin at any dose compared with norfloxacin for the purpose of primary or secondary prevention of SBP.

Types of participants

Studies that recruited patients with cirrhosis (irrespective of aetiology) and ascites were included in our analysis.

The indications for long term SBP prophylaxis included either primary (high risk patients with baseline ascitic fluid total protein < 1.5 g/dL along with impaired renal function [serum creatinine ≥ 1.2 mg/dL, BUN ≥ 25 mg/dL or serum Na ≤ 130 mEq/L] or patients with liver failure [Child-Pugh score ≥ 9 and serum bilirubin ≥ 3 mg/dL]) or secondary prophylaxis (previous episode of SBP).

Patients with active or recent gastrointestinal bleed, known liver malignancy or hypersensitivity to the planned drugs were excluded.

Types of outcome measures

The primary outcome measure across all studies was the occurrence of SBP. We used the AASLD definition of SBP, that is, the diagnosis is made in the presence of an elevated ascitic fluid absolute polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMNL) count ≥ 250 cells/mm 3 without an evident intra-abdominal, surgically treatable source of infection. The secondary outcome measure was all-cause mortality, defined as death due to any cause during the study period.

Study search and selection

We performed both computerised and manual searching of articles from digital dissertation databases, including Google Scholar, CINAHL, MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL Register for Controlled Trials from 1950 until January 2017. We limited our search to studies involving humans only and articles published in the English language using keywords and/or medical subject headings (MeSH) for 'rifaximin' and 'norfloxacin' and 'spontaneous bacterial peritonitis'.

Reference lists of returned search articles were manually screened. Two authors independently reviewed all articles for inclusion. First, all titles and abstracts were assessed and irrelevant articles were rejected. Second, full-text articles were assessed and studies were selected based on meeting the inclusion criteria. After identifying relevant titles, all abstracts were read and eligible articles were selected.

### Antibiotic treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^111ua2uh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 2.5% of all hospitalisations in people with cirrhosis are for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Antibiotics, in addition to supportive treatment (fluid and electrolyte balance, treatment of shock), form the mainstay treatments of SBP. Various antibiotics are available for the treatment of SBP, but there is uncertainty regarding the best antibiotic for SBP.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different antibiotic treatments for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until November 2018 to identify randomised clinical trials on people with cirrhosis and SBP.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in adults with cirrhosis and SBP. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified eligible trials and collected data. The outcomes for this review included mortality, serious adverse events, any adverse events, resolution of SBP, liver transplantation, and other decompensation events. We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio, rate ratio, and hazard ratio with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available-case analysis, according to the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Decision Support Unit guidance.

Main Results

We included a total of 12 trials (1278 participants; 13 antibiotics) in the review. Ten trials (893 participants) were included in one or more outcomes in the review. The trials that provided the information included patients having cirrhosis with or without other features of decompensation of varied aetiologies. The follow-up in the trials ranged from one week to three months. All the trials were at high risk of bias. Only one trial was included under each comparison for most of the outcomes. Because of these reasons, there is very low certainty in all the results. The majority of the randomised clinical trials used third-generation cephalosporins, such as intravenous ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ciprofloxacin as one of the interventions. Overall, approximately 75% of trial participants recovered from SBP and 25% of people died within three months. There was no evidence of difference in any of the outcomes for which network meta-analysis was possible: mortality (9 trials; 653 participants), proportion of people with any adverse events (5 trials; 297 participants), resolution of SBP (as per standard definition, 9 trials; 873 participants), or other features of decompensation (6 trials; 535 participants). The effect estimates in the direct comparisons (when available) were very similar to those of network meta-analysis. For the comparisons where network meta-analysis was not possible, there was no evidence of difference in any of the outcomes (proportion of participants with serious adverse events, number of adverse events, and proportion of participants requiring liver transplantation). Due to the wide CrIs and the very low-certainty evidence for all the outcomes, significant benefits or harms of antibiotics are possible. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life, number of serious adverse events, or symptomatic recovery from SBP.

Funding

the source of funding for two trials were industrial organisations who would benefit from the results of the trial; the source of funding for the remaining 10 trials was unclear.

Authors' Conclusions

Short-term mortality after SBP is about 25%. There is significant uncertainty about which antibiotic therapy is better in people with SBP. We need adequately powered randomised clinical trials, with adequate blinding, avoiding post-randomisation dropouts (or performing intention-to-treat analysis), and using clinically important outcomes, such as mortality, health-related quality of life, and adverse events.

Executive summary of recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis in new- onset ascites 1.1. A diagnostic paracentesis is recommended in all patients with new-onset ascites. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.2. The initial ascitic fluid analysis should include total protein concentration and calculation of the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.3. Ascites fluid analysis for cytology, amylase, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and adenosine deaminase should be considered based on pretest probability of specific diagnosis (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: weak)
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 2.1. Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis SBP) in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.2. A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.3. Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm 3 count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.4. Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.5. Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.6. A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.7. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong; Recommendation: strong) 2.8. Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.9. Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Dietary salt restriction 3.1. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 3.2. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should receive nutritional counselling on the sodium content in the diet. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Diuretics 4.1. In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites, spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 4.2. All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.3. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.4.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^116UzFZF]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

The results might partly be explained by the recent advances in understanding of the pathogenic microbiota responsible for SBP. Selective intestinal decontamination, using norfloxacin, may have led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in the gut flora. This might also be responsible for the recent increase in cases of SBP caused by gram-positive organisms. Elfert et al and Mostafa et al demonstrated a majority of the cases of SBP in the norfloxacin group were due to gram-positive cocci, of which most were resistant to norfloxacin. It was hypothesised that broader spectrum coverage of rifaximin including gram-positive organisms is responsible for efficacy demonstrated in those clinical trials. There is growing evidence that there are other factors at play and that the actual mechanism(s) may be unclear. Bajaj et al evaluated the relative changes in stool microbiome in cirrhotics with infections including SBP versus uninfected cirrhotics. The authors found a relative increase in pathogenic (both gram-positive and gram-negative) compared with non-pathogenic flora in infected cirrhotics represented by low cirrhosis dysbiosis ratio (CDR) with increasing dysbiosis related to severity of liver disease. They speculated that this increased dysbiosis may potentiate the complications of the cirrhosis including infections. Bajaj et al in another study looked at the effects of rifaximin on stool microbial flora in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy and did not find any significant difference in overall composition of stool microbial flora after the prolonged administration (> 8 weeks) of rifaximin. Extrapolating the results of these two studies, it is possible that the rifaximin's mechanism of action may not be linked to improving the state of intestinal dysbiosis. In a systematic review, rifaximin appears to be effective in the treatment of small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). However, the issue of SIBO as an independent risk factor for SBP is controversial as studies in the past have yielded conflicting results. There is some evidence based on studies involving virulent species of Escherichia coli and Shigella known to cause traveller's diarrhoea that rifaximin diminishes the expression of bacterial virulence factors as well as adherence molecules resulting in decreased cellular invasion. Rifaximin may also alter the host cell physiology to provide cytoprotection against bacterial invasion. Further investigations are needed to fully elucidate the effects of rifaximin in preventing SBP.

### Primary prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is linked to antibiotic resistance in the veterans health administration [^1154Jg3o]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a major cause of mortality. Although SBP primary prophylaxis (SBPPr) with fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is often used, resistance could reduce its benefit.

Aim

Analyze peritoneal fluid resistance patterns in patients with a first SBP episode with/without SBPPr using the Veterans Health Administration corporate data warehouse and to evaluate national antibiograms. Corporate data warehouse data were extracted using validated International Classification of Disease-9/10 codes, culture, resistance data, and outcomes of 7553 patients who developed their first inpatient SBP between 2009 and 2019 and compared between those with/without SBPPr. Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX was calculated using 2021 Veterans Health Administration antibiogram data from all states. The most common isolates were E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus species. Veterans taking ciprofloxacin SBBPr had higher fluoroquinolone resistance (34% vs 14% no SBPPr, p < 0.0001); those taking TMP-SMX had higher TMP-SMX resistance (40% vs 14%, p < 0.0001). SBPPr patients showed higher culture positivity, greater length of stay, higher second SBP, and higher probability of liver transplant rates versus no SBPPr. Multivariable models showed SBBPr to be the only variable associated with gram-negative resistance, and SBPPr was associated with a trend toward longer length of stay. E. coli ciprofloxacin sensitivity rates were 50%-87% and 43%-92% for TMP-SMX. K. pneumoniae ciprofloxacin sensitivity was 76%-100% and 72%-100% for TMP-SMX.

Conclusion

Among patients who developed their first SBP episode, there was a higher prevalence of antibiotic resistance in those on SBPPr, with a high rate of fluoroquinolone resistance across the Veterans Health Administration sites.

### Role of fluoroquinolones in the primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: meta-analysis [^111P1Zjh]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The use of antibiotics in the primary prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with cirrhosis is controversial. Our purpose was to determine the beneficial effect of fluoroquinolones as compared with placebo in primary prophylaxis of SBP in high-risk patients with cirrhosis by using meta-analysis.

Methods

Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were searched in all languages until August 2008 for randomized placebo-controlled studies evaluating the role of fluoroquinolones in primary prevention of SBP in patients with low protein ascites (total ascitic protein, < 1.5 g/dL) and without history of SBP. Two investigators independently performed literature search and data extraction, and then another investigator independently reviewed whether the studies met prespecified criteria and rechecked data extraction. Odds ratios (Peto method) for the risk reduction with fluoroquinolones were calculated for each study and combined by using a random-effects model.

Results

Four randomized controlled studies met predefined criteria. The odds ratios for developing first episode of SBP, serious infections, and mortality with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis (n = 194) versus placebo (n = 190) were 0.18 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09–0.35), 0.18 (95% CI, 0.10–0.32), and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.37–0.97), respectively. All studies were unidirectional in showing the beneficial effect of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. We were limited by finding few studies with relatively small sample sizes.

Conclusions

Daily oral fluoroquinolone prophylaxis reduces the risk of development of first episode of SBP and mortality in cirrhotic patients with low total protein in the ascitic fluid. Fluoroquinolones might be advisable for the primary prophylaxis of SBP in selected high-risk patients with cirrhosis.

### Diagnostic model for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites: a multicenter cohort study [^112Jwwdn]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial infection is one of the most common complications leading to acute decompensation and death in cirrhosis. Despite the use of antibiotics, bacterial infections severely impact patient outcomes, increase hospital costs, and extend hospital stays. However, the accumulated mortality of patients with cirrhosis after infections is almost 43.5%. Therefore, bacterial infection can lead to worsened prognosis.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the most common infection in decompensated cirrhosis patients, accounting for 40–70% of all infections. SBP is a recurring, fatal bacterial infection, with an incidence of 3.5% in symptom-free patients and 10–30% in hospitalized patients. SBP was first described in English medical literature in the 1960s as a syndrome with an exceedingly poor prognosis and in-hospital mortality rate of almost 100%. In recent years, the prognosis of SBP has improved considerably due to effective antibiotic treatment. However, due to immune dysfunction in patients with liver cirrhosis, the mortality rate remains as high as 30%. Delayed diagnosis of SBP leads to rapid disease progression and further deterioration of immune function, which leads to decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy. At this stage, the liver function continues to deteriorate and the prognosis is poor despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Therefore, delayed diagnosis of SBP affects the outcome and prognosis of treatment, and consequently, the diagnosis should not be missed or delayed. Antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with liver cirrhosis could result in an increase in infection due to resistant bacterial strains. Therefore, the early and accurate diagnosis of SBP is particularly important.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^115eqCyR]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Moderate-quality evidence (per the GRADE system) shows that the use of long-term rifaximin could be considered as a reasonable alternative to norfloxacin for patients with a qualifying indication for SBP prophylaxis in hepatitis C-related chronic liver disease. With the growing evidence of its use for hepatic encephalopathy, it may be an attractive choice to improve compliance in using a single antibiotic for dual purposes. Further high-quality, higher powered studies are required to firmly establish rifaximin as the first-line therapy for SBP prevention.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^113ddbNg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 2.5% of all hospitalisations in people with liver cirrhosis are for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is associated with significant short-term mortality; therefore, it is important to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people at high risk of developing it. Antibiotic prophylaxis forms the mainstay preventive method, but this has to be balanced against the development of drug-resistant spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which is difficult to treat, and other adverse events. Several different prophylactic antibiotic treatments are available; however, there is uncertainty surrounding their relative efficacy and optimal combination.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different prophylactic antibiotic treatments for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with liver cirrhosis using a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different prophylactic antibiotic treatments according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers to November 2018 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis at risk of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis undergoing prophylactic treatment to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation, or were receiving antibiotics for treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or other purposes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio, rate ratio, and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance.

Main Results

We included 29 randomised clinical trials (3896 participants; nine antibiotic regimens (ciprofloxacin, neomycin, norfloxacin, norfloxacin plus neomycin, norfloxacin plus rifaximin, rifaximin, rufloxacin, sparfloxacin, sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim), and 'no active intervention' in the review. Twenty-three trials (2587 participants) were included in one or more outcomes in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies, with or without other features of decompensation, having ascites with low protein or previous history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The follow-up in the trials ranged from 1 to 12 months. Many of the trials were at high risk of bias, and the overall certainty of evidence was low or very low. Overall, approximately 10% of trial participants developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and 15% of trial participants died. There was no evidence of differences between any of the antibiotics and no intervention in terms of mortality (very low certainty) or number of serious adverse events (very low certainty). However, because of the wide CrIs, clinically important differences in these outcomes cannot be ruled out. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life or the proportion of people with serious adverse events. There was no evidence of differences between any of the antibiotics and no intervention in terms of proportion of people with 'any adverse events' (very low certainty), liver transplantation (very low certainty), or the proportion of people who developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (very low certainty). The number of 'any' adverse events per participant was fewer with norfloxacin (rate ratio 0.74, 95% CrI 0.59 to 0.94; 4 trials, 546 participants; low certainty) and sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim (rate ratio 0.19, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.81; 1 trial, 60 participants; low certainty) versus no active intervention. There was no evidence of differences between the other antibiotics and no intervention in the number of 'any' adverse events per participant (very low certainty). There were fewer other decompensation events with rifaximin versus no active intervention (rate ratio 0.61, 65% CrI 0.46 to 0.80; 3 trials, 575 participants; low certainty) and norfloxacin plus neomycin (rate ratio 0.06, 95% CrI 0.00 to 0.33; 1 trial, 22 participants; low certainty). There was no evidence of differences between the other antibiotics and no intervention in the number of decompensations events per participant (very low certainty). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life or development of symptomatic spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. One would expect some correlation between the above outcomes, with interventions demonstrating effectiveness across several outcomes. This was not the case. The possible reasons for this include sparse data and selective reporting bias, which makes the results unreliable. Therefore, one cannot draw any conclusions from these inconsistent differences based on sparse data. There was no evidence of any differences in the subgroup analyses (performed when possible) based on whether the prophylaxis was primary or secondary.

Funding

the source of funding for five trials were organisations who would benefit from the results of the study; six trials received no additional funding or were funded by neutral organisations; and the source of funding for the remaining 18 trials was unclear.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on very low-certainty evidence, there is considerable uncertainty about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is beneficial, and if beneficial, which antibiotic prophylaxis is most beneficial in people with cirrhosis and ascites with low protein or history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Future randomised clinical trials should be adequately powered, employ blinding, avoid postrandomisation dropouts (or perform intention-to-treat analysis), and use clinically important outcomes such as mortality, health-related quality of life, and decompensation events.

### Effect of rifaximin in patients with severe cirrhosis and ascites: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^115Vp2DD]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background&Aims

Evidence for primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is weak and the selection of quinolone-resistant bacteria is currently of concern. Here we present results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled trial to assess whether rifaximin (RFX) has a beneficial effect on 12-month survival in patients with severe cirrhosis and ascites.

Methods

In this trial conducted at 17 French centers, patients with severe cirrhosis and grade 2 or 3 ascites and ascites protein level < 15 g/L were randomized 1:1 to receive RFX 550 mg or PBO BID for 12 months, as primary prophylaxis for SBP. The primary endpoint was 12-month survival. Secondary endpoints were 3- and 6-month survival, incidence of complications of cirrhosis, and safety of RFX.

Results

Between 2018 and 2022, 1957 cirrhotic patients with ascites were screened, 159 were randomized, and 152 (80/72 PBO/RFX) were analyzed in the modified intention-to-treat population. RFX did not improve 12-month (PBO/RFX: 68.1% [95% CI 56.2–78.7] / 56.6% [95% CI 43.5–67.8], p = 0.74), 6-month (71.1% [95% CI 59.5–80.0] / 76.4% [95% CI 64.3–84.8]) or 3-month survivals (75.4% [95% CI 64.1–83.5]/82.6% [95% CI 71.4–89.7]), or the incidence of liver complications (SBP, encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding or hepatorenal syndrome). In the per-protocol population (127 patients adherent to the study drug), a lower 12-month cumulative incidence of liver-related events in the RFX group was observed. RFX was well tolerated throughout the study.

Conclusions

RFX had no beneficial effect in terms of 12-month survival or incidence of complications of liver cirrhosis in patients with severe cirrhosis and low ascitic fluid protein levels. Improving patient adherence could reduce liver complications of cirrhosis.

Impact and Implications

Selective gut decontamination using norfloxacin is the standard of care for secondary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Evidence for primary prophylaxis of SBP is weaker, and fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Rifaximin, a well-tolerated broad-spectrum antibiotic with a lower risk of AMR emergence, may be an alternative to norfloxacin. Our trial did not demonstrate an improvement in survival or liver complications (SBP, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy or hepatorenal syndrome) at 12 months with rifaximin as primary prophylaxis for SBP versus placebo. However, in the subgroup of patients who adhered to rifaximin, liver complications decreased. Our study highlights the importance of study drug adherence in clinical trials to adequately assess outcomes.

### Oral antibiotic prophylaxis reduces spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurrence and improves short-term survival in cirrhosis: a meta-analysis [^117Saq59]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious complication of advanced liver disease resulting in high mortality rates. Although studies that assessed the use of oral antibiotics in advanced liver disease demonstrated a clear benefit in reducing the risk of recurrent peritonitis, it is unclear whether mortality rates are similarly affected by this practice. The goal of this study was to determine whether oral antibiotic therapy provides a survival benefit for patients with advanced cirrhosis and ascites. Through subgroup analysis, we also evaluated the effect of prophylactic oral antibiotic therapy on the prevention of SBP and the incidence of all infections (including SBP) when compared with non-treated or placebo controls.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2008), bibliographies of retrieved trials, and reports presented at major scientific meetings. Eligible studies included prospective, randomized controlled trials comparing high-risk cirrhotic patients receiving oral antibiotic prophylaxis for SBP with groups receiving placebo or no intervention. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Eight studies with a total of 647 patients were identified and included in this analysis. The combined analysis showed an overall mortality benefit (RR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48–0.88) for treatment groups. The overall mortality rate was 16% (52/324) for treated patients and 25% (81/323) for the control group. Groups treated with prophylactic antibiotics also demonstrated a lower incidence of all infections (including SBP) of 6.2% as compared with the control groups with a rate of 22.2% (RR = 0.32; P < 0.00001; 95% CI, 0.20–0.51). Subgroup analysis showed a survival benefit at 3 months (RR = 0.28; P = 0.005; 95% CI, 0.12–0.68).

Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis improved short-term survival in treated patients when compared with untreated control groups and reduced the overall risk of infections, including SBP, during follow-up. In summary, antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered for high-risk cirrhotic patients with ascites.

### Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrence in patients with cirrhosis receiving secondary prophylaxis with norfloxacin [^113PQBSz]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Few studies carried out more than 20 years ago have evaluated spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) recurrence in patients receiving secondary antibiotic prophylaxis. These studies reported a 1-year recurrence rate of 20–26%. Changes in the bacteriology of SBP over the last few years might have negative effects on secondary prophylaxis. Our primary aim was to estimate the incidence of SBP recurrence in patients with cirrhosis receiving secondary prophylaxis with norfloxacin and to explore the factors associated with SBP recurrence.

Patients and Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients receiving norfloxacin for the secondary prophylaxis of SBP from 1 March 2003 to 31 March 2016. Follow-up was performed for 365 days after secondary prophylaxis was started. A competing risk analysis approach was used.

Results

A total of 115 patients were included. The prevalence of quinolone-resistant and multiresistant bacteria in the first episode of SBP among patients with culture-positive SBP was 70.96% [95% confidence interval (CI): 51.96–85.77%] and 12.90% (95% CI: 3.63–29.83%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of SBP recurrence was 28.53% (95% CI: 20.15–37.45%) after 365 days. Male patients showed an estimated subhazard ratio of SBP recurrence of 2.52 (95% CI: 1.07–5.91, P = 0.034). No other risk factors for SBP recurrence were identified. The overall cumulative incidence of death after 365 days was 21.57% (95% CI: 14.14–30.04%), without significant differences among patients with or without SBP recurrence.

Conclusion

Even though changes in the bacteriology of SBP occurred over time, its recurrence rate in patients receiving norfloxacin remains similar to what was reported in the initial studies.

Albumin in cirrhosis with infection and SBP indicates benefit and dosing: IV albumin improves survival in patients with cirrhosis and SBP, with those who most benefited having renal dysfunction (blood urea nitrogen > 30 mg/dL or creatinine > 1.0 mg/dL) or severe hepatic decompensation (bilirubin > 5 mg/dL). In an infection other than SBP, IV albumin has been used in the same doses (1.5 g/kg at day 1 and 1 g/kg at day 3); it has remained the standard recommendation. Alternatively, following the recommendations for the use of albumin in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) would also be appropriate.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) secondary prophylaxis — Patients with a prior episode of SBP are at a very high risk of SBP recurrence, and in a landmark multicenter randomized controlled trial, the 1-year probability of developing recurrent SBP was significantly lower with norfloxacin (20%) compared with placebo (68%). A reasonable alternative to norfloxacin is oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg/day), although direct evidence in support for this regimen is lacking. Limited comparative data indicate a single-center open-label randomized trial showed rifaximin had a lower 6-month incidence of recurrent SBP compared with norfloxacin (4% vs. 14%, respectively). Similarly, high-quality data in support of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim for secondary prophylaxis are lacking, and to date, prevention of spontaneous bacteremia or SBE has not been studied.

### Peritonitis-the Western experience [^116FJ9kj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The clinical outcomes associated with secondary peritonitis are highly dependent upon the site of contamination (appendicitis vs others), as well as local and systemic factors. Recent developments in care have influenced the route and choice of operation. Improvements in antimicrobial therapy and results of prospective randomized clinical trials have identified a variety of effective antibiotics for the management of these disorders. There continues to be controversy about the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for secondary peritonitis.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^11277hDs]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) primary prophylaxis — In patients without a prior history of SBP, antibiotics should be used judiciously and sparingly and reserved only for those at the highest risk of infection. In cirrhosis with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, a meta-analysis found that short-term (5–7 days) selective intestinal decontamination (mostly oral norfloxacin) reduced the rate of infections, including SBP, and improved survival, and because the emergence of quinolone-resistant organisms has decreased the prophylactic efficacy of norfloxacin, IV ceftriaxone is currently the recommended antibiotic in patients with hemorrhage; alternative drugs are discouraged and SBP and other infections should be ruled out before starting the antibiotic. In patients without gastrointestinal hemorrhage and without a prior episode of SBP, antibiotic prophylaxis may be considered in selected high-risk patients, for example those with low (< 1.5 g/dL) ascitic fluid protein; even with low ascites protein, the 1-year probability of SBP may vary between 20% and 60%. In a landmark trial, norfloxacin was associated with a significantly reduced 1-year probability of first SBP compared with placebo (60% vs. 7%) in patients with low protein ascites and advanced liver disease (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score > 9 points with serum bilirubin level > 3 mg/dL) or with impaired renal function defined by serum creatinine level > 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level > 25 mg/dL, or serum sodium level < 130 mEq/L.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) may occur despite antibiotic prophylaxis. We investigated whether the addition of probiotics to norfloxacin enhances its efficacy in the prevention of SBP.

Methods

A double-blind, randomized-controlled trial was conducted among consecutive cirrhotic patients who had either recovered from SBP (secondary prophylaxis) or who were at a high risk for the development of SBP (low ascitic fluid protein or serum bilirubin ≥ 2.5 mg/dl; primary prophylaxis). Norfloxacin 400 mg/day with probiotics capsules (Enterococcus faecalis JPC 30 million, Clostridium butyricum 2 million, Bacillus mesentericus JPC 1 million, Bacillus coagulans 50 million spores) at a dose of two capsules three times daily (group 1) or norfloxacin with a placebo (group 2) was given and the occurrence of SBP within a period of 6 months (primary endpoint) or side-effects of therapy and mortality (secondary endpoints) were recorded.

Results

From April 2005 through August 2007, 110 patients were randomized to group 1 (n = 55) or group 2 (n = 55) and 45 (82%) and 43 (78%) of them completed the trial, respectively. The baseline characteristics were comparable. On intention-to-treat analysis, the cumulative probability of treatment failures was similar in both the groups [19/55 (34%) in group 1 vs. 20/55 (36%) in group 2, P = 0.840]. The cumulative probability of mortality was also similar [13/45 (29%) in group 1 vs. 14/43 (32%) in group 2, P = 0.834]. The frequency of side-effects was also comparable. In subgroup analyses, the frequencies of SBP and deaths were similar in the two groups in the subgroups of primary and secondary prophylaxes. The presence of encephalopathy and serum bilirubin of greater than 3.65 mg/dl were found to predict mortality independently.

Conclusion

The addition of probiotics to norfloxacin does not improve its efficacy in primary or secondary prophylaxis of SBP or in reducing the mortality in cirrhotic patients with ascites.

### Primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis delays hepatorenal syndrome and improves survival in cirrhosis [^113FbXwy]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Norfloxacin is highly effective in preventing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrence in cirrhosis, but its role in the primary prevention of this complication is uncertain.

Methods

Patients with cirrhosis and low protein ascitic levels (< 15 g/L) with advanced liver failure (Child-Pugh score ≥ 9 points with serum bilirubin level ≥ 3 mg/dL) or impaired renal function (serum creatinine level ≥ 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level ≥ 25 mg/dL, or serum sodium level ≤ 130 mEq/L) were included in a randomized controlled trial aimed at comparing norfloxacin (35 patients) vs placebo (33 patients) in the primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The main end points of the trial were 3-month and 1-year probability of survival. Secondary end points were 1-year probability of development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome.

Results

Norfloxacin administration reduced the 1-year probability of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (7% vs 61%, P < .001) and hepatorenal syndrome (28% vs 41%, P = 0.02), and improved the 3-month (94% vs 62%, P = 0.003) and the 1-year (60% vs 48%, P = 0.05) probability of survival compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Primary prophylaxis with norfloxacin has a great impact in the clinical course of patients with advanced cirrhosis. It reduces the incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, delays the development of hepatorenal syndrome, and improves survival.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites, without gastro-intestinal bleeding [^1158pbr3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is frequent among cirrhotic patients, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Selective intestinal decontamination employing antibiotics is a proposed prophylactic measure. While data regarding this modality among cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding exist, there is insufficient data synthesis regarding cirrhotic patients with ascites and no gastrointestinal bleeding.

Objectives

To assess whether antibiotic prophylaxis decreases spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and mortality among cirrhotic patients with ascites and no gastrointestinal bleeding.

Search Strategy

We identified relevant randomised trials by searching trial registries of The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group and The Cochrane Collaboration, medical literature search engines, and reviewing all literature we found on the topic until February 2009.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised clinical trials assessing prophylactic treatment among adult cirrhotic patients with ascites and no gastrointestinal bleeding, comparing antibiotic therapy with no intervention, placebo, or with another antibiotic regimen.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three independent authors searched for and collected the trials and extracted relevant data. Four other independent authors validated the findings and assessed them. The studies were assessed for design, patient and intervention characteristics, and quality. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate measures of association between antibiotic prophylaxis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or mortality.

Main Results

Nine trials were included in the review. Seven trials, comparing antibiotics to placebo or no treatment, were meta-analysed. Systematic bias in design or publication is suggested by trial results. The randomisation results suggest that the probability that true randomisation took place in all trials is very small and the report of most trials regarding design was poor. The proportion of participants with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis varied between the trials from 15% to 50%. The calculated relative risks (95% confidence interval) of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and mortality among patients treated with antibiotics compared with no treatment/placebo were 0.20 (0.11 to 0.37) and 0.61 (0.43 to 0.87). There were very few reports of adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

The pooled estimates suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis might be prudent among cirrhotic patients with ascites and no gastrointestinal bleeding. However, poor trial methodology and report coupled with findings suggesting systematic bias in publication and design reflect the fragility of these findings. Potential hazard to society and the patients themselves from resistant pathogens should be considered when promoting long-lasting antibiotic prophylaxis. It seems that recommending antibiotic prophylaxis is still far from being a substantiated prevention strategy. Trials of better design, well reported, and of longer follow-up are greatly needed.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^112RF3hn]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Rifaximin has minimal systemic side effects and is a fairly well-tolerated medication. It has very low absorption in healthy volunteers; however, it is significantly increased in patients with advanced liver disease, although there are no definitive data whether to recommend or to avoid its use in this population. Fluoroquinolones, on the other hand, are readily absorbed and may have notable systemic side effects. Serious ones include tendinopathies and QTc prolongation, predisposing to life-threatening arrhythmias. These side effects are more common with ciprofloxacin than norfloxacin, owing to its higher systemic absorption. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the other agent that has been used for SBP prophylaxis, has an unfavourable side-effect profile as well, with hyperkalaemia, hypersensitivity reactions and cytopenias being the limiting ones. The dual use of one single agent for prevention of both hepatic encephalopathy and SBP in the same patient makes rifaximin an ideal choice in this setting. Randomised trials and systematic reviews have clearly demonstrated its benefits in the treatment and prevention of hepatic encephalopathy.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients without gastrointestinal bleeding [^116tr1M4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review relevant studies for both primary and secondary antibiotic prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with cirrhosis without gastrointestinal bleeding.

Data Sources

A search of PubMed (1980-July 2010) was conducted using the terms prophylaxis, SBP, and antibiotics. A manual review of bibliographies was conducted for inclusion of relevant articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective studies and meta-analyses published in English were included.

Data Synthesis

Ten trials and 3 meta-analyses were included. Of the 10 trials, 2 examined the use of secondary prophylaxis for prevention of subsequent episodes of SBP, 4 examined the use of primary prophylaxis to prevent an initial SBP episode, and 4 examined the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in a mixed population. Seven trials evaluated the use of an antibiotic compared to placebo or no treatment. Only 1 trial evaluated norfloxacin versus trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Trial duration varied from 24 days to 12 months. In general, trials examining norfloxacin as secondary prophylaxis found significantly decreased occurrence of SBP but no significant difference in mortality rates. Primary prophylaxis studies found no significant difference in the incidence of infections, including SBP, with norfloxacin or ciprofloxacin treatment but significantly lower incidence of gram-negative infections. Mixed population studies found a significantly decreased incidence of SBP but no significant difference in mortality. In the 3 meta-analyses, a significant decrease in mortality and an overall decrease in SBP incidence in the treatment groups were noted.

Conclusions

Based on currently available data, the use of prophylactic antibiotic therapy is warranted for the prevention of recurrent SBP in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. In patients with low ascetic fluid protein and at least 1 more risk factor, primary prophylaxis may be considered. Further studies with improved methodology are needed to determine whether prophylactic antibiotic therapy has an impact on mortality.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhosis: good and bad [^117P11Zv]. Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Patients with cirrhosis, particularly those with decompensated cirrhosis, are at increased risk of bacterial infections that may further precipitate other liver decompensations including acute-on-chronic liver failure. Infections constitute the main cause of death in patients with advanced cirrhosis, and strategies to prevent them are essential. The main current strategy is the use of prophylactic antibiotics targeted at specific subpopulations at high risk of infection: prior episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and low-protein ascites with associated poor liver function. Antibiotic prophylaxis effectively prevents not only the development of bacterial infections in all these indications but also further decompensation (variceal bleeding, hepatorenal syndrome) and improves survival. However, antibiotic prophylaxis is also associated with a clinically relevant and increasing drawback, the development of infections due to multidrug-resistant organisms. Several strategies have been suggested to balance the risks and benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis.

Conclusion

Antibiotic stewardship principles such as the restriction of antibiotic prophylaxis to subpopulations at a very high risk for infection, the avoidance of antibiotic overuse, and early deescalation policies are key to achieve this balance; nonantibiotic prophylactic measures such as probiotics, prokinetics, bile acids, statins, and hematopoietic growth factors could also contribute to ameliorate the development and spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria in cirrhosis.

### Rethinking antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis: first, Do No harm [^113qnrTi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBPPr) in patients with cirrhosis has been considered the standard of care since the 1990s and is currently recommended by several major gastroenterological societies. However, the evidence that supports this practice is weak, and there is no clear mortality benefit. The unintended consequences of this strategy are not insignificant, both at the patient and population levels. Recent evidence suggests that SBPPr may even cause harm. Since the widespread implementation of SBPPr 3 decades ago, our overall approach to antibiotic use has shifted. We now recognize the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance, the potential harms of antibiotics, and the vital role of antimicrobial stewardship. In light of recent developments and evidence, there is an urgent need for infectious diseases, antimicrobial stewardship, and hepatology leaders to collaborate in development of an updated and cohesive approach to SBPPr.

### CDC updates guidelines for the prevention of perinatal… [^113JwPDU]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Intrapartum Antibiotic Prophylaxis Figure 1 provides an algorithm for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent early-onset GBS disease. The recommended antibiotic for intrapartum GBS prophylaxis is penicillin, although ampicillin is an acceptable alternative. The dosing regimen for penicillin G should be 5 million units intravenously, followed by 2. 5 to
3. 0 million units intravenously every four hours. If the GBS isolate is sensitive to clindamycin but resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin may be used if inducible clindamycin resistance testing is negative. Vancomycin is recommend for penicillin-allergic patients at high risk for anaphylaxis whose susceptibility to both agents is unknown or whose antimicrobial susceptibility testing results show the GBS isolate to be intrinsically resistant to clindamycin or positive for inducible clindamycin resistance.

Erythromycin is no longer an acceptable alternative for intrapartum GBS prophylaxis in penicillin-allergic patients at high risk for anaphylaxis. GBS prophylaxis should be given at hospital admission in patients with threatened preterm delivery if their colonization status is unknown or if they had a positive screen within the preceding five weeks. Women who have not had vaginal-rectal GBS screening within the preceding five weeks should be screened for colonization at hospital admission. If admission screening results are negative for GBS or if, at any point, it is determined that a patient admitted with preterm labor is not in true labor, antibiotics given for GBS prophylaxis should be discontinued immediately. The administration of antibiotics for other indications should not be affected by negative GBS culture results. Antibiotics may be given to patients with PPROM to prolong latency; this dosage should also cover GBS prophylaxis if delivery occurs while the patient is receiving that antibiotic regimen. Oral antibiotics alone will not adequately cover GBS prophylaxis. GBS testing results should not affect the duration of antibiotics given to such patients who are not in labor. Unless a screen performed within the preceding five weeks was negative, GBS prophylaxis should be given for 48 hours in patients with PPROM who are not in labor and are not receiving antibiotics to prolong latency. Prophylaxis should be discontinued if negative results from admission screening become available during that 48-hour period.

### Norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and rifaximin for the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a network meta-analysis [^1148HbpU]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

For the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients with ascites, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended as a standard regimen. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of norfloxacin (N), ciprofloxacin (C), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (T-S), and rifaximin (R) in the prevention of SBP. We searched the electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science from inception till 1 August 2018. The randomized-controlled trials that compared N, C, T-S, R, and placebo (P) were identified. A network meta-analysis (NMA) was carried out using the software STATA 14.0 and Revman 5.3. We included 16 studies involving 1984 participants in the NMA for SBP prevention. The NMA results showed that, compared with those treated with P (reference), patients treated with C, N, or R had a lower incidence of SBP and mortality. Similarly, the incidences of SBP and mortality for R were lower than those for N. The probabilities of ranking results showed that R ranked first with respect to the outcomes of the incidence of SBP and mortality. According to our results, R seemed to be the optimal regimen for protecting against SBP in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. However, considering the limitations of our study, additional high-quality studies are required in this respect.

### A comparison of outcomes of standard weight-based and capped doses of albumin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^114a2MY7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Albumin is recommended in the management of patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) to reduce rates of renal injury and mortality. Current guideline recommendations suggest an intravenous albumin dosing regimen of 1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1 g/kg on day 3, although a maximum dosing strategy is not well-defined.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in renal injury for patients with SBP treated with a capped dose less than or equal to 100 g vs a weight-based dose greater than 100 g.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted at a single academic medical center for patients with a diagnosis of cirrhosis treated with albumin for SBP. The primary outcome examined rates of acute renal injury at 5 days between patients treated with capped dose vs weight-based doses of intravenous albumin. Secondary outcomes included resolution of SBP by day 5, death by day 5, death by day 30, and change in serum creatinine from day 0 to day 5.

Results

In total, 258 patient encounters were analyzed, with 154 included in this study. There were 70 encounters encompassing the capped dose and 84 in the non-capped. Acute renal injury at day 5 was observed in 10% (n = 7) of the capped dosed group and 6% (n = 5) of the non-capped group (P = 0.381).

Conclusion and Relevance

This study did not show a significant difference in outcomes associated with a capped albumin dose at 100 g for SBP. Application of these data may aid in reducing health system and patient costs.

### Evaluating the role of antibiotics in patients admitted to hospital with decompensated cirrhosis: lessons from the ATTIRE trial [^113hNZhz]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Infections in patients hospitalized with decompensated cirrhosis are common with a high mortality. Therefore, guidelines support early antibiotic prescription in suspected infection as mortality risk increases in (noncirrhotic) septic patients after delay in appropriate antibiotic therapy. Given this increased risk of infections, clinicians also prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics to patients hospitalized with cirrhosis without infection to prevent hospital-acquired infections (HAI) and subsequent sepsis, as we observed in the Albumin to Prevent Infection in Chronic Liver Failure (ATTIRE) trial with 50% receiving antibiotics at trial entry, although only 27% were diagnosed with infection.

Other approaches to prevent infection may potentially include use of rifaximin in outpatients, a nonabsorbable broad-spectrum antibiotic licensed for hepatic encephalopathy (HE), because this may prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). However, not all studies have shown benefit. Long-term antibiotics are also used in outpatients with ascites to prevent infection after an episode of SBP, supported by a 72% reduction in 3-month mortality, although a Cochrane systematic review concluded there was very low-certainty supportive evidence.

However, indiscriminate antibiotic use drives antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and quinolone prophylaxis has been associated with increased multidrug resistance and Gram-positive organisms cultured in SBP. Patients hospitalized with cirrhosis have a high incidence of AMR with 34% of cultures growing multidrug-resistant organisms in a global study which caused higher mortality than non-AMR infections. Therefore, prescribing antibiotics in the absence of infection, which may actually be harmful in the longer-term and judicious use of antibiotics, is a global priority. More evidence is needed to aid decision-making on the use of antibiotics to prevent infection in decompensated cirrhosis, in particular in hospitalized patients. We therefore estimated the risk of HAI and mortality in patients without active infection at hospitalization who were treated with antibiotics or rifaximin compared with those who were not treated, using data collected from our completed ATTIRE trial.

### Antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients [^111EpRg5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a complication of cirrhotic ascites that occurs in the absence of any intra-abdominal, surgically treatable source of infection. Antibiotic therapy is indicated and should be initiated as soon as possible to avoid severe complications that may lead to death. It has been proposed that empirical treatment should cover gram-negative enteric bacteria and gram-positive cocci, responsible for up to 90% of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis cases.

Objectives

This review aims to evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of different types and modes of antibiotic therapy in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients.

Search Strategy

We performed electronic searches in The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (July 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2008), MEDLINE (1950 to July 2008), EMBASE (1980 to July 2008), and Science Citation Index EXPANDED (1945 to July 2008). In addition, we handsearched the references of all identified studies and contacted the first author of each included trial.

Selection Criteria

Randomised studies comparing different types of antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted from the trials by at least two authors. Peto odds ratios or average differences, with their 95% confidence intervals, were estimated.

Main Results

This systematic review attempted to summarise evidence from randomised clinical trials on the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Thirteen studies were included; each one of them compared different antibiotics in their experimental and control groups. No meta-analyses could be performed, though data on the main outcomes were collected and analysed separately for each included trial. Currently, the evidence showing that lower dosage or short-term treatment with third generation cephalosporins is as effective as higher dosage or long-term treatment is weak. Oral quinolones could be considered an option for those with less severe manifestations of the disease.

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides no clear evidence for the treatment of cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In practice, third generation cephalosporins have already been established as the standard treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and it is clear, that empirical antibiotic therapy should be provided in any case. However, until large, well-conducted trials provide more information, practice will remain based on impression, not evidence.

### Randomized-controlled trial of rifaximin versus norfloxacin for secondary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^113Gj5f1]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis with a high recurrence rate and a marked increase in mortality. Norfloxacin is used widely for the secondary prophylaxis of SBP; however, its extensive long-term use has led to an increase in the incidence of quinolone-resistant and Gram-positive SBP. Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable broad-spectrum antibiotic and does not appear to promote emergence of resistance. The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of rifaximin versus norfloxacin for the secondary prevention of SBP in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites.

Materials and Methods

Two hundred and sixty two cirrhotic patients with ascites and a previous episode of SBP were assigned randomly to receive either 1200mg rifaximin or 400mg of norfloxacin daily for 6 months. All patients were monitored clinically each month and with ascitic fluid examination at the end of 2 and 6 months if not clinically suspected of recurrence earlier.

Results

Recurrence of SBP was significantly lower in the rifaximin group (3.88 vs. 14.13%) compared with the norfloxacin group (P = 0.04). The mortality rate was significantly decreased in the rifaximin group (13.74 vs. 24.43%) compared with the norfloxacin group (P = 0.044). The causes of death between the two groups did not show a significant difference (P = 0.377), but encephalopathy-related deaths were three folds higher in the norfloxacin group. There was a significant decrease in the side effects in the rifaximin group versus the norfloxacin group (P = 0.033).

Conclusion

Rifaximin was more effective than norfloxacin in the secondary prevention of SBP. Encephalopathy-related mortality and side effects were fewer in the rifaximin group.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^115sSNcT]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Aim

The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rifaximin in the prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) as compared with norfloxacin.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Google Scholar and Cochrane databases from inception to January 2017. Reference lists of articles as well as conference proceedings were manually screened. We included studies that recruited patients with cirrhosis and ascites who met the criteria for primary or secondary SBP prophylaxis as defined by the European Association for the Study of the Liver and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Two independent investigators reviewed the studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was occurrence of SBP. Secondary outcomes included mortality and adverse events with therapy.

Results

Of the 435 studies identified, a total of five were included for full-text review. Four studies were eligible for the systematic review, three of which were randomised controlled trials and one was a prospective observational study. The population examined in majority of studies was primarily hepatitis C cirrhosis. The results of individual studies indicated either superior efficacy of rifaximin or no statistical difference between rifaximin and norfloxacin for SBP prophylaxis.

Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence shows that long-term use of rifaximin appears to be a reasonable alternative to norfloxacin for SBP prevention in hepatitis C cirrhosis.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^113fqeic]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial infections are a frequent complication in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Antibiotic prophylaxis seems to decrease the incidence of bacterial infections. Oral antibiotics, active against enteric bacteria, have been commonly used as antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index EXPANDED until June 2010. In addition, we handsearched the references of all identified studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing different types of antibiotic prophylaxis with no intervention, placebo, or another antibiotic to prevent bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed trial quality, risk of bias, and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Association measures were relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

Twelve trials (1241 patients) evaluated antibiotic prophylaxis compared with placebo or no antibiotic prophylaxis. All trials were at risk of bias. Antibiotic prophylaxis compared with no intervention or placebo was associated with beneficial effects on mortality (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98), mortality from bacterial infections (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.97), bacterial infections (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.49), rebleeding (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74), days of hospitalisation (MD -1.91, 95% CI -3.80 to -0.02), bacteraemia (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.40), pneumonia (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.75), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.57), and urinary tract infections (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.41). No serious adverse events were reported. The trials showed no significant heterogeneity of effects. Another five trials (650 patients) compared different antibiotic regimens. Data could not be combined as each trial used different antibiotic regimen. None of the examined antibiotic regimen was superior to the control regimen regarding mortality or bacterial infections.

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylactic antibiotic use in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding significantly reduced bacterial infections, and seems to have reduced all-cause mortality, bacterial infection mortality, rebleeding events, and hospitalisation length. These benefits were observed independently of the type of antibiotic used; thus, no specific antibiotic can be preferred. Therefore, antibiotic selection should be made considering local conditions such as bacterial resistance profile and treatment cost.
