## Question

pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, risk factors and prognosis of delayed ejaculation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about delayed ejaculation, specifically its pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, risk factors, and prognosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and diagnostic thresholds to anchor the discussion. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological mechanisms, distinguishing neurobiological, endocrine, medication-induced, and psychogenic contributors. Next, I will review clinical manifestations and how they differ by lifelong versus acquired forms. After that, I should enumerate risk factors with attention to medications, endocrine disorders, neurologic and vascular disease, and psychosocial elements. Finally, I will assess prognosis and synthesize the key points, ensuring I double-check areas where evidence is limited or conflicting, such as testosterone's role and the strength of psychogenic contributors.

> Let me first confirm the core definitions so I don't build on a shaky foundation. Delayed ejaculation is a consistent, bothersome inability to achieve ejaculation or excessive latency despite adequate stimulation and desire, and it can be lifelong or acquired; anorgasmia is the absence or markedly diminished intensity of orgasm and is often encompassed within DE in men, with DSM-5 framing male orgasmic difficulties under delayed ejaculation rather than a separate anorgasmia category [^117GW47M] [^116EDFt5] [^116RsY9z]. Wait, I should verify the latency threshold because I initially thought a numeric cutoff like 30 minutes defined DE; hold on, that's not quite right. The AUA/SMSNA guideline notes that men with latencies beyond roughly 25–30 minutes who report distress or stop due to fatigue or futility qualify for a DE diagnosis, but the diagnosis is ultimately clinical and distress-based rather than anchored to a single universal stopwatch time, so I need to correct that overstatement and emphasize patient-reported bother and functional impact [^114juzdA]. I should also confirm that the ICD-11 aligns with this conceptual framing of DE and that AO is considered within DE in men, which it does [^115sZW6S].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology, and I need to ensure I separate well-supported mechanisms from hypotheses. The most robust contributor is medication-induced DE, particularly SSRIs and SNRIs, which increase serotonergic tone and can elevate prolactin via hypothalamic pathways, suppressing testosterone and shifting the ejaculatory threshold upward; this is mechanistically coherent and clinically observed, so I can treat this as high-certainty in practice [^113deLa8] [^113Zucqm] [^115eeFm8]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of SSRI-associated DE risk; yes, SSRI users have about a sevenfold increased risk of DE in observational data, underscoring the strength of this association [^113Zucqm]. I also need to check that SNRIs carry similar warnings; venlafaxine labeling documents ejaculatory delay or failure, supporting the broader serotonergic mechanism beyond SSRIs alone [^111NHybC].

> I will now examine endocrine contributors, but I should be cautious not to overstate causality. Low testosterone has been associated with DE in observational cohorts, and hypothyroidism correlates with delayed ejaculation while hyperthyroidism tends to associate with premature ejaculation; however, I need to double-check whether testosterone levels directly correlate with ejaculatory latency in men with DE, and a large observational study found no association between ejaculation times and serum testosterone, suggesting that while hypogonadism may contribute in some men, it is not a universal driver of latency prolongation [^112ZjZB3] [^1167uLWK]. But wait, what if I'm conflating association with mechanism? The AUA/SMSNA guideline supports checking morning testosterone in men with DE, especially when symptoms of androgen deficiency are present, and offers testosterone normalization as a reasonable option in those with confirmed deficiency, which aligns with a targeted, symptom-driven approach rather than routine screening for all-comers [^1135TrSz] [^115MLkSL].

> Let me consider neurogenic and vascular factors next, and I should confirm that these are more often inferred from shared disease pathways rather than proven in DE-specific trials. Peripheral neuropathy from diabetes, autonomic dysfunction, spinal cord injury, and radical pelvic surgery can impair the afferent and efferent pathways coordinating emission and expulsion, thereby contributing to DE; similarly, vascular insufficiency may compromise penile engorgement and sensory feedback, indirectly delaying ejaculation, though the direct evidence base in DE is thinner than in erectile dysfunction [^114WnagS]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while these mechanisms are biologically plausible and supported by general sexual dysfunction literature, I should flag that high-quality DE-specific mechanistic data are limited and that management often remains empiric when these factors are suspected [^115eeFm8].

> I need to check psychogenic and behavioral contributors carefully because they are frequently implicated yet heterogeneous. Anxiety, depression, performance pressure, relationship conflict, and restrictive sexual scripts can inhibit arousal and orgasmic response; situational DE tied to specific partners or contexts is common, and hyperstimulation from frequent or high-intensity masturbation may blunt penile sensation, creating a mismatch between partnered stimulation and the threshold needed for ejaculation, which can perpetuate a vicious cycle of escalating stimulation and further desensitization [^115eeFm8] [^1175HrrJ]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should verify that these psychogenic and behavioral factors are not merely epiphenomena; longitudinal and interventional data are limited, but clinical guidance consistently recommends addressing these dimensions, and sex therapy is a core treatment pillar when psychosocial drivers are present, which supports their clinical relevance even if mechanistic studies are sparse [^115NRtKA].

> Now, I will delineate clinical manifestations, and I should confirm the distinction between lifelong and acquired forms. Lifelong DE presents from sexual debut with consistently prolonged or absent ejaculation across partners and contexts, whereas acquired DE emerges after a period of normal function and may be generalized or situational; both require clinically significant distress to meet diagnostic criteria, and men often report stopping sexual activity due to fatigue, partner request, or a sense of futility when latency extends beyond roughly 25–30 minutes, which operationalizes the functional burden even in the absence of a rigid numeric threshold [^117GW47M] [^116EDFt5] [^114juzdA]. I should double-check that anorgasmia is encompassed within DE in men; yes, DSM-5 and contemporary reviews treat male anorgasmia under the DE umbrella, which is important for counseling and coding in practice [^116RsY9z].

> Next, I should review risk factors systematically, starting with medications, since they are the most actionable. SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs, antipsychotics, and other serotonergic agents are well-documented causes of DE. Clinicians should proactively screen for these, consider dose reduction, switching, or staged cessation when feasible, and counsel patients that sexual dysfunction is common and often underreported with these agents [^113deLa8] [^113Zucqm] [^111NHybC]. Hold on, I should verify that FDA labeling reinforces this. Sertraline and venlafaxine labels explicitly warn about ejaculatory delay or failure, supporting routine inquiry before and during treatment and shared decision-making about management strategies [^1129W1Ld] [^111NHybC].

> I will now examine endocrine risk factors, but I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. Hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, and hypothyroidism are plausible contributors to DE, and guidelines support targeted evaluation of testosterone and thyroid function when clinically indicated. However, I should reiterate that a large study did not find a correlation between ejaculatory latency and testosterone levels, so routine androgen testing in all men with DE is not supported, and treatment should be reserved for those with confirmed deficiency and compatible symptoms [^1135TrSz] [^115MLkSL] [^1167uLWK]. Let me reconsider whether hyperprolactinemia is a common driver; while mechanistically coherent, its prevalence as a primary cause of DE is modest in observational series, so it remains an important but relatively infrequent contributor that warrants evaluation when symptoms or medications suggest it [^112ZjZB3].

> I should confirm neurologic and systemic disease risk factors next. Diabetes mellitus with autonomic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and radical pelvic surgery can disrupt ejaculatory reflex arcs; cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome may impair vascular flow and penile sensation, indirectly contributing to DE; and chronic pelvic pain syndromes and prostatitis may alter pelvic floor dynamics and sensory feedback, though the evidence linking these directly to DE is weaker and often inferred from broader sexual dysfunction literature [^114WnagS]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines acknowledge shared risk with erectile dysfunction; yes, ED and DE frequently co-occur and share vascular, endocrine, and medication-related risks, which supports a comprehensive cardiometabolic and neurologic review when evaluating DE [^113YuHf1].

> Let me think about lifestyle and behavioral risk factors, and I should be careful to distinguish correlation from causation. Obesity, sedentary behavior, smoking, and alcohol or substance use are associated with sexual dysfunction broadly and may worsen DE via vascular, endocrine, and neurosensory pathways; high-frequency or high-intensity masturbation may lead to penile hypoesthesia and a need for greater stimulation, creating a mismatch with partnered sex; and anxiety, depression, and relationship distress are both risk factors and perpetuating factors, often forming a vicious cycle with sexual avoidance and performance pressure [^115eeFm8] [^1175HrrJ]. I should double-check that these behavioral and psychosocial elements are emphasized in guidelines; yes, psycho-behavioral strategies and, when needed, mental health referral are core recommendations for DE care, reflecting their clinical salience despite variable mechanistic data [^115NRtKA].

> Now, I will assess prognosis, and I need to ensure I separate evidence-based statements from clinical impressions. There are no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for DE, so prognosis hinges on identifying and modifying reversible causes, especially medication contributors, and on engaging patients in sex therapy or behavioral interventions; success is variable, with better outcomes when the etiology is identifiable and modifiable, and with poorer outcomes in lifelong, multifactorial, or treatment-resistant cases [^112sc9iJ] [^115NRtKA]. Wait, let me verify whether any invasive nonpharmacologic strategies improve outcomes; the AUA/SMSNA guideline advises that no published data support invasive approaches such as pudendal nerve release, PRP, or intracavernosal injections for DE, so these should not be offered outside of research settings [^115ftUvZ]. I should also confirm that testosterone therapy is reasonable only in confirmed deficiency with symptoms; yes, normalization of low T may be offered per the AUA testosterone deficiency guideline, but it is not a general treatment for DE without hypogonadism, and expectations should be tempered [^115MLkSL]. Finally, I need to ensure I address comorbid ED, since treating ED can improve ejaculatory function in some men; guidelines recommend managing ED per the AUA ED guideline when present, which can meaningfully shift sexual performance and confidence even if DE-specific latency does not normalize [^113YuHf1].

> In summary, delayed ejaculation is best understood as a multifactorial disorder in which medication effects — particularly serotonergic agents — endocrine disturbances such as hypogonadism and hypothyroidism, neurogenic and vascular disease, and psychogenic or behavioral factors converge to raise the ejaculatory threshold or inhibit orgasm. Clinical manifestations range from prolonged latency to anejaculation or anorgasmia, with diagnosis requiring consistent symptoms and clinically significant distress, and prognosis depends on the ability to identify and modify underlying drivers, engage patients in behavioral therapy, and manage comorbidities, all in the absence of FDA-approved pharmacotherapies specific to DE [^115eeFm8] [^112sc9iJ] [^115NRtKA]. Hold on, I should verify that I've emphasized the key clinical takeaway: a meticulous history targeting medications, endocrine symptoms, neurologic and vascular risk, and psychosexual context, plus a focused physical exam and judicious labs when indicated, are the cornerstones of care and directly shape prognosis by revealing reversible causes and guiding therapy selection [^1126KMUw] [^1135TrSz].

Delayed ejaculation (DE) is defined as a **consistent, bothersome inability to ejaculate** or excessive latency despite adequate stimulation and desire [^117GW47M], with a median ejaculatory latency time (ELT) in Western men of 5–6 minutes [^114juzdA] and DE typically involving latencies beyond 25–30 minutes [^114juzdA]. The condition is **multifactorial**, involving psychological factors (anxiety, depression, relationship issues), medical comorbidities (diabetes, neuropathy, hypogonadism, thyroid dysfunction), medications (SSRIs, antipsychotics, beta-blockers), and lifestyle factors (alcohol, smoking, obesity) [^113YuHf1] [^113deLa8] [^112ZjZB3]. Clinical manifestations include prolonged or absent ejaculation, reduced sexual satisfaction, and significant distress or avoidance [^1175HrrJ]. Prognosis varies: **lifelong DE is often refractory**, whereas acquired DE may improve with treatment of underlying causes; overall, DE can cause substantial psychosexual distress and relationship strain, and management is individualized with limited evidence for pharmacotherapy [^112sc9iJ] [^115NRtKA].

---

## Pathophysiology

DE arises from **complex interactions** among psychological, neurological, endocrine, and pharmacological factors:

- **Psychological factors**: Anxiety, depression, performance anxiety, and relationship difficulties are common contributors [^115eeFm8] [^1175HrrJ].

- **Neurological factors**: Peripheral neuropathy, spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis can impair ejaculatory reflexes [^notfound].

- **Endocrine factors**: Hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, and thyroid dysfunction (especially hypothyroidism) are associated with DE [^112ZjZB3] [^1152RS9n].

- **Pharmacological factors**: SSRIs, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, and other medications can delay or inhibit ejaculation [^113deLa8] [^113Zucqm].

- **Lifestyle factors**: Alcohol use, smoking, and obesity negatively impact ejaculatory function [^notfound].

---

## Clinical manifestations

DE presents with **characteristic symptoms and signs**:

- **Prolonged ejaculatory latency**: Consistently delayed ejaculation or inability to ejaculate despite adequate stimulation [^114juzdA].

- **Reduced sexual satisfaction**: Decreased enjoyment and satisfaction with sexual activity [^1175HrrJ].

- **Distress and avoidance**: Significant psychological distress, anxiety, and avoidance of sexual activity [^1175HrrJ].

- **Relationship strain**: Communication difficulties and reduced intimacy with partners [^113U15LK].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors **increase the risk** of DE:

| **Category** | **Risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Psychological | - Anxiety <br/> - Depression <br/> - Performance anxiety <br/> - Relationship difficulties [^113YuHf1] [^1175HrrJ] |
| Medical | - Diabetes mellitus <br/> - Peripheral neuropathy <br/> - Hypogonadism <br/> - Hyperprolactinemia <br/> - Thyroid dysfunction [^113YuHf1] [^112ZjZB3] [^1152RS9n] |
| Pharmacological | - SSRIs <br/> - Antipsychotics <br/> - Beta-blockers <br/> - Antidepressants [^113deLa8] [^113Zucqm] |
| Lifestyle | - Alcohol use <br/> - Smoking <br/> - Obesity [^notfound] |

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with **etiology and treatment response**:

- **Lifelong DE**: Often refractory to treatment, requiring long-term management and counseling [^115NRtKA].

- **Acquired DE**: Prognosis improves with identification and treatment of underlying causes (e.g. medication adjustment, endocrine therapy, psychological counseling) [^113deLa8] [^115MLkSL] [^115NRtKA].

- **Psychological interventions**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy and sex therapy can improve sexual function and reduce distress [^notfound].

- **Pharmacological treatments**: Limited evidence supports the use of medications such as bupropion, cabergoline, or testosterone replacement in select cases [^112sc9iJ] [^115MLkSL].

- **Overall prognosis**: DE can significantly impact quality of life and relationships, but individualized management strategies can improve outcomes [^116jXf88].

Though early research suggested that thyroid hormones were not involved with the testes, male spermatogenesis, or erectile function, investigations on this topic over the past few decades have increased and shed new light. A literature review of studies conducted between 1963 and 2022 regarding male sexual dysfunction (SD) and thyroid disorders was performed to define the diagnostic consideration, pathophysiology, and management of SD secondary to thyroid dysregulation. This article provides evidence and interpretation of prior clinical and preclinical studies and contextualizes these studies for clinical practice. Clinical manifestations of SDs included erectile and ejaculatory dysfunction, impaired spermatogenesis, and disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Our aim of this communication was to perform a literature review detailing the impact of thyroid disorders on male SD. We hope to provide a framework for practicing urologists, endocrinologists, or general practitioners when evaluating patients with concurrent thyroid and male SD. It is important to recognize that thyroid disorders can be an important part of the pathophysiology of male SD in patients. Future research studies are needed to further elucidate the mechanisms involved.

Premature ejaculation (PE) — PE refers to short ejaculatory latency, lack of control over delaying ejaculation, and personal distress; "lifelong PE" is characterized by ejaculation that occurs within 1 minute of vaginal penetration, and in "acquired PE" latency may be up to 3 minutes. Using this definition, the prevalence of PE has been estimated to be between 5% and 30%. Treatment options include over-the-counter lidocaine-based topical agents aimed at treating penile hypersensitivity and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that have been successful in treating PE by activating the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptor and readjusting the ejaculatory threshold set point; the role of sexual therapy employing cognitive and behavioral techniques is emphasized, and involving the partner with open communication may yield greater relationship benefits.

2 Understanding ED in Diabetes Mellitus: Epidemiology, Pathophysiology and Treatment

A comprehensive understanding of ED in diabetes requires an examination of its epidemiological patterns, physiological basis and the unique pathophysiological changes induced by hyperglycaemia.

2.1 Epidemiology and Risk Factors of ED in Diabetes Mellitus

Men with DM have a significantly higher risk of ED compared to men without diabetes. A study by Corona et al. reported prevalence rates of 19.4%, 15.4%, 10.4% and 21.6% for mild, mild‐to‐moderate, moderate and severe ED, respectively, in men with DM. The severity of ED is influenced by the type and duration of DM, treatment regimens and coexisting conditions. Fedele et al. in a study of a large population of men with DM, found a 26% prevalence of ED in men with T1DM and a 37% prevalence in men with T2DM. Similarly, a meta‐analysis by Kouidrat et al. reported an overall ED prevalence of 52.5% in men with DM, with 37.5% in men with T1DM and 66.3% in men with T2DM.

The primary risk factors for ED include age, DM, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity, metabolic syndrome, hyperhomocysteinaemia, physical inactivity and smoking. ED is also linked to pharmacological treatments for CVDs. Thiazide diuretics and most beta‐blockers (with the exception of nebivolol) may increase the risk, whereas angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium channel blockers have demonstrated neutral or potentially beneficial effects. Psychotropic medications, including antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and tricyclics) and antipsychotics, also increase ED risk. Other contributing factors include atrial fibrillation, hyperthyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, hyperuricaemia, folate deficiency, depression, anxiety, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and rheumatic diseases. ED often co‐occurs with other urological conditions, such as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a history of prostate surgery, chronic prostatitis, chronic pelvic pain syndrome, painful bladder syndrome, premature ejaculation and surgical urethroplasty for posterior urethral strictures.

2.2 Physiology of Erection and Detumescence

Penile erection is a complex physiological process integrating neurological, vascular and endocrine factors. It involves arterial dilation, relaxation of trabecular smooth muscle and activation of the corporeal veno‐occlusive mechanism.

### Disorders of orgasm and ejaculation in men [^116sUU1H]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ejaculatory/orgasmic disorders are common male sexual dysfunctions, and include premature ejaculation (PE), inhibited ejaculation, anejaculation, retrograde ejaculation, and anorgasmia.

Aim

To provide recommendations and guidelines concerning current state-of-the-art knowledge for management of ejaculation/orgasmic disorders in men.

Methods

An international consultation in collaboration with the major urology and sexual medicine associations assembled over 200 multidisciplinary experts from 60 countries into 25 committees. Committee members established specific objectives and scopes for various male and female sexual medicine topics. The recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge of disorders of orgasm and ejaculation represent the opinion of seven experts from seven countries developed in a process over a 2-year period.

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinion was based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation and debate.

Results

Premature ejaculation management is largely dependent upon etiology. Lifelong PE is best managed with PE pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor [SSRI] and/or topical anesthetics). The management of acquired PE is etiology specific and may include erectile dysfunction (ED) pharmacotherapy in men with comorbid ED. Behavioral therapy is indicated when psychogenic or relationship factors are present and is often best combined with PE pharmacotherapy in an integrated treatment program. Retrograde ejaculation is managed by education, patient reassurance, pharmacotherapy, or bladder neck reconstruction. Delayed ejaculation, anejaculation, and/or anorgasmia may have a biogenic and/or psychogenic atiology. Men with age-related penile hypoanesthesia should be educated, reassured, and instructed in revised sexual techniques which maximize arousal.

Conclusions

Additional research is required to further the understanding of the disorders of ejaculation and orgasm.

### A conceptual approach to understanding and managing men's orgasmic difficulties [^113U15LK]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Premature ejaculation (PE) and delayed/inhibited ejaculation (DE) are 2 ejaculatory problems that may negatively affect the sexual relationship and cause distress. Although no specific cause explains these problems when they have been lifelong conditions, understanding both biological and psychological factors may be relevant to treatment choices, with options ranging from pharmacologic to psychobehavioral. Integrating treatment modalities may lead to better outcomes but may also require greater psychological and resource investment from the patient or couple.

### Lack of awareness of erectile dysfunction in many men with risk factors for erectile dysfunction [^111txvBh]. BMC Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Erectile dysfunction affects quality of life and may be associated with depression. Men with erectile dysfunction often have other comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Conversely, men consulting with their physician for comorbidities or other risk factors for erectile dysfunction may also have underlying erectile dysfunction, which may or may not be recognized.

Erectile dysfunction is defined as the inability to attain or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. However, men who experience a change in their ability to achieve an erection might not immediately recognize that erectile dysfunction is the problem. The quality of men's erections deteriorates gradually over time. Consequently, men may be uncertain whether their erectile difficulties are permanent or temporary and may wait to see if the erectile dysfunction resolves on its own. Alternatively, the stigma or embarrassment of having erectile dysfunction symptoms may lead to denial of the problem.

We hypothesized that men with comorbidities and risk factors associated with erectile dysfunction frequently have this condition but might deny it and not identify themselves as erectile dysfunction sufferers. The current report discusses the design and outcome of a screening strategy for men with erectile dysfunction-associated comorbidities and risk factors who do not self-identify as having erectile dysfunction. The objective was to create a profile of these men by describing the general characteristics (demographics, comorbidities, and risk factors) of men who answered the question, "Do you have erectile dysfunction?" with "yes", "no", or "unsure" responses. Such information is needed in order to allow formulation of strategies to identify previously unrecognized or undiagnosed erectile dysfunction in order that it may be addressed as a medical condition.

### Disorders of orgasm and ejaculation in men [^112XA2Kx]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ejaculatory/orgasmic disorders, common male sexual dysfunctions, include premature ejaculation, inhibited ejaculation, anejaculation, retrograde ejaculation and anorgasmia.

Aim

To provide recommendations/guidelines concerning state-of-the-art knowledge for management of ejaculation/orgasmic disorders in men.

Methods

An International Consultation in collaboration with the major urology and sexual medicine associations assembled over 200 multidisciplinary experts from 60 countries into 17 committees. Committee members established specific objectives and scopes for various male and female sexual medicine topics. The recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge in the respective sexual medicine topic represent the opinion of experts from five continents developed in a process over a 2-year period. Concerning the Disorders of Ejaculation/Orgasm in Men Committee, there were nine experts from six countries.

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinion was based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation and debate.

Results

Premature ejaculation management is dependent upon etiology. When secondary to ED, etiology-specific treatment is employed. When lifelong, initial pharmacotherapy (SSRI, topical anesthesia, PDE5 inhibitors) is appropriate. When associated with psychogenic/relationship factors, behavioral therapy is indicated. When acquired, pharmacotherapy and/or behavioral therapies are preferred. Retrograde ejaculation, diagnosed with spermatozoa and fructose in centrifuged post-ejaculatory voided urine, is managed by education, patient reassurance, pharmacotherapy or bladder neck reconstruction. Men with anejaculation or anorgasmia have a biologic failure of emission and/or psychogenic inhibited ejaculation. Men with age-related penile hypoanesthesia should be educated, reassured and be instructed in revised sexual techniques which maximize arousal.

Conclusions

More research is needed in understanding management of men with ejaculation/orgasmic dysfunction.

### Premature ejaculation: definition and prevalence [^113YZNEt]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2006). Low credibility.

Premature ejaculation (PE) is likely the most common sexual dysfunction in men, with a worldwide prevalence of approximately 30%. To date, the lack of a universally acknowledged definition of PE has complicated the examination and analysis of PE in clinical and research-related settings. The impact of PE on men and their partners also needs to be clearly defined. Clearly, a better understanding of the epidemiology of this disorder, especially with regard to prevalence and risk factors, is necessary. The prevalence of PE appears to vary across socio-cultural and geographic populations. The elucidation of the etiology of PE and risk factors associated with PE has been difficult. However, several risk factors for PE exist that have strong support in the literature. Clearly, an improved and universal definition and understanding of PE and its epidemiology will improve the clinical management of PE and the success of future epidemiologic studies and clinical trials.

### Male delayed orgasm and anorgasmia: a practical guide for sexual medicine providers [^115sZW6S]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 defines DE as an inability to achieve ejaculation or an excessive or increased latency of ejaculation, despite adequate sexual stimulation and the desire to ejaculate. The ICD-11 defines AO as "the absence or marked infrequency of the orgasm experience or markedly diminished intensity of orgasmic sensations", though states that AO in men would be encompassed in the diagnosis of DE. For both DO and AO, these patterns of orgasmic dysfunction have occurred episodically or persistently over a period of at least several months and is associated with clinically significant distress. AO is often considered to be the most extreme presentation of DO and thus has similar etiology and treatment options.

DO can also be further categorized as lifelong/primary (present since first sexual encounter) versus acquired/secondary (prior normal orgasm able to be achieved) and generalized (always present) versus situational (only present due to certain stimuli, with certain partners, or in certain situations). The Third International Consultation on Sexual Medicine defines the time threshold for DO based on studies examining mean intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT; defined as the time between the start of vaginal intromission and the start of intravaginal ejaculation). Waldinger et al. measured stopwatch-assessed IELT among men from the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Spain, Turkey, and the United States and determined that median IELT is 5.4 min (range: 0.55–44.1 min). Thus, it has been extrapolated that IELT for DO would be 2 standard deviations above, equivalent to an estimated 20–25 min.

### Premature ejaculation among men with erectile dysfunction-findings from a real-life cross-sectional study [^115hL1nc]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Concomitant sexual disorders have progressively shown increased prevalence in men at first outpatient presentation. We sought to i) estimate the prevalence of unreported premature ejaculation (PE) in a homogenous cohort of 1258 men seeking first medical help for erectile dysfunction (ED) as their primary compliant; ii) compare the baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of men with only ED(ED-only) compared to those with ED and PE(ED+PE); and, iii) investigate the likelihood of detecting PE among men self-reporting only ED over a 16-year period at a single tertiary-referral centre. Descriptive statistics compared sociodemographic and clinical characteristics between ED-only patients and those with unreported concomitant primary/secondary PE(ED+PE). Logistic regression models predicted the risk of having ED+PE at baseline. Local polynomial regression models graphically explored the probability of reporting PE among ED men with ≤ 40 vs. 41–60 vs. > 60 years over the analysed timeframe. Of all, 932 (74.1%) were ED-only and 326 (25.9%) ED+PE patients, respectively. ED+PE patients were younger, presented with fewer comorbidities, and lower rates of severe ED (all p ≤ 0.04). At multivariable logistic regression analysis, younger age (OR:0.98) and low sexual desire/interest (OR:1.54) were independently associated with ED+PE at first clinical assessment (all p = 0.03). The likelihood of detecting unreported concomitant primary/secondary PE among patients complaining of only ED at first presentation worrisomely increased among younger and middle-aged men over the last 16 years.

Medications

The most common medications implicated in the pathogenesis of DO include antidepressants and antipsychotics (Table 1). The underlying mechanism of SSRI-induced DO is that serotoninergic inputs from the dorsal raphe nucleus stimulate PRL-releasing factors in the paraventricular nucleus, resulting in hyperprolactinemia and subsequent suppression of T production as described above. Furthermore, SSRIs are associated with a twofold risk of lower libido. The rate of orgasmic dysfunction at 8 weeks following initiation of antidepressant therapy are as follows: escitalopram (30%), bupropion (15%), placebo (9%).

Medications associated with delayed orgasm or anorgasmia.

SSRI Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, SNRI Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, TCA Tricyclic antidepressant, MAO I Monoamine oxidase inhibitor, DO Delayed Orgasm, AO Anorgasmia.

Psychogenic

Psychogenic DO results from feelings of fear, anxiety, hostility, relationship difficulties associated with sexual intercourse and encounters. Common triggers include childhood sexual abuse, sexual trauma, repressive sexual education or religious beliefs, general anxiety, and history of being widowed or divorced.

One specific scenario that has been studied in patients with situational DO is timed intercourse for fertility treatment. Byun et al. demonstrated a 42.8% (n = 188) and 5.92% (n = 26) rate of ED and DO respectively among 439 men undergoing timed intercourse. The Beck Anxiety Inventory, a standardized measure of anxiety level, was significantly higher among men with DO (p < 0.001).

Penile hyperstimulation and sensation loss

Hyperstimulation of the penis is another factor that has been identified to contribute to DO. DO is significantly associated with higher masturbatory activity, decreased nighttime emissions, lower orgasm and intercourse satisfaction scores on the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). It is postulated that increased frequency of masturbation results in penile sensation loss which cascades into further increase of masturbation force. Consequently, this cycle results in DO during vaginal intercourse or orogenital stimulation as these processes are not able to replicate the necessary stimulation. Penile sensation loss has also been associated with increasing age.

Male sexual dysfunctions, including erectile dysfunction, hypoactive sexual desire disorder, premature ejaculation, and delayed ejaculation, are a complex amalgam of interrelated biological, psychological, and contextual variables that can combine to produce distressing symptoms both for the male diagnosed with the dysfunction and for his partner. This article describes the assessment process for identifying the psychological concerns associated with the man's sexual complaint, and presents a stepwise algorithm for treating mild to moderate psychosocial issues. Physicians' awareness of psychological and interpersonal issues will help them better manage patients' ongoing medical treatment and limit discontinuation of efficacious therapies.

### Zinner syndrome and infertility ─ a literature review based on a clinical case [^111o7Acj]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, further studies are needed to identify the pathomechanism of infertility in patients with ZS. Because of the high rate of infertility associated with ZS, affected patients should be examined regarding their fertility status.

Clinical presentation

ZS usually remains asymptomatic for a long time. Symptoms tend to only manifest at the start of intensive sexual activity. Literature reports describe a period between the 2nd and 4th decade of life but also an increasingly earlier onset of symptoms in puberty in recent years.

Clinical symptoms are often unspecific and frequently pain-related such as abdominal, pelvic, perineal, or scrotal pain particularly during defecation or ejaculation. Lower urinary tract symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, and urgency have also been reported as well as epididymitis, prostatitis, and recurrent urinary tract infections.

Infertility is usually diagnosed in adulthood in the context of the unfulfilled desire to have children. Because ZS seems to have a high impact on fertility, a semen analysis should be conducted when an adolescent patient with ZS reaches adulthood.

### Prevalence, characteristics and implications of premature ejaculation / rapid ejaculation [^116vpWGX]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Premature ejaculation/rapid ejaculation is a common but incompletely understood male sexual dysfunction. The purposes of this review are to 1) raise awareness of the prevalence and characteristics of PE/RE, its impact on the male and his partner, and the lack of approved medications indicated for its treatment, 2) encourage dialogue about PE/RE between physicians and patients, and 3) stimulate the development of appropriate new therapies.

Materials and Methods

A MEDLINE search was performed to retrieve articles relating to PE/RE pathophysiology, etiology, impact, diagnosis and treatment. Sexual medicine journals not indexed in MEDLINE, sexual medicine texts and congress abstracts were also reviewed.

Results

No universally accepted definition, licensed treatment, validated screening instrument or diagnostic criteria have been established for PE/RE, and its pathophysiology and etiology are incompletely understood. Additional barriers are the reluctance of patients and physicians to talk about PE/RE and the lack of knowledge regarding available treatments. Current pharmacological treatments include off label uses of antidepressants, topical anesthetics or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. All are associated with drawbacks that limit their efficacy. Psychological counseling and behavioral therapy have a valuable role, although resources for this modality are limited.

Conclusions

Prevalence rates of 20% to 30% and negative effects on the quality of life of men and their partners illustrate the need for improved, standardized methods of PE/RE diagnosis, assessment and treatment. Medications indicated specifically for PE/RE and effective on an as needed basis are required. Behavioral therapies should emphasize pleasure, arousal, control, confidence and satisfaction, and they may have the best success when coupled with pharmacological approaches.

### Pathophysiology of premature ejaculation [^113GU8Gf]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although the characteristics of premature ejaculation (PE) are established, the exact aetiology is largely unknown. Genetic, neurobiological, pharmacological, psychological, urological and endocrine factors have all been proposed. In addition PE and erectile dysfunction are often co-morbid.

Aim

This article provides an overview of the proposed biological and psychological aetiologies of PE.

Methods

Review of the literature.

Main Outcome Measures

Current data on the pathophysiology of PE.

Results

This review shows that most of the proposed biological and psychological aetiologies of PE are not evidence-based and/or that attempts to confirm them have given conflicting results. There are good data to support roles for genetic and psychological factors, either causal, or secondary to PE for the latter, in lifelong PE. Conversely, more evidence-based data support the responsibility of opioid substance withdrawal, prostatic inflammation or hyperthyroidism in some cases of acquired PE, in addition to a probable role of psychological factors.

Conclusions

The determinants of PE are certainly complex and multifactorial, while each partner's reaction to the frustration caused by the sexual dysfunction may exacerbate or perpetuate it. It is important to understand, as far as possible, the aetiology in the individual patient to ensure appropriate assessment and treatment. It should be noted that identification of an aetiological factor does not necessarily mean the cause of the PE has been completely explained, and the patient may require a combination of treatment approaches.

### Considerations for a better definition of male orgasmic disorder in DSM V [^1153yk3o]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

All of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Ed., text revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for sexual disorders have been criticized on multiple grounds, including that the criteria lack precision, that the requirement of marked distress is inappropriate, and that the specification of etiological subtypes should be deleted.

Aim

The goal of this article is to review evidence relevant to diagnostic criteria for male orgasmic disorder published since 1990.

Methods

Medline searches from 1990 forward were conducted using the terms male orgasmic disorder, anorgasmia, delayed ejaculation, retarded ejaculation, ejaculatory delay, and ejaculatory disorder. Early drafts of proposed alterations in diagnostic criteria were submitted to advisors.

Main Outcome Measure

Evidence reviewed was judged by current usage of terminology, evidence allowing precise definition of the syndrome, and evidence concerning separation of the syndrome from distress.

Results

The literature search indicated minimal use of the term male orgasmic disorder and minimal knowledge concerning psychogenic ejaculatory problems.

Conclusions

It is recommended that the term male orgasmic disorder be replaced with the term delayed ejaculation. Duration and severity criteria are recommended. Since many ejaculatory problems are idiopathic, it is recommended that the etiological subtypes due to psychological or due to combined factors be eliminated.

### Evaluation of premature ejaculation [^117AVkSA]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Premature ejaculation (PE) is a prevalent, yet often underdiagnosed, sexual disorder that affects men of all ages. Identification of PE is hampered by stigma and embarrassment associated with the condition, and limited awareness that it is treatable. Because diagnosis informs treatment decisions that have an impact on clinical outcomes, the ability to diagnose PE accurately is vital to the successful management of this condition.

Aim

Provide an overview of how to evaluate and diagnose PE.

Methods

Review of the literature.

Main Outcome Measures

The taxonomy of PE based on onset, time, type, and comorbidities.

Results

Diagnosis of PE encompasses seven key steps: (i) Obtaining the patient's general medical and sexual history; (ii) Classifying the symptom on the basis of onset (e.g., lifelong or acquired PE), timing (e.g., prior to or during intercourse), and type (e.g., absolute/generalized or relative/situational); (iii) Involving the partner to determine their view of the situation and the impact of PE on the couple as a whole; (iv) Identifying sexual comorbidities (e.g., erectile dysfunction) to define whether PE is simple (occurring in the absence of other sexual dysfunctions) or complicated (occurring in the presence of other sexual dysfunctions); (v) Performing physical examination to check the man's sexual organs and reflexes; (vi) Identifying underlying etiologies and risk factors (e.g., endocrine-, urological-, or psychorelational-/psychosexual-related) to determine the primary cause of PE and any associated comorbidities; (vii) Discussing treatment options to find the most suitable intervention, according to the needs of the man and his partner.

Conclusion

A greater understanding of how to diagnose PE correctly, and a more widespread use of a structured diagnostic approach, could lead to better treatment outcomes in the future.

### Paroxetine in the treatment of premature ejaculation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112rS38Z]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Premature ejaculation (PE) is recognized as one of the most common diseases of sexual dysfunction, affecting approximately 20–30% of men. It has been proved that PE can influence the quality of intercourse, resulting in distress and anxiety and even impacting the relationships between partners. While the aetiology of PE remains controversial, it is increasingly becoming recognized that psychological problems, somatic disorders and/or neurobiological disturbances, and polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter or its promoters frequently co-occur in the same individual. However, other potential aetiologic factors, including depression, erectile dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, chronic prostatitis and thyroid dysfunction, have been definitely established as causative in PE.

According to the new International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM) guidelines, PE is defined as "ejaculation that always occurs after less than 1 minute of vaginal penetration from the first sexual experience (lifelong PE), or a clinically significant and bothersome reduction in latency time, often ≤ 3 minutes (acquired PE), and the inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal penetrations, and negative personal consequences, such as distress, frustration and/or the avoidance of sexual intimacy". Therefore, we use intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) to evaluate the endpoint of PE.

Over the past few decades, many feasible therapies have been explored by andrologists, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), topical anaesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, PDE5Is, α-receptor blockers and surgery. Although, many of them have been reported to be useful for PE with well-tolerated side effects, none of them has been approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) except for dapoxetine. Paroxetine is one of the SSRIs, which increase the amount of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in postsynaptic membrane receptors and thus delay ejaculation. Although it is not approved by the FDA, it has the advantage of lower dropouts and cost, with almost identical effects to dapoxetine. Recently, there have been numerous high-quality randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing paroxetine with other therapeutic options for the treatment of PE. To our knowledge, this study is the first meta-analysis to report on the efficacy and safety of paroxetine in the treatment of PE. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to review the efficacy and safety of paroxetine for PE patients.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^113goj3z]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical signs and symptoms — adult-onset hypogonadism: Adult-onset hypogonadism is an often overlooked condition because hypogonadal men often ignore their symptoms, and the clinical signs and symptoms are variable and nonspecific with a gradual onset and slow progression. Because T influences all steps of the male sexual response cycle, sexual dysfunction is common and can be the presenting symptom; symptoms may include hypoactive sexual desire, reduced nocturnal and morning erections, reduced sex-induced erections, delayed ejaculation, and reduced semen volume. The clinical practice guidelines of the Endocrine Society and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists as well as other authors suggest that physicians should measure the T levels of men with any of the symptoms and signs given in Table 2. The physical examination may not be helpful in making an AOH diagnosis.

### Serotonin and premature ejaculation: from physiology to patient management [^1125tuLz]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Premature ejaculation (PE), whose pathophysiology is still not clearly identified, is the most common male sexual dysfunction, yet it remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. The aims of this paper are to provide a scientific and pharmacologic rationale, and to discuss to what extent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can help patients with PE.

Materials and Methods

A comprehensive evaluation of available published data included analysis of published full-length papers that were identified with Medline and Cancerlit from January 1981 to January 2006. Official proceedings of internationally known scientific societies held in the same time period were also assessed.

Results

The central ejaculatory neural circuit comprises spinal and cerebral areas that form a highly interconnected network. The sympathetic, parasympathetic, and somatic spinal centers, under the influence of sensory genital and cerebral stimuli integrated and processed at the spinal cord level, act in synergy to command physiologic events occurring during ejaculation. Experimental evidence indicates that serotonin (5-HT), throughout brain descending pathways, exerts an inhibitory role on ejaculation. To date, three 5-HT receptor subtypes (5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2C) have been postulated to mediate 5-HT's modulating activity on ejaculation. Pharmacologic manipulation of the serotonergic system has been performed in rats, with the antidepressant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) exhibiting the greatest efficacy in delaying ejaculation. The mechanism of action by which SSRIs modulate central 5-HT tone has been studied in depth, but gaps in this knowledge prevent an explanation of the efficacy of acute treatment in delaying ejaculation. Emerging clinical evidence indicates chronic and on-demand dosing of SSRIs has a beneficial effect for the treatment of men with PE, at least for paroxetine. On-demand dapoxetine, and SSRI with a short half-life, recently has been shown to significantly increase intravaginal latency time and PE patient-related outcomes in phase 3 clinical trials.

Conclusions

Nowadays there is no doubt that PE can be treated effectively by SSRIs. Nevertheless their mechanism of action is not yet well understood and deserves more research. In particular it is not understood why all the SSRIs are not equal in terms of their ability to delay ejaculation. Therefore, there is a need for more research to better characterize the mechanism of action of SSRIs as well their clinical benefit in patients affected by PE.

### Etiology of ejaculation and pathophysiology of premature ejaculation [^1178Xk7m]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ejaculation is comprised of three stages of the male sexual response cycle, namely emission, ejection, and orgasm; however, in comparison with erection, which is a well-understood component of male sexual response, the pathophysiology of ejaculation has yet to be fully delineated. Premature ejaculation (PE), the most common sexual disorder in men, while believed to have a multifactorial etiology, is even less well understood.

Aim

This article reviews the physiology of ejaculation, and the multifactorial pathophysiology of PE.

Methods

The Sexual Medicine Society of North America hosted a State of the Art Conference on Premature Ejaculation on June 24–26, 2005 in collaboration with the University of South Florida. The purpose was to have an open exchange of contemporary research and clinical information on PE. There were 16 invited presenters and discussants; the group focused on several educational objectives.

Main Outcome Measure

Data were obtained by extensive examination of published peer-reviewed literature.

Results

Evidence supports that biologic mechanisms associated with neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, serotonin, oxytocin, Gamma-amino-butyric acid, and nitric oxide (NO) as well as the hormone estrogen play central roles in ejaculation, and subsequently may mediate PE. There is also emerging evidence to show that hyperthyroidism may be a causal factor in PE. Recent data also suggest that psychogenic factors include high level of any experience by some men with PE.

Conclusions

The pathophysiology of both lifelong and acquired PE appears to be both neurobiogenic and psychogenic. While psychogenic factors appear to be contributory to PE, pharmacologic intervention of PE can modify intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), which suggests that IELT is a biological variable, and is likely biologically dependent upon neurotransmitters and hormones.

Information concerning the epidemiology, etiology and treatment of premature (rapid) ejaculation is reviewed. Evidence concerning the prevalence of premature ejaculation indicates that subjective concern about rapid ejaculation is a common concern worldwide. Hypotheses concerning the pathogenesis of premature ejaculation include: (1) that it is a learned pattern of ejaculation maintained by interpersonal anxiety, (2) that it is the result of dysfunction in central or peripheral mechanisms regulating ejaculatory thresholds and (3) that it is a normal variant in ejaculatory latency. Current evidence based treatment interventions include behavioral psychotherapy and the use of pharmacological agents, including topical anesthetic agents and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

### Premature ejaculation: state of the art [^111MhvPQ]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Premature ejaculation (PE) is a frequent male sexual complaint. This occurrence does not automatically imply the existence of a male sexual disorder. The current DSM definition of PE has a low positive predictive value with a high associated risk for false-positive diagnoses of PE. A new classification in four well-defined PE syndromes has recently been proposed for the pending DSM-V. According to this new classification there are different pathophysiologies and treatments of PE, dependent on the underlying PE syndrome. Some types are particularly neurobiologically or medically determined and need drug treatment; other types, which are mainly psychologically determined, need psychotherapy or both drug treatment and psychotherapy. A meta-analysis of all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and clomipramine studies, which were performed according to current standards of evidence-based medicine, demonstrated a similar efficacy for the daily treatment with the serotonergic antidepressants paroxetine hemihydrate, clomipramine, sertraline, and fluoxetine, with paroxetine hemihydrate exerting the strongest effect on ejaculation. On-demand treatment with SSRIs generally exerts much less ejaculation delay than daily SSRI treatment. Other on-demand treatment options are the topical use of anesthetics, tramadol, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Caution is needed with tramadol with regard to its potential addictive properties. There is insufficient evidence for the ejaculation delaying effects of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and intracavernous injection of vasoactive drugs.

### Sertraline hydrochloride (Zoloft) [^1129W1Ld]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.11	Sexual Dysfunction

Use of SSRIs, including ZOLOFT, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm.

It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of ZOLOFT and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder.

### Evidence for a genetic etiology to ejaculatory dysfunction [^116Y34QJ]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2008). Low credibility.

A number of theoretical approaches to understanding the etiology of ejaculatory dysfunction have been proposed, but no study has yet found conclusive evidence that premature (PE) or delayed (DE) ejaculation is under genetic control. We conducted twin model fitting analyses on different indicator variables of ejaculatory function on a population-based sample of 3946 twins and their siblings (age 18–48; mean = 29.9 years) to investigate genetic, shared environmental and unique environmental effects on PE and DE. A significant moderate genetic effect (28%) was found for PE. No clear-cut familial effect could be detected for DE. Significant associations between ejaculatory function and age were detected, but effects of age were generally very weak. The findings from the present study provide useful information regarding the etiology and understanding of ejaculatory dysfunction.

### Common questions about chronic prostatitis… [^116ExmNs]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

What Are the Known Risk Factors for Chronic Prostatitis. Conditions that allow retrograde movement of bacteria into the urethra and the prostate are risk factors for CBP. Patients with a history of urethritis caused by sexually transmitted infections are thought to be at risk of subsequent CBP. Risk factors for CNP/CPPS are largely unknown but may include conditions that can lead to chronic neuropathic pain. EVIDENCE SUMMARY CBP is thought to be caused by infection moving from the distal urethra to the prostate. Facilitating factors are the presence of foreskin, urethral stricture, benign prostatic hyperplasia, history of STI, recent instrumentation or catheterization, and retrograde ejaculation. 6 The specific pathophysiology of CNP/CPPS is poorly understood.

Recent research suggests that some insult to the prostate may trigger central pain sensitization leading to persistent neuropathic pain, which is similar to other chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and endometriosis.
8. EVIDENCE SUMMARY Pain occurs with CBP and CNP/CPPS. The pain may present in the lower back, hypogastrium, pelvis, or genitalia. The patient may also report pain with urination or ejaculation, and lower urinary tract symptoms related to voiding or storage problems. Other symptoms may include sexual dysfunction and psychosocial symptoms, such as anxiety, stress, and depression. EVIDENCE SUMMARY The Prostatitis Expert Reference Group recommends referral for possibly serious conditions.

Hematuria, prostate nodules, or elevated PSA levels suggest cancer; severe dysuria suggests another diagnosis; and a positive result on pre-massage culture suggests an anatomic pathology. These patients should be referred to a urologist for further diagnosis and treatment. 3 Failure of medical therapy is described as persistent symptoms after two four- to six-week courses of antibiotics, with or without an alpha blocker, in patients with CBP, and persistent symptoms after one four- to six-week course of an alpha blocker combined with an antibiotic in patients with CNP/CPPS. Recent European guidelines suggest referral to a multidisciplinary team, although there are no published studies to support this approach.

### Premature ejaculation: the current literature [^115Dm89P]. Current Opinion in Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The recent increase in research with regard to premature ejaculation has led to a significant number of new papers looking at the diagnosis, definition, aetiology and management of this condition.

Recent Findings

The intravaginal ejaculatory latency time remains the primary measure of ejaculatory time although increasing bother and distress require assessment and establishment of quantifiable measures. Biological and psychogenic causes contribute to a multifactorial model of premature ejaculation with some neurobiological vulnerability. The principal treatments are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and behavioural cognitive interventions. New treatment interventions are under investigation.

Summary

A number of guideline papers confirm that a primary sexual history and a multimodel treatment approach provide the best approach to patients with this common condition.

### Can we consider erectile dysfunction as an early marker of Cardiovascular disease? [^112YTjdW]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to achieve or maintain an erection that is sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. This problem affects a considerable proportion of men at least occasionally, and it is estimated that around 52% of men experience some form of ED with an increase from about 5 to 15 percent between ages 40 and 70 years. Although it is not a lethal condition, the interest surrounding ED and its remedies has been constant and present in history since the 15th century when Leonardo da Vinci described the increase in blood flow in the penis as a cause of erection. The causes of ED are classified into 2 main categories: psychogenic and organic causes, the last representing 80% of the total. Organic causes can be broadly divided into nonendocrine and endocrine. Among the nonendocrine etiologies, the vasculogenic (affecting blood supply) is the most common and can involve arterial inflow disorders and abnormalities of venous outflow (corporeal veno-occlusion); there are also neurogenic (affecting innervation and nervous function) and iatrogenic (relating to a medical or surgical treatment) etiologies. Among endocrine factors leading to ED, reduced serum testosterone levels have been implicated, but the exact mechanism has not been fully elucidated.

The incidence of ED increases with age, passing from 20 to 40% in men 60 to 69 years to 50 to 100% in men 70 to 80 years, depending on the differing definitions of ED in various studies. In addition to age, cardiovascular (CV) risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity, and dyslipidemia are significantly associated with ED, and this has led over time to hypothesize a close link between ED and CV disease. The interaction between androgens, chronic inflammation, and CV risk factors can determine endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, resulting in disorders of penile and coronary circulation. Evidence demonstrated that ED and vascular diseases share a similar pathogenic involvement of nitric oxide pathway leading to impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (early phase) and structural vascular abnormalities (late phase).

The smaller size of penile artery size compared with coronary arteries may explain why the same level of endothelial dysfunction can cause a more significant reduction of blood flow in erectile tissues compared with that in coronary circulation. Nowadays, the correlation between ED and CV disease has been widely demonstrated, and ED often precedes CV events and can be used as an early marker to identify men at high risk of major CV disease.

Methodology

In this narrative review, the PubMed database was used to identify articles using the search terms: male sexual dysfunction, male delayed orgasm, delayed ejaculation, anorgasmia, male orgasm, ejaculation. There was no limitation on date range. Clinical trials, case studies, abstracts, review articles, and questionnaire-based surveys were included. Only studies published in English were considered.

### Sertraline [^112HiF8D]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.11 Sexual Dsyfunction

Use of SSRIs, including sertraline hydrochloride tablets, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm.

It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of sertraline hydrochloride tablets and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment

### Epidemiology / risk factors of sexual dysfunction [^116wJiuy]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

Accurate estimates of prevalence/incidence are important in understanding the true burden of male and female sexual dysfunction and in identifying risk factors for prevention efforts.

Aim

To provide recommendations/guidelines concerning state-of-the-art knowledge for the epidemiology/risk factors of sexual dysfunctions in men and women.

Methods

An International Consultation in collaboration with the major urology and sexual medicine associations assembled over 200 multidisciplinary experts from 60 countries into 17 committees. Committee members established specific objectives and scopes for various male and female sexual medicine topics. The recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge in the respective sexual medicine topic represent the opinion of experts from five continents developed in a process over a 2-year period. Concerning the Epidemiology/Risk Factors Committee, there were seven experts from four countries.

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinion was based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation and debate.

Results

Standard definitions of male and female sexual dysfunctions are needed. The incidence rate for erectile dysfunction is 25–30 cases per thousand person years and increases with age. There are no parallel data for women's sexual dysfunctions. The prevalence of sexual dysfunction increases as men and women age; about 40–45% of adult women and 20–30% of adult men have at least one manifest sexual dysfunction. Common risk factor categories associated with sexual dysfunction exist for men and women including: individual general health status, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, other genitourinary disease, psychiatric/psychological disorders, other chronic diseases, and socio-demographic conditions. Endothelial dysfunction is a condition present in many cases of erectile dysfunction and there are common etiological pathways for other vascular disease states. Increasing physical activity lowers incidence of ED in males who initiate follow-up in their middle ages.

Conclusions

There is a need for more epidemiologic research in male and female sexual dysfunction.

### Male delayed orgasm and anorgasmia: a practical guide for sexual medicine providers [^114WnagS]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Male sexual function involves complex interactions among psychosocial, neurogenic, vascular, and endocrine factors that contribute to initiation of erection culminating in ejaculation and orgasm. Male sexual dysfunction occurs with disruption of any of these processes and encompasses decreased libido, erectile dysfunction (ED), ejaculation disorders, and orgasmic dysfunction. ED receives the most attention and concordantly is the most well-studied and understood by patients and providers. Compared to ED where reliable and well-studied treatments are available, there remains a paucity of standardized treatments for men with ejaculatory and/or orgasmic dysfunction. There are extensive well-studied treatments for ED including multiple phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, vacuum devices, self-injectable drugs, and penile prosthesis; meanwhile, there are no FDA approved pharmacotherapies or invasive non-pharmacological interventions approved for delayed orgasm (DO). However, orgasm and ejaculation represent fundamental aspects of male sexual function, and ejaculatory and orgasmic dysfunction are highly prevalent and tremendously impact on quality of life.

Male orgasmic dysfunction can be dichotomized as two ends of a spectrum: premature ejaculation (PE) versus DO and anorgasmia (AO). Though ejaculation and orgasm are distinct events, they occur simultaneously in men and often are used interchangeably in the literature when discussing delayed ejaculation (DE) vs. DO. In this review, we specifically focus on summarizing the current knowledge regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of DO/AO. Recently, the American Urological Association (AUA) released the Disorders of Ejaculation guidelines that we will also highlight.

### International Society for Sexual Medicine's guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of premature ejaculation [^113sZx6A]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over the past 20 years our knowledge of premature ejaculation (PE) has significantly advanced. Specifically, we have witnessed substantial progress in understanding the physiology of ejaculation, clarifying the real prevalence of PE in population-based studies, reconceptualizing the definition and diagnostic criterion of the disorder, assessing the psychosocial impact on patients and partners, designing validated diagnostic and outcome measures, proposing new pharmacologic strategies and examining the efficacy, safety and satisfaction of these new and established therapies. Given the abundance of high level research it seemed like an opportune time for the International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM) to promulgate an evidenced-based, comprehensive and practical set of clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PE.

Aim

Develop clearly worded, practical, evidenced-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of PE for family practice clinicians as well as sexual medicine experts. Method. Review of the literature.

Results

This article contains the report of the ISSM PE Guidelines Committee. It affirms the ISSM definition of PE and suggests that the prevalence is considerably lower than previously thought. Evidence-based data regarding biological and psychological etiology of PE are presented, as is population-based statistics on normal ejaculatory latency. Brief assessment procedures are delineated and validated diagnostic and treatment questionnaires are reviewed. Finally, the best practices treatment recommendations are presented to guide clinicians, both familiar and unfamiliar with PE, in facilitating treatment of their patients.

Conclusion

Development of guidelines is an evolutionary process that continually reviews data and incorporates the best new research. We expect that ongoing research will lead to a more complete understanding of the pathophysiology as well as new efficacious and safe treatments for this sexual dysfunction. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that these guidelines be re-evaluated and updated by the ISSM every 4 years.

### Clinical and demographic correlates of ejaculatory dysfunctions other than premature ejaculation: a prospective, observational study [^1121jja3]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ejaculatory dysfunctions other than premature ejaculation are commonly encountered in specialized clinics; however, their characterization in community-dwelling men is lacking.

Aim

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, severity, and associated distress of four ejaculatory dysfunctions: delayed ejaculation (DE), anejaculation (AE), perceived ejaculate volume reduction (PEVR) and/or decreased force of ejaculation (DFE) as a function of demographic and clinical characteristics in men.

Methods

Observational analysis of 988 subjects presenting with one or more types of ejaculatory dysfunctions other than premature ejaculation who screened for a randomized clinical trial assessing the efficacy of testosterone replacement on ejaculatory dysfunction. Demographic and clinical characteristics were assessed as potential risk factors using regression analysis.

Main Outcome Measures

The main outcome measures used were ejaculatory dysfunction prevalence and scores (3-item Men's Sexual Health Questionnaire Ejaculatory Dysfunction-Short Form [MSHQ-EjD-SF]), and bother (MSHQ-EjD-SF Bother item) and sexual satisfaction/enjoyment (International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire Q7, Q8) as a function of subject's age, race, body mass index (BMI) and serum testosterone levels (measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry).

Results

Mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of the participants was 52 years (11). Eighty-eightpercent of the men experienced more than one type of ejaculatory dysfunction and 68% considered their symptoms to be bothersome. Prevalence of the ejaculatory dysfunctions was substantial across a range of age, race, BMI, and serum testosterone categories. Prevalence of PEVR and DFE were positively associated with age (< 40 years vs. 60–70 years: PEVR: odds ratio [OR], 3.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32–7.06; DFE: OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.46–5.28) while DFE was associated with BMI (≥ 30kg/m² vs. < 25kg/m²: OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.062–3.05). All ejaculatory dysfunctions were more prevalent in black men.

Conclusion

The majority of the participants experienced multiple ejaculatory dysfunctions and found them to be highly bothersome. Ejaculatory dysfunctions were prevalent across a wide range of demographic and clinical characteristics.

### Psychosexual factors that differentiate men with inhibited ejaculation from men with no dysfunction or another sexual dysfunction [^116nzy86]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

Inhibited or retarded ejaculation (IE) is an uncommon male sexual dysfunction that may result in a lack of sexual fulfillment for both the man and his partner. In this study, we attempted to identify factors that differentiate men with IE from sexually functional controls or from men with other sexual dysfunctions and to specify whether such factors predict self-reported sexual arousal during psychophysiological assessment.

Methods

Each patient underwent psychophysiological assessment and a structured clinical interview based on a standardized questionnaire that included demographic information, psychosexual and medical history, and assessment of current sexual, erectile, and ejaculatory function, including relationship quality and characteristics.

Results

Men with IE resemble men with other dysfunctions but are differentiated from controls, in their lower level of relationship satisfaction, greater level of distress, and higher level of health-related problems. Men with IE were further characterized by lower levels of self-reported subjective sexual arousal, despite exhibiting strong penile response during psychophysiological testing and reporting high quality erections across a variety of situations. Also notable, however, were the many factors on which men with IE did not differ from controls.

Conclusions

Taken together, this research helps specify directions for future investigations of men with IE.

### Delayed ejaculation and associated complaints: relationship to ejaculation times and serum testosterone levels [^1167uLWK]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although delayed ejaculation (DE) is typically characterized as a persistently longer than anticipated or desired time to ejaculation (or orgasm) during sexual activity, a timing-based definition of DE and its association with serum testosterone has not been established in a large cohort.

Aim

To examine in an observational study estimated intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) and masturbatory ejaculation latency time (MELT) in men self-reporting DE, assess the association of IELT and MELT with serum testosterone levels, and determine whether correlation with demographic and sexual parameters exist.

Methods

Men who resided in the United States, Canada, and Mexico were enrolled from 2011 to 2013. Self-estimated IELT and MELT were captured using an Ejaculatory Function Screening Questionnaire in a sample of 988 men screened for possible inclusion in a randomized clinical trial assessing testosterone replacement therapy for ejaculatory dysfunction (EjD) and who self-reported the presence or absence of DE and symptoms of hypogonadism. Additional comorbid EjDs (ie, anejaculation, perceived decrease in ejaculate volume, and decreased force of ejaculation) were recorded. Men with premature ejaculation were excluded from this analysis. IELT and MELT were compared between men self-reporting DE and men without DE. The associations of IELT and MELT with serum testosterone were measured.

Outcomes

IELT, MELT, and total testosterone levels.

Results

Sixty-two percent of screened men self-reported DE with or without comorbid EjDs; 38% did not report DE but did report at least one of the other EjDs. Estimated median IELTs were 20.0 minutes for DE vs 15 minutes for no DE (P < .001). Estimated median MELTs were 15.0 minutes for DE vs 8.0 minutes for no DE (P < .001). Ejaculation time was not associated with serum testosterone levels. Younger men and those with less severe erectile dysfunction had longer IELTs and MELTs.

Clinical Implications

Estimated ejaculation times during vaginal intercourse and/or masturbation were not associated with serum testosterone levels in this study; thus, routine androgen evaluation is not indicated in these men.

Strengths and Limitations

This large systematic analysis attempted to objectively assess the ejaculation latency in men with self-reported DE. Limitations were that ejaculation time estimates were self-reported and were queried only once; the questionnaire did not distinguish between failure to achieve orgasm and ejaculation; and assessment of DE was limited to heterosexual vaginal intercourse and masturbation.

Conclusion

IELT and MELT were longer in men with DE, and there was no association of ejaculation times with serum testosterone levels in this study population. Morgentaler A, Polzer P, Althof S, et al.

### Delayed orgasm and anorgasmia [^111Fojz2]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Delayed orgasm/anorgasmia defined as the persistent or recurrent difficulty, delay in, or absence of attaining orgasm after sufficient sexual stimulation, which causes personal distress. Delayed orgasm and anorgasmia are associated with significant sexual dissatisfaction. A focused medical history can shed light on the potential etiologies, which include medications, penile sensation loss, endocrinopathies, penile hyperstimulation, and psychological etiologies. Unfortunately, there are no excellent pharmacotherapies for delayed orgasm/anorgasmia, and treatment revolves largely around addressing potential causative factors and psychotherapy.

### Disorders of ejaculation: an AUA / SMSNA guideline [^113sWBQL]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

AUA/SMSNA guideline — disorders of ejaculation are defined and the evidence base summarized: Men who ejaculate before or shortly after penetration, without a sense of control, and who experience distress may be diagnosed with premature ejaculation (PE), while men who experience difficulty achieving sexual climax may be diagnosed with delayed ejaculation (DE). The role of the clinician in managing PE and DE is to conduct appropriate investigation, to provide education, and to offer available treatments that are rational and based on sound scientific data. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to March 1, 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through January 2019) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through March 1, 2019), with an update on September 5, 2019; database searches resulted in 1,851 potentially relevant articles, after which 223 systematic reviews and individual studies were selected for full-text dual review, and 8 systematic reviews and 59 individual studies were determined to meet inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Several psychological health, behavioral, and pharmacotherapy options exist for both PE and DE; however, none of these pharmacotherapy options have achieved approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration and their use in the treatment of PE and DE is considered off-label. Disturbances of the timing of ejaculation can pose a substantial impediment to sexual enjoyment for men and their partners.

### Female sexual dysfunction: ACOG practice bulletin clinical management guidelines for obstetrician-gynecologists, number 213 [^112dRA51]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on female sexual dysfunction:

- **Definition**: Female sexual dysfunction is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by persistent or recurrent difficulties in sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, or pain during sexual activity, causing significant personal distress or interpersonal difficulty.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of female sexual dysfunction is multifactorial, involving disruptions in neurovascular, hormonal, and psychological pathways that regulate sexual function. Hypoactive sexual desire may result from hormonal changes (low estrogen or androgens), neurotransmitter imbalances, or psychosocial stress. Arousal and orgasmic disorders may be associated with impaired genital blood flow, nerve dysfunction, or psychological inhibition. Sexual pain disorders, including genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder, may involve musculoskeletal dysfunction, hormonal atrophy, or anxiety-related pelvic floor hypertonicity.
- **Epidemiology**: Female sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent, affecting an estimated 40–50% of women at some point in their lives. About 12% experience symptoms that cause significant personal distress. Rates increase with age, with the highest prevalence observed during the perimenopausal and menopausal years, reaching 15% in women aged 45–64, compared to 10% in those aged 18–44 and 9% in those aged 65–85. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder is the most common subtype, followed by arousal and orgasmic difficulties. Cultural, demographic, and methodological differences contribute to variable prevalence estimates across studies.
- **Risk factors**: Female sexual dysfunction is influenced by a combination of biological, psychological, relational, and sociocultural factors. Risk factors include advancing age, menopause, hormonal changes, chronic medical conditions (such as diabetes, CVD, depression), medication use (such as SSRIs, chemotherapeutic agents, opioids, psychotropic drugs, antiepileptics, antihistamines, and antihypertensives), prior sexual trauma, relationship dissatisfaction, and poor body image.
- **Disease course**: Female sexual dysfunction may present as low libido, difficulty with arousal, delayed or absent orgasm, or pain with intercourse. Symptoms may be lifelong or acquired and can vary in severity and frequency over time. Menopausal transition, relationship changes, and chronic illness often influence symptom development.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced sexual dysfunction [^113Zucqm]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sexual dysfunctions are often present in subjects with mood disturbances; however. antidepressants can induce per se sexual dysfunctions.

Aim

To explore the relationship between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), non-SSRIs antidepressants and benzodiazepines (BDZ), hormonal parameters, and reported sexual dysfunction (as assessed by the Structured Interview on Erectile Dysfunction [SIEDY]) in male subjects with comparable psychopathological symptoms (as assessed by the Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire [MHQ] a self-reported test for the screening of mental disorders in a non-psychiatric setting).

Methods

A consecutive series of 2,040 (mean age 51 ± 13 years) male patients with sexual dysfunction was studied.

Main Outcome Measures

Several hormonal and biochemical parameters were investigated, along with SIEDY and the MHQ.

Results

Higher prolactin was observed only in patients using SSRIs, whereas no other hormonal difference was found after adjustment for confounders. Use of SSRIs was associated with a twofold risk for patient hypoactive sexual desire and with a higher impairment of reported erectile function. However, no difference in penile blood flow was observed. A very high risk (sevenfold) for delayed ejaculation (DE) was observed in SSRI users. Interestingly, the association with the mild, but not severe, form of DE was observed also in subjects using non-SSRI antidepressants (3.35 [1.48–7.59]; P < 0.005). Different life stressors and relational parameters were also associated with SSRI use. SSRI users reported less enjoyment with masturbation and decreased partner desire and climax. Conversely, a lack of significant association was observed among BDZ or non-SSRI antidepressant users and all the aforementioned life-stressors and relational parameters.

Conclusions

SSRIs can negatively affect all the steps of the male sexual response cycle (desire-arousal-excitement-orgasm). SSRI-associated sexual dysfunction has a deleterious effect on both auto- and couple-erotic performances. Conversely, other antidepressants and BDZ are less often associated with sexual impairment.

### An overview of pharmacotherapy in premature ejaculation [^116a5eCj]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

With increasing interest and clinical research in male sexual disorders, it has become clear that not only psychological but also organic, neurobiological, and genetic factors may play an important role in premature ejaculation (PE).

Aim

This article provides an overview of the different treatment options both for lifelong (primary, "congenital") and acquired (secondary) PE.

Methods

Review of the literature.

Main Outcome Measures

Currently used treatment options for PE.

Results

Treatments reviewed include psychological/behavioral/sexual counseling therapy, topical anesthetics, dapoxetine, and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, and phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors.

Conclusions

Before starting any therapy for PE, correct diagnosis has to be made considering the patient's reported intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) and the duration and type of PE. Concomitant erectile dysfunction (ED) should be either ruled out or proven by appropriate means. In uncomplicated cases of PE with stable partnerships, medical treatment represents the first-choice option with a high likelihood of success. Dapoxetine, where available, or other SSRIs provide suitable therapeutic options with a good risk/benefit profile for patients. In complicated ("difficult-to-treat") PE patients, a combination of medication and sexual counseling should be considered the first treatment option. Combination therapies of PDE-5 inhibitors and PE-related medications should be offered to patients suffering from comorbid PE and ED, with ED treatment starting first. In those patients with severe PE-IELTs of < 30–60 seconds or anteportal ejaculation-combination therapy of topical and oral medications can be offered and may considerably increase IELT, compared with either monotherapy.

The Panel "is supportive of clinicians offering appropriately selected pharmacotherapies that have a physiologic rationale for benefit in DE treatment (Table 3)" but emphasizes that "Patients should be counseled on the weak evidence base and the potential for both known and unknown side effects", that risks and benefits should be individualized, and that "the urologist who is not comfortable prescribing these medications should consider referral of the patient for discussion of these management options".

### Diagnostic evaluation of sexual dysfunction in the male partner in the setting of infertility: a committee opinion [^116wZ9R6]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

American Society for Reproductive Medicine committee opinion — erectile dysfunction (ED) in the male partner during infertility evaluation: It is the responsibility of the clinician to assess for the presence of erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, or diminished libido in men presenting for evaluation of infertility, and referral to a reproductive urologist or other appropriate specialist is often warranted. ED is prevalent and increases with age; severe and moderate-severity ED occur in 5% and 17%, respectively, of men aged 40–49 years. Globally, more than 152 million men were reported to have ED in 1995, with projections to 322 million in 2025. Among men with infertility, ED is present in 18%–89%, and the prevalence of ED in infertile men is significantly higher than in fertile controls. Men with ED without a history of cardiovascular disease have a 45% increased risk of a subsequent cardiovascular event within 5 years compared with those without ED. In infertility care, ED can be psychogenic or organic; psychogenic ED occurs when a man has normal penile blood flow and nerve function and may achieve an erection under some circumstances but typically not with his partner when trying to conceive, whereas organic ED is commonly a result of diminished penile blood flow or nerve dysfunction and results in the inability to achieve or maintain an erection regardless of the situation.

### Male delayed orgasm and anorgasmia: a practical guide for sexual medicine providers [^114Qi2VX]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Delayed orgasm (DO) is defined as increased latency of orgasm despite adequate sexual stimulation and desire. Anorgasmia (AO) is characterized as the absence of orgasm. Etiologies of DO/AO include medication-induced, psychogenic, endocrine, and genitopelvic dysesthesia. Given the multifactorial complex nature of this disorder, a thorough history and physical examination represent the most critical components of patient evaluation in the clinical setting. Treating DO/AO can be challenging due to the lack of standardized FDA-approved pharmacotherapies. There is no standardized treatment plan for DO/AO, though common treatments plans are often multidisciplinary and may include adjustment of offending medications and sex therapy. In this review, we summarize the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of DO/AO.

### Diagnosing premature ejaculation: a review [^113JAr7E]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Premature ejaculation (PE) is one of the most prevalent male sexual dysfunctions, yet it is frequently misdiagnosed or overlooked as a result of numerous patient and physician barriers. In particular, there is no universally used definition of the condition. There are no validated assessments or laboratory assays which distinguish men with PE from men without PE, and there are no risk factors or definitive correlates identified for this condition. Patients fail to seek medical help because of the stigma and embarrassment over the condition. In addition, patients (and clinicians) often misdiagnose PE as erectile dysfunction (ED).

Aim

To review the barriers to diagnosing PE, the factors to consider in diagnosing PE and how to diagnose PE.

Methods

The Sexual Medicine Society of North America hosted a State of the Art Conference on Premature Ejaculation on June 24–26, 2005 in collaboration with the University of South Florida. The purpose was to have an open exchange of contemporary research and clinical information on PE. There were 16 invited presenters and discussants; the group focused on several educational objectives.

Main Outcome Measure

Data were utilized from the American Urological Association (AUA) Guideline on the Pharmacologic Management of Premature Ejaculation.

Results

The AUA recommends the diagnosis of PE be based solely upon sexual history. In addition to a shortened latency time, recent research has identified three key factors associated with — and necessary for — a diagnosis of PE: (i) patient reports of reduced control over ejaculation; (ii) patient (and/or partner) reports of reduced satisfaction with sexual intercourse; and (iii) patient (and/or partner) distress over the condition.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of PE is based upon sexual history of a shortened latency time, poor control over ejaculation, low satisfaction with intercourse, and distress regarding the condition.

Pathophysiology of DO

Several etiologies have been identified in the pathophysiology of DO, owing to the multifactorial, complex nature of the disorder. The most common etiologies include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI; 42%), psychogenic (28%), low testosterone (T; 21%), abnormal penile sensation (7%), and penile hyperstimulation (2%).

Endocrinopathies

Given the fundamental role of hormonal regulation in the physiology of orgasm, multiple endocrinopathies have been identified in patients with DO. Corona et al. compared T levels among 2437 men (mean age 51.9 ± 13.0 years) with PE or DO versus those without ejaculatory dysfunction and demonstrated lower total and free T levels among patients with DO. Patients with DO had higher prevalence of testosterone deficiency when compared to patients with PE (26 vs. 12%, respectively). The varied prevalence of testosterone deficiency among patients with PE and DO compared to the control group remained statistically significant even when controlling for age (HR = 0.75 [0.57–0.99] and 1.83 [1.14–3.94], respectively; both p < 0.05).

Hyperprolactinemia also leads to DO as increased levels of prolactin (PRL) result in suppression of T production. Hyperprolactinemia can be defined as mild (> 420 mU/L or 20 ng/mL) versus severe (> 735 mU/L or 35 ng/mL). It has been shown that PRL levels progressively increase when comparing men with PE versus no ejaculatory dysfunction versus DO respectively.

Likewise, aberrant thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been associated with orgasmic dysfunction. Hyperthyroid patients often experience PE whereas hypothyroid patients often experience DO. A multicenter prospective study of 48 men (n = 34 hyperthyroid, n = 14 hypothyroid) demonstrated that IELT significantly improved after normalization of TSH levels. Among hyperthyroid men, IELT doubled from 2.4 min to 4.0 min after treatment, whereas IELT significantly decreased from 22 to 7 min in hypothyroid men.

### New technologies developed for treatment of premature ejaculation [^116DBnK8]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

While the exact etiology of PE remains undetermined, the most widely accepted theories regarding the etiology of lifelong PE center on disruptions in neurotransmitter activities within the central nervous system. This includes serotonin, noradrenaline, oxytocin, nitric oxide (NO), and Gama aminobutyric acid (GABA). Additionally, increased sensitivity of the glans penis, erectile dysfunction (ED), genetic polymorphisms, hormonal imbalances, and prostatic diseases also contribute to its pathophysiology. Further research is necessary to evaluate the impact of these factors on ejaculation physiology. The etiology of acquired PE is more closely associated with underlying medical, psychological, and interpersonal causes, as described by Serefoglu et al.

Since the 1990s, the prevailing treatment options for both lifelong and acquired PE have been on-demand topical anesthetics and off-label daily or on-demand selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including Dapoxetine, a swiftly absorbed and short-acting SSRI, which stands as the sole approved oral medication for PE treatment. Notably, Dapoxetine lacks approval from the US Food and Drug Administration due to its uncertain efficacy and safety. While the majority of men with PE report these treatments as safe, some may experience minor adverse effects. Additionally, SSRIs offer only a temporary delay in ejaculation latency time, with PE often resurfacing after treatment cessation. Certain PE patients and their partners might find the necessity to apply a topical anesthetic 5–10 min before each sexual encounter dissatisfying. A post-marketing study reveals that a significant majority (up to 75%) of PE patients express dissatisfaction with topical anesthetic treatments. Consequently, adherence to topical anesthetic treatments remains low, at ~10%.

Behavioral therapy, specifically sex therapy, represents a treatment with fewer side effects and lower costs. Its goal is to enhance self-confidence and alleviate anxiety and depression by systematically training men to acquire sexual skills that can extend ejaculation time. In the short term, behavioral therapy can yield success rates ranging from 45% to 65% of patients, but its long-term effects remain uncertain.

A definitive cure for PE is still elusive, and ongoing research is focused on identifying the optimal treatment for this condition. Consequently, in response to the unmet need for PE therapy, new technologies are currently under development.

This review article is aimed at providing a summary of the presently available non-pharmacological, non-surgical technological therapies for PE, excluding cognitive or behavioral approaches. We will discuss the findings from studies that are dedicated to creating innovative technological treatment options for PE.

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride (venlafaxine) [^111NHybC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Sexual Dysfunction

Use of SNRIs, including venlafaxine tablets, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). In male patients, SNRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SNRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm.

It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of venlafaxine tablets and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment.

### Male delayed orgasm and anorgasmia: a practical guide for sexual medicine providers [^116jXf88]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Orgasm and ejaculation represent fundamental aspects of male sexual function and disorders affecting these processes garner a tremendous impact on quality of life. DO and AO are prevalent among men and may be underreported due to patient embarrassment or discomfort. Given the complex and multifactorial nature of this condition, the most critical component of patient evaluation is gathering a thorough medical, surgical, and psychosocial history and performing a complete physical examination. Treatment options include addressing underlying organic causes and sex therapy. Though many promising pharmacotherapies have emerged, none are currently approved by the FDA for this indication. Future directions include developing a universal definition of DO and AO as well as a standardized pathway to achieve objective evaluation and diagnosis. Further studies elucidating the underlying molecular pathogenesis of orgasmic dysfunction can also lead to novel targeted pharmacotherapies.

### Male delayed orgasm and anorgasmia: a practical guide for sexual medicine providers [^114Ps6tL]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology

Kinsey et al. found that on 15 out of 10,000 participants had primary AO while Nathan et al. found the prevalence of inhibited male orgasm to be 5%. DO and DE are used interchangeably in the literature, the true prevalence of AO and DO is difficult to extrapolate since difficulties with orgasm and ejaculation are often not separated in studies. Corona et al. evaluated 2652 men and asked patients about difficulty with ejaculation and climax. They observed a 7.3% (n = 194) prevalence of DE and/or DO. In a separate study, the same author group evaluated the prevalence of sexual dysfunction among 2437 men with mean age 51.9 years and reported a 4.4% rate of DE and/or DO. However, it is postulated that the prevalence of DO is likely higher as embarrassment may preclude men from seeking treatment or discussing this condition with their providers.

### Standard operating procedures in the disorders of orgasm and ejaculation [^117CHwAZ]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ejaculatory/orgasmic disorders are common male sexual dysfunctions and include premature ejaculation (PE), inhibited ejaculation, anejaculation, retrograde ejaculation, and anorgasmia.

Aim

To provide recommendations and guidelines of the current state-of-the-art knowledge for management of ejaculation/orgasmic disorders in men as standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the treating health care professional.

Methods

The International Society of Sexual Medicine Standards Committee assembled over 30 multidisciplinary experts to establish SOPs for various male and female sexual medicine topics. The SOP for the management of disorders of orgasm and ejaculation represents the opinion of four experts from four countries developed in a process over a 2-year period.

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinion was based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, limited expert opinion, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation, and debate.

Results

PE management is largely dependent upon etiology. Lifelong PE is best managed with PE pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and/or topical anesthetics). The management of acquired PE is etiology specific and may include erectile dysfunction (ED) pharmacotherapy in men with comorbid ED. All men seeking treatment for PE should receive basic psychosexual education. Graded behavioral therapy is indicated when psychogenic or relationship factors are present and is often best combined with PE pharmacotherapy in an integrated treatment program. Delayed ejaculation, anejaculation, and/or anorgasmia may have a biogenic and/or psychogenic etiology. Men with age-related penile hypoanesthesia should be educated, reassured, and instructed in revised sexual techniques which maximize arousal. Retrograde ejaculation is managed by education, patient reassurance, and pharmacotherapy.

Conclusions

Additional research is required to further the understanding of the disorders of ejaculation and orgasm.

### Epidemiology of premature ejaculation [^11455zBo]. Current Opinion in Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Accumulating evidence suggests that premature ejaculation is the most common sexual symptom. This review focuses on the epidemiology of premature ejaculation from geographical and medical perspectives.

Recent Findings

In the past year many articles have been published using the data from the Global Study of Sexual Attitudes and Behaviors, a large survey that investigated various aspects of sex and relationships among 27 500 men and women aged 40–80 years. Despite some methodological bias, discussed herein, a prevalence of more than 21% seems a realistic figure for premature ejaculation.

Summary

Premature ejaculation is the most prevalent sexual dysfunction in every country.

Definition of DO/AO

Although most definitions are similar, there is no standardized definition for DO. The AUA guidelines on disorders of ejaculation recognize that there are multiple terms to refer to delays in ejaculations and/or orgasm including DE and DO. Though it is acknowledged that ejaculation and orgasm are separate entities, the term DE is often used to refer to both difficulties with ejaculation and orgasm. Additionally, the AUA guidelines consider AO to be "the condition in which sexual climax cannot be reached via any means of stimulation".

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-V) states that "distressing difficulties with orgasm in men would be considered under delayed ejaculation", which is defined as a marked delay in ejaculation or a marked infrequency of absence of ejaculation on 75–100% of all occasions of partnered sexual activity without the individual desiring delay, persisting for at least 6 months, and causing significant distress to the individual. DSM-V does not provide a definition for AO.
