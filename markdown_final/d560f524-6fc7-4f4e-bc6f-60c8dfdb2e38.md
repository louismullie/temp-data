## Question

What is the maximum daily dose of valsartan?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the maximum daily dose of valsartan is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA labeling explicitly states for each approved indication. Then, I should verify whether combination products set any different ceilings. Next, I will check for any conflicting data suggesting higher doses in trials and reconcile that with labeling. After that, I need to consider special populations and whether the maximum changes with renal or hepatic impairment or age. Finally, I will review pharmacokinetic and clinical data to ensure there is no overlooked benefit beyond the labeled maximum and synthesize a clear conclusion [^111wg5dP] [^111WkmoW] [^112aA82J].

> Let me first confirm the maximal dose directly from high-credibility FDA sources. For hypertension, the FDA SPL lists a maximum dose of 320 mg per day, with usual dosing 80–320 mg once daily, which is very clear and binding for clinical use [^111wg5dP]. For heart failure, the labeled maintenance is 80–160 mg twice daily with a maximum of 320 mg per day, achieved as 160 mg BID, so again the ceiling is 320 mg daily [^111WkmoW]. For post–myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction, the maintenance dose is 160 mg twice daily, which equals 320 mg/day, aligning with the same maximum [^112aA82J]. Combination products do not exceed this valsartan ceiling: Diovan HCT tops out at 320/25 mg daily, and the triple amlodipine/valsartan/HCTZ product at 10/320/25 mg daily, both preserving valsartan 320 mg as the highest permitted daily exposure [^1113xfL6] [^111d4khd].

> I should verify consistency across all labeled uses to be certain there isn't an outlier indication with a different cap. Diabetic nephropathy labeling also uses a 160–320 mg per day maintenance range, again implying 320 mg/day as the highest recommended daily dose, which keeps this consistent across the board with hypertension, heart failure, and post-MI labeling [^114ohMmu] [^111wg5dP] [^111WkmoW] [^112aA82J]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this confirms labeled adult dosing, but I still need to check special populations before I finalize the "maximum applies to everyone" statement [^111wg5dP].

> Wait, let me verify any conflicting higher-dose data. There is a study that explored 640 mg/day, explicitly described as two times the maximal recommended dose; the investigators were evaluating supratherapeutic dosing in a research setting, not proposing a new standard, which should not override FDA labeling in practice [^115Vg4yx]. I should also check the FDA pharmacodynamics section: it notes robust ATII pressor blockade with 80 mg and linear PK across the clinical dose range, but does not provide evidence supporting efficacy or safety advantages above 320 mg/day, reinforcing that 320 mg/day is the top of the evaluated and recommended range for routine care [^113QPHt4].

> Next, I should review special populations and formulations. For renal impairment, the labels indicate no adjustment is required for eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², caution is advised when eGFR < 30, and even in intermittent hemodialysis and CRRT, dose adjustment typically isn't required, but monitoring for renal function and hyperkalemia is essential, none of which changes the labeled maximum of 320 mg/day in adults [^114fXBYy] [^115PzkpT] [^116LYzsT] [^113jguSZ]. For hepatic impairment, mild to moderate disease generally does not require dose adjustment per SPL, but there are no dosing recommendations for severe hepatic disease, so the adult maximum remains 320 mg/day in those with preserved tolerability while acknowledging insufficient data in severe impairment [^115rUYgR] [^113Jh8BN]. I will now examine pediatric considerations: pediatric hypertension uses weight-based dosing with substantially lower maxima; that's a different framework, so I should not conflate adult and pediatric caps, and I must keep adult maximums distinct from pediatric titration schemes [^111dhvfZ]. Also, standard warnings apply: hypotension, hyperkalemia, and renal function shifts warrant careful monitoring when approaching the upper end of dosing, particularly in heart failure or post-MI patients with volume depletion or renal artery stenosis [^1143oe8R].

> Let me consider pharmacokinetic and clinical efficacy data to ensure no missed signal suggesting benefit beyond 320 mg/day. Valsartan exhibits approximately linear increases in AUC and Cmax across the clinical range, with a half-life around 6 hours, explaining why heart failure regimens use BID dosing while hypertension can be once daily, yet labeling and trials do not show incremental therapeutic benefit in standard outcomes above 320 mg/day in adults [^113QPHt4] [^114V5Ax6]. Hmm, wait a minute — there is that supratherapeutic 640 mg trial, but it does not demonstrate a basis to change the labeled maximum; in fact, it frames 640 mg as double the maximum, which confirms rather than refutes the 320 mg/day cap for clinical practice [^115Vg4yx].

> Synthesis now: The convergent FDA labeling across hypertension, heart failure, post-MI, and diabetic nephropathy indicates that the maximum daily dose of valsartan is 320 mg per day, administered as either 320 mg once daily for hypertension or 160 mg twice daily for heart failure or after myocardial infarction, with combination products aligning to the same valsartan ceiling of 320 mg/day [^111wg5dP] [^111WkmoW] [^112aA82J] [^1113xfL6] [^111d4khd]. Initially, I almost stated "this maximum applies regardless of indication, patient age, or renal/hepatic function", but hold on, I should verify and correct that: the 320 mg/day maximum applies to adults across labeled indications; pediatric dosing follows different, lower weight-based maxima, and while no routine adult dose adjustment is required for mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment, severe hepatic disease lacks dosing recommendations and all higher-risk states necessitate close monitoring for hypotension, renal function changes, and hyperkalemia at higher doses [^111dhvfZ] [^114fXBYy] [^115rUYgR] [^1143oe8R].

---

The maximum recommended daily dose of valsartan is **320 mg per day** [^111wg5dP] for hypertension, heart failure [^111WkmoW], and post-myocardial infarction indications [^112aA82J]. For hypertension, this can be given once daily [^114V5Ax6] or divided into two doses; for heart failure and post-MI, it is typically **160 mg twice daily**. No dose adjustment is needed [^115Sgsew] for mild-to-moderate renal [^114fXBYy] or hepatic impairment [^115rUYgR], but use caution and monitor renal function and potassium in severe impairment [^115PzkpT]. Exceeding 320 mg daily is not recommended [^114V5Ax6] due to increased risk of hypotension [^1143oe8R], hyperkalemia, and renal impairment [^1143oe8R].

---

## Maximum recommended daily dose

The maximum recommended daily dose of valsartan for adults is **320 mg per day** [^111wg5dP] across its primary indications — hypertension, heart failure [^111WkmoW], and post-myocardial infarction [^112aA82J].

---

## Indication-specific dosing recommendations

### Hypertension

- **Initial dose**: 80–160 mg once daily.
- **Maintenance dose**: 80–320 mg once daily [^114V5Ax6].
- **Maximum dose**: 320 mg once daily [^111wg5dP].

---

### Heart failure

- **Initial dose**: 40 mg twice daily.
- **Maintenance dose**: 80–160 mg twice daily [^112fri3r].
- **Maximum dose**: 320 mg per day (typically 160 mg twice daily) [^111WkmoW].

---

### Post-myocardial infarction

- **Initial dose**: 20 mg twice daily, initiated as early as 12 hours after myocardial infarction [^112aA82J].
- **Maintenance dose**: 160 mg twice daily.
- **Maximum dose**: 320 mg per day (typically 160 mg twice daily) [^112aA82J].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting maximum dose

Clinical trials show that valsartan at doses up to **320 mg per day** effectively reduces blood pressure and improves cardiovascular outcomes, with no meaningful additional benefit at higher doses. The antihypertensive effect is dose dependent up to 320 mg, with **diminishing returns beyond this dose**.

---

## Safety considerations and adverse effects

While valsartan is generally well tolerated, higher doses increase the **risk of adverse effects**. These include hypotension (particularly in patients with heart failure, post-myocardial infarction, or volume depletion) [^1143oe8R] [^114V5Ax6]; hyperkalemia (especially in patients with renal impairment or those taking potassium-sparing diuretics) [^1143oe8R] [^114fXBYy]; and renal impairment (warranting caution in renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, or severe congestive heart failure) [^1143oe8R] [^115PzkpT].

---

## Special populations

### Renal impairment

In patients with renal impairment, **mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²)** requires no dose adjustment, but renal function and potassium should be monitored [^114fXBYy], whereas **severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²)** warrants cautious use with close monitoring of renal function and potassium [^115PzkpT].

---

### Hepatic impairment

In patients with hepatic impairment, **mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A or B)** requires no dose adjustment (Child-Pugh A [^115rUYgR] or B [^113Jh8BN]), whereas **severe hepatic impairment** warrants cautious use; no specific dosing recommendations are available.

---

### Elderly patients

In **elderly patients**, overall efficacy and safety are similar, though greater sensitivity in some individuals cannot be ruled out; start at the lower end of the dosing range and titrate cautiously [^115Sgsew].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines consistently recommend a **maximum daily dose of 320 mg** for valsartan across its primary indications, balancing efficacy with safety.

---

## Summary of maximum recommended daily dose by indication

| **Indication** | **Initial dose** | **Maintenance dose** | **Maximum dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hypertension | 80–160 mg once daily | 80–320 mg once daily | 320 mg once daily [^111wg5dP] |
| Heart failure | 40 mg twice daily | 80–160 mg twice daily | 320 mg per day [^111WkmoW] |
| Post-myocardial infarction | 20 mg twice daily | 160 mg twice daily | 320 mg per day [^112aA82J] |

---

The maximum recommended daily dose of valsartan is **320 mg per day** for hypertension, heart failure, and post-myocardial infarction, supported by clinical evidence and guidelines that balance efficacy and safety [^111wg5dP].

In the controlled clinical trials of valsartan, 1,214 (36.2%) hypertensive patients treated were aged 65 years or older, and 265 (7.9%) were 75 years or older. No overall difference in the efficacy or safety of valsartan was observed in this patient population; however, greater sensitivity among some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

In the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial, out of 2,511 patients with heart failure randomized to valsartan, 45% (1,141) were 65 years of age or older. Similarly, in the Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (VALIANT), 53% (2,596) of the 4,909 patients treated with valsartan, and 51% (2,515) of the 4,885 patients treated with valsartan + captopril, were 65 years of age or older. No notable differences in efficacy or safety were observed between older and younger patients in either trial.

- **Renal impairment**: The safety and effectiveness of valsartan in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min) have not been established. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild (CrCl 60 to 90 mL/min) or moderate (CrCl 30 to 60 mL/min) renal impairment.

- **Hepatic impairment**: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-moderate liver disease. Additionally, no dosing recommendations can be provided for patients with severe liver disease.

### Diovan [^114V5Ax6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypertension**:

The antihypertensive effects of Diovan (valsartan) were demonstrated principally in seven placebo-controlled, 4- to 12-week trials, including one in patients over 65 years, with dosages ranging from 10 to 320 mg/day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95–115 mmHg. These studies allowed for comparisons of once-daily and twice-daily regimens of 160 mg/day, peak and trough effects, response by gender, age, and race in pooled data, and the evaluation of incremental effects of hydrochlorothiazide.

Administration of valsartan to patients with essential hypertension results in a significant reduction of sitting, supine, and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure, typically with little or no orthostatic change.

Upon administration of a single oral dose, most patients experience the onset of antihypertensive activity at approximately two hours, with maximum reduction of blood pressure achieved within six hours. The antihypertensive effect persists for 24 hours after dosing. However, there is a decrease from peak effect at lower doses (40 mg), likely reflecting loss of inhibition of angiotensin II. At higher doses (160 mg), there is little difference between peak and trough effect.

During repeated dosing, the reduction in blood pressure with any dose is substantially present within two weeks, and maximal reduction is generally attained after four weeks. Long-term follow-up studies (without placebo control) indicate that the effect of valsartan appears to be maintained for up to two years. The antihypertensive effect is independent of age.

### Prexxartan [^112d295H]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Abrupt withdrawal of valsartan has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure. The blood pressure-lowering effect of valsartan and thiazide-type diuretics is approximately additive.

- **Studies and findings**: The seven studies of valsartan monotherapy included over 2,000 patients randomized to various doses of valsartan and about 800 patients randomized to placebo. Doses below 80 mg were not consistently distinguished from those of placebo at trough, but doses of 80, 160, and 320 mg produced dose-related decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, with the difference from placebo of approximately 6–9/3–5 mmHg at 80 to 160 mg and 9/6 mmHg at 320 mg. In a controlled trial, the addition of HCTZ to valsartan 80 mg resulted in additional lowering of systolic and diastolic blood pressure by approximately 6/3 and 12/5 mmHg for 12.5 and 25 mg of HCTZ, respectively, compared to valsartan 80 mg alone.

- **Patient titration and response**: Patients with an inadequate response to 80 mg once daily were titrated to either 160 mg once daily or 80 mg twice daily, which resulted in a comparable response in both groups.

- **Comparative trials**: In controlled trials, the antihypertensive effect of once-daily valsartan 80 mg was similar to that of once-daily enalapril 20 mg or once-daily lisinopril 10 mg.

### A randomized trial of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan in chronic heart failure [^112fri3r]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). High credibility.

The actions of angiotensin II may contribute to the progression of heart failure despite treatment with currently recommended drugs. Therefore, we evaluated the long-term effects of adding the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan to standard therapy for heart failure.

- **Methods**: A total of 5,010 patients with heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, III, or IV were randomly assigned to receive 160 mg of valsartan or a placebo twice daily. The primary outcomes were mortality and the combined endpoint of mortality and morbidity, defined as the incidence of cardiac arrest with resuscitation, hospitalization for heart failure, or receipt of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator therapy for at least four hours.

- **Results**: Overall mortality was similar in the two groups. However, the incidence of the combined endpoint was 13.2 percent lower with valsartan than with placebo (relative risk, 0.87; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.97; P = 0.009), predominantly because of a lower number of patients hospitalized for heart failure: 455 (18.2 percent) in the placebo group and 346 (13.8 percent) in the valsartan group (P < 0.001). Treatment with valsartan also resulted in significant improvements in NYHA class, ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of heart failure, and quality of life compared with placebo (P < 0.01). In a post hoc analysis of the combined endpoint and mortality in subgroups defined according to baseline treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers, valsartan had a favorable effect in patients.

### Real-world treatment patterns of sacubitril/valsartan: a longitudinal cohort study in Germany [^113cTBdi]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Low credibility.

Of the patients prescribed 50 mg b.i.d. or 100 mg b.i.d. at index, more than 80% of those who were up-titrated were able to maintain a stable higher dose in the first 6 months post-index. Only 10% of patients prescribed a dose of 200 mg b.i.d. at index were down-titrated to a stable lower dose. Overall, 62% of patients had no change in their sac/val dose during the 6 months of follow-up.

The mean (SD) time to first up-titration was 54 (44) days, while the mean time to reach the target dose varied from 79 (44) days to 57 (47) days for patients on 50 mg b.i.d. and 100 mg b.i.d. at index, respectively (P < 0.001). No notable differences in the time to first titration were observed across specialties at index.

During the 6-month post-index period, 26% of patients receiving their first prescription from a cardiologist were prescribed the target dose of 200 mg b.i.d. compared with 19% of patients with GP prescribers and 20% with prescribers in other specialties at index (P < 0.001). From the 7609 eligible patients who were using ACEI in the pre-index period or who were RAAS-naïve, only 21% were prescribed the ACEI target dose. Among pre-index RAAS-naïve and low-dose ACEI patients, around 72% to 74% were initiated on sac/val 50 mg b.i.d. compared to 65% of patients on the pre-index ACEI target dose. The proportion of patients with sac/val 50 mg b.i.d. dose at index decreased with the increasing ACEI dose strata at baseline, whereas the proportion of patients prescribed the sac/val target dose (200 mg b.i.d.) during the first 6 months increased.

### Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^111d4khd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Dose once daily. Titrate up to a maximum dose of 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. Amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used as add-on or switch therapy for patients not adequately controlled on any two of the following antihypertensive classes: calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics. These tablets may be substituted for their individually titrated components.

- **General considerations**: Dose once daily. The dosage may be increased after two weeks of therapy. The full blood pressure-lowering effect is achieved two weeks after reaching the maximum dose of amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. The maximum recommended dose is 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg.

- **Add-on/switch therapy**: Amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used for patients not adequately controlled on any two of the following antihypertensive classes: calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics. A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions to an individual component while on any dual combination may switch to tablets containing a lower dose of that component to achieve similar blood pressure reductions.

- **Replacement therapy**: These tablets may be substituted for the individually titrated components.

### Patient, provider, and practice characteristics associated with sacubitril/valsartan use in the United States [^116gWYm9]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend sacubitril/valsartan for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; however, the rate of adoption in the United States has been slow. Using data from CHAMP-HF (Change the Management of Patients With Heart Failure), we described sacubitril/valsartan use and identified patient, provider, and practice characteristics associated with its use. Patients were considered to be on sacubitril/valsartan if they were prescribed it before enrollment or initiated on it at the baseline visit. Patients with a contraindication to sacubitril/valsartan and practices with fewer than 10 patients enrolled were excluded.

Of 4,216 patients from 121 sites, 616 (15%) were prescribed sacubitril/valsartan, 2,506 (59%) an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and 1,094 (26%) neither. Patients prescribed sacubitril/valsartan were younger (63 years versus 66 years for ACE inhibitor/ARB and 69 years for neither, P < 0.001), less likely to have chronic kidney disease (15% versus 17% for ACE inhibitor/ARB and 30% for neither, P < 0.001), more likely to have cardiac resynchronization therapy (12% versus 7% for both ACE inhibitor/ARB and neither, P < 0.001), and had a lower ejection fraction (27% versus 30% for both ACE inhibitor/ARB and neither, P < 0.001). Larger practices, based on the number of cardiologists and advanced practice providers, were associated with the highest sacubitril/valsartan use. After multivariable adjustment, the number of advanced practice providers was still significantly associated with sacubitril/valsartan use.

### National trends in the use of sacubitril/valsartan [^1146rnWe]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

A better understanding of recent sacubitril/valsartan prescription patterns may help identify factors that influence its use. The aim of the study was to characterize sacubitril/valsartan use and dosage patterns nationally.

- **Methods and results**: We conducted a population-level cohort study using IQVIA Inc. National Prescription Audit™ data in the United States from August 2016 to July 2019. Over three years, there was a 5.6-fold increase in the number of sacubitril/valsartan prescriptions dispensed per month, totaling 3.3 million prescriptions. For the most recent year, this extrapolates to a best-case scenario of 13.8% of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction using sacubitril/valsartan, representing at most one-half of those eligible for sacubitril/valsartan use. During the most recent year, 48.7% of dispensed prescriptions were for the lowest strength (24/26 mg), and only 20.6% for the target strength (97/103 mg). A greater proportion of the target strength was used in younger patients (< 65 years: 24.6%; ≥ 85: 11.1%; P < 0.0001). Cardiologists prescribed 59.0% of all dispensed prescriptions, and non-cardiologists showed a greater increase (7.5-fold vs 4.9-fold; P < 0.0001) over time.

- **Conclusions**: Recent use of sacubitril/valsartan has increased greatly in the United States; however, a substantial proportion of eligible patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction did not receive treatment, and only 1 in 5 prescriptions dispensed were for the target strength. Further exploration of barriers to the use of sacubitril/valsartan and its dosing is necessary.

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^114Z9GUx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials, however, provides a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.

Studies with amlodipine and valsartan tablets have evaluated their safety in over 2,600 patients with hypertension; over 1,440 of these patients were treated for at least 6 months, and over 540 of these patients were treated for at least 1 year. Adverse reactions have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy.

The hazards of valsartan [see Warnings and Precautions (5)] are generally independent of dose. Those of amlodipine are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily peripheral edema) and dose-independent phenomena, with the former being much more common than the latter.

The overall frequency of adverse reactions was neither dose-related nor related to gender, age, or race. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation due to side effects occurred in 1.8% of patients treated with amlodipine and valsartan tablets and 2.1% in the placebo-treated group. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with amlodipine and valsartan tablets were peripheral edema (0.4%) and vertigo.

### Antihypertensive effects of double the maximum dose of valsartan in African-American patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and albuminuria [^115Vg4yx]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

The blood pressure (BP)-lowering response to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade in hypertensive African-Americans is typically less than in whites. This study aims to determine whether higher than conventional doses of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade can improve BP reduction in African-American patients.

Hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria were enrolled: 110 African-Americans (BP = 150/87 mmHg, aged 57.5 ± 11 years) and 281 non-African-Americans (BP = 151/89 mmHg, aged 57.7 ± 11 years). All patients received valsartan 160 mg once daily in the morning for 4 weeks, after which patients were randomized to one of three valsartan doses: 160, 320, or 640 mg/day (2x the maximal recommended dose) for 26 weeks. If at week 6 the target BP (< 130/80 mmHg) was not achieved, other add-on antihypertensives were allowed.

The predominant BP (DeltaSBP/DeltaDBP) reduction was observed within 4 weeks and was lower in African-Americans (7.8 ± 15/4.5 ± 9 mmHg) than in non-African-Americans (8.9 ± 14/6.6 ± 1 mmHg, P < 0.05). A greater reduction in urinary albumin excretion was observed with higher doses (320 or 640 mg); however, the responses were similar between African-Americans and non-African-Americans. The use of add-on antihypertensives was higher in African-American patients (56%) compared to non-African-American patients (36%), with a similar rate across the three valsartan doses. From weeks 4 to 26, the reduction in BP was lesser (P < 0.05) for African-American patients than non-African-American patients at the 160-mg dose, but this was not the case with the 320 and 640 mg doses.

### Effect of baseline and changes in systolic blood pressure over time on the effectiveness of valsartan in the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial [^114QUifL]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2008). Low credibility.

Low systolic blood pressure (SBP) is a risk factor for adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). Valsartan improved morbidity rates in the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) despite a reduction in SBP. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the SBP-lowering effects of valsartan and its cardiovascular protective effects in this population.

- **Methods and results**: Baseline measurements and changes in SBP at 4 months were related to mortality and morbidity rates. The effects of valsartan on these endpoints were compared in quartiles of baseline SBP with multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. These included a test for interaction between the effects of valsartan treatment and baseline SBP, and examined the effects of changes in SBP on the valsartan effect. The mean ± SD baseline SBP in all patients (n = 5010) was 124 ± 18 mm Hg. Patients in the lowest quartile of SBP (SBP ≤ 110 mm Hg; mean SBP 102 mm Hg; n = 940) had more severe HF and a significantly increased adjusted risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.43; P = 0.02), first morbid event (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.40; P = 0.001), and hospitalization for HF (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.73; P < 0.001) than patients in the upper 3 quartiles of baseline SBP (mean SBP 130 mm Hg; n = 3260). Valsartan reduced SBP in patients in the upper three quartiles but not in patients in the lowest quartile who had a baseline SBP < 110 mm Hg. Valsartan was associated with decreases in the risks of the first morbid event (HR, 0.74; 95% CI).

### Effects of telmisartan 80 mg and valsartan 160 mg on ambulatory blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension [^112uRFYB]. Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

This trial investigated and compared the antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan and valsartan, two angiotensin II receptor blockers, used in monotherapy at their maximum recommended dose in hypertensive patients.

- **Methods**: We studied 70 subjects (32 men and 38 women) aged 47.6 ± 12.2 (mean ± SD) years, with mild to moderate essential hypertension. They were randomly assigned to receive monotherapy with either telmisartan (80 mg) or valsartan (160 mg), in the form of a single daily tablet upon awakening. Blood pressure was measured by ambulatory monitoring every 20 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes at night for 48 consecutive hours before and after 3 months of treatment. Physical activity was simultaneously monitored every minute by wrist actigraphy to calculate accurately the diurnal and nocturnal means of blood pressure on a per-subject basis.

- **Results**: There was a highly significant blood pressure reduction during the 24 hours with both drugs. The blood pressure reduction in the 24-hour mean was significantly larger for valsartan 160 mg (18.6 and 12.1 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively) than for telmisartan 80 mg (10.8 and 8.4 mmHg; P < 0.001 between treatment groups). There was also a highly significant reduction (P < 0.001) of 6.5 mmHg in the 24-hour mean of pulse pressure after valsartan administration only. The trough-to-peak ratio and the smoothness index were slightly higher in systolic, but similar in diastolic blood pressure, for telmisartan as compared to valsartan.

Despite a shorter half-life, 160 mg/day valsartan…

### Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^115XFS1K]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypotension in volume- or salt-depleted patients**: Excessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was observed in 1.7% of patients treated with the maximum dose of amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg). This is in comparison to 1.8% of patients receiving valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (320 mg/25 mg), 0.4% of patients on amlodipine/valsartan (10 mg/320 mg), and 0.2% of patients on hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine (25 mg/10 mg) in a controlled trial involving patients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as those who are volume- or salt-depleted and receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur when receiving angiotensin receptor blockers. It is important to correct this condition before administering amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide.

Amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide have not been studied in patients with heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or those undergoing surgery or dialysis. Valsartan, when given to patients with heart failure or post-myocardial infarction, often results in a reduction in blood pressure. However, following dosing instructions usually prevents the need for discontinuation due to continuing symptomatic hypotension. In heart failure patients involved in controlled trials, hypotension occurred in 5.5% of those treated with valsartan, compared to 1.8% of those given a placebo. In the Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (VALIANT), hypotension experienced by post-myocardial infarction patients led to permanent discontinuation of treatment.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^116NuM1A]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Studies suggest that bedtime dosing of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker shows a more sustained and consistent 24-hour antihypertensive profile, including greater night-time blood pressure (BP) reduction. We compared the antihypertensive effects of morning (a.m.) and evening (p.m.) dosing of valsartan on 24-hour BP.

This 26-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study evaluated the efficacy and safety of valsartan 320 mg, dosed a.m. or p.m., versus lisinopril 40 mg (a.m.), a long-acting ACE inhibitor, in patients with grade 1–2 hypertension and at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. Patients (n = 1093; BP = 156 ± 11/91 ± 8 mmHg; 62 years, 56% male, 99% white) received (1:1:1) valsartan 160 mg a.m. or p.m. or lisinopril 20 mg a.m. for 4 weeks, then force-titrated to double the initial dose for 8 weeks. At Week 12, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg was added for 14 weeks if office BP was more than 140/90 mmHg and/or ambulatory BP more than 130/80 mmHg.

Mean 24-hour ambulatory SBP change from baseline to Weeks 12 and 26 was comparable between valsartan a.m. (-10.6 and -13.3 mmHg) and p.m. (-9.8 and -12.3 mmHg) and lisinopril (-10.7 and -13.7 mmHg). There was no benefit of valsartan p.m. versus a.m. on night-time BP, early morning BP, and morning BP surge. Evening dosing also did not improve BP lowering in patients requiring add-on HCTZ or in nondippers at baseline. All treatments were well tolerated.

Once-daily dosing of valsartan 320 mg results in equally effective 24-hour BP efficacy, regardless of administration time.

### Diovan HCT [^1113xfL6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dose once daily. Titrate as needed to a maximum dose of 320/25 mg. It may be used as add-on or switch therapy for patients not adequately controlled on any of the components (valsartan or HCTZ). It may also be substituted for titrated components.

- **General considerations**: The usual starting dose is Diovan HCT 160/12.5 mg once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 320/25 mg tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure. Maximum antihypertensive effects are attained within 2 to 4 weeks following a change in dose [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

- **Add-on therapy**: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with valsartan (or another ARB) alone or hydrochlorothiazide alone may be switched to combination therapy with Diovan HCT. A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may switch to Diovan HCT containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions. The clinical response to Diovan HCT should be subsequently evaluated, and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 320/25 mg.

- **Replacement therapy**: Diovan HCT may be substituted for the titrated components.

- **Initial therapy**: Diovan HCT is not recommended as initial therapy in patients with intravascular volume depletion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Use with other antihypertensive drugs**: Diovan HCT may be administered in conjunction with other antihypertensive agents.

### Diovan [^113QPHt4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Valsartan inhibits the pressor effect of angiotensin II infusions. An oral dose of 80 mg inhibits the pressor effect by about 80% at peak, with approximately 30% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. No information on the effect of larger doses is available. The removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a 2- to 3-fold rise in plasma renin and a consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients. Minimal decreases in plasma aldosterone were observed after the administration of valsartan; very little effect on serum potassium was observed. In multiple-dose studies in hypertensive patients with stable renal insufficiency and patients with renovascular hypertension, valsartan had no clinically significant effects on glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction, creatinine clearance, or renal plasma flow. In multiple-dose studies in hypertensive patients, valsartan had no notable effects on total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, fasting serum glucose, or uric acid.

- **Pharmacokinetics - Absorption**: In healthy volunteers, valsartan peak plasma concentration is reached 2 to 4 hours after dosing. Valsartan shows bi-exponential decay kinetics following intravenous administration, with an average elimination half-life of about 6 hours. The absolute bioavailability for Diovan is about 25% (range 10% to 35%). The bioavailability of the suspension [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] is 1.6 times as great as with the tablet. AUC and Cmax values of valsartan increase approximately linearly with increasing dose.

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^1125n87P]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Clinical studies**: Amlodipine and valsartan tablets were investigated in two placebo-controlled and four active-controlled trials involving hypertensive patients. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a total of 1012 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension received treatment with three combinations of amlodipine and valsartan (5/80, 5/160, 5/320 mg), amlodipine alone (5 mg), valsartan alone (80, 160, or 320 mg), or placebo. All doses, with the exception of the 5/320 mg dose, were initiated at the randomized dose. The high dose was titrated to that dose following a week at a dose of 5/160 mg. At week 8, the combination treatments were statistically significantly superior to their monotherapy components in reducing diastolic and systolic blood pressures.

	- In another double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 1246 patients with mild to moderate hypertension received treatments consisting of two combinations of amlodipine and valsartan (10/160, 10/320 mg), amlodipine alone (10 mg), valsartan alone (160 or 320 mg), or placebo. Except for the 10/320 mg dose, treatment was initiated at the randomized dose. The high dose was begun at a dose of 5/160 mg and titrated to the randomized dose after one week. At week 8, the combination treatments were statistically significantly superior to their monotherapy components in reducing diastolic and systolic blood pressures.

### Time to achieve blood pressure goal: Influence of dose of valsartan monotherapy and valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy [^111UHtRn]. American Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Our objective was to assess the time to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals with incremental doses of valsartan alone and together with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in patients with uncomplicated hypertension.

- **Methods**: This analysis pooled patient-level data from nine randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled trials (N = 4278) of once-daily valsartan 80 mg, 160 mg, and 320 mg, as well as valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 80/12.5 mg, 160/12.5 mg, 160/25 mg, 320/12.5 mg, and 320/25 mg. Kaplan-Meier methods estimated the cumulative proportion of patients achieving BP < 140/90 mm Hg over 8 weeks and the median time to BP goal. The HCTZ 12.5-mg and 25-mg doses were pooled for the time-to-goal analysis in patients receiving combinations with valsartan 160 mg or 320 mg.

- **Results**: Overall, the median time-to-goal was 8.1 weeks with valsartan 160 mg, 6.1 weeks with valsartan 320 mg, 2.6 weeks with valsartan 160 mg/HCTZ, and 2.1 weeks with valsartan 320 mg/HCTZ. In patients with stage 2 hypertension, the median time-to-goal was 4.3 weeks with valsartan 160 mg/HCTZ and 2.4 weeks with valsartan 320 mg/HCTZ. Goal rates by Week 4 for valsartan/HCTZ exceeded rates by Week 8 with the same doses of valsartan alone. Overall, the proportion that achieved BP goal by Week 8 was 32.6% with valsartan 80 mg, 48.4% with valsartan 160 mg, 54.2% with valsartan 320 mg, 74.6% with valsartan 160 mg/HCTZ, and 84.8% with valsartan 320 mg/HCTZ, versus 24.2% with placebo. With valsartan 320 mg/HCTZ, 75.8% of stage 2 patients and 94% of stage 1 patients reached BP goal by Week 8.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^116Re8jT]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

- **Results**

- **Patient disposition and baseline characteristics**: A total of 1,291 patients were enrolled in the placebo run-in phase for 2 weeks, among whom 1,093 patients received valsartan a.m. (n = 366), valsartan p.m. (n = 370), or lisinopril as a morning dose (n = 357). Of these, 950 (86.9%) patients completed the study, with the proportion of completers being similar among the three groups. The primary reasons for discontinuation were distributed similarly across the three groups, with adverse events, withdrawal of consent, unsatisfactory therapeutic effect, and protocol violations being the most frequently reported.

Most patients in the three treatment groups were white (approximately 99%) and male (55.6%). The mean age was 61.5 years, with 45.5% of patients aged at least 65 years. At baseline, the maSBP and maDBP were 143.0 and 84.1 mmHg, respectively. The treatment groups were well balanced at baseline with respect to the duration of hypertension, prior antihypertensive treatments including ACE inhibitors or ARBs, presence of isolated systolic hypertension, cardiovascular risk factors, and baseline ambulatory BP measures.

### Effects of the angiotensin II receptor blockers telmisartan versus valsartan on the circadian variation of blood pressure: impact on the early morning period [^11746Xcz]. American Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring has shown that BP typically declines by 10% to 20% during sleep and increases fairly rapidly in the early morning period. Because the early morning period has been associated with both loss of hypertension control and increased rates of myocardial infarction and stroke, there has been interest in evaluating the effects of antihypertensive therapy at this particular time of day. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a long half-life (telmisartan, 24 h) versus intermediate half-life (valsartan, 6 to 9 h) on early morning BP in two scenarios: after an active dose and following a missed dose of each agent.

- **Methods**: The study was a double-blind, randomized trial that compared telmisartan (40 to 80 mg once daily) versus valsartan (80 to 160 mg once daily) on early morning BP in 490 patients with hypertension. Ambulatory BP recordings were performed at baseline following a placebo period and again after 6 and 8 weeks of double-blind therapy in a randomized crossover design. The monitored patients received either an active dose or a placebo dose (to mimic a "missed" dose). The primary study endpoint was reduction in the BP in the early morning period (last 6 h of the dosing period).

- **Results**: After the active dose, telmisartan reduced the BP during the last 6 h of the dosing period by -11/-7.6 ± 0.8/0.6 mm Hg compared to -8.7/-5.8 ± 0.8/0.6 mm Hg on valsartan (P = .02 for systolic BP and .01 for diastolic BP). On the day of the missed dose, telmisartan reduced the early morning BP by -9.0/-6.3 ± 0.7/0.6 mm Hg.

### Effect of valsartan added to background ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with heart failure: results from Val-HeFT [^112WQSbc]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2004). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of valsartan in the Valsartan-Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) when added to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) alone in patients with heart failure (HF).

Subjects in Val-HeFT receiving ACEi but not beta-blocker at baseline were analyzed; 1532 participants were assigned to valsartan and 1502 to placebo. Primary outcome events, such as all-cause mortality, hospitalization for adjudicated heart failure, sudden death with resuscitation, and the need for more than four hours of parenteral therapy for worsening heart failure, were monitored.

Mortality was not affected by valsartan; however, morbidity endpoints were significantly reduced (36.3% in placebo vs. 31.0% in valsartan, p = 0.002) in patients receiving an ACEi without a beta-blocker. Quality of life (QOL) significantly improved, ejection fraction (EF) increased, left ventricular (LV) diameter reduced, and plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptide, norepinephrine, and aldosterone were significantly lower with valsartan compared to placebo. The morbidity benefit was significant in patients on ACEi doses below the median (22% reduction, p = 0.003) but not statistically significant in those receiving ACEi doses above the median (14% reduction, p = 0.143).

Valsartan reduces heart failure hospitalizations and slows LV remodeling in patients treated with an ACEi in the absence of beta-blockade, particularly in those on lower doses of ACEi.

### The neprilysin pathway in heart failure: a review and guide on the use of sacubitril/valsartan [^1163Z3ot]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Sacubitril/valsartan should not be prescribed in conjunction with another angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or renin inhibitor due to the risk of renal impairment and hyperkalemia, nor with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, because of the risk of renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and angioedema. Due to the potential risk of angioedema when used concurrently with an ACE inhibitor, sacubitril/valsartan must not be started for at least 36 hours after discontinuing an ACE inhibitor. Patients and caregivers should dispose of any remaining doses to prevent accidental ingestion.

- **Prescribing guidelines**: The starting dose of sacubitril/valsartan is 49 mg/51 mg taken twice daily. This dosage should be reduced for certain groups. The dose should be doubled every 2–4 weeks as tolerated by the patient, up to the maximum dose of 97 mg/103 mg twice daily.

Patients should also be prescribed other evidence-based medications such as beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, ivabradine, and digoxin. Additionally, devices like cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) should be considered as appropriate for the patient's condition.

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^112ZwXAK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g. on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide the selection of therapy.

Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets may be used in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on either monotherapy. Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.

The choice of Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets as initial therapy for hypertension should be based on an assessment of potential benefits and risks, including whether the patient is likely to tolerate the lowest dose of Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets.

### Novel doses of sacubitril/valsartan in patients unable to tolerate traditional therapy: Effects on N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide levels [^115fj9K5]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

In the PARADIGM-HF trial, a 20% reduction in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure (HF) led to the approval of sacubitril/valsartan (S/V) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2015 and the European Commission in November 2015. Furthermore, S/V earned designation as the first-line therapy in a focused update of the ACC/AHA guidelines for the treatment of HF and the European HF clinical practice guidelines. After a run-in phase ensuring all patients tolerated enalapril 10 mg twice daily, patients switched to S/V 49/51 mg twice daily, with a goal dose of 97/103 mg twice daily. Ultimately, the FDA approved three doses: 23/24 mg (low dose), 49/51 mg, and 97/103 mg (high dose).

Subsequent to the PARADIGM-HF trial, many post-hoc analyses were conducted to investigate hypotension with S/V. While patients were more likely to experience hypotension in the run-in phase with S/V therapy compared to ACE inhibitors, they still derived benefits from S/V therapy. Although the dose of S/V used was among the standard dosing, subsequent "real-world" studies also indicate a significant increase in hypotensive episodes with S/V compared to ACE inhibitors. Thus, despite estimates of profound benefits to HF patients, in clinical practice, many cannot tolerate high doses of S/V or even the smallest approved dose of 24/26 mg twice daily due to factors including hypotension. This issue is particularly pronounced in older patients. The question remains whether lower doses are an effective solution.

### Real-world treatment patterns of sacubitril/valsartan: A longitudinal cohort study in Germany [^116CMPy5]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Low credibility.

A multivariate analysis revealed that patients younger than 75 years, male, received an initial sacubitril/valsartan dose of 100 mg b.i.d., and used ACEI, ARB, BB, MRA, lipid-lowering drugs, oral diuretics, or novel oral anticoagulants in the 12 months pre-index had a significantly lower risk of therapy discontinuation.

Among the 8,226 patients with a record of 12 months of pre- and post-index activity, high compliance with sacubitril/valsartan (PDC > 80%) was observed during 12 months post-index; this increased with the sacubitril/valsartan dose at index (80% PDC for 50 mg b.i.d., 83% for 100 mg b.i.d., and 85% for 200 mg b.i.d.). The same trend was observed for compliance stratified by the maximum dose reached by 6 months post-index (77% PDC for 50 mg b.i.d., 82% for 100 mg b.i.d., and 85% for 200 mg b.i.d.; data not shown).

- **Compliance measurement**:
	- Compliance with sacubitril/valsartan during 12 months post-index was stratified by sacubitril/valsartan dose at index. The proportion of days covered (PDC) was calculated as the total days' supply of sacubitril/valsartan divided by the length of the treatment period, with overlapping days' supply removed. The term "b.i.d". refers to "twice daily".

Among RAAS-naïve patients, the mean compliance was estimated to be 77.2%, which is significantly lower than the compliance in non-naïve patients (81.4%) (P < 0.001).

### Prexxartan [^111uQJKH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Valsartan inhibits the pressor effect of angiotensin II infusions. An oral dose of 80 mg inhibits the pressor effect by about 80% at peak, with approximately 30% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. No information on the effect of larger doses is available. Removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a 2- to 3-fold rise in plasma renin and a consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients. Minimal decreases in plasma aldosterone were observed after the administration of valsartan; there was very little effect on serum potassium.

	- In multiple-dose studies in hypertensive patients with stable renal insufficiency and patients with renovascular hypertension, valsartan had no clinically significant effects on glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction, creatinine clearance, or renal plasma flow. Additionally, in multiple-dose studies in hypertensive patients, valsartan had no notable effects on total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, fasting serum glucose, or uric acid.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: For an equivalent dose, Prexxartan has 86% higher peak concentration (Cmax) and a 25% higher area under the plasma concentration over time curve (AUC) for valsartan compared to Diovan. The AUC and Cmax of valsartan increase approximately linearly with increasing dose over the clinical dosing range. Valsartan does not accumulate appreciably in the plasma following repeated administration.

	- **Absorption**: Prexxartan Cmax is achieved 0.7 to 3.7 hours after dosing.

	- **Effect of food**: A high-fat, high-calorie meal decreased the AUC of Prexxartan by approximately…

### Sacubitril/valsartan initiation among veterans who are renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor naïve with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^116mq1hY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

At the 6-month follow-up, a minority (23.5%) of sacubitril/valsartan initiators were at ≥ 50% of the target daily dose recommended by the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America HF Guideline Update, compared with approximately half of ACEI (43.2%) and ARB (47.1%) initiators. Although Greene et al. in the CHAMP-HF (Change the Management of Patients with Heart Failure) study similarly found that most HFrEF patients were titrated to less than target doses of ACEI, ARB, or sacubitril/valsartan at any point during 12 months of follow-up, initiation or dosing increases were higher for patients on sacubitril/valsartan (10%) versus an ACEI or ARB (7%).

The lack of titration is not unique to sacubitril/valsartan, and there are several possible explanations. First, early on, when there was less guidance for healthcare providers, it may have been common to prescribe lower than target doses. Our exploratory analysis examined whether provider specialty seen on the index date, a proxy for provider familiarity with sacubitril/valsartan, was related to sacubitril/valsartan dose. Our results suggest that veterans seen in primary care, where there may be lower familiarity with sacubitril/valsartan (versus cardiology), were prescribed lower doses of sacubitril/valsartan at baseline and follow-up.

Second, lower sacubitril/valsartan doses may have been chosen because of perceived benefit at lower doses, as supported by evidence from a post hoc PARADIGM-HF analysis. However, any dose reduction from the target dose in the post hoc analysis, regardless…

### Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade with 80 and 160 mg valsartan in healthy, normotensive subjects [^115sCKKQ]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2001). Low credibility.

An 80 mg dose once or twice daily is the dose of valsartan frequently administered for the treatment of hypertension. The target dose selected for the Val-HeFT trial in patients with chronic heart failure is 160 mg twice daily. The level and time course of angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1))-receptor blockade achieved by 160 mg valsartan have not been reported.

- **Methods and results**: Seven normotensive healthy subjects were assigned in random order to receive a single dose of placebo, 80 mg valsartan, and 160 mg valsartan at 7- to 10-day intervals. AT(1)-receptor blockade level (%) was determined by the pressure response to administration of exogenous angiotensin II. The pressure response to angiotensin II was measured at baseline and 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after oral administration of placebo, 80 mg valsartan, and 160 mg valsartan. Both 80 mg and 160 mg valsartan resulted in a significant and similar level of AT(1)-receptor blockade at 2 and 6 hours compared with placebo. The 160 mg dose resulted in a significantly greater level of AT(1)-receptor blockade than 80 mg at 12 and 24 hours.

- **Conclusions**: During the first 6 hours after oral administration of 80 mg and 160 mg valsartan, the level of AT(1)-receptor blockade is similar. However, only 160 mg valsartan provides sustained AT(1)-receptor blockade over 24 hours.

### Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^113B8cmV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Valsartan, when administered as an oral solution, is primarily recovered in feces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose). Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 L/h, and its renal clearance is 0.62 L/h (about 30% of total clearance).

- **Hydrochlorothiazide**: The estimated absolute bioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide after oral administration is about 70%. Peak plasma hydrochlorothiazide concentrations (Cmax) are reached within 2 to 5 hours after oral administration. There is no clinically significant effect of food on the bioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide. Hydrochlorothiazide binds to albumin (40% to 70%) and distributes into erythrocytes. Following oral administration, plasma hydrochlorothiazide concentrations decline biexponentially, with a mean distribution half-life of about 2 hours and an elimination half-life of about 10 hours. About 70% of an orally administered dose of hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated in the urine as unchanged drug.

- **Specific populations - Geriatric**: Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine, resulting in increased peak plasma levels, elimination half-life, and AUC. Exposure (measured by AUC) to valsartan is higher by 70%, and the half-life is longer by 35% in the elderly compared to the young. Limited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and hypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers.

### Prexxartan [^111dhvfZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

There are no trials of valsartan demonstrating reductions in cardiovascular risk in patients with hypertension, but at least one pharmacologically similar drug has demonstrated such benefits.

There was essentially no change in heart rate in valsartan-treated patients in controlled trials.

- **Pediatric hypertension**: The antihypertensive effects of valsartan were evaluated in two randomized, double-blind clinical studies. In a clinical study involving 261 hypertensive pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years, patients who weighed less than 35 kg received 10, 40, or 80 mg of valsartan daily (low, medium, and high doses, respectively), and patients who weighed 35 kg or more received 20, 80, and 160 mg of valsartan daily (low, medium, and high doses, respectively). Renal and urinary disorders, along with essential hypertension with or without obesity, were the most common underlying causes of hypertension in children enrolled in this study.

	- At the end of 2 weeks, valsartan reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, the three dose levels of valsartan significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by -8, -10, and -12 mmHg from the baseline, respectively. Patients were re-randomized to either continue receiving the same dose of valsartan or were switched to placebo. In patients who continued to receive the medium and high doses of valsartan, systolic blood pressure at trough was -4 and -7 mmHg lower, respectively, than in patients who received the placebo treatment. In patients receiving the low dose of valsartan, systolic blood pressure at trough was similar to that of patients who received the placebo.

### Atacand [^111DJrpw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil and losartan potassium at their highest recommended doses administered once daily were compared in two randomized, double-blind trials. In a total of 1,268 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were not receiving other antihypertensive therapy, candesartan cilexetil 32 mg lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2 to 3 mm Hg on average more than losartan potassium 100 mg, when measured at the time of either peak or trough effect. The antihypertensive effects of twice-daily dosing of either candesartan cilexetil or losartan potassium were not studied.

The antihypertensive effect was similar in men and women and in patients older and younger than 65. Candesartan was effective in reducing blood pressure regardless of race, although the effect was somewhat less in blacks (usually a low-renin population). This has been generally true for angiotensin II antagonists and ACE inhibitors.

In long-term studies of up to 1 year, the antihypertensive effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil was maintained, and there was no rebound after abrupt withdrawal.

There were no changes in the heart rate of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil in controlled trials.

- **Pediatric**: The antihypertensive effects of Atacand were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to < 6 years old and 6 to < 17 years of age in two randomized, double-blind multicenter, 4-week dose-ranging studies. There were 93 patients 1 to < 6 years of age, 74% of whom had renal disease, that were randomized to receive an oral dose of candesartan cilexetil su…

### 2021 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure [^112349Xq]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of heart failure, specifically concerning renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, the ESC 2021 guidelines recommend initiating sacubitril/valsartan as a replacement for an ACE inhibitor. This substitution aims to reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization and death in patients with NYHA class II-IV HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 40%).

### Potential implications of expanded US Food and Drug Administration labeling for sacubitril/valsartan in the US [^112tVUJC]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded labeling for sacubitril/valsartan for use in individuals with chronic heart failure (HF) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) lower than normal. The population-level implications of implementing sacubitril/valsartan at higher LVEF ranges are unknown. While the Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ARB Global Outcomes in HF With Preserved Ejection Fraction (PARAGON-HF) trial did not meet its primary endpoint, the trial may provide useful information in projecting expected clinical events among treated individuals.

The objective of this study is to quantify newly eligible treatment candidates for sacubitril/valsartan under the expanded FDA labeling and to apply treatment effects and the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one worsening HF event derived from subgroups of the PARAGON-HF trial who fall under the revised FDA label.

Newly eligible treatment candidates were estimated by mapping the LVEF distribution from 559,520 adult patients hospitalized between 2014 and 2019 in the Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure registry to adults self-identifying with HF in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2015 to 2018). The NNT with three years of treatment for three endpoints of interest (total HF hospitalizations, total HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death, and total HF hospitalizations and urgent HF visits and cardiovascular death) were estimated from the PARAGON-HF trial. Data were analyzed from February to June 2021.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^115yvo6X]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The main limitation of this study was the inability to precisely determine when the patients went to bed and when they awoke, as patient diaries were not maintained. To correct for imprecise daytime and nighttime periods, narrower windows for the daytime (8 a.m. to 10 p.m.) and nighttime (12 a.m. to 6 a.m.) periods were used. Further, comparisons between morning and evening dosing of valsartan were limited to the maximum dose (320 mg); comparisons of lower doses may have shown a similar response, provided the drugs are given in doses that have a complete 24-hour duration of action.

In conclusion, in patients with grade 1–2 hypertension, treatment with valsartan can be given once a day, regardless of the dosing time, to effectively lower BP throughout the 24-hour period, including the nighttime and early morning periods.

### Dose-response to sacubitril/valsartan in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^115Bnw4h]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

Doses of sacubitril/valsartan (Sac/Val) achieved in clinical trials of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are often not reached in clinical practice.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to investigate associations among Sac/Val doses and changes in prognostic biomarkers, health status, and cardiac remodeling among individuals with HFrEF through 12 months of treatment with Sac/Val administered per usual care.

- **Methods**: A total of 794 persons with HFrEF (ejection fraction [EF] ≤ 40%) were categorized according to average daily doses of Sac/Val divided into tertiles. Change from baseline to 12 months in biomarkers (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, soluble ST2, atrial natriuretic peptide, urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-23 scores, and parameters of cardiac reverse remodeling (left ventricular EF, indexed left atrial and ventricular volumes, and E/e') were assessed.

- **Results**: The average daily dose was 112 mg in Tertile 1 (low dose), 342 mg in Tertile 2 (moderate dose), and 379 mg in Tertile 3 (high dose). Similar changes in prognostic biomarkers were observed in all dose tertiles. Gains in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-23 scores were comparable regardless of dose category. Consistent reverse cardiac remodeling occurred in all dose categories; the median absolute left ventricular EF improvement across HF dose groups was 9.3%, 8.7%, and 10.2% for low, moderate, and high doses, respectively. Similar improvements in left atrial and ventricular volumes were observed.

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^111kJXwz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Valsartan shows biexponential decay kinetics following intravenous administration, with an average elimination half-life of about 6 hours. The recovery is mainly as unchanged drug, with only about 20% of the dose recovered as metabolites. The primary metabolite, accounting for about 9% of the dose, is valeryl 4-hydroxy valsartan. In vitro metabolism studies involving recombinant CYP 450 enzymes indicated that the CYP 2C9 isoenzyme is responsible for the formation of valeryl-4-hydroxy valsartan. Valsartan does not inhibit CYP 450 isozymes at clinically relevant concentrations. Because of the low extent of metabolism, CYP 450-mediated drug interactions between valsartan and coadministered drugs are unlikely.

Valsartan, when administered as an oral solution, is primarily recovered in feces (about 83% of the dose) and urine (about 13% of the dose). Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 L/h, and its renal clearance is 0.62 L/h (about 30% of total clearance).

- **Amlodipine and valsartan tablets**: Following oral administration of amlodipine and valsartan tablets in normal healthy adults, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan and amlodipine are reached in 3 and 6 to 8 hours, respectively. The rate and extent of absorption of valsartan and amlodipine from amlodipine and valsartan tablets are the same as when administered as individual tablets. The bioavailabilities of amlodipine and valsartan are not altered by the coadministration of food. Amlodipine and valsartan tablets may be administered with or without food.

### Novel doses of sacubitril/valsartan in patients unable to tolerate traditional therapy: Effects on N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide levels [^111WvKtH]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

The widespread use of angiotensin receptor blocker and neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) remains low, with many patients unable to tolerate the medication due to hypotension at the currently recommended starting dose.

- **Hypothesis**: The aim of this study is to assess if lower than standard doses of ARNI, sacubitril/valsartan (S/V), significantly reduce NT-proBNP and lead to any change in diuretic dose, serum potassium, or creatinine.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective study of 278 patients who were started on a low dose of S/V at a single medical center, 45 patients were selected for the study cohort. Patients were subcategorized into three groups:
	- Group 1 (n = 10): very low dose S/V (half a tab of 24/26 mg BID)
	- Group 2 (n = 10): very low dose titrated to low dose S/V
	- Group 3 (n = 25): low dose S/V (24/26 mg BID)

	- NT-proBNP, diuretic dose, serum potassium, and creatinine were compared before and after the initiation of S/V.

- **Results**: Among all groups, there was a significant reduction in NT-proBNP level (Group 1: p < 0.01, Group 2: p < 0.01, and Group 3: p < 0.001). Additionally, there was a significant reduction in diuretic dose across all groups combined (furosemide 53 mg/day vs. 73 mg/day; p = .03), with 17.8% (8/45) of patients being able to discontinue their diuretic completely. There was no significant change in potassium or creatinine.

- **Conclusions**: Lower than standard doses of S/V significantly reduce NT-proBNP and diuretic requirements without changes in potassium or creatinine, providing hope that patients who cannot tolerate standard doses of S/V due to hypotension may still receive treatment.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^112FgYDX]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) follows a circadian rhythm, with BP levels falling during sleep and increasing in the early morning hours in most individuals. In patients with hypertension, a lack of fall in night-time BP (i.e. nondipping) and/or a marked rise or surge in BP during the early morning hours is associated with a higher incidence of stroke and an increased risk for other cardiovascular complications, especially among the elderly. This has led some researchers to recommend the dosing of antihypertensive agents in the evening or bedtime hours in patients with hypertension in order to preserve the normal circadian pattern of BP. An ideal antihypertensive agent would be one that retains its efficacy throughout the 24-hour period while also effectively restoring the normal circadian BP pattern, such as the reduction in BP at night.

Several studies with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, both agents that reduce the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activity, have reported improvements in night-time BP and a reduction in the early morning rise in BP with bedtime dosing compared with traditional dosing upon awakening. The benefit of night-time dosing might be related to the incomplete 24-hour action of a once-daily antihypertensive when given in the morning, even though the agent is approved for single daily use. Better BP lowering with night-time dosing, however, has been reported for both short- and longer-acting ACE inhibitors and ARBs, and hence it is not merely a pharmacokinetic effect.

### Real-world treatment patterns of sacubitril/valsartan: A longitudinal cohort study in Germany [^112KxiS7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Low credibility.

Patients on the pre-index target ACEI dose presented slightly higher rates of down-titration following up-titration to the target dose compared to patients with low pre-index ACEI doses (90% vs. 84%) and similar to that observed in RAAS-naïve patients (89%). Patients who were on the pre-index ACEI target dose had a marginally shorter time to the first sac/val dose titration and time to individual maximum dose compared to those with low ACEI doses (< 50% target dose) [mean (SD): 51.9 (43.8) days vs. 55.3 (44.2) days, and 60.7 (46.6) days vs. 64.4 (47.1) days, respectively]. Times to first sac/val up-titration and to the individual maximum dose observed in pre-index ACEI target dose patients are very similar to those observed in RAAS-naïve patients [mean (SD): 53.6 (40.5) days and 60.8 (42.8) days, respectively].

- **Persistence and compliance analyses**: Among the 22,275 patients with 12 months of pre-index activity, sac/val persistence at 12 months was estimated to be 71%. In the majority of cases where discontinuation of sac/val therapy was observed, this happened within the first 90 days after index. Persistence at 12 months was similar across the different specialties prescribing sac/val at index, while time to discontinuation was shorter for patients prescribed sac/val 50 mg b.i.d. at index (77 days) than those prescribed 100 mg b.i.d. and 200 mg b.i.d. at index (110 days and 111 days).

### Initiating sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) in heart failure: Results of TITRATION, a double-blind, randomized comparison of two uptitration regimens [^115gqLfX]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

This multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study comprised three phases: (i) a 1-week screening phase; (ii) a sacubitril/valsartan run-in phase lasting approximately 1 week (Day 1–5); and (iii) a randomized phase lasting approximately 11 weeks.

As both treatment arms started with sacubitril/valsartan 50 mg (sacubitril 24 mg and valsartan 26 mg) twice daily, the run-in phase was open-label to simplify the study. Patients were then randomized to one of the two blinded treatment arms. The 'condensed' uptitration arm comprised uptitration from 50 mg twice daily to 200 mg twice daily over 3 weeks (including the run-in phase). The 'conservative' uptitration arm involved uptitration from 50 mg twice daily to 200 mg twice daily over 6 weeks (including the run-in phase). A double-dummy design was used to preserve blinding.

Patients were stratified according to the dose of ACEI/ARB at screening, pre-specified as follows: 'High-dose' received a total daily dose > 160 mg of valsartan or > 10 mg of enalapril, or equivalent doses of other ARBs or ACEIs. 'Low-dose' received a total daily dose ≤ 160 mg of valsartan or ≤ 10 mg of enalapril, or equivalent doses of other ARBs or ACEIs at screening.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^1145CA8X]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The pharmacologic rationale for more effective blood pressure (BP) lowering with evening dosing of antihypertensive therapy presupposes the inability of morning dosing to effectively lower BP at night and during the early morning period. However, this cannot be supported, as studies that evaluated morning versus evening administration of amlodipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker (circulating half-life > 24 h), reported no benefit of evening versus morning dosing.

The question remains: did the use of higher doses of valsartan (160, 320 mg) in this study help to maintain the 24-hour BP-lowering effect, whereas the use of lower or suboptimal doses would have exposed a weakness in morning dosing? Support for this comes from a study wherein less-effective BP lowering at the end of the dosing period was reported with either morning or evening administration when using a low dose of a RAAS blocker.

Alternatively, the benefit of evening dosing of antihypertensive therapy, particularly for angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), may be related to the need for more effective RAAS blockade during the evening period, as RAAS activity is increased during the night. For example, a previous study demonstrated more effective nighttime control of BP with evening administration of quinapril and was associated with a more sustained decline in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity.

In contrast, a study with valsartan, even though it was not conducted in patients with hypertension, demonstrated similar levels of RAAS blockade at the end of the dosing period in patients with heart failure, irrespective of whether valsartan was administered in the morning or evening.

### Initiating sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) in heart failure: Results of TITRATION, a double-blind, randomized comparison of two uptitration regimens [^1153LSch]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

To assess the tolerability of initiating and uptitrating sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) from 50 to 200 mg twice daily (target dose) over 3 and 6 weeks in heart failure patients (ejection fraction ≤ 35%), a study was conducted with specific methods and criteria.

The study began with a 5-day open-label run-in phase where sacubitril/valsartan was administered at 50 mg twice daily. This was followed by an 11-week double-blind randomization period with two regimens: the 'condensed' regimen (100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 200 mg twice daily) and the 'conservative' regimen (50 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, 100 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, followed by 200 mg twice daily). Patients were stratified by their pre-study dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB); this included a low-dose stratum with ACEI/ARB-naïve patients.

Out of 540 patients entering run-in, 498 (92%) were randomized and 429 (86.1% of randomized) completed the study. The pre-defined tolerability criteria included hypotension, renal dysfunction, hyperkalemia, and adjudicated angioedema. These occurred in ('condensed' vs. 'conservative') 9.7% vs. 8.4% (P = 0.570), 7.3% vs. 7.6% (P = 0.990), 7.7% vs. 4.4% (P = 0.114), and 0.0% vs. 0.8% of patients, respectively.

Corresponding proportions for pre-defined systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg, serum potassium levels ≥ 5.5 mmol/L, and serum creatinine > 3.0 mg/dL were 8.9% vs. 5.2% (P = 0.102), 7.3% vs. 4.0% (P = 0.097), and 0.4% vs. 0%, respectively. In total, 378 (76%) patients achieved and maintained sacubitril/valsartan 200 mg twice daily without dose interruption or down-titration over 12 weeks (77.8% vs. 84.3% for 'condensed' vs. 'conservative'; P = 0.078).

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose sacubitril/valsartan in heart failure patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114zGKoH]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

- **Efficacy outcomes**: The outcomes related to heart failure (HF) hospitalization and all-cause mortality were reported in three studies. High-dose sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the risk of HF hospitalization (OR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.27–0.61, p < .0001, Figure 2A) and the risk of all-cause mortality (OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.11–0.47, p < .0001, Figure 2B) compared with low-dose sacubitril/valsartan, with no heterogeneity (I² = 0%). Improvements in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification were also presented in three trials. However, there were no significant differences in the improvements of NYHA between the groups receiving low-dose and high-dose sacubitril/valsartan (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.15–2.35, p = .45, I² = 77%, Figure 2C).

	- Changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were shown in four studies. The mean increase in LVEF was marginally greater in the high-dose cohort compared with the low-dose cohort (mean difference [MD]: 2.73%, 95% CI: −2.24% to 7.7%, p = .28, I² = 99%, Figure 2D). Notably, in a subset analysis of two studies with the largest contrast in daily dose (400 mg vs. 100 mg), there was no significant difference in the mean increase in LVEF between patients receiving 400 mg daily and those receiving 100 mg daily (MD: 5.5%, 95% CI: −1.56% to 12.55%, p = .13, I² = 100%, Supporting Information: Figure S1).

	- Additionally, four trials reported on the outcome of NT-proBNP. No distinct differences in changes of NT-proBNP were observed between patients with high-dose sacubitril/valsartan and those with low-dose sacubitril/valsartan (MD: 43.09, 95% CI: −28.41 to 114.59, p = .24, I² = 0%, Figure 2E).

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^1129NKHF]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

This study confirms the once-daily use of valsartan for blood pressure (BP) lowering, irrespective of whether it is administered as a morning or evening dose. This is in accordance with earlier reports that showed similar effects of valsartan 160 mg on nocturnal BP and 24-hour systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), independent of dosing time.

The findings, however, are contrary to previous studies with valsartan that reported improvements in BP lowering, particularly with nocturnal BP in nondippers (i.e. increase the proportion of nondippers to dippers and increase the daytime to nighttime BP ratio) with nighttime dosing. The differing findings may be explained by the use of 320 mg valsartan, the maximum approved daily dose, as the BP-lowering effect in nondippers in our study was similar, irrespective of whether valsartan was administered as a morning or evening dose.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^116JgBwq]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). High credibility.

The discussion highlights that blood pressure (BP) varies considerably throughout the day following a circadian rhythm. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decrease during sleep and rise rapidly with morning activity. It is crucial that a once-daily antihypertensive medication administered in the morning maintains BP control throughout both daytime and nighttime, especially towards the end of the dosing interval to cover early morning hours. This has led to recommendations for administering antihypertensive agents, particularly angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), at bedtime to ensure coverage during the nighttime and early morning. Although clinical evidence supports this practice, the pharmacologic rationale for such a recommendation with an antihypertensive previously demonstrating effective 24-hour BP lowering remains uncertain.

A randomized, multicenter clinical trial involving over 1000 patients with hypertension was conducted to explore this hypothesis. The study demonstrated that the timing of valsartan administration, whether morning or night, did not impact BP control. Valsartan was found to provide effective BP lowering in patients with grade 1–2 hypertension and additional cardiovascular risks, comparable to the long-acting ACE-inhibitor lisinopril. Over a 24-hour period, valsartan showed effective BP reductions similar to those produced by 40 mg of lisinopril, regardless of whether it was dosed in the morning or at night. This was applicable to nighttime BP lowering and limiting the early morning BP rise, as well as other ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) measures such as day/night BP ratio and morning BP surge.
