## Question

What is the difference between subendocardial ischemia and a nstemi

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how subendocardial ischemia differs from NSTEMI and how they relate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological relationship and where they overlap or diverge. Next, I will compare biomarkers and ECG patterns to separate reversible ischemia from infarction. After that, I should confirm management implications and how therapy differs. Finally, I will consider nuances like type 2 MI and occlusive MI that can present without classic ST elevation, and synthesize a succinct clinical takeaway.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate a pathophysiologic pattern with a clinical diagnosis. Subendocardial ischemia describes a distribution of ischemia that preferentially involves the inner myocardial layer and may be transient and reversible if perfusion is restored, often manifesting as widespread ST-segment depression and/or T-wave changes on ECG, though I should be careful because ECG patterns can be variable and context dependent [^113hgQsm]. By contrast, NSTEMI is a clinical syndrome within ACS defined by a rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, plus clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischemia by symptoms, ECG, imaging, or angiography; troponin testing is required to distinguish NSTEMI from unstable angina, especially when there is no ST elevation on ECG [^112fpq23] [^113MXVPV] [^111QnpBh]. Hold on, I should verify the troponin criterion explicitly: yes, the universal definition requires a dynamic change with at least one value above the 99th percentile in addition to ischemic evidence [^112fpq23].

> Now, I will examine the pathophysiologic relationship. In many NSTEMIs, the underlying mechanism is non-occlusive plaque rupture or erosion with downstream thrombosis causing subendocardial infarction, meaning subendocardial ischemia that lasts long enough progresses to necrosis in the subendocardium, which is typical for NSTEMI histopathology [^114mEU8G] [^112fpq23]. Wait, if I say "all NSTEMIs are subendocardial", that's too absolute; I should correct that. Although the prototypical NSTEMI is subendocardial, a subset of patients classified clinically as NSTEMI can have an occlusive infarct with subtle or non-diagnostic ST elevation patterns, including LCX-related events, so transmural injury can occasionally occur without classic ST elevation on the ECG, reminding me not to overgeneralize histology from ECG labels [^114rht7p] [^112gj29N].

> Next, I should review how to diagnostically separate subendocardial ischemia without necrosis from NSTEMI. The discriminator is cardiomyocyte necrosis evidenced by troponin kinetics: unstable angina with subendocardial ischemia has symptoms and possibly ischemic ECG changes but does not meet the troponin rise/fall threshold above the 99th percentile; NSTEMI has the same ischemic context plus the required troponin dynamics indicating necrosis [^113MXVPV] [^112fpq23]. I need to ensure ECG interpretation is not over-weighted: ST depression or T-wave inversion can be seen in both, so serial high-sensitivity troponin using 0/1 h or 0/2 h algorithms is critical to rule in or rule out NSTEMI in NSTE-ACS presentations [^111QnpBh] [^115wc2F7]. Let me double-check that the initial assessment integrates history, vitals, ECG, and troponins together for risk stratification: yes, that's the ESC 2023 framework [^113Yc72b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should explicitly distinguish reversible from irreversible injury. Subendocardial ischemia without measurable necrosis corresponds clinically to unstable angina, whereas once there is myocyte death documented by troponin rise/fall above the 99th percentile in an ischemic context, the diagnosis becomes MI, which in the absence of persistent ST elevation is NSTEMI [^113MXVPV] [^1122UDY6]. I should confirm that there is no absolute troponin value that differentiates STEMI from NSTEMI; rather, the diagnosis depends on ECG pattern and ischemic evidence alongside troponin kinetics, which is correct [^1122UDY6].

> Next, I should review management implications because mislabeling affects therapy. If there is subendocardial ischemia without necrosis, anti-ischemic therapy and antiplatelet therapy may be used with risk stratification, and an urgent invasive approach is individualized rather than routine. Once NSTEMI is diagnosed, guideline-directed care includes dual antiplatelet therapy for type 1 MI, high-intensity statins, anticoagulation during the acute phase, and an early invasive strategy for high-risk patients, with angiography generally within 24 hours in NSTE-ACS with high-risk features; IV nitroglycerin is indicated for ongoing ischemia, HF, or hypertension, while immediate-release nifedipine without beta-blocker should be avoided [^112pYfo9] [^113fb6dS] [^1123TN3u] [^1129zmg6]. Wait, I should confirm indications for early revascularization in high-risk NSTEMI: yes, multiple guidelines support early invasive therapy to reduce events in high-risk patients, including those with HF or elevated risk scores [^113HPrmp] [^113fb6dS].

> But wait, what if the troponin-positive NSTE-ACS is a type 2 MI driven by supply–demand imbalance rather than plaque rupture. I need to ensure I differentiate type 1 vs type 2 pathophysiology, because DAPT and routine invasive strategies are less clearly beneficial in type 2 MI, and treatment should focus on correcting the precipitant (e.g., tachyarrhythmia, anemia, hypoxia, sepsis) while evaluating for underlying CAD when appropriate [^111zLE3L] [^117KDdFL]. I should double-check that misclassifying type 2 MI as NSTEMI type 1 can lead to inappropriate antithrombotic intensity and procedural risk, which is a recognized problem, particularly in complex inpatients, including those with COVID-19 where myocardial injury and T2MI are prevalent [^111ZDmwR] [^111zLE3L].

> Next, I should review ECG nuances to avoid anchoring bias. Diffuse horizontal ST depression with reciprocal ST elevation in aVR often reflects global subendocardial ischemia, but occlusion MI can hide within "NSTEMI" when the infarct-related artery is the LCX or diagonal branch, producing non-classic or subtle ECG changes; such patients may still have large areas at risk and benefit from urgent invasive management despite the absence of diagnostic ST elevation, underscoring the need for integrated risk assessment and close monitoring [^113hgQsm] [^114rht7p] [^113fb6dS]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should verify that certain NSTEMI phenotypes like LCX "N-wave" patterns carry STEMI-like risk and may merit expedited revascularization, which has been suggested in observational work, albeit with lower credibility and requiring clinical judgment [^112gj29N].

> Finally, let me synthesize the core difference and make sure it aligns with definitions and management. Subendocardial ischemia is a pathophysiological and ECG descriptive pattern that may be transient and reversible; NSTEMI is a clinical diagnosis requiring biomarker evidence of myocardial necrosis in an ischemic context, most commonly reflecting subendocardial infarction, though exceptions exist and classification should not be solely ECG-based [^114mEU8G] [^112fpq23]. The critical discriminator is the presence of a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin with at least one value above the 99th percentile plus evidence of ischemia; without this biomarker pattern, the syndrome remains unstable angina with subendocardial ischemia rather than NSTEMI, guiding less aggressive antithrombotic and invasive strategies, while confirmed NSTEMI generally warrants guideline-directed antithrombotics and an early invasive approach tailored to risk and etiology [^112fpq23] [^113Yc72b] [^113fb6dS].

---

Subendocardial ischemia is **reversible ischemia** of the inner myocardium without necrosis, typically showing ST depression or T-wave inversion on ECG and normal troponin [^113Yc72b]. NSTEMI is **irreversible necrosis** from prolonged ischemia, defined by a rise/fall of troponin above the 99th percentile [^112fpq23] with ischemic symptoms or ECG changes, but without persistent ST elevation [^111QnpBh]. Thus, subendocardial ischemia is a functional, reversible state, while NSTEMI is a structural, irreversible injury requiring urgent evaluation and management [^113fb6dS].

---

## Pathophysiological differences

Subendocardial ischemia is a **reversible oxygen supply–demand mismatch** in the subendocardium, often due to transient coronary narrowing, vasospasm, or increased demand (e.g. tachycardia, hypertension, anemia) [^113Yc72b]. NSTEMI reflects **irreversible necrosis** from prolonged ischemia, usually from partial coronary occlusion or severe supply–demand mismatch, with myocyte death and troponin release [^113dtKcZ].

---

## Clinical presentation

Clinically, **subendocardial ischemia** presents with transient chest discomfort or angina, often exertional or stress-related, relieved by rest or nitrates, and symptoms are typically brief and reversible [^113HPrmp]. NSTEMI typically presents with **prolonged chest pain** or discomfort — often at rest or with minimal exertion — not fully relieved by rest or nitrates, and may be accompanied by dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, or syncope [^112Vyp9r] [^113Yc72b].

---

## Electrocardiographic findings

On ECG, **subendocardial ischemia** shows transient ST depression or T-wave inversion that resolves with relief of ischemia, without persistent ST elevation [^113hgQsm]. NSTEMI may show **ST depression, T-wave inversion**, or nonspecific changes, without persistent ST elevation; the ECG can also be normal [^112fpq23].

---

## Biomarker differences

Regarding biomarkers, **subendocardial ischemia** shows no significant troponin elevation because there is no necrosis, whereas **NSTEMI** shows elevated troponin (rise and/or fall with at least one value above the 99th percentile), indicating necrosis [^111QnpBh].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

| **Parameter** | **Subendocardial ischemia** | **NSTEMI** |
|-|-|-|
| Clinical symptoms | Transient, reversible ischemic symptoms | Prolonged ischemic symptoms |
| ECG findings | Transient ST depression or T-wave inversion | ST depression, T-wave inversion, or nonspecific changes |
| Cardiac biomarkers | Normal troponin levels | Elevated troponin levels |
| Myocardial necrosis | Absent | Present [^113MXVPV] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Regarding management, **subendocardial ischemia** is treated with anti-ischemic therapy (nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers), risk factor modification, and close monitoring; urgent invasive intervention is not indicated unless progression occurs [^112Vyp9r]. NSTEMI requires **urgent evaluation and an early invasive strategy** (angiography and possible revascularization) in high-risk patients; dual antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and guideline-directed medical therapy are essential [^113fb6dS] [^1157AyYy].

---

## Prognostic differences

Prognostically, **subendocardial ischemia** generally has a favorable outlook because there is no necrosis, whereas **NSTEMI** carries a higher risk of adverse outcomes, including recurrent MI, heart failure, and death, due to necrosis; overall prognosis depends on infarct size, comorbidities, and management [^114MNqKw].

---

Subendocardial ischemia is a **reversible supply–demand mismatch without necrosis**, while NSTEMI is **irreversible necrosis with elevated troponin**; distinguishing them guides appropriate management and prognosis [^113MXVPV].

Clinically, myocardial infarction (MI) is defined by the presence of acute myocardial injury as detected by abnormal cardiac biomarkers, such as cardiac troponins (cTn), presenting with symptoms of myocardial ischemia accompanied by an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), imaging, or angiographic findings.

- **Diagnosis of NSTEMI**: The diagnosis of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is covered in extensive detail elsewhere, including European and US clinical practice guidelines. In summary, in NSTEMI, a 12-lead ECG may show a depressed ST-segment or T-wave inversion, whereas in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), an ECG shows persistent (> 20 minutes) ST-segment elevation or a new left bundle-branch block. Cardiac troponin testing, in combination with an ECG, has become an essential tool for accurately diagnosing MI and is mandatory for patients showing characteristics of a NSTEMI on ECG. The cardiac troponin test enables the distinction between NSTEMI and unstable angina and is therefore an important aid in risk stratification and treatment decisions.

Cardiac troponin is a specific cardiac structural protein associated with myocyte injury of any type. Although elevated blood cardiac troponin is not specific to acute coronary events, cardiac troponin testing is highly sensitive in detecting small amounts of myocardial necrosis. In a study examining the utility of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays, more high-risk patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with unspecified chest pain were identified and admitted to the hospital than when conventional cardiac troponin assays were used.

### Cardiac troponin at the point of care in acute and chronic coronary syndromes [^112fpq23]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025).

Acute coronary syndromes encompass a spectrum of acute conditions, including ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and unstable angina. These presentations share a common underlying pathophysiology, with the majority due to coronary atherosclerotic plaque rupture with thrombosis resulting in myocardial ischaemia. The mortality rate of acute coronary syndromes is highest within hours of symptom onset, and prompt diagnosis can facilitate the timely delivery of life-saving treatments that improve prognosis.

The electrocardiogram is essential for differentiating STEMI from NSTEMI, while measuring cardiac troponin is required to rule in or rule out myocardial infarction in those without ST-segment elevation and to differentiate NSTEMI from unstable angina. For a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin is required, with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL). This must be in addition to one of the following: symptoms of myocardial ischaemia, new ischaemic changes on the electrocardiogram, the development of pathological Q-waves, imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality, or identification of atherothrombosis on coronary angiography.

The term chronic coronary syndrome is more recent and encompasses a range of clinical presentations due to diseases of the coronary arteries and/or microcirculation, resulting in structural or functional abnormalities that lead to transient myocardial ischaemia.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^117W5CtN]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The incidence of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) relative to ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has increased since the 1980s. This increase in NSTEMI is likely due to advances in medical care and technology that have facilitated the care of older patients with multiple comorbidities and the availability of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays for diagnosing myocardial injury. Currently, NSTEMI accounts for 60%–70% of myocardial infarction (MI) hospitalizations. About two-thirds of those diagnosed with NSTEMI are men, although the proportion of women presenting with NSTEMI has increased in recent years.

NSTEMI is more common than STEMI, though the proportion of patients with STEMI is higher for type 1 MI than type 2. A meta-analysis of observational studies comparing type 1 and type 2 MI showed that 70.0% of the 2,683 patients with type 2 MI were diagnosed with NSTEMI compared to 44.1% of 23,189 patients with type 1 MI. A prospective study of consecutive patients meeting the MI definition found that 96.7% of the 144 patients with type 2 MI had NSTEMI, compared to 67.3% of the 397 patients with type 1 MI. However, it should be noted that a modified definition of type 2 NSTEMI was used, which included clinical criteria related to underlying conditions causing oxygen supply-demand imbalance.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, particularly in prognostic assessment, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend considering the presence and magnitude of troponin elevations for short- and long-term prognosis. It is advisable to obtain BNP to provide additional prognostic information.

### Prevalence, predictors, and outcomes of type 2 NSTEMI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^117KDdFL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Non–ST‐segment‐elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is a subtype of acute coronary syndrome that results from either partial or total occlusion of coronary artery blood flow. The majority of NSTEMI cases are due to partial, flow‐limiting occlusions, rather than total obstructions. While type 1 myocardial infarction (MI) is characterized primarily by intracoronary atherothrombotic plaque rupture, a type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI) occurs due to an oxygen supply and demand mismatch in the absence of acute atherothrombosis. T2MI can occur in the setting of fixed atherosclerosis without plaque rupture, alone or in combination with coronary vasospasm, sustained tachyarrhythmias, severe hypertension, severe bradyarrhythmias, respiratory failure, or severe anemia, among other causes.

Comorbid risk factors for patients with T2MI include anemia, sepsis, chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure (HF), hypertension, and arrhythmias. T2MI has been associated with higher mortality when compared to type 1 myocardial infarction and typically occurs in patients who are older, more often female, and with a higher prevalence of cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities.

Since the early stages of the COVID‐19 pandemic, a reported cardiovascular complication with associated adverse outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection has been myocardial injury, characterized as acute or chronic. Acute myocardial injury is defined as a significant elevation of cardiac troponin above the 99th percentile upper reference limit.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^111zLE3L]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Advances in cardiovascular (CV) imaging, redefined electrocardiogram criteria, and high-sensitivity CV biomarker assays have enabled more differentiated etiological classification of myocardial infarction (MI). Type 1 MI has a different underlying pathophysiology than type 2 through type 5 MI; type 1 MI is characterized primarily by intracoronary atherothrombosis, while the other types are defined by a variety of mechanisms, which may occur with or without an atherosclerotic component. In type 2 MI, there is evidence of myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance unrelated to acute coronary atherothrombosis. Types 1 and 2 MI are spontaneous events, whereas type 4 and type 5 are procedure-related, and type 3 MI is identified only after death.

Most type 1 and type 2 MI present as non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI), although both types can also present as ST-elevation MI. Because of their differing underlying etiologies, type 1 and type 2 NSTEMI present different prognoses and should be managed differently. This article discusses the epidemiology, prognosis, and management of NSTEMI occurring with underlying type 1 or type 2 pathophysiology. Notably, most NSTEMI (65%-90%) are type 1 MI. Patients with type 2 MI often have multiple comorbidities, and causes of in-hospital mortality among these patients are not always CV-related. It is important to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 NSTEMI early in the clinical course to enable the use of the most appropriate treatments, which will provide the greatest benefit for these patients.

Regarding medical management for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically concerning nitrates, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend administering IV nitroglycerin in patients with NSTEMI for the treatment of persistent ischemia, heart failure, or hypertension.

### What US cardiology can learn from the 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^113fb6dS]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The spectrum of clinical presentations, electrocardiographic findings, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin levels in patients with acute coronary syndrome requires thorough assessment. The initial ACS assessment incorporates the electrocardiogram, physical examination, clinical history, vital signs, and high-sensitivity troponin trends.

- **Electrocardiogram assessment**: An ST elevation MI is readily apparent from the electrocardiogram. Patients with NSTE-ACS, however, should be divided into those with very high-risk features and those without such features. Very high-risk features include hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock, ongoing chest pain refractory to medical management, acute heart failure presumed secondary to ongoing myocardial ischemia, life-threatening arrhythmias or cardiac arrest after presentation, mechanical complications, or dynamic electrocardiographic changes suggestive of ischemia.

- **Intervention strategies**: Patients with STEMI require immediate angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as appropriate, or thrombolysis if timely PCI is not feasible. Similarly, NSTE-ACS patients with very high-risk features require urgent intervention. For NSTE-ACS without very high-risk features, angiography should be considered within the initial 24 hours. The results of angiography determine the need for PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Long-term medical therapy and lifestyle measures, with an emphasis on smoking cessation, are vital considerations thereafter.

### The evolution of electrocardiographic changes in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^113FeZKa]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a not uncommon diagnosis in the emergency department. During ST-segment elevation AMI (STEMI), the electrocardiogram (ECG) typically follows a progression of abnormality, beginning with hyperacute T waves and culminating with ST-segment elevation; pathologic Q waves can appear early and/or late in the process. Other findings include T-wave inversion and ST-segment depression, which can occur before, during, or after the STEMI event. The evolution of ECG through these changes can occur rapidly after coronary artery occlusion. The emergency physician should be aware of the ECG findings that characterize the evolution of a STEMI, with a sound understanding of the associated pathophysiology and clinical implication. This review discusses the changing ECG during an AMI. The pathogenesis of these findings is discussed. Finally, the clinical implications at each stage are reviewed.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically in relation to cardiac troponin, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend using an ESC algorithmic approach. This consists of serial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurements at 0 hour/1 hour or 0 hour/2 hours to rule in and rule out NSTEMI.

### Non-st-segment-elevation myocardial infarction: When is rapid revascularization critical [^115B8ADs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains a devastating event in patients with cardiovascular disease worldwide. Among patients suffering an AMI, non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is approximately twice as common as ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The efficacy of immediate reperfusion in the setting of STEMI is well established and consistent with the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic plaque rupture/erosion and thrombosis. In patients with NSTEMI, the efficacy of an invasive strategy with revascularization in appropriate patients is also well established. However, in contrast to STEMI, the optimal timing of invasive coronary angiography and revascularization in NSTEMI is controversial, with some evidence that high-risk patients benefit from an early invasive strategy.

Thus, guidelines recommend an early invasive strategy within 24 hours of hospital admission in patients with NSTEMI and a high-risk profile, in particular, a GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) risk score > 140. However, the recent 2020 European Society of Cardiology guidelines acknowledge that there is a gap in evidence of NSTEMI care concerning the optimal timing of angiography and revascularization, and further research is needed.

The original VERDICT (Very Early Versus Deferred Invasive Evaluation Using Computerized Tomography) trial, which was a multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial, evaluated the optimal timing of invasive coronary angiography in patients with non–ST-segment–elevation acute coronary syndromes (n = 2147). The majority, but…

### Myocardial infarction classification and its implications on measures of cardiovascular outcomes, quality, and racial/ethnic disparities [^11444XZq]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Type 1 myocardial infarction (MI) can be further divided into two classifications: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). STEMI is defined as an acute coronary thrombosis or persistent ST-segment elevation of ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 2 contiguous electrocardiographic leads. NSTEMI is characterized by ischemic symptoms at rest due to an acute coronary plaque rupture or erosion, lasting ≥ 10 minutes, occurring within 24 hours before hospital admission, and displaying elevated cardiac biomarkers, such as creatine kinase or cTn, within 24 hours after initial presentation.

Prior to the introduction of the ICD-10 code for type 2 MI, patients with type 2 MI were often coded as NSTEMI or were not coded at all. While STEMI care is well defined and fairly consistent in delivery, NSTEMI management is substantially more variable across patient, clinician, facility, and regional levels. Since there is now a specific code for type 2 MI, and type 2 MI does not feature acute coronary thrombotic plaque disruption, clinicians should make concerted efforts to avoid identifying it as NSTEMI. Misidentification could adversely affect patient prognosis, treatment, and outcomes. Improved methods of distinguishing between type 1 and type 2 MI could further enhance the study of MI and the potential development of MI-specific treatments.

### Acute coronary syndromes: mechanisms, challenges, and new opportunities [^114rht7p]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

While STEMI patients proceed immediately to revascularization, risk stratification for those with NSTE-ACS remains challenging. Importantly, up to one-quarter of NSTEMI patients have coronary occlusion responsive to immediate revascularization therapy. Dedicated ACS guidelines endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology suggest guiding the timing of intervention (immediate vs. early for patients with a score of 140 points/ > 3% in-hospital mortality risk, transient ST-segment elevation, dynamic ST-segment/T-wave changes), or 'non-high' risk (absence of any risk features with low suspicion of UA).

This scheme does not fully reflect our understanding of ACS pathobiology. While ST-segment elevation on ECG indicates transmural infarction and, thus, coronary occlusion, approximately 5% of patients with STEMI have no occlusion, whereas up to 25% of NSTEMI patients have occlusive MI. Specifically, occlusion of the left circumflex artery or large diagonal branches may result in subtle ECG changes (e.g. ST-depression), often hidden to the human eye. These findings indicate the need for innovation in the triage of patients with ACS.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^112Ft58r]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

**Prevalence of type 1 and type 2 MI in NSTEMI**: Results from several studies suggest that between 65% and 90% of NSTEMI events are pathophysiologically type 1 MI, depending on the clinical setting and the diagnostic criteria used. For instance, in a prospective study involving 541 hospitalized patients, 406 (73.4%) were diagnosed with NSTEMI. Of these, 267 (65.8%) had type 1 NSTEMI, and 139 (34.2%) had type 2 NSTEMI. A single-center retrospective study of 1039 patients with a discharge diagnosis of NSTEMI reported that 775 (74.6%) had type 1 NSTEMI, while 264 (25.4%) had type 2 NSTEMI, with none having type 4 or 5 MI. Conversely, a larger prospective analysis of 19,763 hospitalizations for acute MI revealed an even greater proportion of type 1 NSTEMI. Of the 13,211 patients without ST-segment elevation, approximately 90% were diagnosed with type 1 NSTEMI, and only 10% with type 2 NSTEMI.

### Myocardial infarction classification on outcomes in nonemergent coronary artery bypass grafting [^1179z154]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Although patients with ST elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) are known to have worse outcomes than patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMIs), such differences are not well described in the subset of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. The purpose of this study is to compare postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing nonemergent coronary artery bypass grafting within one week after an STEMI versus NSTEMI.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was performed on patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting between one and seven days from an MI from 2008 to 2012. Postoperative outcomes, including mortality and composite postoperative morbidity for patients with STEMI versus NSTEMI, were compared within each group.

- **Results**: Of the 446 patients undergoing nonemergent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting between one and seven days after an MI, 122 patients (27.3%) had a STEMI. The STEMI cohort was younger with less incidence of hypertension than the NSTEMI cohort. However, aside from having a lower incidence of congestive heart failure, STEMI patients had an overall poorer cardiac status than NSTEMI patients. No differences were found in mortality, rates of major complication, length of intensive care unit stay, and length of hospital stay between STEMI and NSTEMI patients.

- **Conclusion**: Despite differences in preoperative characteristics and pathophysiology of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting between one and seven days after NSTEMI versus STEMI, no difference was found in early surgical outcomes.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^112pYfo9]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is an essential first-line component of guideline-recommended type 1 NSTEMI treatment to inhibit platelet activation and thus reduce acute ischemic complications and prevent further atherothrombotic events. Dual antiplatelet therapy, consisting of a P2Y12 inhibitor plus aspirin, is indicated for patients who are initially treated with either an early invasive or medical management strategy. Dual antiplatelet therapy guidelines support the use of the P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor rather than clopidogrel in type 1 NSTEMI, regardless of whether early revascularization is performed, based on the results of the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) study.

Following successful recovery from the acute phase of an NSTEMI, patients remain at an increased risk of subsequent CV events and premature death. NSTEMI guidelines therefore recommend that dual antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor plus aspirin be continued for ≥ 12 months after the index date, after an assessment of the individual patient's ischemic and bleeding risk.

Recommendations for antiplatelet therapy are more applicable to patients with type 1 NSTEMI, as intracoronary thrombosis is absent in patients with type 2 MI. Furthermore, there is a lack of data on the use of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with type 2 NSTEMI from either randomized controlled trials or observational studies.

### Biomarkers and acute coronary syndromes: An update [^1161CdFN]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Biomarkers complement clinical assessment and the 12-lead ECG in the diagnosis, risk stratification, triage, and management of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). While there is broad consensus that cardiac troponin (cTn) I or T is the preferred biomarker in clinical practice, important uncertainties remain regarding the value of high-sensitivity cTn assays and their best clinical use, including the most appropriate timing of serial measurements. Additionally, the added value of other biomarkers reflecting and quantifying other pathophysiological signals, such as copeptin and natriuretic peptides, requires further investigation. This review addresses these aspects with a focus on the diagnostic application of biomarkers, as they are associated with immediate therapeutic consequences. Furthermore, it briefly highlights that increased diagnostic accuracy offered by high-sensitivity cTn assays has improved our understanding of the incidence, pathophysiology, and mortality of the two distinct components currently summarized under the term ACS: acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina.

### Mortality based on the presenting electrocardiogram in patients with myocardial infarction in the troponin era [^111uHmHq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Studies reporting short-term mortality in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) based on the initial electrocardiogram (ECG) are often limited by requiring an ischemic ECG for inclusion. Because few patients with normal or nonspecific findings were included, outcomes in these patients are less clear, especially in the troponin era.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients diagnosed as having MI using troponin I (TnI) over a six-year period were included and classified into eight mutually exclusive groups based on the initial ECG using standard criteria. Patients were included in only one group. The MI size was estimated using multiples of peak creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and the 30-day mortality rate was assessed.

- **Results**: Among 1,641 patients with MI, patients with ST elevation represented only 22% of all MIs. Patients with ST elevation had the largest MI size, with two of three having a peak CK-MB greater than 10 times normal. In contrast, most patients representing all the other ECG groups had a peak CK-MB less than five times normal, with approximately one of three having no CK-MB elevation and were diagnosed by TnI elevation alone. Patients could be separated into a high-risk group (ST elevation, ischemia, other, or left bundle-branch block), in which the mortality rate exceeded 9% (mean, 14%), and a lower-risk group (prior MI, left ventricular hypertrophy, nonspecific changes, and normal), in which the 30-day mortality rate averaged 6% (P < .001; range, 5.23%-7.1%).

- **Conclusions**: Specific ECG findings other than ischemia portend poor outcomes in patients with MI. Once MI is diagnosed, p

### Invasive and antiplatelet treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: Understanding and addressing the global risk-treatment paradox [^1157AyYy]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines for the treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) recommend an invasive strategy with cardiac catheterization, revascularization when clinically appropriate, and initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy regardless of whether the patient receives revascularization. However, although patients with NSTEMI have a higher long-term mortality risk than patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), they are often treated less aggressively, with those who have the highest ischemic risk often receiving the least aggressive treatment (the "treatment-risk paradox").

Here, using evidence gathered from across the world, we examine some reasons behind the suboptimal treatment of patients with NSTEMI and recommend approaches to address this issue in order to improve the standard of healthcare for this group of patients. The challenges for the treatment of patients with NSTEMI can be categorized into four "P" factors that contribute to poor clinical outcomes:

- **Patient characteristics**: Being heterogeneous.
- **Physicians underestimating**: The high ischemic risk compared with bleeding risk.
- **Procedure availability**: Limitations in access to necessary treatments.
- **Policy within the healthcare system**: Influencing treatment options and delivery.

To address these challenges, potential approaches include developing guidelines and protocols that incorporate rigorous definitions of NSTEMI, risk assessment and integrated quality assessment measures, providing education to physicians on the management of long-term cardiovascular risk in patients with NSTEMI, and making stents and antiplatelet therapies more accessible.

### Clinical features and prognosis of patients with coronary spasm-induced non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome [^11336zs3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of spasm-induced NSTE-ACS was based on the absence of a culprit lesion on coronary angiography and the following criteria:

1. Presence of ischemic ECG changes, including transient ST-segment elevation of ≥ 0.1 mV, ST-segment depression of ≥ 0.1 mV, or new appearance of negative U waves, recorded in ≥ 2 contiguous leads on the 12-lead ECG during rest angina attacks.

2. Spontaneous coronary spasm during coronary angiography, which was relieved by the administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin.

3. A positive spasm provocation test (i.e. spasm after the intracoronary injection of ACh).

We defined the culprit lesion as the site of:

- Acute coronary occlusion.
- Severe coronary artery disease of > 90% stenosis.
- Coronary artery disease with complex lesion morphology, which is responsible for ischemic symptoms, corresponding to the electrocardiographic changes or wall motion abnormality observed on transthoracic echocardiography or left ventriculography.

- **Figure caption**: Representative case of spasm-induced NSTE-ACS diagnosed by spontaneous coronary spasm during coronary angiography.
	- **A**: First coronary angiography showed severe stenosis of the middle right coronary artery.
	- **B**: Intracoronary administration of nitroglycerin resulted in complete resolution of the stenosis and vasodilation of the entire right coronary artery.

Regarding specific circumstances for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, particularly for patients with diabetes mellitus, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend initiating medical treatment in the acute phase of NSTEMI.

### Non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction with "N" wave on electrocardiogram and culprit vessel in left circumflex has a risk equivalent to ST-elevated myocardial infarction [^112gj29N]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

It was found that a delayed activation wave often appeared in the terminal QRS wave in non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with a culprit vessel in the left circumflex artery (LCX), yet little is known about the similarities among non-"N"-wave non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction (N-NSTEMI) and ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI).

- **Hypothesis**: In AMI patients with the culprit vessel in LCX, "N" wave NSTEMI has a risk equivalent to STEMI.

- **Methods**: All 874 patients admitted to Shenjing Hospital of China Medical University between January 1, 2013, and December 30, 2017, were included, and whose coronary angiography (CAG) indicated the culprit vessel in LCX. Patients were divided into three groups: ST-elevated myocardial infarction group (STEMI group, n = 322), "N" wave non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction group (N-NSTEMI group, n = 232), and non-"N"-wave NSTEMI group (non N-NSTEMI group, n = 320). The basic data and the incidence of MACE during hospitalization and 12 months were analyzed.

- **Results**: In STEMI and N-NSTEMI groups, AST, CK, CK-MB, TnI, and stenosis severity were significantly higher than non N-NSTEMI (p < 0.05). The lesions in the N-NSTEMI and STEMI groups were more often located in the proximal LCX before giving rise to OM1 of LCX (p < 0.05); however, the non N-NSTEMI group was often located in the distal LCX after giving rise to OM1 and the OM1 (p < 0.05). The incidence rates of all MACEs, all-cause death, ST, TVR, and rUAP were similar in N-NSTEMI and STEMI groups, which were greater than non N-NSTEMI (p < 0.05). Both N-NSTEMI and STEMI are independent risk factors for MACE.

### Fractional flow reserve versus angiography in guiding management to optimize outcomes in non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (FAMOUS-NSTEMI): rationale and design of a randomized controlled clinical trial [^114oZhvR]. American Heart Journal (2013). High credibility.

Specific uncertainties with angiography-guided treatment decisions in NSTEMI are evident. First, treatment decisions for nonobstructive (FFR > 0.80) culprit coronary lesions lack an evidence base to guide management. On one hand, a stent for coronary plaque rupture might reduce the risk of rethrombosis. On the other hand, optimal medical therapy with dual antiplatelet drugs and high-dose statins might suffice, and unnecessary stenting can be harmful (e.g. stent thrombosis, restenosis).

Second, in NSTEMI patients with multivessel coronary disease, evidence is lacking as to whether nonculprit obstructive lesions should undergo revascularization or not. A post hoc analysis of the contemporary large-scale ACUITY trial found that incomplete coronary revascularization was a multivariable predictor of major adverse cardiac events at one year and that the risk was related to the number of nonrevascularized lesions. In a recent analysis of NSTEMI patients in whom FFR was measured during usual care in our hospital, we found that FFR disclosure influenced cardiologists' treatment decisions.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^114r5UAu]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of NSTEMI management guidelines is to provide recommendations for the relief of ischemia during hospitalization and, in the longer term, to prevent secondary events such as reMI, events in other vascular beds, and death. All NSTEMI events should initially be diagnosed and managed in accordance with these guidelines regardless of MI type. However, NSTEMI guidelines are more suited to type 1 NSTEMI than type 2 NSTEMI. Recent guidelines for MI classification have attempted to address this by providing an algorithmic approach to understanding the mechanistic basis for the occurrence of type 2 NSTEMI to facilitate appropriate treatment.

Further studies are needed to address this unmet need in the treatment of the older, sicker patient with a type 2 NSTEMI. Given the preponderance of type 1 MI over type 2 MI in patients presenting with NSTEMI, and the increased intermediate‐ and long‐term risk of major adverse CV events relative to STEMI, aggressive strategies need to be adopted in treating these patients. These include the appropriate use of early invasive approaches, antithrombotic agents that yield the best benefit‐risk outcomes, and other guideline‐directed therapies.

On the other side, algorithms that address the multiple possible underlying causes for the myocardial oxygen supply‐demand imbalance in individual patients may be preferable for managing patients with type 2 NSTEMI. Future guidelines should include appropriate evidence‐based recommendations for the management of type 2 NSTEMI.

### Clinical utility of ventricular repolarization dispersion for real-time detection of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in emergency departments [^116K36w7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates that T-wave complexity on baseline 12-lead ECG can differentiate NSTEMI patients from UA and other non-ischemic chest pain patients very early during evaluation, while also correlating with the risk of adverse in-hospital outcomes. This is the first study to test the clinical utility of T-wave complexity to detect and risk-stratify NSTEMI patients in the ED. Our findings are novel and support the notion that global myocardial ischemia, associated with ruptured plaques and partial coronary artery occlusion, can precipitate quantifiable T-wave distortions before any ST segment displacement. This is logical because ischemic injury is most likely to alter local gradients of repolarization manifested in the T waves (i.e. phase 3 of the action potentials) before distorting the ST segment (i.e. phase 2 of the action potentials) of the ECG. Our data suggest that a simple measure of T-wave complexity is more sensitive for (1) detecting ischemic myocardial necrosis associated with NSTEMI and (2) quantifying the severity of ischemic burden to identify high-risk NSTEMI patients who would benefit from early revascularization.

- **Vrd and ischemic myocardial injury**: Myocardial ischemia induces electrophysiological alterations in action potentials, causing repolarization dispersion between normal and ischemic fibers and between epicardium and endocardium. These changes can be detected on the surface 12-lead ECG. However, despite the ongoing electrical dispersion currents during infarction (whether STEMI or NSTEMI), ST changes mainly evolve when action pot

### Great debate: The universal definition of myocardial infarction is flawed and should be put to rest [^112KEFHW]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Myocardial infarction (MI) is pathologically defined as myocardial cell death resulting from prolonged ischemia. The clinical definition of this pathological process relies on clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia and biomarker evidence of myocardial cell death. Cardiac troponins are the standard clinical biomarker for assessing cardiac cell death.

Within the framework of the universal definition of myocardial infarction (UDMI), the goal is to guide clinicians in accurately diagnosing and classifying acute MI, and distinguishing it from other forms of myocardial injury in daily practice. In the latest (Fourth) UDMI, a major effort has been made to provide:

- **A stratified pathophysiology-informed framework**: Aimed at classifying different MI types.
- **Overview of distinguishing factors**: Needed to differentiate MI from non-ischemic myocardial injury.

The development and implementation of the UDMI in its various iterations has aimed to comprehensively define MI, rather than provide an MI management guideline. This has resulted in major achievements; however, significant reservations have emerged among different stakeholders, forming the basis of this 'Great Debate' manuscript.

### Bench to bedside: Pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes and implications for therapy [^112W3UY6]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the pathophysiology of unstable angina (UA) and non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) myocardial infarction (MI), commonly referred to as NSTE acute coronary syndrome(s) (ACS), has evolved considerably over the years, with atherothrombosis playing a pivotal role. This review discusses the molecular interactions in coronary thrombosis that may serve as therapeutic targets for more effective management of these syndromes.

The purposes of this review are:

- **Understanding the pathophysiology of NSTE ACS**: To provide a comprehensive discussion of recent insights into the pathophysiology of NSTE ACS.

- **Recent studies with novel antithrombotic agents**: To describe recent studies involving novel antithrombotic agents such as low-molecular-weight heparin, thienopyridines, and glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa inhibitors in patients with NSTE ACS.

- **Recommendations for management**: To highlight recommendations for the management of patients with NSTE ACS as outlined in the recently updated American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, including the appropriate use of antithrombotic therapies.

### The electrocardiogram in the ACS patient: High-risk electrocardiographic presentations lacking anatomically oriented ST-segment elevation [^113hgQsm]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is defined as pathologic ST-segment elevation occurring in at least two anatomically contiguous leads in a patient with a clinical presentation consistent with acute myocardial infarction (AMI); these findings can suggest the need for urgent revascularization. Unfortunately, the electrocardiogram (ECG) may be nondiagnostic in a large portion of patients who initially present with AMI. Furthermore, it is now recognized that ECG patterns that do not meet the traditional diagnostic criteria for STEMI may represent significant AMI. These patterns are generally referred to as STEMI equivalent patterns in that they are caused by occlusion of an epicardial coronary artery, place significant portions of the left ventricle in jeopardy, and can result in a poor outcome if not recognized and treated appropriately.

### Invasive and antiplatelet treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: Understanding and addressing the global risk-treatment paradox [^114LTuKX]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Challenges for the treatment of patients with NSTEMI**: Patients with NSTEMI present with more heterogeneous characteristics than patients with STEMI, with a wide variation in ischemic risk and comorbid conditions, making NSTEMI more challenging to diagnose and treat in these patients. Whereas patients with STEMI typically have complete occlusion of a large epicardial coronary artery, patients with NSTEMI are often affected by multiple variable factors; including varying degrees of reduction of coronary flow, atherosclerotic changes in the vessel wall, calcification, plaque rupture, and subsequent nonocclusive intracoronary thrombus formation. Indeed, in a study of patients hospitalized with MI who underwent coronary angiography in Alberta, Canada, of the 2092 patients with MI with nonobstructive coronary arteries, 1542 (73.7%) received a diagnosis of NSTEMI, and 550 (26.3%) a diagnosis of STEMI.

- **Patient characteristics**: There is also heterogeneity in the demographics of NSTEMI patient populations across the world, as indicated by the variety of patient demographic data across different countries. This heterogeneity could partly explain the variation in mortality of patients with cardiovascular disease between countries. Furthermore, patients with NSTEMI are more likely to be older in age and have a higher rate of comorbidities, such as diabetes, impaired renal function, and lung disease, than patients with STEMI. These comorbidities contribute to a greater burden of coronary artery disease and an increased risk of cardiovascular events.

### Reproducing extracellular matrix adverse remodelling of non-ST myocardial infarction in a large animal model [^1122UDY6]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We have presented a model of NSTEMI that is triggered by multiple ligations, 2 cm apart, from the level of the first diagonal artery and parallel to the LAD to within 3–4 cm of the apex, and we compared this procedure with animals with full ligation of the first diagonal branch to induce STEMIs. As a result, following NSTEMIs, we observed patchy and non-transmural infarcts, as confirmed by ECG and histological changes in the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle.

The fourth universal definition of MI requires a rise and fall of cardiac troponin (cTn) and one other criterion from the following: symptoms of acute ischaemia, new ischaemic ECG changes, new Q-waves, loss of viable myocardium, or a new wall-motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with ischaemic aetiology via imaging. Thus, we have demonstrated that this multiple suture ligation approach results in infarcts that fulfil all of the criteria for an NSTEMI by comparing its functional response with STEMIs. We have observed a significant rise and fall of cTn over time following NSTEMI and STEMI. However, the absolute peak value of cTn does not consistently correlate with the type or size of infarction in NSTEMI; no specific cTn level differentiates STEMI from NSTEMI, but cTn values may be used for risk stratification for early intervention.

In addition, typical changes of NSTEMI on ECG in sheep reflected the standard range of changes classified as NSTEMI in the clinical setting. Moreover, histology showed definitive partial thickness myocardial necrosis and fibrosis.

Biomarkers and differential diagnosis

- **Q1: You are on rounds in the emergency department and your intern asks**: What is the main difference between non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina?

	- NSTEMI is characterized by ischaemic symptoms associated with acute cardiomyocyte injury (i.e. rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin T/I), while ischaemic symptoms at rest (or minimal effort) in the absence of acute cardiomyocyte injury define unstable angina. This translates into an increased risk of death in NSTEMI patients, while unstable angina patients are at relatively low short-term risk of death.

- **Q2: A 72-year-old patient with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia as cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) presents to the emergency department with typical chest pain of 3-hour duration**: The patient has palpitations, atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of about 120 beats per minute, ST depression on electrocardiogram (ECG), and a mild elevation in cardiac troponin (cTn), measured at twice the upper limit of normal (ULN). Is it correct to state that the underlying process is a rupture, ulceration, fissuring, or erosion of a coronary atherosclerotic plaque?

	- No. According to the universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI), two main subtypes of NSTEMI must be differentiated: Type 1 MI, characterized by any of the processes just previously described, and Type 2 MI, in which an extra-coronary condition is the main cause of imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand (e.g. tachycardia, anemia, hypertension, or hypotension). The patient described may have had.

### Troponin level at presentation as a prognostic factor among patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^113Lfp78]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Despite the prognostic implications of troponin levels in ACS, guidelines for urgent revascularization in NSTEMI patients do not incorporate this biomarker in their decision‐making process regarding treatment. In our study, we have demonstrated an association between hs‐cTnI levels upon admission and overall survival in patients diagnosed with NSTEMI. Furthermore, we identified a subgroup that is at heightened risk of mortality according to their initial hs‐cTnI level. Interestingly, this association becomes less significant when early reperfusion strategy is considered. These findings may suggest that initial hs‐cTnI levels could be an additional factor when determining reperfusion strategies in NSTEMI patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to investigate the impact of early reperfusion strategies on mortality in NSTEMI patients categorized by their initial presenting troponin levels.

### Non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction with "N" wave on electrocardiogram and culprit vessel in left circumflex has a risk equivalent to ST-elevated myocardial infarction [^115PzSvM]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

NSTEMI patients with an "N" wave in the ECG, where the LCX was the infarct-related artery, had a higher incidence of acute occlusion and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) than non-N-NSTEMI patients. However, they did not always experience more favorable clinical outcomes than patients with acute LAD or RCA occlusion. Therefore, N-NSTEMI presents a risk equivalent to acute STEMI. These NSTEMI patients, exhibiting the delayed activation wave in the absence of classic ST-segment elevation, may benefit from earlier revascularization.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^113dtKcZ]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Advances in cardiovascular (CV) imaging, redefined electrocardiogram criteria, and high‐sensitivity CV biomarker assays have enabled more differentiated etiological classification of myocardial infarction (MI). Type 1 MI has a different underlying pathophysiology than type 2 through type 5 MI; type 1 MI is characterized primarily by intracoronary atherothrombosis and the other types by a variety of mechanisms, which can occur with or without an atherosclerotic component. In type 2 MI, there is evidence of myocardial oxygen supply‐demand imbalance unrelated to acute coronary atherothrombosis. Types 1 and 2 MI are spontaneous events, while type 4 and type 5 are procedure‐related; type 3 MI is identified only after death.

Most type 1 and type 2 MI present as non‐ST‐elevation MI (NSTEMI), although both types can also present as ST‐elevation MI. Because of their different underlying etiologies, type 1 and type 2 NSTEMI have different presentation and prognosis and should be managed differently. In this article, we discuss the epidemiology, prognosis, and management of NSTEMI occurring in the setting of underlying type 1 or type 2 pathophysiology. Most NSTEMI (65%–90%) are type 1 MI. Patients with type 2 MI have multiple comorbidities and causes of in‐hospital mortality among these patients are not always CV‐related. It is important to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 NSTEMI early in the clinical course to allow for the use of the most appropriate treatments that will provide the greatest benefit for these patients.

### Does clinical presentation affect outcome among patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention? Insights from the Providing Regional Observations to Study Predictors of Events in the Coronary Tree study [^111JXVjB]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

In some prior studies, patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), as compared to patients with non-STEMI (NSTEMI), tended to have higher early mortality but similar long-term outcomes. We compared the angiographic and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) characteristics of patients with STEMI and NSTEMI in the PROSPECT study to evaluate the independent prognostic value of clinical presentation on long-term outcomes.

- **Methods**: After successful revascularization, patients had 3-vessel quantitative coronary angiography, gray scale, and radiofrequency IVUS imaging. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), which include cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization for unstable or progressive angina.

- **Results**: There were 211 patients (31.6%) with STEMI and 457 (68.4%) with NSTEMI. Patients with STEMI and NSTEMI had similar angiographic and IVUS morphologic characteristics. At 3 years, MACE occurred in 22.1% and 19.6%, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 1.16 [0.81, 1.68], P = 0.42). There was a higher overall mortality (HR 2.16 [0.94, 4.99], P = 0.06) and a significantly higher incidence of probable stent thrombosis (HR 4.34 [1.09, 17.36], P = 0.02) in the STEMI cohort. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to events related to culprit or to nonculprit lesions. ST-elevation myocardial infarction presentation was not an independent predictor of 3-year MACE (HR 1.14 [0.77, 1.67], P = 0.52).

### Timing of revascularization in patients with transient ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a randomized clinical trial [^1113APda]. European Heart Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with acute coronary syndrome who initially present with ST-elevation on the electrocardiogram but subsequently show complete normalization of the ST-segment and relief of symptoms before reperfusion therapy are referred to as transient ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and pose a therapeutic challenge. It is unclear what the optimal timing of revascularization is for these patients and whether they should be treated with a STEMI-like or a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)-like invasive approach. The aim of the study is to determine the effect of an immediate versus a delayed invasive strategy on infarct size measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR).

- **Methods and results**: In a randomized clinical trial, 142 patients with transient STEMI with symptoms of any duration were randomized to an immediate (STEMI-like) [0.3h; interquartile range (IQR) 0.2–0.7h] or a delayed (NSTEMI-like) invasive strategy (22.7h; IQR 18.2–27.3h). Infarct size as a percentage of the left ventricular myocardial mass measured by CMR at day four was generally small and not different between the immediate and the delayed invasive group (1.3%; IQR 0.0–3.5% vs. 1.5% IQR 0.0–4.1%, P = 0.48). By intention to treat, there was no difference in major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as death, reinfarction, or target vessel revascularization at 30 days (2.9% vs. 2.8%, P = 1.00). However, four additional patients (5.6%) in the delayed invasive strategy required urgent intervention due to signs and symptoms of reinfarction while awaiting angiography.

Regarding medical management for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, particularly in managing pain and anxiety, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend not using NSAIDs (except aspirin) and advise discontinuing them during hospitalization for NSTEMI if initiated before hospitalization due to the increased risk of major adverse cardiac events.

### Fractional flow reserve vs. angiography in guiding management to optimize outcomes in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: the British Heart Foundation FAMOUS-NSTEMI randomized trial [^114mEU8G]. European Heart Journal (2015). High credibility.

In invasively managed NSTEMI patients, the standard care approach involves visual interpretation of the anatomical severity of the disease disclosed by the coronary angiogram. Adoption of a physiological approach, such as the use of fractional flow reserve (FFR), to inform treatment decisions in these patients is not the standard of care, primarily due to a lack of evidence. The uncertainties surrounding FFR adoption pertain to the lack of evidence for FFR measurement in culprit arteries.

When coronary resistance is reduced by vasodilator drugs, such as adenosine, the curvilinear relationship between coronary pressure and flow becomes approximately linear in the physiological range of blood pressure. Following STEMI, vascular injury may limit microvascular vasodilation, which may affect the validity of FFR since it is a hyperaemic index by definition. In NSTEMI, the pathophysiology typically involves non-occlusive thrombotic plaque rupture and subendocardial infarction. Because FFR was measured in coronary arteries with normal blood flow, microvascular dysfunction was possibly limited, transient, or absent in the participants in this trial. The post hoc analysis of medically stabilized ACS patients in the FAME trial also supports the validity of FFR.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^113Lmxtq]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

When considering revascularization in patients presenting with NSTEMI, the risks of morbidity and mortality associated with the procedure should be weighed against its benefits in terms of short- and long-term prognosis, symptom relief, quality of life, and duration of hospital stay. Patients with type 2 NSTEMI are less likely than those with type 1 NSTEMI to undergo revascularization, and its benefit in type 2 NSTEMI has yet to be established. In addition to the absence of intracoronary thrombosis, almost half of the patients with type 2 MI do not have significant underlying CAD. Therefore, guideline recommendations for revascularization in patients with NSTEMI may be more relevant to type 1 MI. Early identification of atherothrombotic plaque disruption as the cause of the event is critical in triaging appropriate patients with type 1 NSTEMI to the cardiac catheterization lab and distinguishing it from type 2 NSTEMI.

- **Revascularization approach**: The indication for an invasive approach, the timing of revascularization (immediate, early, or delayed), and the selection of the revascularization approach (i.e. PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) in type 1 NSTEMI depend on several factors. These include the risk of a subsequent ischemic event, bleeding risk, and the clinical setting, for example, whether the patient has been admitted to a PCI center or will need to be transferred to a suitable facility. In general, guidelines recommend that in the case of multivessel CAD, the choice of CABG over multivessel PCI should be guided by the extent and complexity.

### The CRP troponin test (CTT) stratifies mortality risk in patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) [^111zkaN1]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Elevated cardiac troponin is a hallmark of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The definition of NSTEMI includes several clinical entities, such as type 1 MI, type 2 MI, and myocardial injury. Distinguishing between these entities is challenging and bears substantial implications for patient management and prognosis. Thus, definitive diagnostic tests aimed at better stratifying risk at the onset of NSTEMI development are needed.

A rapid increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations early in the development of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with worse outcomes and cardiac dysfunction. We recently described a simple diagnostic approach for identifying STEMI patients at increased risk for worse outcomes, the "CRP Troponin Test (CTT)", which is comprised of simultaneous serial measurements of both CRP and cardiac troponin during admission. However, the clinical application of this approach in patients with NSTEMI has not yet been studied.

Systemic and vascular inflammation play key roles in the development of ACS, in addition to precipitating illnesses such as infection, respiratory disease, and kidney injury. CRP is an acute phase reactant. Analyzing its concentrations in relation to circulating cardiac troponin, which implicates myocardial necrosis, might help identify "inflammatory prone" patients who demonstrate an excessive inflammatory response during an MI.

We, therefore, sought to determine the association between early CTT results and short- and long-term mortality rates in patients with NSTEMI.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^115HQB9y]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining continuous ECG monitoring and ensuring the availability of defibrillator capacity as soon as possible. This applies to all patients with suspected STEMI, in cases of suspected ACS with other ECG changes, or ongoing chest pain, and once the diagnosis of myocardial infarction is made.

### Rapid diagnosis of STEMI equivalent in patients with left bundle-branch block: Is it feasible [^115dJivP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021).

It is conceivable that patients with underlying left bundle‐branch block (LBBB) can present with AMI with either STEMI equivalent (acute occlusion of an epicardial artery) or NSTEMI equivalent physiology. LBBB distorts the surface ECG, resulting in secondary ST‐T changes that interfere with the interpretation and identification of ischemia (STEMI and NSTEMI). Whereas in the past, the presence of new or presumably new LBBB in a patient with symptoms compatible with AMI was considered a class I indication for emergent reperfusion therapy (STEMI-equivalent, also known as occlusion MI, or OMI), the 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guideline for the management of STEMI states: "A new or presumably new LBBB has been considered a STEMI equivalent. Most cases of LBBB at time of presentation, however, are 'not known to be old' because a prior ECG is not available for comparison. New or presumably new LBBB at presentation occurs infrequently, may interfere with ST‐elevation analysis, and should not be considered diagnostic of AMI in isolation".

- **European Society of Cardiology guidelines**: Acknowledge the difficulties in diagnosing STEMI equivalent in patients with LBBB. These guidelines consequently recommend that patients with a clinical suspicion of ongoing refractory myocardial ischemia, "regardless of ECG or biomarker findings", should be managed in a way similar to patients with STEMI, regardless of the presence or absence of LBBB, or whether the LBBB is previously known.

### Novel criteria for the observe-zone of the ESC 0/1h-hs-cTnT algorithm [^1177Gmn3]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

The non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommend a 3-hour cardiac troponin determination in patients triaged to the observe-zone of the ESC 0/1h-algorithm; however, no specific cutoff for further triage is endorsed. Recently, a specific cutoff for 0/3h high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) change (7 ng/L) was proposed, warranting external validation.

- **Methods**: Patients presenting with acute chest discomfort to the emergency department were prospectively enrolled into an international multicenter diagnostic study. Final diagnoses were centrally adjudicated by two independent cardiologists applying the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction, based on complete cardiac workup, cardiac imaging, and serial hs-cTnT. Hs-cTnT concentrations were measured at presentation, after 1 hour, and after 3 hours. The objective was to externally validate the proposed cutoff and, if necessary, derive and internally as well as externally validate novel 0/3h-criteria for the observe-zone of the ESC 0/1h-hs-cTnT algorithm in an independent multicenter cohort.

- **Results**: Among 2076 eligible patients, application of the ESC 0/1h-hs-cTnT algorithm triaged 1512 patients (72.8%) to either rule out or rule in NSTEMI, leaving 564 patients (27.2%) in the observe-zone (adjudicated NSTEMI prevalence, 120/564 patients, 21.3%). The suggested 0/3h-hs-cTnT change of < 7 ng/L triaged 517 patients (91.7%) toward rule-out, resulting in a sensitivity of 33.3% (95% CI, 25.5–42.2), missing 80 patients with NSTEMI.

### Prevalence, predictors, and outcomes of type 2 NSTEMI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^111ZDmwR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with T2MI and myocardial injury are frequently encountered in clinical practice and are at high risk of both major adverse cardiovascular events and noncardiac death. Differentiating T2MI from nonischemic myocardial injury is important because the underlying mechanisms of troponin release differ. T2MI is an ischemic process, and thus consideration for assessment for underlying obstructive coronary artery disease may be reasonable if not previously done. In contrast, nonischemic myocardial injury may result from many mechanisms, including myocardial strain — such as heart failure (HF), valvular heart disease, or hypertension — or direct cardiotoxicity, such as myocarditis and stress cardiomyopathy. The evaluation of nonischemic myocardial injury will often focus on a structural examination of the heart with imaging. Because upwards of 60% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 meet the definition for myocardial injury, distinguishing from T2MI with electrocardiogram (ECG), imaging, or symptoms is increasingly important both for prognostication and to provide insight into the specific mechanisms of cardiac involvement.

Given what we have learned about the pathophysiology of acute cardiac injury in COVID-19, our finding of pre-admission anticoagulation use and lower odds of T2MI can be explained. The hypercoagulable state and systemic endothelial tissue injury due to COVID-19 infection predisposes to microthrombi formation in blood vessels, including the cardiac capillaries, leading to T2MI. Furthermore, macrovascular thrombosis, such as acute pulmonary embolism leading to respiratory failure and/or increased hemodynamic stress, may also contribute to this condition.

### Stemi and nstemi: are they so different? 1 year outcomes in acute myocardial infarction as defined by the ESC/ACC definition (the opera registry) [^114vHFXe]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) redefined myocardial infarction as any amount of necrosis caused by ischaemia. The aim of this study was to describe the management and outcomes using 'real-world' data, taking the new definition of acute myocardial infarction into account.

A total of 2,151 consecutive patients (76.0% men) with a myocardial infarction were enrolled at 56 centres in France. The median delay to presentation was shorter in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) compared to non-STEMI (NSTEMI) (4 vs. 7 hours, P < 0.0001). STEMI patients were more likely to receive fibrinolysis (28.9% vs. 0.7%, P < 0.0001) or undergo PCI (71.0% vs. 51.6%, P < 0.0001) but were less likely to have bypass surgery (3.1% vs. 4.9%, P < 0.05). At discharge, patients with STEMI received more aggressive secondary prevention therapies than those with NSTEMI, which was not supported by differences in disease severity.

A total of 1878 patients were followed up for one year: 36.7% of STEMI and 41.5% of NSTEMI patients were rehospitalized (P = 0.05); 16% in both groups were revascularized. In-hospital mortality was similar (4.6% vs. 4.3%), and one-year mortality was 9.0% in STEMI patients and 11.6% in NSTEMI patients (Log-Rank P = 0.09). Independent correlates of in-hospital mortality were untreated dyslipidaemia, advanced age, diabetes, and low blood pressure. The strongest predictors of one-year mortality were heart failure and age. Similar predictors were found in both the STEMI and NSTEMI subgroups.

Despite different management approaches, patients with STEMI and NSTEMI have similar prognoses.

### Is coding for myocardial infarction more accurate now that coding descriptions have been clarified to distinguish ST-elevation myocardial infarction from non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [^116zD6BA]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Outcomes are typically graded based on diagnoses coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). To facilitate performance measurement, the ICD-9 codes for acute myocardial infarction changed in October 2005 to completely separate non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI; code 410.71) and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI; all other codes 410.x). However, it is unclear whether these changes have been implemented by coders. Patients in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI), version 5, were categorized in two ways: by electrocardiographic (ECG) findings and ICD-9 codes.

- **Agreement assessment**: Agreement between ECG findings and ICD-9 codes for type of myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI) was assessed before and after the ICD-9 revision. Mortality rates were measured in a subgroup of patients discharged without transfer after the coding change. There were 102,679 hospitalizations before October 2005 and 63,012 hospitalizations after the coding change, with a mean age of 66.7 years.

- **Coding correlation**: Previously, 81% of NSTEMIs (by ECG diagnosis) were coded as ICD-9 410.71. After the reclassification of code 410.71 to reflect NSTEMI, 82% of NSTEMIs were coded 410.71 (p < 0.001). Overall, the correlation of ECG diagnosis with ICD-9 code improved only slightly after the coding change.

In conclusion, despite more distinctly separated definitions of STEMI and NSTEMI in the new ICD-9 coding system as of October 2005, there appears to be little change in coding. This may reflect a lack of awareness of this substantial change in classification.

### New features of troponin testing in different clinical settings [^114RtLDP]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponin levels are routinely measured for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction. Cardiac troponin measurements also provide information concerning prognosis and the effect of early intervention in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The recent development of highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays permits detection of very low circulating levels. The use of sensitive troponin assays improves overall diagnostic accuracy in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes, and these assays provide strong prognostic information in stable coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure. However, increased sensitivity comes with a cost of decreased specificity, and serial testing, as well as clinical context and judgment, is likely to become increasingly important in the interpretation of troponin assay results.

### Myocardial ischemic syndromes: A new nomenclature to harmonize evolving international clinical practice guidelines [^115Ch515]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Since the 1960s, cardiologists have adopted several binary classification systems for acute myocardial infarction (MI) that facilitated improved patient management. Conversely, for chronic stable manifestations of myocardial ischemia, various classifications have emerged over time, often with conflicting terminology, such as "stable coronary artery disease" (CAD), "stable ischemic heart disease", and "chronic coronary syndromes" (CCS). While the 2019 European guidelines introduced CCS to impart symmetry with "acute coronary syndromes" (ACS), the 2023 American guidelines endorsed the alternative term "chronic coronary disease". An unintended consequence of these competing classifications is the perpetuation of the restrictive terms "coronary" and "disease", often connoting only a singular obstructive CAD mechanism.

It is now important to advance more broadly inclusive terminology for both obstructive and non-obstructive causes of angina and myocardial ischemia to foster conceptual clarity and unify dyssynchronous nomenclatures across guidelines. We, therefore, propose a new binary classification of "acute myocardial ischemic syndromes" and "non-acute myocardial ischemic syndromes", which comprises both obstructive epicardial and non-obstructive pathogenetic mechanisms, including microvascular dysfunction, vasospastic disorders, and non-coronary causes. We herein retain accepted categories of ACS, ST-segment elevation MI, and non-ST-segment elevation MI as important subsets for which revascularization is of proven clinical benefit, as well as new terms like ischemia and MI with non-obstructive causes.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^114VLWoq]. Clinical cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Managing type 1 vs type 2 NSTEMI - **Type 2 classification**: Type 2 NSTEMI is often classified under a general NSTEMI diagnosis or misclassified as type 1, despite its presentation and underlying pathophysiology being different from those of type 1 NSTEMI. It is essential that NSTEMI be classified as type 1 or type 2, based on clinical presentation, cardiac troponin, ECG, and imaging findings, so that it can be managed appropriately. Type 2 MI has heterogeneous underlying causes, often atypical features, a lack of a clear precipitating cause of the oxygen supply-demand imbalance in some patients (e.g. absence of discernible CAD), and does not usually involve atherothrombotic plaque disruption. As a result, NSTEMI guidelines may be challenging — or in some cases inappropriate — to apply in patients who are experiencing a type 2 NSTEMI, and no formal guidelines for type 2 NSTEMI are available.

Studies have found that compared with patients with type 1 NSTEMI, patients with type 2 NSTEMI were less likely to undergo catheterization and revascularization procedures or receive recommended secondary prevention medications at discharge, and they had higher mortality rates. There is therefore a need for evidence-based diagnosis and management guidelines for NSTEMI that acknowledge the complexities of type 2 MI. Consequently, a phenotype-based approach to type 2 MI diagnosis and management across different clinical settings has been proposed. This approach considers both the context and multiple possible underlying mechanisms of type 2 MI.

### Invasive and antiplatelet treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: Understanding and addressing the global risk-treatment paradox [^114MNqKw]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) have a higher long-term mortality risk than patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) but are often treated less aggressively, with those who have the highest ischemic risk often receiving the least aggressive treatment — this is known as the "treatment-risk paradox". The suboptimal treatment of patients with NSTEMI can be explained by the heterogeneity of patient characteristics, an underestimation by physicians of the high ischemic risk compared with bleeding risk, limited procedure availability, and policy constraints.

To address these challenges, potential approaches include developing guidelines and protocols that encompass rigorous definitions of NSTEMI, risk assessment, and integrated quality assessment measures. Additionally, there is a need for education provided to physicians on the management of long-term cardiovascular risk in patients with NSTEMI. Finally, improving access to stents and antiplatelet therapies for patients is essential.

Regarding medical management for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically concerning the management of pain and anxiety, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend considering the administration of IV morphine sulfate in patients with NSTEMI. This is advised in the absence of contraindications if there is continued ischemic chest pain despite treatment with maximally tolerated anti-ischemic medications.

### Prognostic value of admission electrocardiographic findings in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^115PUVTs]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Although our study showed that TSTE was the least frequent finding on the admission ECG and had no prognostic value for short-term outcome, our investigation into this finding still bears important clinical implications. It is unclear at present whether TSTE myocardial infarction (TSTEMI) should be considered a variant of STEMI or a subgroup of NSTEMI. Previous studies have revealed that TSTEMI is associated with less ischemic damage and better short- or long-term outcomes than STEMI. In this study, we explored TSTEMI in the context of NSTEMI and found that it had similar in-hospital and 30-day outcomes as the other three categories, regardless of whether patients received invasive management. These results corroborated data from several observational studies showing no differences in outcome during hospitalization or short-term follow-up. From this perspective, TSTEMI seems to behave more like NSTEMI than STEMI. However, Badings et al. and Blondheim et al. have reported favorable long-term outcomes in TSTEMI vs. NSTEMI patients. In addition, Lemkes et al. recently performed a randomized study to assess the effect of an immediate vs. a delayed invasive strategy in patients with TSTEMI and found no difference in myocardial-infarct size or 30-day outcome between these two strategies. Badings et al. also found that in patients with high-risk NSTE-ACS, early angiography and revascularization in TSTE patients were not superior to later treatment. Thus, long-term outcomes and management of TSTEMI might be somewhat different from those of NSTEMI.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^113ys8wf]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The past two decades have seen significant advancements in the accuracy of myocardial infarction (MI) detection. This progress has been supported by enhancements in cardiovascular imaging, refined ECG criteria, and the use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays. On the basis of these diagnostic improvements, the joint European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association/World Heart Foundation (ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF) Task Force redefined MI into five main categories according to etiology, with the most recent criteria published in 2018. Types 1 and 2 MI are of spontaneous etiology, whereas type 3 is fatal by definition and types 4 and 5 are procedure-related. This review emphasizes type 1 and type 2 MI.

- **Classification of MI**: The fourth universal definition categorizes MI into distinct subtypes. Type 1 MI is characterized by atherothrombotic coronary artery disease (CAD) with an occlusive or non-occlusive coronary thrombus. Both type 1 and type 2 MI require a rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin with at least one value exceeding the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit, along with one of the following: symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia, new ischemic ECG changes, development of pathological Q waves, or imaging evidence supporting an ischemic etiology.

### Cardiac troponin level elevations not related to acute coronary syndromes [^11219eGm]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past two decades, cardiac troponins (cTn) have emerged as the preferred biomarkers for the noninvasive detection of myocardial injury. In conjunction with typical clinical findings of ischemia, elevated cTn levels in blood confirm a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. However, neither cTnT nor cTnI are exclusively released as a result of ischemic myocardial cell necrosis, as they are also associated with numerous nonischemic acute and chronic cardiac conditions, such as myopericarditis, toxic injury, or severe cardiac overload. With the advent of high-sensitivity assays, causes of cTn elevation not related to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have become common findings in patients with chest pain and in those with acute or chronic systemic disorders. Elevated cTn levels in blood are associated with increased rates of cardiac events and mortality, independently of the underlying disease.

However, the clinical conditions leading to cTn release in patients who do not have ACS, and the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these individuals, are largely unknown. Here, we provide an overview of the many causes and the prognostic importance of the release of cTn not related to ACS. We also recommend strategies to discriminate between ischemic and nonischemic cTn elevation and describe the clinical evaluation of these patients.

### Troponin level at presentation as a prognostic factor among patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^112YU71j]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Results**: A total of 665 patients with NSTEMI were screened; of these, 27 were excluded due to missing data, and 94 were excluded due to loss of follow-up. Hence, the final study population included 544 patients. The mean age was 68 (± 11) years, and 122 (22%) were female. Three hundred and fifty (64%) patients suffered from hypertension, 233 (43%) from DM, 342 (63%) from dyslipidemia, 184 (34%) were active smokers, and 39 (7%) had previous MI.

- **Hs-cTnI levels at presentation**: Hs-cTnI levels in each quartile were: (a) ≤ 122, (b) 123–680, (c) 681–2877, and (d) ≥ 2878 ng/L. The median initial hs-cTnI level was 680 ng/L (range 0–150,008 ng/L). There were no differences regarding age or comorbidities between the four initial hs-cTnI level quartiles. The prevalence of male gender, higher peak level of hs-cTnI during admission, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were greater in the fourth quartile than in the first quartile. Stratifying NSTEMI patients based on gender resulted in distinct cutpoints. In male patients, the cutpoints were as follows: (a) ≤ 217, (b) 218–698, (c) 699–3276, and (d) ≥ 3277 ng/L. Conversely, female patients exhibited lower values, as anticipated, with the following cutpoints: (a) ≤ 100, (b) 101–612, (c) 613–2449, and (d) ≥ 2450 ng/L.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^113Yc72b]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend basing the diagnosis and initial short-term risk stratification of ACS on a combination of clinical history, symptoms, vital signs, other physical findings, ECG, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin.
