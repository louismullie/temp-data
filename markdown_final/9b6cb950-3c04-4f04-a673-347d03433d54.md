## Question

Can peginterferon-alpha be used to treat ulcerative colitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether peginterferon‑alpha can be used to treat ulcerative colitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA‑approved indications and whether UC is on label. Then, I should verify the mechanistic rationale that has been proposed for interferons in UC. Next, I will examine randomized clinical trial data for pegylated interferon in UC. After that, I need to check safety signals and boxed warnings. I should then review contemporary guideline recommendations to confirm current standard of care. Finally, I will consider alternative proven therapies and synthesize a recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the labeled uses. Peginterferon alfa‑2a (Pegasys) is FDA‑approved for chronic hepatitis B and C, not for ulcerative colitis; the label details interferon's pleiotropic JAK/STAT‑mediated effects but does not include any IBD indication, so use in UC would be off‑label, which I should explicitly note before moving on to efficacy considerations [^1148HZ9V] [^11676Tvm].

> Next, I should review the theoretical rationale. Type I interferons have immunoregulatory properties, and historically there was a hypothesis that they might rebalance Th1/Th2 skewing in UC; however, the Cochrane analysis framed this as a theoretical construct rather than established clinical benefit, so I should be cautious not to over‑interpret mechanism without outcomes data [^1126Ug2a].

> Now, I will examine randomized trial evidence specific to pegylated interferon in UC. The Gut 2003 randomized, placebo‑controlled study in active UC tested weekly pegylated interferon alpha for 12 weeks and found no statistically significant advantage over placebo for clinical remission, while reporting serious adverse events in the active arms; initially I thought this trial evaluated peginterferon alfa‑2a, but wait, let me verify the formulation, because on re‑inspection it used PegIntron, which is peginterferon alfa‑2b, so while it is the pegylated interferon class, it is not the identical alfa‑2a product, and that nuance should be kept in mind even though the class signal for efficacy was negative in this RCT [^113njyVb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single study; I should review broader interferon data in IBD. Interferon‑beta‑1a showed mixed and largely non‑significant results in small UC trials, and a larger steroid‑refractory UC study of recombinant interferon‑beta‑1a was negative for the primary efficacy outcome, which aligns with an earlier authoritative review categorizing interferon alpha and interferon beta‑1a as having insufficient evidence of efficacy in IBD, reinforcing that the interferon class lacks robust support in UC [^111ZDCXF] [^111Tf6EU] [^116vBXTd].

> I need to assess safety next, because any off‑label consideration would require a compelling benefit‑risk profile. Peginterferon alfa‑2a carries boxed warnings for exacerbation of autoimmune disorders, severe neuropsychiatric events including suicidality, serious infections, and cerebrovascular events; common adverse effects include cytopenias, thyroid dysfunction, and constitutional symptoms, all of which could complicate UC care; additionally, case reports describe new‑onset IBD during interferon‑based hepatitis C therapy, which, while anecdotal, is mechanistically coherent with autoimmune activation risks, so the safety margin appears unfavorable without clear efficacy [^1148HZ9V] [^116z5e9d] [^116enZMN].

> Next, I should review guidelines to ensure I am not missing any niche recommendation. Contemporary AGA living guidelines for moderate‑to‑severe UC prioritize anti‑TNF agents, anti‑integrin therapy, anti‑IL12/23 and anti‑IL23 agents, and JAK inhibitors for induction and maintenance, and ECCO and ACG similarly frame care around these proven classes; peginterferon‑alpha is not included in any recommended UC pathway, which strongly argues against its clinical use in UC outside of a trial [^113BxFur] [^112KNL91] [^115MR1c8] [^114WG2Rw] [^115YzUgj] [^114qHe3L] [^111mU1Eg].

> Let me consider mechanism and potential for harm more explicitly. While interferon signaling is immunomodulatory via JAK/STAT pathways, in autoimmune conditions like UC this can tilt pro‑inflammatory, consistent with the label's warning about autoimmune exacerbations; given this bidirectional immunologic potential, I need to ensure we do not presume anti‑inflammatory benefit where clinical trials have not shown it and where harm signals are credible [^11676Tvm] [^1148HZ9V].

> I will now examine effective alternatives to ensure practical recommendations. For mild disease, appropriately dosed mesalamine remains foundational; for mild left‑sided disease not responding to optimized 5‑ASA, budesonide MMX is guideline‑supported; for moderate‑to‑severe UC or 5‑ASA‑refractory disease, guideline‑endorsed options include anti‑TNFs, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, IL‑23 agents such as mirikizumab, and JAK inhibitors like tofacitinib or upadacitinib, with selection individualized to prior exposure, comorbidity, and treatment goals [^113mGAjT] [^1151hj4T] [^1113q8tQ] [^113tKDJ5] [^111kU5xp] [^113K27np] [^115nfiV7].

> Synthesizing all of this, I should conclude clearly. Efficacy signals for pegylated interferon in UC are absent in the only randomized trial of the class, broader interferon trials in UC are negative or inconclusive, safety concerns are substantial and particularly relevant in autoimmune disease, and no major guideline supports its use; therefore, peginterferon‑alpha should not be used to treat ulcerative colitis outside of a prospective clinical trial, and management should follow guideline‑directed, evidence‑based therapies with established benefit‑risk profiles [^113njyVb] [^111Tf6EU] [^1148HZ9V] [^113BxFur] [^114qHe3L].

---

Peginterferon-alpha is **not effective** [^1126Ug2a] for induction or maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis, with randomized trials showing no significant benefit over placebo [^113njyVb]. It is **not recommended** by current AGA or ECCO guidelines [^1113q8tQ] [^114qHe3L], and is associated with substantial adverse effects including flu-like symptoms, cytopenias, neuropsychiatric events [^1148HZ9V], and autoimmune exacerbations. Modern therapies such as anti-TNFs, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and JAK inhibitors [^1113q8tQ] are preferred for moderate-to-severe UC [^113BxFur].

---

## Mechanism of action

Peginterferon-alpha binds the type I interferon receptor [^11676Tvm], **activating JAK/STAT signaling** [^115zh2Sm] and exerting broad immunomodulatory effects. In UC, it was hypothesized to shift Th2-predominant inflammation toward Th1; however, clinical trials did not show meaningful benefit [^1126Ug2a].

---

## Clinical evidence for efficacy

### Induction of remission

A randomized, placebo-controlled trial (n = 60) [^113njyVb] found **no significant difference** in clinical remission at 12 weeks between peginterferon-alpha and placebo (33–47% vs 35%; p = NS). A Cochrane review [^1126Ug2a] concluded that type I interferons, including peginterferon-alpha, are ineffective for induction of remission in UC.

---

### Maintenance of remission

There is **no evidence** [^1126Ug2a] supporting peginterferon-alpha for maintenance of remission in UC [^114qHe3L].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Peginterferon-alpha has a significant adverse effect profile, with **common adverse effects** including flu-like symptoms, fatigue, cytopenias, neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety), and autoimmune exacerbations. Serious adverse events such as **seizures, thrombosis, and severe infections** have also been reported [^113njyVb] [^1148HZ9V].

## Comparison with other biologic therapies

| **Therapy** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Peginterferon-alpha | Ineffective [^113njyVb] [^1126Ug2a] | Poor tolerability [^1148HZ9V] [^116z5e9d] | Not recommended [^1113q8tQ] [^114qHe3L] |
| Anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab) | Effective for induction and maintenance [^1113q8tQ] | Moderate safety profile | Recommended [^114qHe3L] |
| Vedolizumab | Effective for induction and maintenance [^112oU2Wr] | Favorable safety profile | Recommended [^1113q8tQ] |
| Ustekinumab | Effective for induction and maintenance [^113BxFur] | Favorable safety profile | Recommended [^113BxFur] |
| JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, upadacitinib) | - Effective [^113K27np] <br/> - Especially post-TNF failure [^113BxFur] | Moderate safety profile | Recommended [^1113q8tQ] |

---

## Current clinical guidelines

The **AGA 2024 guidelines** [^1113q8tQ] recommend anti-TNFs, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and JAK inhibitors for moderate-to-severe UC [^113BxFur]; peginterferon-alpha is neither mentioned nor recommended. The **ECCO 2022 guidelines** [^114qHe3L] recommend anti-TNFs for maintenance of remission; peginterferon-alpha is not recommended.

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

There are **no specific patient populations** [^114qHe3L] or clinical scenarios where peginterferon-alpha is recommended for UC.

---

## Ongoing clinical trials and future research

There are **no ongoing clinical trials** or significant future research efforts focused on peginterferon-alpha for UC.

---

Peginterferon-alpha is **not effective** for UC [^1126Ug2a] and is not recommended by current guidelines due to its adverse effect profile and lack of efficacy. Modern biologics and JAK inhibitors are preferred for moderate-to-severe UC [^1113q8tQ].

### Type I interferons for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis [^1126Ug2a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines with immunoregulatory properties and have been used to successfully treat several chronic inflammatory disorders. It has been postulated that type I IFNs may be able to re-establish the Th1/Th2 balance in Th2 predominant diseases like ulcerative colitis.

- **Objectives**: To systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of type I IFN therapy for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group's specialized register, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to August 8, 2014. Reference lists of trials and review articles, as well as recent proceedings from major gastroenterology meetings, were manually searched.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of type I IFNs for induction of remission in UC were included. The study population included patients of any age with active ulcerative colitis. There were no exclusions based on type, dose, or duration of IFN treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two independent authors reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data, and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. The primary outcome was the induction of remission of ulcerative colitis. Secondary outcomes included time to remission, mean change in disease activity index score, clinical, histological or endoscopic improvement, improvement in quality of life, and adverse events. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corres

### A randomised placebo controlled trial of pegylated interferon alpha in active ulcerative colitis [^113njyVb]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

Pilot studies of interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) suggest a high remission rate in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis. We evaluated the safety of pegylated interferon alpha (PegIFN) and its role in inducing remission in patients with active ulcerative colitis in a multicenter, placebo-controlled trial.

- **Methods**: Sixty patients with a clinical activity score (CAI) of > 6 were randomized to receive a placebo (n = 20), PegIFN 0.5 microg/kg (n = 19), or PegIFN 1.0 microg/kg body weight (n = 21) once weekly (PegIntron; Schering-Plough, USA) over 12 weeks. Patients receiving stable dosages of 5-aminosalicylates, steroids, and/or azathioprine were included.

- **Results**: Serious adverse events were seen in none of the placebo patients, in 3 out of 19 patients in the PegIFN 0.5 microg/kg group (hospitalization due to disease flare-up n = 3), and in 3 out of 21 in the PegIFN 1.0 microg/kg group (hospitalization due to disease flare-up n = 1; thrombosis n = 1; grand mal seizure n = 1). Otherwise, only minor IFN-alpha side effects were observed. Clinical remission rates at week 12 (CAI ≤ 4) were 7 out of 20 (35%) in the placebo group, 9 out of 19 (47%) in the PegIFN 0.5 microg/kg group, and 7 out of 21 (33%) in the PegIFN 1.0 microg/kg group (NS). Early withdrawal from the study was observed in 11 out of 20 placebo patients, in 6 out of 19 in the PegIFN 0.5 microg/kg group, and in 10 out of 21 in the PegIFN 1.0 microg/kg group, mainly due to a lack of efficacy. The higher PegIFN dose was associated with a significant decrease in levels of C-reactive protein (p = 0.003, day 0 vs. 85).

- **Conclusions**: PegIFN is safe but not effective at the dosages used.

### Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in inflammatory bowel disease: the story continues [^113PEjen]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

In the 1990s, tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitor therapy ushered in the biologic therapy era for inflammatory bowel disease, leading to marked improvements in treatment options and patient outcomes. There are currently four tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors approved as treatments for ulcerative colitis and/or Crohn's disease: infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol. Despite the clear benefits of tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors, a subset of patients with inflammatory bowel disease either do not respond, experience a loss of response after initial clinical improvement, or report intolerance to anti-tumour necrosis factor-α therapy.

Optimizing outcomes of these agents may be achieved through earlier intervention, the use of therapeutic drug monitoring, and thoughtful switching within class. To complement these approaches, evolving predictive biomarkers may help inform and optimize clinical decision-making by identifying patients who might potentially benefit from an alternative treatment strategy. This review focuses on the use of tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors in inflammatory bowel disease and the application of personalized medicine to improve future outcomes for all patients.

### Certolizumab pegol for the treatment of Crohn's disease [^113kxbx6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

In this article, we provide a contemporary overview of available clinical data on certolizumab pegol, a pegylated anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha agent that comprises a uniquely small protein, and its emerging role as a therapy for Crohn's disease (CD). The results from a comprehensive clinical trial program suggest that certolizumab pegol offers rapid and sustained remission of moderate to severe CD. Certolizumab pegol is an effective and well-tolerated therapy both in patients who have already received biologics and in patients who are anti-TNF naïve. Benefits of therapy include a stable dosing regimen, which allows for rapid induction of a clinical response followed by long-term maintenance of response and remission under one fixed dose. Treatment with certolizumab pegol has been shown to improve function and quality of life in patients with CD, and insights into the potential mechanisms by which certolizumab pegol effects a response in CD suggest that this agent may have the potential to slow or even modify disease progression. Early therapy is particularly effective and could help control CD progression and lessen the burden of disease on patients.

### Mesalamine [^113mGAjT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Two similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies were conducted with a total of 562 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. The study populations had a mean age of 46 years (11% were aged 65 years or older), were 53% female, and were primarily white (92%).

Ulcerative colitis disease activity was assessed using a modified Sutherland Disease Activity Index (DAI), which is a sum of four subscores based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance on endoscopy, and physician's rating of disease activity. Each subscore can range from 0 to 3, resulting in a total possible DAI score of 12.

At baseline, approximately 80% of patients had a total DAI score of 0 or 1. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either mesalamine 1.5 g or placebo once daily in the morning for six months. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the clinic, with endoscopy performed at baseline, at end of study, or if clinical symptoms developed. Relapse was defined as a rectal bleeding subscale score of 1 or more and a mucosal appearance subscale score of 2 or more using the DAI. The analysis of the intent-to-treat population involved comparing the proportions of patients who remained relapse-free at the end of six months of treatment. In these studies, all patients who withdrew prematurely for any reason were counted as relapses.

In both studies, the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at six months was greater for those receiving mesalamine than for those receiving placebo.

### Critical roles of RGS16 in the mucosal inflammation of ulcerative colitis [^113PE5gq]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic and progressive inflammatory disorder. The regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) is involved in the pathogenesis of several immune system disorders. RGS16, a member of the RGS protein superfamily, has been shown to play critical roles in several immune system-related diseases. However, the roles of RGS16 in ulcerative colitis remain to be elucidated.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the expression of RGS16 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and inflamed mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. We performed Spearman's correlation to analyze the correlation between RGS16 expression and the ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity (UCEIS), Mayo index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and IL-17A levels. Further, PBMCs were stimulated with inflammatory cytokines in vitro.

- **Results**: RGS16 expression significantly increased in the colonic mucosa and PBMCs from patients with ulcerative colitis and significantly correlated with the Mayo index, UCEIS, ESR, and serum TNF-α and IL-17A levels. TNF-α upregulated RGS16 expression in PBMCs in a dose- and time-dependent manner via the nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) signaling pathway. Moreover, anti-TNF treatment with infliximab significantly decreased RGS16 expression in PBMCs and intestinal mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis.

- **Conclusion**: Our study revealed a novel mechanism by which RGS16 expression in ulcerative colitis is positively correlated with disease severity indicators.

### Golimumab in the treatment of ulcerative colitis [^113PfsBk]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Golimumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis in 2013 and was the third antitumor necrosis factor therapy — after adalimumab and infliximab — licensed for this indication. However, given it is the most recent of these drugs to become available, evidence regarding its optimal use and its positioning in relation to other biological therapies is only now emerging. In this article, we review the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of golimumab both in the setting of clinical trials and in "real-world" observational studies. We also explore the limited data available regarding the possible role of therapeutic-drug monitoring and dose flexibility.

### Anti-TNF alpha-induced paradoxical psoriasis treated with topical roflumilast 0.3 [^113c7yiS]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Anti-TNF alpha treatments have revolutionized the management of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory colitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and psoriasis vulgaris. However, there have been a number of adverse effects associated with such treatments, with paradoxical psoriasis being of particular importance to dermatologists. Some patients are more at risk, such as those carrying the IL-23R SNIP gene. The delay of onset for paradoxical psoriasis is variable, ranging from 1 to 30 months after the introduction of anti-TNF alpha injections.

Treatment options for paradoxical psoriasis remain limited, prompting either the addition of topical agents to minimize cutaneous inflammation or the eventual discontinuation of anti-TNF alpha injections. Roflumilast cream 0.3% is a highly selective and potent topical phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor approved in 2022 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of psoriasis, including intertriginous areas. We report a case of a 61-year-old male with new-onset paradoxical palmoplantar psoriasis after adalimumab initiation that was successfully treated with roflumilast 0.3% once daily cream.

### Omvoh [^113tKDJ5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of OMVOH were evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies: one induction study [UC-1 (NCT03518086)] and one maintenance study [UC-2 (NCT03524092)]. These studies involved adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who had an inadequate response, loss of response, or failure to tolerate any of the following: corticosteroids, 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, biologic therapy (TNF blocker, vedolizumab), or tofacitinib. The 12-week intravenous induction study (UC-1) was followed by the 40-week subcutaneous randomized withdrawal maintenance study (UC-2).

### An open-labeled, randomized study comparing systemic interferon-alpha-2A and prednisolone enemas in the treatment of left-sided ulcerative colitis [^111gVxAo]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the treatment efficacies of subcutaneous interferon-alpha-2A (IFN-alpha-2A) injections versus prednisolone enemas in active left-sided ulcerative colitis in an open-labeled, randomized study.

- **Methods**: Sixteen ulcerative colitis patients received IFN-alpha-2A subcutaneously (dosage: first week, 9 MIU three times weekly [t.i.w.]; second week, 6 MIU t.i.w.; weeks 3–12, 3 MIU t.i.w.), and 16 received prednisolone enemas for 30 days (100 mL once daily, 0.25 mg of prednisolone/ml). The Powell-Tuck Index, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score, and rectal histological activities were assessed before and after treatment. Thirteen patients in the IFN-alpha-2A group and all 16 in the prednisolone enema group completed the treatment.

- **Results**: IFN-alpha-2A treatment showed significant improvements in the Powell-Tuck Index (p = 0.0002), IBDQ score (p = 0.002), and rectal histological activity scores (p = 0.02). In the enema group, significant improvements were found in the Powell-Tuck Index (p = 0.0009), whereas no significant improvements were detected in the IBDQ scores (p = 0.055) or rectal histological scores (p = 0.052). There were no differences between scores of the two groups either before or after treatment. Only moderate side effects from the IFN-alpha-2A treatment were seen during the first 2–4 weeks of treatment.

- **Conclusion**: IFN-alpha-2A treatment resulted in significant depression of the disease activity as reflected by the Powell-Tuck Index, IBDQ score, and histological disease activity scoring.

### Inducing and maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis: role of high-dose, extended-release mesalamine [^112yKQpH]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

In mild-to-moderate inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) remains a cornerstone of therapy. Sulfasalazine, originally synthesized in 1940 as an arthritis treatment for Sweden's King Gustaf V, is an azo-linked compound between 5-ASA and sulfapyridine. This medication was soon discovered to be effective in treating ulcerative colitis. However, dose-related side effects of the sulfapyridine moiety led to considerable effort in developing medications to deliver 5-ASA to the desired parts of the intestine.

The newest generation of 5-ASA medications allows high-dose medication delivery with decreased pill burden, thereby improving patient compliance. This review describes the pharmacokinetics of various 5-ASA preparations, particularly focusing on high-dose formulations and their role in therapy. It examines scientific literature and reviews clinical outcomes and safety profiles.

### British Society of Gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^114y9gBn]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

No comparative data for tofacitinib with biologics are available, and NICE approval has been granted for the treatment of moderate to severely active UC where conventional treatments or biological agents have not been tolerated or have failed. Tofacitinib has the advantage of oral administration and, as a small molecule, immunogenicity is not an issue. This has to be weighed against the side effect profiles and costs of different agents.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^117Qqv8s]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, the AGA 2023 guidelines recommend considering an endoscopic assessment of disease activity. This is advised rather than implementing empiric treatment adjustment in patients with UC in symptomatic remission who have elevated stool or serum markers of inflammation, such as fecal calprotectin > 150 mcg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, or elevated CRP.

### Mucosal gene signatures to predict response to infliximab in patients with ulcerative colitis [^113AqqUT]. Gut (2009). High credibility.

Infliximab is an effective treatment for ulcerative colitis, with over 60% of patients responding to treatment and up to 30% reaching remission. The mechanism of resistance to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) is unknown. This study utilized colonic mucosal gene expression to provide a predictive response signature for infliximab treatment in ulcerative colitis.

- **Methods**: Two cohorts of patients who received their first treatment with infliximab for refractory ulcerative colitis were studied. Response to infliximab was defined as endoscopic and histological healing. Total RNA from pre-treatment colonic mucosal biopsies was analyzed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. Quantitative RT-PCR was employed to confirm microarray data.

- **Results**: For predicting response to infliximab treatment, pre-treatment colonic mucosal expression profiles were compared between responders and non-responders. Comparative analysis identified 179 differentially expressed probe sets in cohort A and 361 in cohort B, with an overlap of 74 probe sets, representing 53 known genes, between both analyses. A combined analysis of both cohorts yielded 212 differentially expressed probe sets. The top five differentially expressed genes in a combined analysis of both cohorts were osteoprotegerin, stanniocalcin-1, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2, and interleukin 11. All proteins encoded by these genes are involved in the adaptive immune response. These markers separated responders from non-responders with 95% sensitivity.

**Choice of anti-TNF agent in Crohn's disease**: There is little difference in efficacy between adalimumab and infliximab for luminal Crohn's disease. Practical considerations, such as the mode and frequency of administration, are the main factors to consider. Additionally, the relative need for combination therapy with an immunomodulator should be evaluated (see Section 5.2.4.1: Choice of anti-TNF agent). Certolizumab is not licensed for the treatment of IBD in the UK and will not be discussed here.

### Characterizing unmet medical need and the potential role of new biologic treatment options in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: a systematic review and clinician surveys [^115DHr7T]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Rate and timing of therapy failure**: When asked to estimate treatment failure on the basis of their own experience, UK clinicians estimated that 18–26% of patients fail and discontinue therapy with a first-line anti-TNFα agent during the induction phase (primary failure), and that 22–26% lose response and discontinue that anti-TNFα agent over time – that is, secondary failure of the first-line anti-TNFα agent. Estimates of treatment failure were even higher for second-line treatment with an anti-TNFα agent: 28–37% of patients fail and discontinue treatment during the induction phase, and 31–41% lose response and discontinue their second-line anti-TNFα agent treatment over time. Among patients who lost response, it was estimated that 68–77% of patients discontinued treatment by the end of the first year, and 82–90% of patients discontinued treatment by the end of the second year of treatment due to loss of response.

- **Figure interpretation**: Treatment failure during anti-TNFα therapy as estimated by UK clinicians. Estimates of treatment failure are consistently lower for first-line biologic therapy (black boxes) compared with second-line biologic therapy (grey boxes) in (a) UC and (b) CD, on the basis of the experience of UK gastroenterologists. The figure displays the median line with a box of 25th/75th percentiles and upper/lower adjacent values; while reading the figure, please observe that each category on the x-axis is assigned two boxes. ADA, adalimumab; anti-TNFα, anti-tumour necrosis factor-α; CD, Crohn's disease; IFX, infliximab; PF, primary failure; SF, secondary failure; UC, ulcerative colitis.

### Advances in the development of new biologics in inflammatory bowel disease [^112rMUAB]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Infliximab and adalimumab are considered the mainstay of biological therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for the last decade. They have been shown to induce clinical and endoscopic remission in both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), diminishing exacerbations and surgery rates. Certolizumab is a pegylated monoclonal IgG antibody against TNF-α. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2008 for both induction and maintenance of remission in moderately-to-severely active CD, including patients who have previously lost response to infliximab. It has been shown that lower drug levels and the existence of anti-drug antibodies correlate with the loss of clinical and endoscopic response.

### New insights into the mechanisms of action of anti-tumor necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibodies in inflammatory bowel disease [^1121MryF]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) has been widely accepted as a therapeutic target for inflammatory disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease. Anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol have revolutionized therapy for these chronic inflammatory disorders. These agents are potent inhibitors of TNF-α, but significant evidence points to the fact that their actions extend beyond simple neutralization of the cytokine.

Recent advances in understanding the mechanism of action of anti-TNF-α mAbs have uncovered several previously unrecognized actions that are likely to be relevant in mediating their anti-inflammatory effects. Many of these actions are mediated by the binding of the antibodies to transmembrane TNF-α (tmTNF-α) and involve complex interactions with other molecular factors and cells. In this review, we have highlighted new information on the mechanism of action of anti-TNF-α mAbs, from in vitro and in vivo studies.

Despite obvious benefits in many patients, the clinical use of these antibodies is hampered by the fact that some patients do not respond to them. Among patients who do respond, many will develop recurrent disease despite continued dosing. Although pharmacokinetic factors explain some of the observed cases of partial or complete resistance to the effects of anti-TNF-α mAbs, other nonresponder patients may be resistant to those agents' mechanism of action. A more thorough understanding of the mechanism of action of anti-TNF-α mAbs may allow the development of strategies to individualize therapy further.

There is no information regarding the presence of peginterferon alfa-2a in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Due to the potential for adverse reactions from the drugs in nursing infants, a decision must be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue Pegasys. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Pegasys and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Pegasys or from the underlying maternal condition.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid potential transmission of HIV; therefore, CHC- and CHB-infected mothers coinfected with HIV should not breastfeed their infants.

- **Females and males of reproductive potential**:

	- **Pregnancy testing**: Females of reproductive potential must undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with Pegasys or with Pegasys in combination with ribavirin or with other HCV drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17)]. Females of reproductive potential receiving Pegasys in combination with ribavirin must have a routine pregnancy test performed monthly during treatment and for at least 6 months following treatment. Female partners of male patients receiving Pegasys in combination with ribavirin must have a routine pregnancy test performed monthly during treatment and for at least 6 months posttherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17), ribavirin prescribing information].

### The impact of biological interventions on health-related quality of life in adults with Crohn's disease: A systematic review with meta-analysis [^117XupbA]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

The evidence suggests that infliximab and upadacitinib result in clinically meaningful improvements (CMI) in quality of life (QoL) assessed by the IBDQ score change, with very low to high-certainty evidence. No CMIs were observed for treatments with adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, ustekinumab, and natalizumab, which also presented low to high certainty. Considerable heterogeneity prevented us from pooling data in meta-analyses on vedolizumab and risankizumab treatments.

In all included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), a statistically significant difference is achieved for at least one health-related quality of life (HRQoL) result, but a clinically meaningful significance is not achieved in many analyses. Reaching statistical significance is only a precondition for achieving a clinically meaningful difference. From the patient's perspective, a CMI in HRQoL is a crucial point and treatment goal that should be achieved. Clinicians should be careful when interpreting results solely in terms of statistical significance.

Improvement in QoL in Crohn's disease (CD) patients encompasses achieving clinical remission of the disease, but van der Have and colleagues found that disease activity contributed to only 37% of HRQoL. Based on this observation and the fact that not all included RCTs have been powered to detect a clinically meaningful difference in HRQoL outcomes, the lack of CMI in most of our analyses should not be simply interpreted as a lack of significant effect of biologicals on HRQoL.

Several possible explanations could address our findings, including shortcomings in study design considering HRQoL outcomes as secondary, a heterogeneous participant population, and differences in inclusion criteria. For instance, the lack of…

### Update on the role of upadacitinib in the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis [^1116ZP9L]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Evidence suggests that considering an extended induction up to 16 weeks when needed expands the proportion of patients who may benefit from UPA. Healthcare providers need to individualize the need and rationale of extended induction therapy based on the label and the patient in front of them. UPA 30 mg daily as maintenance therapy appears to be more effective than 15 mg OD across most endpoints, with a delta of anywhere between 8% and 13%. Over 52 weeks of maintenance, there appears to be no difference in toxicity between the doses. The 30 mg dose in maintenance should be particularly considered in patients with pancolitis, previous biologic failure, and EIMs.

New evidence has shown the efficacy of UPA in Crohn's disease phase III trials, with no new safety signals, opening the door for further and more practical use of this highly effective drug.

### New therapies for inflammatory bowel disease: From the bench to the bedside [^112nvFDv]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

The mechanisms underlying the chronic intestinal inflammation, which is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), are complex. The pathological response involves both the adaptive and innate immune systems, alongside the intestinal epithelium and endothelium. Advances in understanding the roles of these components have led to the development of multiple biological agents that offer an alternative to traditional therapies for patients with refractory Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. This study systematically reviews the mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety of new and emerging therapies currently in clinical trials, and discusses future directions in the treatment of IBD.

### Viral hepatitis and inflammatory bowel disease [^114g8yur]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Viral hepatitis is common worldwide and in the United States. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who have chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) with active disease, indicated by elevated alanine aminotransferase levels and viral replication, should receive HBV treatment. HBV reactivation is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients receiving immunosuppression. IBD patients may require long-term immunosuppression and should be considered candidates for vaccination against new HBV infection, as well as prophylaxis against HBV reactivation prior to starting immunosuppressive therapy.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonists and immunomodulators appear compatible with use in IBD patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV), although prednisone may increase viral replication. HCV treatment with peg-interferon and ribavirin may exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms, necessitating that the decision to treat HCV be individualized. The management of IBD patients with viral hepatitis is addressed in this review.

### Interferon beta-1a in ulcerative colitis: a placebo controlled, randomised, dose escalating study [^111ZDCXF]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

Administration of interferon (IFN)-beta may represent a rational approach to the treatment of ulcerative colitis due to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of IFN-beta-1a.

- **Methods**: Patients (n = 18) with moderately active ulcerative colitis were randomized to receive IFN-beta-1a or placebo. IFN-beta-1a was started at a dose of 22 micro g three times a week subcutaneously, with dose increases at two-week intervals to 44 micro g and then to 88 micro g if no response was observed. The maximum treatment duration was eight weeks. End points were clinical treatment response (a decrease of at least 3 points from baseline in the ulcerative colitis scoring system (UCSS) symptoms score) and induction of endoscopically confirmed remission.

- **Results**: Baseline characteristics and disease severity were similar in both groups. Data from 17 patients are included in this report (10 patients in the IFN-beta-1a group and seven patients in the placebo group). Clinical response was achieved in five patients (50%) in the IFN-beta-1a group and in one (14%) in the placebo group (P = 0.14). Remission was achieved in three patients in the IFN-beta-1a group and in none in the placebo group (p = 0.02). Most adverse reactions associated with IFN-beta-1a were influenza-like symptoms or injection site reactions, which were mild or moderate in severity.

- **Conclusions**: IFN-beta-1a may represent a promising novel treatment approach in ulcerative colitis.

### Humira [^115JgH1z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial (Study PUC-I, NCT02065557) involving 93 pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 with endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 points, confirmed by centrally read endoscopy) who had inadequate response or intolerance to therapy with corticosteroids and/or an immunomodulator, such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate. Fifteen out of the 93 patients (16%) in the study had prior experience with a TNF blocker. Patients receiving corticosteroids at enrollment were allowed to taper their corticosteroid therapy after Week 4.

Seventy-seven patients were initially randomized in a 3:2 ratio to receive double-blind treatment with one of two dosages of Humira. Patients in both dosage groups received 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 0, 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2, and 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) at Weeks 4 and 6. The higher dosage group also received an additional dosage of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 1. Following an amendment to the study design, 16 additional patients were enrolled and received open-label treatment with Humira at the higher dosage.

### Biologic therapy of inflammatory bowel disease [^116vBXTd]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Advancing knowledge regarding the biology of chronic inflammation has led to the development of specific biologic therapies that mechanistically target individual inflammatory pathways. Many biologic therapies are being evaluated for the treatment of the chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

- **Proven effective in Crohn's disease**: Biologic compounds such as monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor (infliximab and CDP571) and to the leukocyte adhesion molecule alpha4 integrin (natalizumab) have shown efficacy.

- **Insufficient evidence of efficacy**: The following biologic compounds do not have enough evidence to judge their efficacy for inflammatory bowel disease:
	- p55 tumor necrosis factor binding protein (onercept),
	- Interferon alpha,
	- Interferon beta-1a,
	- Anti-interferon gamma antibody,
	- Anti-interleukin 12 antibody,
	- p65 anti-sense oligonucleotide (blocks NF-kappaB),
	- Granulocyte colony stimulating factor and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor,
	- Anti-interleukin 2 receptor antibody,
	- Epidermal growth factor,
	- Keratinocyte growth factor 2 (repifermin),
	- Human growth hormone,
	- Anti-CD4 antibody,
	- Anti-alpha4beta7 antibody.

- **Proven ineffective**: Some biologic therapies have been proven ineffective for inflammatory bowel disease, including interleukin 10, interleukin 11, anti-sense intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and the tumor necrosis factor receptor fusion protein etanercept.

Based on the early successes of infliximab, CDP571, and natalizumab, it seems certain that biologic therapy will play an important role in the future treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

### Efficacy of vedolizumab during intravenous induction therapy in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: post hoc analysis of patient-reported outcomes from the VISIBLE 1 and 2 studies [^112oU2Wr]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

- **Introduction**: Patient-reported outcomes from the VISIBLE 1 and 2 studies were analyzed to assess the efficacy of vedolizumab during intravenous induction therapy in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).

- **Patient-reported UC symptoms**: During vedolizumab intravenous induction, weekly mean changes from baseline in UC symptoms were monitored. Stool frequency (SF) subscores for the overall population, anti-TNFα-naive patients, and anti-TNFα-experienced patients are detailed. Additionally, assessments of rectal bleeding (RB) subscores were conducted across similar patient demographics. Error bars in the figures indicate standard deviations of the mean values. Abbreviations include anti-TNFα (antitumor necrosis factor alpha), RB (rectal bleeding), and SF (stool frequency).

- **Symptom improvement**: The improvement of UC symptoms during vedolizumab induction was notable. SF improvement in patients was measured across the overall population, anti-TNFα-naive patients, and anti-TNFα-experienced patients, with moderate or severe disease status at baseline considered. A significant improvement in SF was defined as achieving a Mayo SF subscore of 0. Similarly, RB improvement was categorized by a reduction of at least 1 on the Mayo score's 4-point RB subscore, with a specific focus on visible blood presence and frequency during stool passage.

The analysis clarifies the response to vedolizumab induction therapy in both UC and CD, emphasizing the variations in efficacy based on prior anti-TNFα therapy and disease severity at baseline.

### Tumour necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (TACE) activity in the colonic mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^116TVEPJ]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

Anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antibodies are effective in Crohn's disease and perhaps ulcerative colitis, but antigenicity and the high cost have raised interest in other strategies to block TNF-alpha. These include the TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), which releases soluble TNF-alpha from transmembrane pro-TNF-alpha.

- **Aim**: To investigate whether TACE activity is present in human colonic mucosa.

- **Materials and methods**: Detergent extracts of cell membranes from colonic biopsies were obtained from 12 controls and 28 patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Enzyme activity was measured by hydrolysis assays using pro-TNF-alpha or oligopeptide substrates spanning the known pro-TNF-alpha cleavage site at Ala(76)-Val(77). Cleavage products were identified by western blotting, high-pressure liquid chromatography, or mass spectrometry. TACE protein was localized by immunohistochemistry and identified by western blotting of detergent extracts from purified lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMNC) or epithelial cells.

- **Results**: Detergent extracts released TNF-alpha from pro-TNF-alpha and cleaved a model oligopeptide as predicted. Substrate hydrolysis was sensitive to known TACE/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors but not trocade, which has low activity against TACE. The median TACE level was increased in active ulcerative colitis (147 arbitrary units (AU)/mg; p < 0.01) but not in Crohn's disease (81 AU/mg) compared with controls (79 AU/mg). Both the full-length proform and the active form of TACE protein were expressed in LPMNC cells and epithelial cells.

### Real-world effectiveness of advanced therapies among patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in the United States [^111v7yJ5]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with UC frequently continue using steroids during the first year after initiating advanced therapies, and those initiating biologic therapies often require combination therapy with an immunosuppressant. A subset of patients also experience extended UC-related hospitalization stays. These results suggest that optimization of therapies and/or therapies with alternative mechanisms of action are needed to achieve steroid-free goals of treatment.

### Integrating anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: Current and future perspectives [^1143JLKj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two idiopathic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Manifestations of these diseases can be severe, often leading to long-term therapy utilizing a variety of medications and/or surgical interventions. Standard medical therapy includes agents that address suppurative complications or modulate the inflammatory cascade in a nonspecific manner.

Many specific chemokine and cytokine effectors promote intestinal inflammation have been identified. This has led to experimental clinical trials involving various cytokine antagonists. Compounds targeting one particular cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), have demonstrated the greatest clinical efficacy thus far, aligning with scientific observations that suggest a central role for TNF in the inflammatory cascade.

Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF, has been proven effective for the treatment of Crohn's disease and has received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for this use. Several other TNF antagonists are in various stages of investigation, including the monoclonal antibody CDP 571, the fusion peptide etanercept, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor oxpentifylline, and thalidomide.

The clinical efficacy of these agents and the role of TNF in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is reviewed.

### Tumour necrosis factor alpha blocking agents for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis [^111rtBzs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Anti-TNF-alpha agents have been shown to be effective for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. The role of TNF-alpha blocking agents in ulcerative colitis is, however, unclear and recent studies have yielded conflicting results.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy of TNF-alpha antibody for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis, and to determine adverse events associated with TNF-alpha antibody treatment.

- **Search strategy**: We searched MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), EMBASE (1984 to 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 3, 2004), and the IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register. We hand-searched the articles cited in each publication.

- **Selection criteria**: Only randomized controlled trials in which patients with active ulcerative colitis (defined by a combination of clinical, radiographic, endoscopic, and histologic criteria) were randomly allocated to receive a TNF-alpha blocking agent in the treatment arm and to receive placebo or another treatment in the comparison arm were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data extraction and assessment of the methodological quality of each study were independently performed by two reviewers. Any disagreement among reviewers was resolved by consensus. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of remission as defined by the primary studies. Other endpoints were clinical, histological, or endoscopic improvement as defined by the primary studies; improvement in quality of life as measured by a validated quality of life tool; and the occurrence of adverse events.

To determine the potential effects of orally administered OPRX-106 on cytokine levels, serum levels of TNFα, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12 (p70) were determined by highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, according to the manufacturer's instructions. TNFα, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12 (p70) were quantified by ELISA using Quantikine (R&D Systems, Catalogue number: HSTA00E, HS600B, HS120, and HS120, respectively), and IFN-γ was quantified using HS (eBioscience, Catalogue number: BMS228HS). The analysis was performed at American Medical Laboratories (AML), Herzliya Pituach, Israel.

- **Study endpoints**: Study endpoints included safety, PK, and exploratory efficacy parameters. Clinical response (improvement) at baseline versus week 8 was defined by the following criteria: decrease in the Mayo score of at least 3 points, decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of at least 1 point, a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1, clinical remission at week 8 which is defined as clinically symptom-free, Mayo Score ≤ 2 with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point after treatment, histopathological improvement in Geboes histologic grading from baseline to week 8, improvement in high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels from baseline to week 8, improvement in fecal calprotectin levels from baseline to week 8, and changes in systemic immune modulation parameters from baseline to week 8. Mayo responsiveness and remission were defined as a decrease in the total Mayo score; reductions in Geboes grading, CRP, and calprotectin levels served as indicators of treatment efficacy.

### Update on the role of upadacitinib in the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis [^115zh2Sm]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The description in 1992 of the JAK-signal transduction and activation of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway has provided a better understanding of intracellular signaling, its importance, and its role in hematopoiesis, immunity, inflammation, growth, neural development, and metabolism. The JAK-STAT pathway involves the transmission of signals from outside the cell to inside the cell, beginning with the engagement of transmembrane receptors and culminating in signal transduction and transcription at the level of the nucleus.

Cytokines utilizing the JAK-STAT can be classified according to the kind of receptors they bind to; type I and II cytokine receptors are dimeric structures composed of two or more different subunits which are JAK dependent. Type I and type II cytokines include, among others, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, interferons, and IL-10-related cytokines.

- **JAK proteins**: There are four JAKs: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2, which are tyrosine kinases working in pairs with the potential to phosphorylate cytokine receptors, other JAKs, or themselves, as well as cytoplasmic STAT proteins. There are several combinations of JAKs associated with different cytokine receptors, which, in turn, modulate a variety of physiologic processes.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^115YzUgj]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ulcerative colitis, specifically for maintaining remission in moderate-to-severe disease through advanced therapy, the AGA 2024 guidelines indicate that there is insufficient evidence to recommend either withdrawing immunomodulators or continuing combination therapy. This applies to patients with UC who are in corticosteroid-free clinical remission for at least six months on a combination therapy of TNF antagonists and an immunomodulator.

### ACG clinical guideline update: Ulcerative colitis in adults [^115FP6i9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ulcerative colitis, specifically with respect to treatment targets, the ACG 2025 guidelines recommend treating patients with UC to achieve endoscopic improvement. This is defined as the resolution of inflammatory changes with a Mayo endoscopic score of 0 or 1. Achieving this target increases the likelihood of sustained steroid-free remission and helps prevent hospitalizations and surgery.

### Characterizing unmet medical need and the potential role of new biologic treatment options in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: a systematic review and clinician surveys [^113k51HX]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Clinician response to treatment failure: UK clinicians estimated that in patients with first-line treatment failure who showed signs of a reduced response, their response would be to add another (nonbiologic) treatment, such as corticosteroids, in around 25% of cases. They would increase the dose of the existing biologic therapy in 21–24% of cases, increase the administration frequency in 17–25% of cases, and offer surgery as a treatment option in 20–22% of cases. When treatment alternatives in patients failing first-line biologic therapy were restricted to surgery or a switch to a second-line biologic, UK clinicians estimated that among UC patients failing IFX as a first-line anti-TNFα agent, around 50% would switch to ADA as a second-line anti-TNFα agent, and the other 50% would pursue surgery as a treatment option. Similarly, among ADA failures, around 50% would switch to IFX as a second-line anti-TNFα agent and 50% would pursue surgery. Among CD patients failing IFX, clinicians estimated that around 70% would switch to ADA as a second-line anti-TNFα agent, and the other 30% would pursue surgery as a treatment option. For ADA failures, around 50% would switch to IFX as a second-line anti-TNFα agent, and 50% would pursue surgery. French clinicians estimated that among patients with first-line treatment failure or a reduced response, around 18–39% would receive an additional nonbiologic treatment, such as corticosteroids. Around 12–33% would be administered an increased dose of the existing anti-TNFα agent and the administration frequency would be increased in around 9–27% of patients.

### Interferon-beta-1a for the treatment of steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111Tf6EU]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of recombinant interferon-beta-1a (rIFN-beta-1a) in outpatients with active steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis.

- **Methods**: Ninety-one randomized patients subcutaneously received 3 MIU rIFN-beta-1a (Group A, n = 32), 1 MIU rIFN-beta-1a (Group B, n = 30), or placebo (Group C, n = 29) three times a week over a period of eight weeks in addition to standard therapy. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment.

- **Results**: In all three groups, the median prestudy clinical activity index (CAI) was 10. A reduction of the CAI of six points or greater (response) was achieved in 18 of 32 patients (56%) in Group A, in 11 of 30 patients (36%) in Group B, and in 10 of 29 patients (34%) in Group C, though the differences were not statistically significant. Complete response (reduction of CAI to less than or equal to 4) was achieved in 56%, 30%, and 38% of patients in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. Compared with baseline, the median endoscopic index had been reduced by 5, 3, and 4 points in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. Steroid reduction was 12 mg in Group A, 6 mg in Group B, and 10 mg in Group C. Identical side effects occurred in all three groups. Seven serious adverse events were reported (1 in Group A and 6 in Group C), but all were unrelated to therapy as judged by the investigating physicians.

- **Conclusions**: rIFN-beta-1a was safe but not significant, at the dosage and/or duration of treatment used, in steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis.

### Biological therapies in inflammatory bowel disease: Predictive factors of nonresponse [^115fz2B2]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

The treatment modalities for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been rapidly expanding over the past years. Biological therapies are the leading choice of therapy in moderate and severe IBD, aiming to help patients achieve meaningful clinical, endoscopic, and laboratory responses. However, some patients are primary nonresponders and fail to show any response, while others relapse after an initial response, also known as secondary nonresponders.

In this article, we review the mechanism of action of the currently available biological therapies for IBD, assessment of treatment response, the nonresponse rates to each therapy, clinical and laboratory factors affecting the efficacy of therapies, and suggested targeted drug levels.

### Uceris [^114bN1UP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Fourteen clinical studies were conducted focusing on the induction of remission in active, mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.

Two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted with a total of 970 adult patients suffering from active, mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC), defined by an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UCDAI) score ranging from ≥ 4 to ≤ 10. Eight hundred ninety-nine of these patients exhibited histology consistent with active UC, which constituted the primary analysis population. UCDAI is a four-component scale (total score of 0 to 12) addressing clinical assessments of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, and physician's rating of disease activity, with scores ranging from 0 to 3 for each component.

The baseline median UCDAI score in both studies was 7. In Study 1, 56% of the patients were male, with a median age of 42 years. Study 2 observed 57% male participation, with a median age of 44 years. In Study 1, the demographic distribution was 50% Caucasian, 7% African American, and 34% Asian. Conversely, in Study 2, over 99% were Caucasian.

Both studies compared UCERIS 9 mg and 6 mg with a placebo and included an active reference arm which was mesalamine 2.4 g in Study 1 and budesonide 9 mg* in Study 2 (though not approved for UC treatment). The primary endpoint was the induction of remission after an 8-week treatment period. Remission was defined as a UCDAI score of ≤ 1, with subscores of 0 for rectal bleeding, stool frequency, and mucosal appearance, along with a ≥ 1 point reduction in the endoscopy-only score. In both studies, UCERIS 9 mg extended-release tablets demonstrated…

### Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in inflammatory bowel disease: The story continues [^113bXyxS]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

The role of TNF in IBD is complex yet significant. TNF is a 17 kDa soluble cytokine predominantly secreted by monocytes, exerting potent proinflammatory effects on various cell types. It is crucial for intestinal homeostasis, including the regulation of epithelial cell shedding during the renewal of the intestinal epithelium, maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity, wound healing, and mucosal repair. However, TNF also plays a pivotal role in the development and perpetuation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as evidenced by the clinical benefits associated with TNF inhibition.

- **TNF in the pathogenesis of IBD**: Both soluble and membrane-bound TNF, along with other proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-18, are produced by various stromal and immune cells within the inflamed mucosa. Non-immune cells also contribute; for instance, members of the IL-1 cytokine family, including IL-18, are produced by intestinal epithelial cells, while TNF and IL-6 are produced by stromal fibroblasts. Through its receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, TNF exerts pleiotropic proinflammatory effects, such as angiogenesis, induction of Paneth cell death, production of matrix metalloproteases, and activation of macrophages and effector T cells. Experiments in mice have demonstrated that membrane-bound, rather than soluble, TNF may play a significant role in intestinal inflammation.

### Critical roles of RGS16 in the mucosal inflammation of ulcerative colitis [^114UCCWx]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic and progressive inflammatory disorder. The regulator of the G-protein signaling (RGS) is involved in the pathogenesis of several immune system disorders. RGS16, a member of the RGS protein superfamily, has been shown to play critical roles in several immune system-related diseases. However, the roles of RGS16 in ulcerative colitis remain to be elucidated.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the expression of RGS16 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and inflamed mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. We performed Spearman's correlation to analyze the correlation between RGS16 expression and the ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity (UCEIS), Mayo index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and IL-17A levels. Further, PBMCs were stimulated with inflammatory cytokines in vitro.

- **Results**: RGS16 expression significantly increased in the colonic mucosa and PBMCs from patients with ulcerative colitis and significantly correlated with the Mayo index, UCEIS, ESR, and serum TNF-α and IL-17A levels. TNF-α upregulated RGS16 expression in PBMCs in a dose- and time-dependent manner via the nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) signaling pathway. Moreover, anti-TNF treatment with infliximab significantly decreased RGS16 expression in PBMCs and intestinal mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis.

- **Conclusion**: Our study revealed a novel mechanism by which RGS16 expression in ulcerative colitis is positively correlated with the disease's severity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.

### Critical roles of RGS16 in the mucosal inflammation of ulcerative colitis [^116Qc3et]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Anti-TNF treatment downregulates RGS16 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. TNF-α is crucial for the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, and anti-TNF treatment can ameliorate intestinal mucosal inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis. Hence, we hypothesized that anti-TNF participates in the TNF-α-induced increase in RGS16 expression in ulcerative colitis patients. IFX, an anti-TNF agent, is often used to treat ulcerative colitis.

Freshly inflamed colonic tissue from ulcerative colitis patients was obtained and treated with IFX for 24 hours. The levels of RGS16 significantly reduced after IFX treatment compared to the control treatment (Figure 5a). The same result was also observed in ulcerative colitis patient-isolated PBMCs treated with IFX for 24 hours (Figure 5b). Collectively, anti-TNF treatment downregulated RGS16 expression in inflamed intestinal tissues and PBMCs from patients with ulcerative colitis.

- **Figure 5**:
	- Anti-TNF treatment downregulated RGS16 expression.
	- (a) Freshly obtained inflamed colonic tissue from patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 12) were treated with IFX (50 μg/mL) or control for 24 hours, and RGS16 mRNA expression was measured by qRT-PCR.

### Therapeutic drug monitoring for current and investigational inflammatory bowel disease treatments [^111BgH2S]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which encompasses ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is a chronic, medically incurable disease that can be disabling. A recent systematic review of population-based studies on IBD indicated the highest prevalence in Europe (ulcerative colitis: 505 cases/100,000 persons in Norway; Crohn's disease: 322 cases/100,000 persons in Germany) and North America (ulcerative colitis: 286 cases/100,000 persons in the United States; Crohn's disease: 319 cases/100,000 persons in Canada), with the prevalence increasing in newly industrialized countries.

Management of IBD aims to induce and maintain clinical and endoscopic remission. Patients with IBD, therefore, require chronic medical treatment that is effective in maintaining remission with acceptable tolerability. Treatment options for the maintenance of remission in patients with moderate to severe IBD include, with regional variability, thiopurines [azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)]; methotrexate; biologic agents targeting tumor necrosis factor (TNF; infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, or golimumab), α 4 β 7 integrin (vedolizumab) or interleukins 12 and 23 (ustekinumab); and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (tofacitinib).

### Advancements in dual biologic therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases: efficacy, safety, and future directions [^112V9WRm]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are entities with a complex, multifactorial pathogenesis, comprising mainly ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Besides genetic and environmental factors, immunological elements are significant hallmarks in the development and maintenance of inflammation in IBD. Cytokines such as interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-5, IL-9, IL-13, and IL-33 are more characteristic of UC. In CD, substantial levels of IL-10, IL-12, IL-27, and interferon (IFN)-γ are expressed. IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, IL-21, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) are not specific and are found in both diseases. Among the cytokines, TNF-α is regarded as the most important player that drives inflammation. Anti-TNF-α therapy was the first biologic drug introduced to treat IBD. More than 20 years ago, the first chimeric antibodies against TNF-α were used to successfully treat CD and UC.

However, there have been significant developments since then, including the implementation of biosimilars, an expanded understanding of IBD, and the establishment of new therapeutic goals. Despite these advancements, up to 40% of IBD patients fail to respond to induction therapy with anti-TNF-α biologics, as assessed with mucosal healing, and 23–46% of patients experience a disease relapse in the maintenance phase after the initial response. Pathogenetic factors such as diet, pollution, genetics, and microbiota disturbances contribute to the immunological changes inducing intestinal inflammation. The broad spectrum of immunological mechanisms, such as immune cell trafficking, continues to be explored in this context.

### The role of early biologic therapy in inflammatory bowel disease [^111pTLTr]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The goals for treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are changing from the elimination of symptoms toward complete disease control — a process that demands both clinical and endoscopic remission. This new IBD treatment paradigm has been shifting from a conventional "step-up" approach toward a more "top-down" early intervention treatment strategy. Recent studies suggest that the use of biologic agents, specifically those targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha, earlier in the treatment course improves patient outcomes and can prevent progression to irreversible bowel damage. Although the strategy of early intervention has accumulating evidence in Crohn's disease, there is less evidence supporting its impact in ulcerative colitis.

### Pegasys [^11676Tvm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

The mechanism of action for PEGASYS is derived from its recombinant human interferon α-2a moiety. Peginterferon α-2a binds to the human type 1 interferon receptor, leading to receptor dimerization. This dimerization activates multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways, initially mediated by the JAK/STAT pathway. Given the diversity of cell types that respond to interferon α-2a and the multiplicity of potential intracellular responses to interferon receptor activation, peginterferon α-2a is expected to have pleiotropic biological effects in the body.

- **Activity against HCV**: In the stable HCV cell culture model system (HCV replicon), peginterferon α-2a inhibited HCV RNA replication, with an EC50 value of 0.1–3 ng/mL. The combination of peginterferon α-2a and ribavirin was more effective at inhibiting HCV RNA replication than either agent alone.

- **Resistance**: Different HCV genotypes display considerable clinical variability in their response to peginterferon-α and ribavirin therapy. Viral genetic determinants associated with the variable response have not been definitively identified.

- **Cross-resistance**: Cross-resistance between interferon-α and ribavirin has not been observed.

- **Host factors affecting response**: Polymorphisms in the IL28B gene have been shown to impact the response to peginterferon α-2a. Determining the IL28B genotype should be considered.

### Novel orally administered recombinant anti-TNF alpha fusion protein for the treatment of ulcerative colitis: Results from a phase 2a clinical trial [^113u48MC]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

The safety and exploratory immune modulatory effects of orally administered OPRX-106 were shown in a phase I study in humans. Three different doses (2, 8, or 16 mg/d) of OPRX-106 were orally administered for five consecutive days in 14 healthy volunteers. Treatment was found to be safe and well tolerated. The pharmacokinetic (PK) study showed that OPRX-106 is not absorbed into circulation. No effect on white blood cells (WBC) and lymphocyte counts was noted. A dose-dependent effect was observed on systemic lymphocytes.

- **Immune effects**: The oral administration of all three dosages was associated with an increase in CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD25+ subsets of suppressor lymphocytes. An increase in CD4+CD25+FoxP3 Tregs was noted in the group treated with 8 mg. Additionally, NKT regulatory cells, CD3+CD69+, and CD4+CD62 lymphocyte subsets increased with treatment. No change in serum TNFα was observed.

The present study was aimed at determining the safety, PK, and exploratory efficacy of orally administered human TNFR fusion protein expressed in plant cells in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC).
