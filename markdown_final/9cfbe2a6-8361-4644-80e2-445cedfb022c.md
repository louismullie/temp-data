## Question

At what level of wbc classifies pus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what WBC threshold, if any, defines pus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition of pus and whether any authoritative source ties it to a quantitative WBC threshold. Then, I should verify whether major guidelines or reviews actually specify a numeric WBC cutoff for calling something pus. Next, I will examine contexts where WBC counts are used diagnostically in fluids that might be confused with pus, such as synovial, ascitic, or pleural fluid, to see if any of those thresholds are mistakenly conflated with a definition of pus. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion and clarify the clinical implications for practice.

> Let me first confirm the definition of pus. Pus is a macroscopic mixture of dead neutrophils, cellular debris, proteinaceous exudate, and often bacteria; it is a pathologic material rather than a laboratory concentration, and standard references describe it qualitatively rather than as a numeric WBC threshold, which already makes me cautious about assuming a number exists for "pus" per se [^114Hz5t8].

> Wait, let me verify whether any guideline or review in the provided corpus actually states a WBC count that defines pus. I need to check carefully for any direct statement like "WBC > X equals pus". Hold on, I should verify across infectious disease and surgical sources. I find no document that provides a quantitative WBC cutoff to define pus; instead, pus is treated as a clinical/pathologic finding, and when WBC counts are discussed, they pertain to specific fluids (synovial, ascitic, pleural) or to systemic leukocytosis, not to a universal definition of pus itself [^1123kkjg] [^117GHjGJ] [^116hK7Pv].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could I be missing a threshold buried in a synovial fluid guideline or a peritoneal infection review? Let me consider the synovial fluid literature. The classic teaching for native septic arthritis uses a synovial WBC around 50,000/µL as strongly suggestive, but that is a diagnostic marker for infection, not a definition of pus; moreover, sensitivity is imperfect and lower thresholds have been proposed, reinforcing that these are diagnostic cut points, not a definition of pus [^1123kkjg] [^112n66oL] [^112qLutn]. I should double-check peritoneal infection criteria too: spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is diagnosed by an ascitic neutrophil count > 250 cells/mm³, again a disease-specific diagnostic threshold rather than a general definition of pus [^117GHjGJ] [^115nLPF8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — what about pleural empyema or other purulent collections? I need to ensure I'm not conflating empyema definitions with a generic pus definition. Pleural empyema is defined clinically and radiologically with purulent fluid, and while pleural WBC counts can help distinguish bacterial from other etiologies, there is still no authoritative numeric WBC definition of "pus" itself in these contexts, which supports the conclusion that no universal WBC threshold defines pus [^116hK7Pv].

> Let me reconsider the core question and synthesize. There is no established WBC count that defines pus; pus is a macroscopic, pathologic material composed largely of neutrophils and debris, and its recognition is clinical and macroscopic rather than defined by a laboratory WBC concentration. Numeric WBC thresholds exist for specific fluids (for example, synovial fluid > 50,000/µL suggesting native septic arthritis, ascitic neutrophils > 250/mm³ for SBP), but these are diagnostic criteria for particular diseases, not a general definition of pus [^114Hz5t8] [^1123kkjg] [^117GHjGJ].

> I should confirm the practical implication so we don't misapply cutoffs. Clinically, if fluid is frankly purulent, that appearance alone is sufficient to call it pus; if fluid is not overtly purulent, a high WBC count with neutrophil predominance increases the likelihood of infection depending on the fluid type and context, but it does not convert the fluid into "pus" by definition. Therefore, clinicians should interpret WBC counts within disease-specific frameworks and not use any WBC number as a standalone definition of pus [^112n66oL] [^117GHjGJ].

There is **no universal WBC threshold** that defines pus; pus is a macroscopic mixture of neutrophils, necrotic tissue, and bacteria, not a specific WBC count [^114Hz5t8]. Clinically, **> 50,000 WBC/µL** in synovial fluid strongly suggests septic arthritis, but lower counts do not exclude infection [^1123kkjg] [^112n66oL]. For peritoneal infections, **> 250 neutrophils/mm³** in ascitic or peritoneal fluid indicates bacterial infection [^117GHjGJ] [^115nLPF8]. For prosthetic joint infection, synovial WBC > 3,000/µL with > 80% neutrophils is supportive, but thresholds vary by joint and timing [^1116STtA] [^112Vv7Ew]. Always interpret WBC counts in clinical context, as no single cutoff defines pus [^117ACyCN].

## Definition and composition of pus

Pus is a thick, yellowish-white fluid composed primarily of **neutrophils**, necrotic tissue, and bacteria. It forms as part of the body's immune response to infection, particularly bacterial infections. The presence of pus indicates a significant inflammatory response and is clinically recognized by its macroscopic appearance and odor, rather than a specific WBC count [^113FJse4].

---

## Clinical contexts and WBC thresholds

While there is no universal WBC count that defines pus, several clinical contexts use WBC thresholds to indicate infection or inflammation. These thresholds vary depending on the **clinical scenario** and the type of fluid or tissue being analyzed.

---

### Synovial fluid analysis (septic arthritis)

In synovial fluid analysis for septic arthritis, a WBC count **> 50,000 cells/µL** is strongly suggestive of infection, although lower counts do not exclude it [^1123kkjg] [^112n66oL]. The EBJIS 2023 guidelines recommend considering a synovial WBC count > 50,000/µL as suggestive of septic arthritis in native joints, while recognizing that lower counts may still be consistent with infection, particularly in immunocompromised patients or early disease [^1123kkjg] [^111YZvNe].

---

### Ascitic fluid analysis (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis)

In ascitic fluid analysis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), a neutrophil count **> 250 cells/mm³** is diagnostic of bacterial infection [^117GHjGJ]. This threshold is widely accepted and recommended by major hepatology guidelines, including the British Association for the Study of the Liver (BASL) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) [^117GHjGJ] [^115nLPF8].

---

### Prosthetic joint infection (PJI)

For prosthetic joint infection (PJI), synovial fluid WBC counts and neutrophil percentages are used to diagnose infection. Commonly cited thresholds include a synovial WBC count **> 3,000 cells/µL** and a neutrophil percentage > 80% [^1116STtA]. However, these thresholds may vary depending on the joint involved, the timing of infection, and patient-specific factors [^111sBwq4].

---

## Limitations and variability of WBC counts

WBC counts alone **cannot definitively distinguish** bacterial from nonbacterial infections. Factors influencing WBC counts include:

- **Patient age**: Pediatric patients may have different baseline WBC counts compared to adults [^notfound].
- **Immune status**: Immunocompromised patients may have blunted WBC responses, making lower counts misleading [^116qTutk].
- **Clinical context**: The type of infection, duration, and presence of antibiotics can influence WBC counts [^111sBwq4].

Given these limitations, WBC counts should always be interpreted in conjunction with **clinical findings**, microbiological cultures, and other laboratory tests [^117ACyCN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Major infectious disease guidelines emphasize that **no single WBC count threshold** definitively defines pus or infection. Instead, they recommend using WBC counts as part of a comprehensive diagnostic approach that includes clinical assessment, microbiological cultures, and imaging studies when appropriate [^117ACyCN].

---

## Summary of WBC thresholds by clinical context

| **Clinical context** | **Wbc threshold** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Synovial fluid (septic arthritis) | > 50,000 cells/µL | Strongly suggestive of infection |
| Ascitic fluid (SBP) | > 250 neutrophils/mm³ | Diagnostic of bacterial infection |
| Synovial fluid (PJI) | > 3,000 cells/µL | Suggestive of infection |
| General infection (systemic) | > 12,000 cells/µL | Suggestive of systemic infection |

---

## Conclusion

There is **no universal WBC count** that defines pus. Pus is a macroscopic mixture of neutrophils, necrotic tissue, and bacteria, and its presence is determined by clinical assessment rather than a specific WBC threshold. WBC counts are useful adjuncts in diagnosing infection, but they must be interpreted in the context of the clinical scenario, patient factors, and other diagnostic tests [^117ACyCN].

### Clinical disease measures in generalized pustular psoriasis [^11324kzP]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

To overcome the limitations of the CGI scale and the lack of systemic measures, another GPP-specific measure, the Japanese Dermatological Association Severity Index of GPP (JDA-GPPSI), was introduced in the GPP Medical Practice Guideline to assess GPP severity based on skin symptoms and systemic involvement (Table 1). Cutaneous symptoms are assessed using a total skin score that ranges from 0 (none) to 9 (severe) and includes three components: overall erythema area, erythema area with pustules, and edema area. The systemic symptoms of GPP are assessed using a systemic/laboratory score that ranges from 0 to 8 and has four components: pyrexia, white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and serum albumin level. Each component is based on measurements of four anatomic regions that are summed to give the total BSA involvement (head [including neck, 10%], upper extremities [20%], trunk [including axillae and genitals, 30%], and lower extremities [including buttocks, 40%]). The total GPP score is the sum of the total skin score and the systemic/laboratory score and ranges from 0 to 17. The JDA-GPPSI classifies disease severity as mild (0–6), moderate (7–10), or severe (11–17).

### Intraoperative purulence is not reliable for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection [^113FJse4]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Purulence, defined as presence of pus, is based on subjective interpretation yet has been considered a definite sign of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). 583 patients undergoing revision arthroplasty due to presumed PJI were retrospectively studied. PJI definition was independent of purulence, based on the definition of Musculoskeletal Infection Society recently modified by International Consensus Group on PJI. 498 patients fulfilled the criteria for definite PJI and 59 patients were deemed as aseptic. Purulence had sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 0.82, 0.32, 0.91, and 0.17, respectively. Purulence was not correlated with higher culture positivity yet was associated with higher synovial WBC counts (mean of 34.8 versus 5.2×10(3)/μL in patients without purulence [P < 0.001]). In the absence of objective definition for purulence and in light of its inadequate test characteristics compared to a multi-criteria definition, purulence cannot serve as a single absolute diagnostic criterion for PJI.

### Infectious pulmonary diseases [^111Pf2wG]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a lower respiratory tract infection caused by the inability to clear pathogens from the lower airway and alveoli. Cytokines and local inflammatory markers are released, causing further damage to the lungs through the accumulation of white blood cells and fluid congestion, leading to pus in the parenchyma. The Infectious Diseases Society of America defines pneumonia as the presence of new lung infiltrate with other clinical evidence supporting infection, including new fever, purulent sputum, leukocytosis, and decline in oxygenation. Importantly, lower respiratory infections remain the most deadly communicable disease. Pneumonia is subdivided into three categories: (1) community acquired, (2) hospital acquired, and (3) ventilator associated. Therapy for each differs based on the severity of the disease and the presence of risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The following constitutes key background information on skin abscess:

- **Definition**: A skin abscess is a localized collection of pus within the dermis and deeper skin tissues, typically caused by bacterial infection.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology involves the invasion of bacteria into the skin, often through a break in the skin barrier. The body's immune response to this invasion leads to inflammation and the formation of pus, which is a collection of dead WBCs, bacteria, and tissue debris.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of skin abscess worldwide is estimated at 1861.45 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for skin abscesses include poor hygiene, trauma to the skin, and underlying medical conditions that compromise the immune system, such as diabetes or HIV infection. Other local factors, such as the presence of foreign materials or conditions like hidradenitis suppurativa and pilonidal cyst, can also contribute to the development of skin abscesses.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, skin abscesses typically present as a painful, red, swollen area on the skin. There may also be a visible accumulation of pus. In some cases, systemic signs of infection such as fever may be present.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for skin abscesses is generally good with appropriate treatment, which typically involves incision and drainage, and in some cases, antibiotic therapy.

### Diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection: has the era of the biomarker arrived? [^115TTUtz]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

If the biomarkers described in this study were merely mirroring the state of inflammation, we would have expected strong correlations among the biomarkers and between the biomarkers and synovial fluid WBC count. However, we did not identify many strong correlations between biomarkers and synovial fluid WBC count among infected patients. Nor did we identify many strong correlations among differing biomarkers. Therefore, it appears that these biomarkers are not merely redundant proxies for the local level of inflammation but instead are being modulated by other underlying causes.

There are several strengths of this study. First, to our knowledge, this is one of the largest diagnostic studies to date that utilizes the rigorous gold-standard MSIS definition for PJI. Second, patients usually excluded from similar diagnostic studies, such as those on antibiotics and those with systemic inflammatory disease, were included in this study to emulate standard clinical practice. In fact, 21% of infected patients in this study were on antibiotic treatment at the time of synovial fluid aspiration and 20% of all patients in the study had a history of systemic inflammatory disease, resulting in a historically challenging patient population. Finally, while some diagnostic biomarker studies limit their samples of PJI to a single organism, our study included all infected patients diagnosed by the MSIS criteria, demonstrating utility of the biomarkers for most representative pathogens. Based on this study, which supports our earlier work, we conclude that synovial fluid biomarkers show promise as a valuable tool for the diagnosis of PJI. Given the ability of these assays to match the results of the more complex MSIS definition of PJI, we believe that these assays can improve the diagnostic accuracy in the field.

What is the best timing of re-exploration?

Consider to plan the first re-exploration within 12–24 h and to repeat re-exploration(s) until the patient is free of necrosis (recommendation 1C).

There is a lack of literature examining outcomes in necrotizing infections when surgical re-debridements are performed in early versus delayed intervals. Scheduled re-explorations should be done at least every 12–24 h after the initial operation or sooner if clinical local or systemic signs of worsening infection become evident, as well as with worsening laboratory parameters (particularly WBC count). Re-explorations should be repeated until the time when very little or no debridement is required.

A prospective observational study by Okoye et al. showed that delayed re-debridement after initial source control in necrotizing infections results in worse survival and an increased incidence of acute kidney injury. The authors concluded that further studies to identify the optimal time interval for re-debridement are warranted.

Recognize that low synovial WBC count (< 25, 000/mcL) decreases post-test probability, but not excludes, septic arthritis of a native joint.

### The EBJIS definition of periprosthetic joint infection [^1116STtA]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Blood biomarkers

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white cell count, percentage of polymorph neutrophils (PMN), and CRP are the most widely available and studied. They are all a reflection of general inflammation and are affected by non-infective inflammatory conditions and may be normal in low-grade infections.

CRP is especially useful in gauging the systemic severity of any infection, and is often recommended for septic screening. In the absence of other causes of raised inflammatory markers, which are often easy to exclude (e.g. crystal arthropathy, active inflammatory joint disease, periprosthetic fracture, or in the first few postoperative weeks), CRP level above 10 mg/l has sufficient specificity to be associated with PJI in the majority of cases. It cannot be used alone to confirm or exclude PJI, but a raised CRP without other cause should prompt the clinician to think about the likelihood of PJI. A normal CRP does not exclude infection.

Synovial fluid cytology

Synovial fluid aspiration in suspected PJI is a central part of the diagnostic pathway. It not only allows assessment of the degree of local inflammation, but also enables limited microbiological analysis. Synovial white blood cell (WBC) count has been included in all of the major definitions. - The diagnostic cut-offs proposed in the literature vary between 1,500 and 4,000 cells/µL and the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) between 65% and 80%.

This variation highlights the difficulty for a bimodal definition set. In most analyses, sensitivities and specificities are around 90% and largely depend on the definition used to diagnose PJI. Levels for WBC count and PMNs below the lowest reported cut-offs can be used to indicate that an infection is unlikely. Values above this threshold may suggest infection, especially in PJI of the knee. In addition, there is a high level of consensus and literature support for a cut-off value of 3,000 cells/µl and a percentage of PMNs above 80% to confirm a PJI in the hip and knee. It must be noted that these cut-off levels can be affected by other conditions, and may not be appropriate for other joints, particularly in the upper limbs. Future studies are necessary to define the best cut-off level in these joints.

### Synovial fluid analysis [^115LgqPD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

AsA prompt and accurate diagnosis of a painful, swollen joint is imperative, primarily in the case of a septic joint, as delayed therapy may result in progression of disease or permanent loss of function. Procurement and analysis of synovial fluid (SF) are paramount in helping the clinician to determine a patient's clinical condition and further course of treatment. Measurement of white blood cell (WBC) counts, crystal analysis by polarized microscopy, and microbiologic studies including Gram stain and culture are the SF parameters that are collectively most important in the ultimate determination by a clinician of the presence or absence of an infectious or inflammatory joint. It is important for the clinician to understand and recognize the limitations of various SF parameters to minimize under-treating patients with potentially serious joint pathology.

### Synovial cell count before reimplantation can predict the outcome of patients with periprosthetic knee infections undergoing two-stage exchange [^114LLqkW]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although synovial fluid can be used to diagnose periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) effectively, only the cutoff values adopted at the time of PJI diagnosis have been standardized, and few data are currently available about effectiveness of synovial fluid examination before definitive reimplantation.

Questions/Purposes

We asked: (1) What are the most appropriate thresholds for synovial fluid leukocyte counts (WBC) and neutrophil percentage (PMN percentage) in a patient group undergoing definitive reimplantation after an uninterrupted course of antibiotic therapy for chronic PJI? (2) What is the predictive value of our synovial WBC and PMN percentage threshold compared with previously proposed thresholds?

Methods

In all, 101 patients with PJI were evaluated for inclusion from January 2016 to December 2018. Nineteen percent (19 of 101) of patients were excluded because of the presence of a chronic inflammatory disease, acute/late hematogenous infection, low amount of synovial fluid for laboratory investigations or infection persistence after spacer placement, and adequate antibiotic therapy. Finally, 81% (82 of 101) of patients with a median (range) age of 74 years (48 to 92) undergoing two-stage revision for chronic TKA infection, who were followed up at our institution for a period 96 weeks or more, were included in this study. The patients did not discontinue antibiotic treatment before reimplantation and were treated for 15 days after reimplantation if intraoperative cultures were negative. No patient remained on suppressive treatment after reimplantation. Synovial fluid was aspirated aseptically with a knee spacer in place to evaluate the cell counts before reimplantation. Thirteen percent (11 of 82) of patients had persistent or recurrent infection, defined as continually elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein levels coupled with local signs and symptoms or positive cultures. The synovial fluid WBC counts and PMN percentage from the 11 patients with persistent or recurrent PJI were compared with the 71 patients who were believed to be free of PJI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses assessed the predictive value of the parameters, and the areas under the curves (AUCs) were evaluated. The sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values were determined for the WBC count and PMN percentage. Patients with persistent or recurrent infection had higher median WBC counts (471 cells/µL versus 1344 cells/µL; p < 0.001) and PMN percentage (36% versus 61%; p < 0.001) than did patients believed to be free of PJI.

Results

ROC curve analysis identified the best threshold values to be a WBC count of 934 cells/µL or more (sensitivity 0.82 [95% CI 0.71 to 0.89], specificity 0.82 [95% CI 0.71 to 0.89]) as well as a PMN percentage of at least 52% (sensitivity 0.82 [95% CI 0.71 to 0.89] and specificity 0.78 [95% CI 0.67 to 0.86]. We found no difference between the AUCs for the WBC count and the PMN percentage (0.87 [95% CI 0.79 to 0.96] versus 0.84 [95% CI 0.73 to 0.95]. Comparing the sensitivities and specificities of the synovial fluid WBC count and PMN percentage proposed by other authors, we find that a PMN percentage more than 52% showed better predictive value than previously reported.

Conclusion

Based on our findings, we believe that patients with WBC counts of at least 934 and PMN percentage of 52% or more should not undergo reimplantation but rather a repeat debridement, as their risk of persistent or recurrent PJI appears prohibitively high. The accuracy of the proposed cutoffs is better than previously reported.

### How sensitive is the synovial fluid white blood cell count in diagnosing septic arthritis? [^112qLutn]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was conducted to determine the sensitivity of the current standard for synovial fluid leukocytosis analysis in diagnosing infectious arthritis or a septic joint. How accurate is the standard synovial fluid white blood cell (WBC) cutoff of 50,000 WBC/mm3 to rule out septic arthritis?

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study at an urban tertiary care medical center with 50,000 adult emergency department visits per year. The study population consisted of patients with infectious arthritis confirmed by synovial fluid culture growth of a pathogenic organism. The study period lasted from January 1996 to December 2002. Extracted data included synovial fluid leukocyte count, Gram's stain, culture, past medical history, and discharge diagnosis. Fisher exact test was used to compare proportions. Sensitivity and means were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results

There were 49 culture-positive synovial fluid aspirates in the 6-year study period. Nineteen (39%) of 49 patients (95% CI, 25%-52%) had a synovial WBC of less than 50,000/mm3 and 30 (61%) of 49 patients (95% CI, 48%-75%) had a synovial WBC of more than 50,000/mm3. The sensitivity of the 50,000 synovial WBC/mm3 cutoff was 61% (95% CI, 48%-75%). Twenty-seven (55%) of 49 patients had a negative Gram's stain (95% CI, 41%-69%) and 15 (56%) of 27 patients (95% CI, 37%-74%) with negative Gram's stain had a synovial WBC of less than 50,000/mm3.

Conclusion

A synovial fluid WBC cutoff of 50,000/mm3 lacks the sensitivity required to be clinically useful in ruling out infectious arthritis.

Neutrophilic dermatoses are a group of inflammatory skin conditions characterized by a neutrophilic infiltrate on histopathology with no evidence of infection. These conditions present with a wide range of clinical manifestations, including pustules, bullae, abscesses, papules, nodules, plaques, and ulcers. The classification of neutrophilic dermatoses is based on the localization of neutrophils in the skin. The pathogenic mechanisms of neutrophilic dermatoses involve autoinflammation, neutrophilic dysfunction, clonal somatic mutation and differentiation of the myeloid precursors as encountered in myeloid neoplasm.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111eVYNk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — purulent skin and soft tissue infections (abscesses, furuncles, carbuncles, inflamed epidermoid cysts) recommendations are as follows: Gram stain and culture of pus from carbuncles and abscesses are recommended, but treatment without these studies is reasonable in typical cases (strong, moderate). Gram stain and culture of pus from inflamed epidermoid cysts are not recommended (strong, moderate). Incision and drainage is the recommended treatment for inflamed epidermoid cysts, carbuncles, abscesses, and large furuncles (strong, high). The decision to administer antibiotics directed against S. aureus as an adjunct to incision and drainage should be based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria such as temperature ≥ 38°C or < 36°C, tachypnea > 24 breaths per minute, tachycardia > 90 beats per minute, or white blood cell count > 12 000 or < 4000 cells/µL (moderate; Figure 1) (strong, low), and an antibiotic active against MRSA is recommended for patients with carbuncles or abscesses who have markedly impaired host defenses and in patients with SIRS (Figure 1, Table 2) (strong, low).

Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of skin and soft tissue infections state that a swab is not the optimal choice for these specimens and to submit tissue, fluid, aspirate where possible; do not use the label "wound" alone and be specific about the actual anatomical site and type of wound (ie, "human bite wound from the right forearm", "surgical incision") from which the specimen was collected; the specimen of choice is a firm sample of the advancing margin of the wound/lesion, not just the surface of the wound/lesion; pus alone is inadequate and does not specifically represent the disease process; when submitting curettes or biopsies for culture, also retain for histopathology analysis only; and do not request the laboratory to report everything that grows.

### Utility of synovial white blood cell count and differential before reimplantation surgery [^115VBTvK]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Determining optimal timing of reimplantation during 2-stage exchange for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) remains elusive. Joint aspiration for synovial white blood cell (WBC) count and neutrophil percentage (PMN%) before reimplantation is widely performed; yet, the implications are rarely understood. Therefore, this study investigates (1) the diagnostic yield of synovial WBC count and differential analysis and (2) the calculated thresholds for persistent infection.

Methods

Institutional PJI databases identified 129 patients undergoing 2-stage exchange arthroplasty who had joint aspiration before reimplantation between February 2005 and May 2014. Persistent infection was defined as a positive aspirate culture, positive intraoperative cultures, or persistent symptoms of PJI-including subsequent PJI-related surgery. Receiver-operating characteristic curve was used to calculate thresholds maximizing sensitivity and specificity.

Results

Thirty-three cases (33 of 129; 25.6%) were classified with persistent PJI. Compared with infection-free patients, these patients had significantly elevated PMN% (62.2% vs 48.9%; p = 0.03) and WBC count (1804 vs 954 cells/μL; p = 0.04). The receiver-operating characteristic curve provided thresholds of 62% and 640 cells/μL for synovial PMN% and WBC count, respectively. These thresholds provided sensitivity of 63% and 54.5% and specificity of 62% and 60.0%, respectively. The risk of persistent PJI for patients with PMN% > 90% was 46.7% (7 of 15).

Conclusion

Synovial fluid analysis before reimplantation has unclear utility. Although statistically significant elevations in synovial WBC count and PMN% are observed for patients with persistent PJI, this did not translate into useful thresholds with clinical importance. However, with little other guidance regarding the timing of reimplantation, severely elevated WBC count and differential analysis may be of use.

Question 14 — cell counts and chemistries for suspected extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB): The committee identified no accuracy studies and relied on clinical experience (very low-quality evidence). Recommendation 14 states, We suggest that cell counts and chemistries be performed on amenable fluid specimens collected from sites of suspected extrapulmonary TB (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence), with remarks that amenable fluids include pleural, cerebrospinal, ascitic, and joint fluids. The guideline notes these tests can be performed in hours, are inexpensive, and are technically simple, and that specificity is poor if interpreted alone but substantially better in the clinical context with radiographic and laboratory findings.

### Does this adult patient have septic arthritis? [^112n66oL]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

In patients who present with an acutely painful and swollen joint, prompt identification and treatment of septic arthritis can substantially reduce morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To review the accuracy and precision of the clinical evaluation for the diagnosis of nongonococcal bacterial arthritis.

Data Sources

Structured PubMed and EMBASE searches (1966 through January 2007), limited to human, English-language articles and using the following Medical Subject Headings terms: arthritis, infectious, physical examination, medical history taking, diagnostic tests, and sensitivity and specificity.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they contained original data on the accuracy or precision of historical items, physical examination, serum, or synovial fluid laboratory data for diagnosing septic arthritis.

Data Extraction

Three authors independently abstracted data from the included studies.

Data Synthesis

Fourteen studies involving 6242 patients, of whom 653 met the gold standard for the diagnosis of septic arthritis, satisfied all inclusion criteria. Two studies examined risk factors and found that age, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, joint surgery, hip or knee prosthesis, skin infection, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection significantly increase the probability of septic arthritis. Joint pain (sensitivity, 85%; 95% confidence interval, 78%-90%), a history of joint swelling (sensitivity, 78%; 95% CI, 71%-85%), and fever (sensitivity, 57%; 95% CI, 52%-62%) are the only findings that occur in more than 50% of patients. Sweats (sensitivity, 27%; 95% CI, 20%-34%) and rigors (sensitivity, 19%; 95% CI, 15%-24%) are less common findings in septic arthritis. Of all laboratory findings readily available to the clinician, the 2 most powerful were the synovial fluid white blood cell (WBC) count and percentage of polymorphonuclear cells from arthrocentesis. The summary likelihood ratio (LR) increased as the synovial fluid WBC count increased (for counts < 25,000/microL: LR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.23–0.43; for counts ≥ 25,000/microL: LR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.5–3.4; for counts > 50,000/microL: LR, 7.7; 95% CI, 5.7–11.0; and for counts > 100,000/microL: LR, 28.0; 95% CI, 12.0–66.0). On the same synovial fluid sample, a polymorphonuclear cell count of at least 90% suggests septic arthritis with an LR of 3.4 (95% CI, 2.8–4.2), while a polymorphonuclear cell count of less than 90% lowers the likelihood (LR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.25–0.47).

Conclusions

Clinical findings identify patients with peripheral, monoarticular arthritis who might have septic arthritis. However, the synovial WBC and percentage of polymorphonuclear cells from arthrocentesis are required to assess the likelihood of septic arthritis before the Gram stain and culture test results are known.

### Diagnosis and prevention of periprosthetic joint infections [^116tQubH]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) clinical considerations — diagnostic approach and culture practices are outlined: It is important to distinguish PJI from non-infectious causes of arthroplasty failure because of divergent surgical and medical management. The infecting microorganism(s) should ideally be defined to direct antimicrobial therapy, and only cultures and microbe-directed molecular diagnostics are able to define the infecting microorganism(s). Preferably, a diagnosis should be established pre-operatively; if feasible, preoperative arthrocentesis is recommended, with fluid submitted for leukocyte count and differential, as well as aerobic and anaerobic cultures. For synovial fluid culture, culture in blood cultures bottles may be helpful, although there is no United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved/cleared system for this approach, and no evidence supports routine fungal and mycobacterial cultures of synovial fluid. Interpretive criteria for synovial fluid leukocyte counts and differentials vary from native joint septic arthritis, some studies suggest different cutoffs for hip versus knee arthroplasties, and cutoffs may vary with the time post-arthroplasty; definition of appropriate cutoffs is beyond the scope of this guideline.

### Accumulation of fatty marrow in the osteonecrotic hip mimicking joint infection [^116c1ERa]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Factors such as lipids or cholesterol crystals in body fluids can cause a spurious elevation of leukocytes (WBC) in an automated cell count. This artifact can occur in automated WBC counts of hip fluid from femoral head osteonecrosis (ON), and an erroneous diagnosis of septic arthritis can be made.

Question/Purposes

We describe the frequency of this artifactual leukocytosis in femoral head ON and how to differentiate it from septic arthritis.

Methods

From September 1997 to June 2004, 414 patients (486 hips) with femoral head ON were scheduled to undergo THAs. Although we had no preoperative suspicion of infection, we intraoperatively suspected concomitant pyogenic arthritis in eight patients (eight hips) because pus-like fluid gushed from the joint during the operation. To confirm the presence or absence of infection we intraoperatively evaluated the joint fluid with automated blood cell count and microscopy. The automated WBC count was elevated in all eight patients. In seven of the eight patients, WBCs were not identified under microscopic observation and the leukocytosis of automated cell counting was considered to be erroneous. These seven patients underwent THAs. The minimum followup was 3 years (average, 45 months; range, 36–60 months).

Results

These seven patients were considered to have a spurious elevation of WBC (range, 4500–18,400/mm(3); mean, 8970/mm(3)) in an automated cell count. The prevalence of the spurious leukocytosis was 1.4% (7/414) in osteonecrotic hips. In all seven patients, we observed numerous fat cells and globules instead of WBCs under microscopic observation. No bacteria were seen in the smear and culture of the joint fluid. The seven patients underwent THAs, and no patient had a subsequent deep wound infection as of the last followup.

Conclusions

Fatty joint effusion in an osteonecrotic hip may appear like pus and erroneously can be interpreted as leukocytes in an automated cell count. In this situation, a microscopic evaluation of joint fluid smear should be performed to determine the presence of infection and the treatment method.

### Consensus document for the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infections: a joint paper by the EANM, EBJIS, and ESR (with ESCMID endorsement) [^112Vv7Ew]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

8. Leukocyte count and differential in synovial fluid has high diagnostic accuracy in detecting PJI.

Level of evidence: 2.

Patients with abnormal CRP and/or ESR should undergo aspiration of the hip or knee. We recommend that aspiration fluid be tested for white blood cell count (WBC) and percentage of neutrophils. Our systematic review of the literature showed high sensitivity and specificity for both tests. Synovial white blood cell count had sensitivity of 36–100% and specificity of 80–99%. Differential count had sensitivity of 84–100% and specificity of 80–99%. A threshold for white blood cell count of > 3000 cells/μl seems justified based on the studies found (the thresholds from various reports vary from 1700 cells/μl to 5000 cells/μl). Neutrophil percentage > 70% is highly suggestive of prosthetic joint infection (range 65–80%). Fourteen level 2 studies addressed the diagnostic efficacy of synovial fluid white blood cell count and differential. Aspiration of synovial fluid for white blood cell count has advantages. It can be performed in the outpatient setting, and the results do not appear to be influenced by antimicrobial treatment.

9. Bacterial culture from joint aspiration has high diagnostic accuracy in detecting prosthetic joint infection.

Level of evidence: 2.

Given the limitations of the preoperative diagnostic work-up in identifying the presence or absence of infection, fluid and tissue cultures of the suspected infection site are often necessary. Twenty-three level 2 studies in our systematic review showed moderate to high sensitivity (43.5–100%) and high specificity (81.2–100%) for cultures. The culture of multiple intraoperative tissue samples is important for the differentiation of contamination from infection. Accordingly, we recommend using five tissue samples for microbial culture for both aerobic and anaerobic culturing. Cultures can reliably confirm the etiology of joint infection in cases where two or more tissue samples show growth of the same micro-organism. The incubation time should be at least 7 days, although some studies even advise an incubation time of 2 weeks. Cultures may be false-negative due to prior use of an antimicrobial agent, low number of organisms, use of an inappropriate culture medium, infection by a fastidious organism, or prolonged transport time to the microbiology laboratory. Therefore, it is advisable to stop antibiotic treatment at least 2 weeks before sampling.

### Leukocyte and bacterial counts do not correlate with severity of symptoms in men with chronic prostatitis: the National Institutes of Health chronic prostatitis cohort study [^117XZGn8]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We examine whether leukocytes and bacteria correlate with symptom severity in men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

Materials and Methods

All 488 men screened into the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Cohort Study before close of recruitment on August 22, 2001 were selected for analysis. The National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index, including subscores, were used to measure symptoms. Urethral inflammation was defined as white blood cell (WBC) counts of 1 or more (1+) in the first voided urine. Participants were classified as category IIIa based on WBC counts of 5 or more, or 10 or more (5+, 10+) in the expressed prostatic secretion, or 1+ or 5+ either in the post-expressed prostatic secretion urine (voided urine 3) or semen. Uropathogens were classified as localizing if the designated bacterial species were absent in voided urine 1 and voided urine 2 but present in expressed prostatic secretion, voided urine 3 or semen, or present in expressed prostatic secretion, voided urine 3 or semen at 2 log concentrations higher than at voided urine 1 or 2. Associations between symptoms, and inflammation and infection were investigated using generalized Mantel-Haenszel methods.

Results

Of all participants 50% had urethral leukocytes and of 397 with expressed prostatic secretion samples 194 (49%) and 122 (31%) had 5+ or 10+ WBCs in expressed prostatic secretion, respectively. The prevalence of category IIIa ranged from 90% to 54%, depending on the composite set of cut points. None of the index measures were statistically different (p > 0.10) for selected leukocytosis subgroups. Based on prostate and semen cultures, 37 of 488 men (8%) had at least 1 localizing uropathogen. None of the index measures were statistically different (p > 0.10) for selected bacterial culture subgroups.

Conclusions

Although men with chronic prostatitis routinely receive anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial therapy, we found that leukocytes and bacterial counts as we defined them do not correlate with severity of symptoms. These findings suggest that factors other than leukocytes and bacteria also contribute to symptoms associated with chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

### What is the diagnostic accuracy of aspirations performed on hips with antibiotic cement spacers? [^117X75X4]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Periprosthetic joint infection is a serious complication after THA and commonly is treated with a two-stage revision. Antibiotic-eluting cement spacers are placed for local delivery of antibiotics. Aspirations may be performed before the second-stage reimplantation for identification of persistent infection. However, limited data exist regarding the diagnostic parameters of synovial fluid aspiration with or without saline lavage from a hip with an antibiotic-loaded cement spacer.

Questions/Purposes

We asked: (1) For hips with antibiotic cement spacers, does saline lavage influence the diagnostic validity of aspirations? (2) What is the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative aspirations performed on hips with antibiotic cement spacers using the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria, stratified by saline and nonlavage? (3) For hips with antibiotic spacers, what are the optimal thresholds for synovial fluid white blood cell (WBC) count and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) percentage for diagnosing infections?

Methods

One hundred seventy-four hips (155 patients) with antibiotic-eluting cement spacers inserted between October 2012 and July 2015 were reviewed. Of these, 98 hips (80 patients) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis (77 nonlavage, 21 saline lavage aspirations). Laboratory data from the aspiration and preoperative workup and intraoperative details were collected. Infection status of each hip procedure was determined based on a modified MSIS criteria using serologic, histologic, and intraoperative findings (sinus tract communicating with the joint at surgery or two positive intraoperative periprosthetic cultures with the same organism or two of the three following criteria: elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] [> 30 mm/hour] and C-reactive protein [CRP] [> 10 mg/L], a single positive intraoperative periprosthetic tissue culture, or a positive histologic analysis of periprosthetic tissue [> 5 neutrophils per high power field]). The diagnostic parameters were calculated for the MSIS criteria thresholds for synovial fluid (ie, WBC count > 3000 cells/µL and PMN percentage > 80%). Optimal thresholds were calculated for the corrected synovial WBC count and PMN percentage with a receiver operating characteristic curve. Separate analyses were performed for the hips with successful aspirations (nonlavage group) and those with saline lavage aspirations.

Results

The WBC count and PMN percentage were higher in hips with infection than in hips without infection when nonlavage aspirations were done (WBC count, 6680 cells/µL ± 6980 cells/µL vs 2001 ± 4825; mean difference, 4679; 95% CI, 923–8436; p = 0.015; PMN percentage, 83% ± 13% vs 44% ± 30%; mean difference, 39%; 95% CI, 39%-49%; p < 0.001) and the findings between infected and noninfected aspirations were not different when saline lavage aspirations were done (WBC count, 782 cells/µL ± 696 vs 307 cells/µL ± 343; mean difference, 475; 95% CI, -253 to 1203; p = 0.161; PMN percentage, 67% ± 15% vs 58% ± 28%; mean difference, 10%; 95% CI, -11% to 30%; p = 0.331). Aspirations performed without lavage yielded good diagnostic accuracy in all parameters (WBC count, 78% [95% CI, 70%-86%]; PMN percentage. 79% [95% CI, 70%-88%]; positive culture: 84% [95% CI, 81%-90%]; at least one of the above: 79% [95% CI, 70%-88%]); but in the saline lavage group, none had WBC counts above the threshold (diagnostic accuracies for WBC count, 0%; PMN percentage, 71% [95% CI, 62%-86%]; positive culture, 76% [95% CI, 76%-86%]; at least one: 71% [95% CI, 57%-91%]). Because saline lavage did not result in differences between aspirations from infected and noninfected hips, we calculated the optimal thresholds in the nonlavage group only; the optimal threshold for synovial WBC count was 1166 cells/µL and for synovial PMN the percentage was 68%, which corresponds to WBC count diagnostic accuracy of 78% (95% CI, 69%-87%) and PMN percentage accuracy of 78% (95% CI, 69%-87%).

Conclusions

Because the MSIS criteria thresholds resulted in suboptimal sensitivities owing to a higher number of false negatives, we recommend considering lower WBC count and PMN percentage thresholds for hip-spacer aspirations. Furthermore, the WBC count and PMN percentage results from aspirations performed with saline lavage are not reliable for treatment decisions.

Level Of Evidence

Level III, diagnostic study.

### Septic arthritis in immunosuppressed patients: Do laboratory values help? [^111gcqLA]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Besides the synovial fluid cell count we also evaluated the serum WBC count, ESR, and CRP. We additionally evaluated the percentage of synovial neutrophils and found that none of these values were helpful in predicting which patients would have positive cultures in the immunosuppressed population. Based on these results we recommend that clinicians have a heightened suspicion for septic arthritis in immunosuppressed patients and rely more on clinical evaluation than the laboratory values to avoid a delayed or missed diagnosis.

There are unavoidable limitations with this study. This was performed as a retrospective review and has all the inherent limitations of this study design. Although this study comprised mostly of septic arthritis involving the knee joint, other joints were included in the analysis, which adds to the complexity of interpreting the results because different joints could have different physiologic responses to infection. Previous studies have however used a similar approach. The main limitation of this study is the small sample size, which is a combined effect of studying a rare patient population and our strict criteria for inclusion into the study. This results in a low power to detect differences between our patient cohorts. A multicenter approach would be needed to overcome this. Despite these limitations, we think these data are valuable because the main focus of the study was to determine if the average cell count in the immunosuppressed patients reached the commonly cited 50,000 cells/mm⁻³ threshold rather than to determine absolute differences between the patient cohorts.

### Impact of antibiotic pretreatment on cultures in children with osteomyelitis and septic arthritis: a retrospective review [^114FjH5R]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteomyelitis and septic arthritis are two diagnoses commonly encountered in pediatric hospital medicine with an incidence of 1 in 5000–10,000 and 1 in 2700–100,000, respectively. These diagnoses frequently require hospitalization for workup and initiation of treatment. Treatment involves prompt diagnosis, long-term antimicrobial therapy, and sometimes surgical debridement. Though there is a lack of universally-accepted diagnostic criteria for these infections, a combination of pathogen detection, imaging consistent with osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis, and clinical data such as inability to bear weight, decreased range of motion, presence of fever, and elevated inflammatory markers or white blood cell (WBC) count is often used to confirm the diagnosis.

Pathogen detection is important to direct and narrow antimicrobial therapy, but patients may be treated for these infections even with negative cultures to avoid complications related to untreated infection. Cultures may not yield the causative organism, or the pathogen may only be isolated from the affected bone or joint. Rates of culture-negative pediatric musculoskeletal infection range from 16 to 42%. Initial blood cultures have been reported to be positive in 30–50% of children with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, whereas bone biopsy cultures are reported to be positive in 50–70%. A systematic review and several other small studies of pediatric patients with acute osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis found that pathogens were more likely to be isolated from culture samples at the source of infection (joint aspirate, bone biopsy, pus) than from blood culture.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^113sCKrm]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Analysis

The benchmark for diagnosis of gout is the appearance of negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals in synovial fluid or tophaceous material under polarized light microscopy. This is in contrast to CPPD crystals, which will appear rhomboid shaped and positively birefringent. In addition to crystal analysis, synovial fluid samples should always be sent for cell count with differential, Gram stain and culture. Synovial fluid white blood cell (WBC) counts under 50,000 cells/μL (or mm 3) in the presence of MSU crystals are generally not suspicious for septic arthritis. Special attention must be paid even in cases of synovial WBC below this level if patients are immunocompromised and unable to mount the immune response of a high synovial fluid WBC count. In addition, ruptured tophi with overlying skin ulceration should increase suspicion for possible coinfection. Synovial fluid cultures should be followed over time even in patients with low suspicion of infection, and Gram stains have a high positive predictive value but cannot exclude septic arthritis if negative.

In addition to aspiration, other laboratory tests can help confirm a diagnosis of suspected gout. C-reactive protein (CRP) is usually increased during a gout flare and can be quite high, although a high CRP alone is nonspecific. In other words, a high CRP alone does not necessarily mean that septic arthritis is present, whereas a CRP under 100 mg/dL in the setting of a lower synovial fluid WBC count and the presence of MSU crystals is generally consistent with gout. Serum WBC may or may not be elevated during a gout flare depending on the amount of systemic inflammation, and therefore, the test is less useful. Serum urate levels are also less useful as they can be normal during a gout flare, and conversely, many patients with higher serum urate levels do not have gout. Finally, blood cultures should be ordered in patients with signs of sepsis and if positive increase suspicion for septic arthritis.

### Working formulation for the standardization of definitions of infections in patients using ventricular assist devices [^114oD3fM]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2011). Medium credibility.

Ventricular assist device (VAD) suspected infection — investigations include initial labs and exit-site sampling, cardiac imaging, blood cultures with specified timing/volumes, device- and site-directed cultures, targeted screening, and adjunct imaging. For labs and local sampling, obtain white blood cell count, serial C-reactive protein, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate; and if pus is present at the driveline exit site, send a sterile aspirate for Gram stain, KOH, and routine bacterial and fungal culture. Perform an echocardiogram with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) if a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is negative, and obtain a chest X-ray. Blood cultures require at least 3 sets taken at different times over 24 hours with 2 sets from peripheral sites preferably, and if there is a central venous catheter (CVC) in situ, take at least 1 central and 1 peripheral set at the same time; each set should include aerobic and anaerobic bottles with at least 10 mL of blood per bottle in adult cases or 1 ml/kg per bottle for pediatric patients. For device-/site-directed microbiology, aspirate the external aspect of the VAD (anterior and posterior) for culture; aspirate the outflow and inflow cannula parts of the VAD (internal aspect) for culture; culture saline instilled into the VAD (internal aspect); send a sample of pus for Gram stain, KOH, and bacterial/fungal culture; and submit ≥ 2 tissue samples from suspicious tissue surrounding the VAD, driveline, or anastomoses for histology and cultures. When clinically indicated, screen for Staphylococcus aureus carriage with nasal, throat, and groin aspirates; if suspicious of a pocket infection, obtain abdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) abdomen/thorax, ± nuclear imaging study; consider image-guided aspiration or brush of pocket/driveline; and rule out other potential septic sources. Abbreviations used include CT (computed tomography), US (ultrasound), TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram), and TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram).

### Periprosthetic joint infection diagnosis: a complete understanding of white blood cell count and differential [^111MGvEz]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2012). Low credibility.

Recent research has raised doubts regarding the utility of serum white blood cell count (WBC) for diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). As synovial WBC and neutrophil (PMN) percentage have been adopted as accurate markers of PJI, this study investigated the correlation of WBC in serum versus joint fluid and diagnostic value of all WBC levels for failed arthroplasty patients. 153 patients (73 PJI) undergoing revision knee arthroplasty were identified. Weak correlations between joint fluid and serum for WBC (R = 0.19), PMN count (R = 0.31), and lymphocyte count (R = -0.22) were observed. Diagnostic accuracy of PMN (93%) and WBC (93%) synovial count relative to serum was similar to synovial WBC (93%) and PMN% (95%) alone. Serum WBC analysis does little to improve the accurate diagnosis of PJI.

### A comprehensive review of abdominal infections [^111ywuzz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Definitions

Intra-abdominal infection (IAI) describes a diverse set of diseases. It is broadly defined as peritoneal inflammation in response to microorganisms, resulting in purulence in the peritoneal cavity. IAI are classified as uncomplicated or complicated based on the extent of infection.

Uncomplicated abdominal infections involve intramural inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract without anatomic disruption. They are often simple to treat; however, when treatment is delayed or inappropriate, or the infection involves a more virulent nosocomial microbe, the risk of progression into a complicated abdominal infection becomes significant.

Complicated abdominal infections extend beyond the source organ into the peritoneal space. They cause peritoneal inflammation, and are associated with localized or diffuse peritonitis. Localized peritonitis often manifests as an abscess with tissue debris, bacteria, neutrophils, macrophages, and exudative fluid contained in a fibrous capsule. Diffuse peritonitis is categorized as primary, secondary or tertiary peritonitis.

Primary peritonitis is also known as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. It is thought to be the result of bacterial translocation across an intact gut wall. These infections are commonly monomicrobial, and the infecting organism is primarily determined by patient demographics. For example, healthy young girls are most often infected by streptococcal organisms, cirrhotics by gram negative or enterococcal organisms, and peritoneal dialysis patients by Staphylococcus aureus. Diagnosis requires peritoneal fluid aspiration. Characteristics of infection include white blood cell count (WBC) > 500 cells/mm 3, high lactate, and low glucose levels. Positive peritoneal fluid cultures are definitive, and resolution of infection is marked by peritoneal fluid with < 250 WBC/mm 3.

Secondary peritonitis is caused by microbial contamination through a perforation, laceration, or necrotic segment of the GI tract. Definitive diagnosis is based on clinical examination and history, and specific diagnoses can be confirmed by radiographic imaging. If a patient is stable enough for transport, computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous and oral contrast is the standard method of evaluating most intra-abdominal pathologies, such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, and colitis. Suspected biliary pathology is the exception, and ultrasound is the preferred initial imaging modality for this spectrum of disease including acute cholecystitis, emphysematous cholecystitis, and cholangitis. Infections associated with secondary peritonitis are commonly polymicrobial and the infecting organisms are those most commonly associated with the source of contamination (see Table 1).

Surgical site infections — management recommendations: Suture removal plus incision and drainage should be performed for surgical site infections (strong, low). Adjunctive systemic antimicrobial therapy is not routinely indicated, but in conjunction with incision and drainage may be beneficial for surgical site infections with a significant systemic response such as erythema and induration extending > 5 cm from the wound edge, temperature > 38.5° C, heart rate > 110 beats/minute, or white blood cell (WBC) count > 12 000/μL (weak, low). A brief course of systemic antimicrobial therapy is indicated in patients with surgical site infections following clean operations on the trunk, head and neck, or extremities that also have systemic signs of infection (strong, low). For infections following operations on the axilla, gastrointestinal tract, perineum, or female genital tract, agents active against gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes, such as a cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone in combination with metronidazole, are recommended (strong, low).

### Synovial fluid cell count for diagnosis of chronic periprosthetic hip infection [^1176Ptnm]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There is a paucity of data regarding the threshold of synovial fluid white blood-cell (WBC) count and polymorphonuclear cell (neutrophil) percentage of the WBC count (PMN%) for the diagnosis of chronic periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after total hip arthroplasty. Despite this, many organizations have provided guidelines for the diagnosis of PJI that include synovial fluid WBC count and PMN%. We attempted to define a threshold for synovial fluid WBC count and PMN% for the diagnosis of chronic PJI of the hip using a uniform definition of PJI and to investigate any variations in the calculated thresholds among institutions.

Methods

From 4 academic institutions, we formed a cohort of 453 patients with hip synovial fluid cell count analysis as part of the work-up for revision total hip arthroplasty. Using the definition of PJI from the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS), 374 joints were diagnosed as aseptic and 79, as septic. Intraoperative aspirations were performed as routine practice, regardless of the suspicion for infection, in 327 (72%) of the patients. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, the optimal threshold values for synovial WBC count and PMN% were identified.

Results

For the diagnosis of chronic PJI of the hip, the threshold for the overall cohort was 3,966 cells/μL for WBC count and 80% for PMN%. Despite the high predictive accuracy for the cohort, there was notable institutional variation in fluid WBC count and PMN%. Furthermore, the rate of PJI was 14% (4 of 28) for patients with a WBC count of 3,000 to 5,000 cells/μL compared with 91% (20 of 22) for patients with a WBC count of > 50,000 cells/μL. Similarly, the rate of PJI was 29% (14 of 49) for patients with a PMN% of 75% to 85% compared with 69% (33 of 48) for patients with a PMN% of > 95%.

Conclusions

Using the MSIS criteria, the optimal synovial fluid WBC count and PMN% to diagnose chronic PJI in the hip is closer to thresholds for the knee than those previously reported for the hip. This study validates the diagnostic utility of synovial fluid analysis for the diagnosis of periprosthetic hip infection; however, we also identified a clinically important "gray area" around the threshold for which the presence of PJI may be unclear.

### Diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection: has the era of the biomarker arrived? [^117Rsmqf]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

Fig. 2A–D
Log-scale dot plots demonstrate the diagnostic separation of study groups achieved by traditional tests for PJI: (A) ESR, (B) serum CRP, (C) neutrophil percentage, and (D) synovial fluid WBC count. Horizontal bar = median; error bars = interquartile range.

The five biomarkers demonstrating 100% sensitivity and specificity were compared to each other and to the synovial fluid WBC count using the Pearson correlation to evaluate for redundant performance among infected samples (Table 5). The mean correlation between biomarkers and the synovial fluid WBC count was 0.12 (range, −0.02 to 0.364), demonstrating no correlation. The biomarkers and synovial fluid WBC count had predominantly weak or no correlations with each other among samples with PJI.

Table 5
Pearson correlations with degree and type of correlation among patients with PJI

PJI = periprosthetic joint infection; α-defensin = human α-defensin 1–3; BPI = bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein; ELA-2 = neutrophil elastase 2; NGAL = neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin; SF = synovial fluid; WBC = white blood cell; + = positive.

There were no statistically significant differences between subgroups of patients in this study (systemic inflammatory disease versus other; antibiotic treatment versus other) in regard to mean ESR, CRP, synovial fluid WBC count, or biomarker.

### Post-operative septic arthritis after arthroscopy: modern diagnostic and therapeutic concepts [^116qTutk]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

If an acute infection is suspected, cell count, macroscopic assessment, and microscopy after gram staining help to make a quick diagnosis (within hours) and support a quick decision-making process for further treatment (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Priority protocol for suspected joint infections. Depending on the amount of joint fluid, the user should start with priority 1 and then follow the list. This specific protocol allows for easy handling with information about the amount, the purpose, the tube, and the target institute for analysis

The interpretation of the joint fluid sample can be done according to Trampuz et al. and Stutz et al. who proposed the following criteria: the main distinctive feature between reactive and septic arthritis is the number of cells. If this is greater than 20,000/µl, there is a high probability of an infectious event (Table 3). However, there are some limitations to these criteria. The cell count must be interpreted with regard to the individual patient, i.e. a leukocyte count of 15,000/µl can already be considered critical if an intraarticular implant is present (anchor or suture material) and the cut-off value due to presence of joint replacements is even more strict (physiological < 2800 leukocytes/µl). Additionally, in patients with immunosuppression, the leucocyte count may not be elevated and therefore mask a joint infection.

This interpretation is also supported by the systematic review of Margaretten et al. who showed that a progressively higher synovial white blood cell (WBC) count increased the likelihood of septic arthritis (Table 4). Additionally, they could show the importance of polymorphonuclear cells with an increased likelihood for septic arthritis when the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells is at least 90% (LR 3.4; 95% CI 2.8–4.2). If the polymorphonuclear cells are less than 90%, the likelihood decreased (LR 0.34; 95% CI 0.25–0.47).

Table 4
Likelihood ratio of septic arthritis according to the synovial white blood cell count (LR = likelihood ratio, CI = confidence interval)

The negative results after cultivation, for assessment of joint fluid pathogens in the sample, do not necessarily exclude an infection. This also applies to the long-term cultivation (14 days and longer).

### The value of white blood cell counts before revision total knee arthroplasty [^114dkGqh]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2003). Low credibility.

A white blood cell count (WBC) of > 50000 cell/mm(3) from a knee aspirate with ≥ 80% polymorphonuclear cells (PMNCs) is suggestive of infection. This study sought to determine if these same criteria were applicable when interpreting aspirates from a total knee. Of 440 revision total knee arthroplasties, 86 patients had preoperative aspirations of the knee before revision. Fifty-five aspirates were from aseptic failures; 31 aspirates were from patients determined to have septic failure. The mean white blood cell (WBC) count in aspirates from the aseptic group was 645 cells/mm(3) (SD = 878). The mean WBC count in the septic group was 25951 cells/mm(3) (SD = 34994; P = < .001). The mean percentage of PMNCs was statistically higher in the septic group compared with the aseptic group (72.8% vs 27.3%; P = < .001). The synovial fluid WBC count differential analysis is a statistically relevant indicator of the presence or absence of infection in revision knee arthroplasty. Aspirates with a WBC count of 2500 per milliliter and 60% PMNCs are highly suggestive of infection.

Patient Characteristics

Continuous variables were summarized with median and range, and categorical variables with frequency and percent. Continuous variables were compared between patients with a positive culture and those with a negative culture using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, whereas categorical variables were compared between these two groups using a Pearson chi-square test. To evaluate the ability of % neutrophils, ESR at diagnosis, CRP at diagnosis, WBC at diagnosis, and synovial fluid cell count from aspiration to discriminate between patients with a positive culture and those with a negative culture, we estimated the area under the ROC curve (AUC) along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). An AUC of 1.0 indicates perfect predictive ability, whereas and AUC of 0.5 indicates predictive ability equal to chance. All statistical tests were two-sided, and P -values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. If patients had multiple aspirations performed, only the first was included to satisfy the statistical assumption of independence. All statistical analyses were performed in R statistical software (version 3.4.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

### Synovial white blood cell count and differential to predict successful infection management in a two-stage revision [^115UbPVb]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

An array of synovial white blood cell (WBC) count and polymorphonuclear differential (PMN%) thresholds have been reported using 2013 Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) definition which has a poor accuracy to confirm infection control before reimplantation. The workgroup of MSIS recently developed a comprehensive definition of successful infection management. Our objectives were to determine optimal thresholds for WBC count and PMN% associated with reimplantation success based on this new MSIS definition and assess if values above these thresholds indicate decreased survival time.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted on a consecutive series of 133 two-stage hip/knee arthroplasties performed by 15 surgeons (2014–2020) at 2 institutions. All surgeries had a minimum follow-up of 1 year. The inclusion criteria included reporting of preoperative synovial fluid aspiration results. Thus, 88 were finally included. Surgical success was defined by MSIS outcome reporting tool (Tiers 1–4). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to estimate optimal thresholds of WBC count and PMN%. A Kaplan-Meier survival analyses with log-rank test were performed.

Results

With area under the curve of 0.65, synovial PMN% showed superior accuracy than WBC count (area under the curve = 0.52) in determining outcome of reimplantation. The optimal PMN% threshold (62%) demonstrated sensitivity of 57% and specificity of 77%. The calculated WBC count threshold (2,733/μL) showed poor sensitivity (21%) but high specificity (95%). There was a significant difference in failure-free survival (24 months) between the cases with WBC count higher vs lower than 2,733/μL (P = 0.002). This was also true for PMN% at 5 months postoperatively (P = 0.009).

Conclusion

WBC count (2,733/μL) shows very high specificity to confirm successful reimplantation. Both WBC count and PMN% (62%) thresholds can significantly determine reimplantation survival.

### Histopathological diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection: does a threshold of 23 neutrophils Do better than classification of the periprosthetic membrane in a prospective multicenter study? [^115xAeJE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

No gold standard exists for histopathological diagnosis of a prosthetic joint infection (PJI). The historical criterion considers the presence of neutrophil infiltration upon examination of periprosthetic tissue. Morawietz et al. proposed a classification of periprosthetic membranes (Morawietz et al. Clin Pathol 59:591–597, 2006, https://doi.org/10.1136/jcp.2005.027458) and a more recently described classification with a new cutoff value of 23 neutrophils in 10 high-power fields (Morawietz et al. Histopathology 54:847–853, 2009. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2559.2009.03313.x). We performed a multicenter prospective study, which compared both methods for the diagnosis of PJI. All suspicions of PJI (n = 264) between December 2010 and March 2012 in seven centers were prospectively included. Five perioperative specimens were collected per patient for cultures, and one was collected for histology. Diagnosis of PJI was made according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. Histopathological analysis classified the patients according to the threshold of 23 neutrophils and according to the classification of Morawietz. Performances of both methods were compared by using clinical and/or bacteriological criteria as the gold standard. Among 264 patients with suspected PJI, a diagnosis of infection was confirmed in 215 and unconfirmed in 49 patients. Histopathological analysis was available for 150 confirmed PJI and 40 unconfirmed PJI cases. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 78.7%, 90.0%, 96.7%, 52.9%, and 81.1%, respectively, for the Morawietz classification, and 82.0%, 90.0%, 96.9%, 57.1%, and 83.7%, respectively, for the 23-neutrophil threshold. The new algorithm using a threshold of 23 neutrophils can be proposed as a new gold standard for the histopathological diagnosis of PJI.

Standard microscopy of centrifuged urine uses a threshold of 5 white blood cells (WBCs) per high-power field (~25 WBCs per μL), whereas in uncentrifuged urine a counting chamber threshold of at least 10 WBCs per μL has been demonstrated to be more sensitive and performs well in very young infants.

### Diagnostic thresholds of synovial markers for acute periprosthetic joint infection: one size does not fit all [^113EfCUt]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), particularly during the early postoperative period, remains challenging. The purpose of this multicenter study was to assess the utility of synovial white blood cell (WBC) count and polymorphonuclear leukocyte percentage (PMN%) in the diagnosis of acute PJI at different time intervals after primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA).

Methods

This retrospective study identified 225 patients who underwent a joint aspiration within 90 days of their primary TJA at three institutions. A PJI was defined as revision TJA for infection within 7 days of joint aspiration with two positive cultures isolating the same organism. Patients were considered aseptic if they had no reoperation for up to 1 year after arthrocentesis. Receiver operator characteristic curves were used to assess the utility of WBC count and PMN% in the diagnosis of acute PJI at zero to 15, 15 to 45, and 45 to 90 days. Youden's index was used to identify the optimal cutoffs at each time interval. A pairwise comparison was performed to compare the area under the curve (AUC) of the two markers. There were 214 patients included. Of these, 81 (37.9%) were infected and 133 (62.1%) were aseptic.

Results

The optimal cutoff at zero to 15 days was 21,003 cells/μL for WBC count (AUC 0.937, sensitivity 88.0%, specificity 100%) and 92.0% for PMN% (AUC 0.638, sensitivity 56.0%, specificity 68.4%). Although the diagnostic threshold for WBC count decreased to 5,111 cells/μL at 15 to 45 days and to 2,503 cells/μL at 45 to 90 days, the cutoffs for PMN% did not downtrend in the same fashion (80% at 15 to 45 days; 86% at 45 to 90 days). Using pairwise comparison, the AUC for WBC count was higher than that of PMN% at 0 to 15 days (P = 0.002); however, there was no difference in AUCs at either 15 to 45 days (P = 0.438) or 45 to 90 days (P = 0.826).

Conclusions

Based on our findings, it appears that there may be a role for diagnostic thresholds for the identification of acute PJI that are specific to the timing of joint aspiration after primary TJA.

Complete blood count (CBC) parameters in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis — The peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count can be elevated but is in the normal range in most children, and the accuracy of the WBC count for the diagnosis of AHO is less than that of CRP; WBC count may be higher on average with MRSA etiology and in complicated cases, yet WBC counts overlap considerably among these etiologies and scenarios and do not provide discriminatory value. The information provided by a CBC can provide important adjunctive information for decision-making for children with suspected or confirmed AHO, and anemia and reactive thrombocytosis may be seen in some children with AHO at presentation.

### Value of white cell count in predicting serious bacterial infection in febrile children under 5 years of age [^1154pRx3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The leukocyte count is frequently used to evaluate suspected bacterial infections but estimates of its test performance vary considerably. We evaluated its accuracy for the detection of serious bacterial infections in febrile children.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Paediatric emergency department.

Patients

Febrile 0–5-year-olds who had a leukocyte count on presentation.

Outcome Measures

Accuracy of total white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts for the detection of urinary tract infection, bacteraemia, pneumonia and a combined ('any serious bacterial infection') category. Logistic regression models were fitted for each outcome. Reference standards were microbiological/radiological tests and clinical follow-up.

Results

Serious bacterial infections were present in 714 (18.3%) of 3893 illness episodes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for 'any serious bacterial infection' was 0.653 (95% CI 0.630 to 0.676) for the total white blood cell count and 0.638 (95% CI 0.615 to 0.662) for absolute neutrophil count. A white blood cell count threshold > 15×10⁹/L had a sensitivity of 47% (95% CI 43% to 50%), specificity 76% (95% CI 74% to 77%), positive likelihood ratio 1.93 (95% CI 1.75 to 2.13) and negative likelihood ratio 0.70 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.75). An absolute neutrophil count threshold > 10×10⁹/L had a sensitivity of 41% (95% CI 38% to 45%), specificity 78% (95% CI 76% to 79%), positive likelihood ratio 1.87 (95% CI 1.68 to 2.09) and negative likelihood ratio 0.75 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.80).

Conclusions

The total white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count are not sufficiently accurate triage tests for febrile children with suspected serious bacterial infection.

### The clinical features of respiratory infections caused by the Streptococcus anginosus group [^111VxpPN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Previous reports have demonstrated that SAG infections occur mainly in male patients, patients with comorbid diseases, and pus formation, and that the mean time to pus formation is 18 days. Similar clinical characteristics were observed in the present study. In this study, patients with pneumonia, with or without pleural effusion, tended to show a shorter period from the onset of symptoms to the diagnosis and more elevated levels of peripheral WBC counts than patients with lung abscess.

Pleural effusion was observed in 73.3% of the patients and many of them fulfilled the diagnosis for complicated pleural effusion or empyema. Okada et al. reported that pleural effusion was observed in 54.5% of patients with SAG infections, and that pleural effusion was more frequently observed in patients with SAG infections than in patients were infected with other pathogens, including S. pneumoniae, and they therefore speculated that respiratory infections caused by SAG should be especially considered in patients with pleural effusion. In relation to medical treatments, early surgical treatment was necessary in 20 of 30 (66.7%) patients. The application of early surgical treatment, in addition to appropriate antibiotic use for patients with thoracic infections caused by SAG, was associated with a low mortality rate, a shortened length of hospital stay and an increase in the number of patients who could be discharged to their homes. The mortality rate in this study was low (6.7%), and 19 of 30 (63.3%) patients were treated with additional surgical treatments in combination with antibiotic treatment. Thus it should be considered that early (additional) surgical intervention might lead to favorable outcome in patients with respiratory infections caused by SAG.

We presented a case of a 38-year-old man who had right lower quadrant abdominal pain with fever. White blood cell count was only 1800/microL. Computed tomography showed thickening with fluid contained in the lumen of distended appendix, and emergent appendectomy was done. Accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis is still based on the clinical history and physical examination adjuvant with imaging studies.

### Role of ultrasound and inflammatory factors in the management of pediatric hip joint effusion [^112Sh1SB]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
The sonographic measurements of hip effusion in anterior recess: (A) Longitudinal diameter and thickness of hip effusion. (B) Transverse diameter of anterior recess. The anterior recess volume was measured with these three dimensions. (C) Capsule thickness at the midpoint of the anterior recess and synovial thickness at the maximal point. Synovial thickening in reactive arthritis is obvious. L: Labrum, S: Synovium

In all patients, a blood sample was analyzed for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and WBC counts and glucose. Dependent on patient status and clinical judgment, one of the following three approaches is performed; close follow-up and observation, ultrasound-guided aspiration of the hip joint effusion, and or arthrotomy. The closed follow-up was proposed in the volume of less than 0.5 cc with normal clinical and laboratory examination. An effusion aspiration or arthrotomy of hip joint was performed in other patients. The hip joint puncture and effusion aspiration was carried out under ultrasound guidance in a parasagittal plane after topical anesthesia (lidocaine-prilocaine topical cream) and in a sterile environment. The effusion volume was recorded and the sample was sent to laboratory for: cell count (RBC, WBC, neutrophil), glucose level, lactate dehydrogenase test (LDH), and joint fluid culture. Arthrotomy was performed in patients with unsuccessful aspiration, septated effusion, and septic arthritis.

The presence of a neutrophil ratio of more than 75% with a low joint fluid white blood cell (WBC) count can be suggestive of septic arthritis, even in cases where the culture is negative. Septic arthritis is an infection of the joint, and a high neutrophil ratio along with an elevated WBC count in the joint fluid are indicators of an inflammatory response to infection. However, it is important to note that a negative culture does not completely rule out septic arthritis, as there can be various reasons for false-negative results. Therefore, clinical judgment and further diagnostic tests may be necessary to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. In addition, positive Gram stain in joint aspiration culture, a joint fluid WBC count of more than 50,000 per ml, a neutrophil ratio of more than 75%, joint fluid glucose levels less than 30% of serum glucose levels, and obvious pus were indicative of septic arthritis. The absence of any of these conditions led to the diagnosis of reactive arthritis.

### Utility of common biomarkers for diagnosing infection in nonunion [^116nB4Pk]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the diagnostic utility of leukocyte count (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) for distinguishing between septic and aseptic nonunions.

Design

A single-gate (cohort) design was used, using 1 set of eligibility criteria applied to a consecutive sample of nonunions.

Setting

Private quaternary referral center.

Patients/Participants

Inclusion criteria were consecutive patients (≥ 18 years) with a nonunion requiring surgery that allowed for direct or medullary canal tissue sampling from the nonunion site. The cohort included 204 subjects with 211 nonunions.

Intervention

Blood samples were drawn for laboratory analysis of WBC, ESR, and CRP before surgery.

Main Outcome Measurements

The reference standard used to define infection was the fracture-related infection confirmatory criteria. Measures of diagnostic accuracy were calculated. To assess the additional diagnostic gain of each index lab test while simultaneously considering the others, logistic regression models were fit.

Results

The prevalence of infection was 19% (40 of 211 nonunion sites). The positive likelihood ratios (95% confidence interval) for WBC, ESR, and CRP were 1.07 (0.38–3.02), 1.27 (0.88–1.82) and 1.57 (0.94–2.60), respectively. Multivariable modeling adjusted for the effect of preoperative antibiotics showed that WBC (P = 0.42), ESR (P = 0.48), and CRP (P = 0.23) were not significant predictors of infection.

Conclusions

In this consecutive sample of 211 nonunions in whom standard clinical practice would be to obtain index lab tests, our findings showed that WBC, ESR, and CRP were not significant predictors of infection.

Level Of Evidence

Diagnostic Level II. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### Impact of peritoneal lavage on intra-abdominal abscess after laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis: a propensity score matching analysis [^113cNrMY]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Observation indicators

Preoperative baseline data collected for enrolled patients included: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), presence of diabetes, presence of immunodeficiency disorders, history of abdominal surgery, time from symptom onset to surgery (hours, h), preoperative maximum body temperature (°C), preoperative white blood cell count (10⁹/L), preoperative neutrophil count (10⁹/L), preoperative lymphocyte count (10⁹/L), preoperative monocyte count (10⁹/L), preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP, mg/L), time from preoperative antibiotic administration to surgery start (h), and CT-measured appendiceal diameter (mm). Laboratory values were the last results obtained prior to surgery.

Intraoperative data included: extent of intra-abdominal infection, occurrence of fecalith spillage, operative time (minutes, min), surgeon's professional title, whether to place an abdominal drain and whether peritoneal lavage was performed.

Postoperative data included: postoperative length of stay (LOS, days), duration of postoperative antibiotic use (days), occurrence of IAA within 30 days postoperatively, and pathological type.

The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of postoperative IAA. The secondary outcomes included postoperative LOS, duration of postoperative antibiotic use, and operative time.

Extent of intra-abdominal infection was classified based on intraoperative findings: confined (pus localized to the pelvis or right iliac fossa) or diffuse (pus spread diffusely throughout the abdominal cavity). The operating surgeon decided whether to perform peritoneal lavage or place an abdominal drain based on their clinical judgment. Criteria for drain removal were: no further fluid output from the drain, or daily drainage volume less than 20 mL with clear fluid.

Preoperative Empiric Antibiotic Therapy for Broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as cefoperazone-sulbactam or piperacillin-tazobactam and so on, are established as effective by guidelines. Administration should commence immediately upon diagnosis of appendicitis through intravenous infusion, regardless of whether perforation is confirmed. Postoperative antibiotics identical to preoperative agents. Duration of postoperative antibiotic use was determined by the operating surgeon based on criteria including absence of fever, decreasing white blood cell count, decreasing neutrophil count, or improvement in other infection markers.

Diagnostic criteria for IAA formation: Presence of fever and abdominal pain within 30 days postoperatively, confirmed by abdominal CT scan, with or without positive bacterial culture of aspirated pus.

### Reevaluating current cutoffs for acute periprosthetic joint infection: current thresholds are insensitive [^112H1eRn]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosing acute periprosthetic joint infection remains a challenge. Several studies have proposed different acute cutoffs resulting in the International Consensus Meeting recommending a cutoff of 100 mg/L, 10,000 cell/μL and 90% for serum C-reactive protein (CRP), synovial white blood cell count (WBC), and polymorphonuclear percentage (PMN%), respectively. However, establishing cutoffs are difficult as the control group is limited to rare early aseptic revisions, and performing aspiration in asymptomatic patients is difficult because of a fear of seeding a well-functioning joint arthroplasty. This study (1) assessed the sensitivity of current thresholds for acute periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) and (2) identified associated factors for false negatives.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed patients with acute PJIs (n = 218), defined as less than 6 weeks from index arthroplasty, treated between 2000 and 2017. Diagnosis of PJI was based on 2 positive cultures of the same pathogen from the periprosthetic tissue or synovial fluid samples. Sensitivities of International Consensus Meeting cutoff values of CRP, synovial WBC, and PMN% were evaluated according to organism type. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine associated factors for false negatives.

Results

Overall, the sensitivity of CRP, synovial WBC, and PMN% for acute PJI was 55.3%, 59.6%, and 50.5%, respectively. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) demonstrated the lowest sensitivity for both CRP (37.5%) and WBC (55.6%). CNS infection was identified as an independent risk factor for false-negative CRP.

Conclusions

Current thresholds for acute PJI may be missing approximately half of PJIs. Low virulent organisms, such as CNS, may be responsible for these false negatives. Current thresholds for acute PJI must be reexamined.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^115KSn6w]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

How can necrotizing infections be diagnosed?

Clinical signs of NSTI include pain out of proportion, edema extending beyond the erythema, and fever. A rapidly progressive soft-tissue infection should always be suspected as a necrotizing infection (recommendation 1C).

The initial differential diagnosis between a cellulitis and a necrotizing infection that requires prompt operative intervention may be difficult. Most cases of NSTI are initially diagnosed and begin as cellulitis. However, since time to operative debridement is an important determinant of outcome in necrotizing infections, timely diagnosis is essential.

Patients with NSTI usually present with severe pain which is out of proportion to the physical findings.

Typical local signs are as follows:
Edema
Erythema
Severe and crescendo pain out of proportion
Skin bullae or necrosis (at later stage)
Swelling or tenderness
Crepitus

Systemic signs are as follows:
Fever
Tachycardia
Hypotension
Shock

Laboratory tests are not highly sensitive or specific for NSTIs. A rapidly progressive soft-tissue infection should be treated as a necrotizing infection, from the beginning. The clinical picture may worsen very quickly, sometimes during a few hours.

In order to predict the presence of NSTI, the Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing infection (LRINEC) score was proposed. LRINEC score assigns points for abnormalities in six independent variables: serum C-reactive protein level (> 150 mg/L), white blood cell (WBC) count (> 15,000/μL), hemoglobin level (< 13.5 g/dL), serum sodium level (< 135 mmol/L), serum creatinine level (> 1.6 mg/dL [142 mmol/l]), and serum glucose level (> 180 mg/dL [10 mmol/l]). With a score of 8 or higher, there is a 75% risk of a NSTI.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Acute bacterial arthritis — culture-negative terminology and molecular diagnostics: The term "culture-negative" ABA has been used for many years to label clinical presentations consistent with ABA for which bacterial cultures of synovial fluid and blood are negative, and molecular testing methods developed over the past 15 years now allow identification of causative microbes in a high proportion of cases with negative cultures. The panel suggests the use of "presumed ABA with no identified pathogen" for culture-negative cases with clinical signs of arthritis, elevated white blood cell count with neutrophil predominance in synovial fluid, and a clinical course consistent with ABA, including temporal improvement and resolution after drainage and initiation of antimicrobial therapy.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^117ACyCN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infections of native joints — etiology and synovial fluid testing are outlined as follows: S. aureus, Streptococcus species, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common causes of septic arthritis of native joints, and K. kingae is the most common etiology of bacterial joint infection in children younger than 4 years; septic bursitis, often prepatellar, olecranon, or trochanteric, is usually caused by S. aureus; peripheral blood white cell count, ESR, and CRP are often elevated but non-specific; traditionally, a synovial fluid leukocyte count more than 50 000 cells/mm3 was considered to suggest septic arthritis, though lower counts do not exclude it; ideally, synovial fluid should be submitted for Gram stain and cultured in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles; if Gram stain and culture are negative, molecular testing with a multiplex PCR panel or 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR/sequencing should be considered, and biopsy of the synovium for Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic cultures, and histopathology, with or without fungal and mycobacterial stains and cultures, may be considered; concomitant or secondary bacteremia or fungemia occurs sporadically, so blood cultures should be collected; some less common agents such as K. kingae may require molecular detection methods, and N. gonorrhoeae is included in a recently FDA-cleared multiplex PCR panel for synovial fluid.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^115mBWHo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Osteomyelitis — diagnostic evaluation is typically based on clinical suspicion with confirmation by imaging and laboratory methods, and inflammatory markers are often elevated: the peripheral white blood cell count may be elevated; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are often elevated as well. Establishing an etiologic diagnosis nearly always requires obtaining bone for microbiologic evaluation unless blood cultures are positive in the context of convincing radiographic findings, which can be accomplished by imaging-guided or surgical sampling. As much specimen as possible should be submitted to the laboratory; specimens may include pieces of intact bone, shavings, scrapings, and/or excised or aspirated necrotic material. Swabs are not recommended and cultures of sinus tracts are generally not recommended, because recovered organisms, aside from Staphylococcus aureus, do not correlate well with those found in deep cultures. In adults, imaging-guided aspiration or open biopsy is typically necessary, and those with underlying diabetes mellitus or vascular insufficiency are at particular risk for osteomyelitis.

### Impact of high prevalence of Pseudomonas and polymicrobial gram-negative infections in major sub-/ total traumatic amputations on empiric antimicrobial therapy: a retrospective study [^114xtRrn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Microbiological assessment and definition of wound infections

All microbiological tests of the 51 patients were screened for pathogen type, number of simultaneous pathogens, resistance towards administered antimicrobial agent and time until positive pathogen proof.

Microbiological specimens (i.e. wound swabs, tissue samples, drain fluids) were obtained during surgery before debridement and administration of antibiotic therapy. Within operation at least 2 wound swabs (superficial and deep) were obtained. Based on surgeon's decision additionally tissue samples were obtain under sterile conditions. Drains were standardized removed within 2 days after surgery except high amount of wound secretion. Therefore, drain fluids were tested in case of persisting secretion > 48 hours after surgery. Initial surgical debridement was performed within 2 hours after injury, followed by staged surgical debridement until conditioning of soft tissue or plastic surgery, depending on the clinical situation. Specimens were sent native (i.e. without transport media) and cultivated within 6 hours of sampling, except patient arrived at night, then samples were cultivated next morning. Samples were plated on sheep blood agar plates and incubated for 7 days under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 37°C; an aliquot was in addition inoculated in thioglycolate broth. Identification and susceptibility testing of grown microorganisms were performed as standard microbiological methods. Wound cultures on day 1 refer to intraoperative microbiological samples collected before the first surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy, reflecting the incidence and spectrum of initial wound contamination.

Wound infection was defined as the proof of at least one pathogenic species in microbiological testing combined with clinical signs of infection (fever, pus, rubor, odor, macerated soft tissue) and elevated laboratory infectious parameter (WBC, CRP). A wound infection occurring within 14 days after trauma was defined as an early infection. Simultaneous detection of more than one pathogen species in the same sample was classified as polymicrobial wound infection. The initially applied antibiotic therapy was considered to be insufficient, if proven so by the microbiological resistance determination via antibiogram.

### Utility of the peripheral blood white blood cell count for identifying sick young infants who need lumbar puncture [^112uSwMw]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We assess the utility of the peripheral blood WBC count as a screen for lumbar puncture among young infants evaluated for serious bacterial infections.

Methods

We performed logistic regression modeling and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of peripheral blood WBC count and cerebrospinal fluid WBC count for results obtained from 3- to 89-day-old infants undergoing a full sepsis evaluation.

Results

Twenty-two of 5,353 (4.1 per 1,000) infants had acute bacterial meningitis. For diagnosing acute bacterial meningitis, the peripheral blood WBC count was poorly discriminating and significantly inferior to the cerebrospinal fluid WBC count. This was true both when the odds of meningitis were modeled to vary linearly and as a U-shaped function of the peripheral blood WBC count. When relying on single and interval-based high-risk thresholds of peripheral blood WBC counts alone, the majority of infants with acute bacterial meningitis would have been missed.

Conclusion

Decisions to perform or withhold lumbar puncture should not be based on prevailing interpretations of the total peripheral blood WBC counts to maximize detection of bacterial meningitis in young infants.

### The diagnostic thresholds for synovial fluid analysis in late periprosthetic infection of the hip depend on the duration of symptoms [^115HsGm9]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

We hypothesised that the synovial white blood cell (WBC) count in patients with a late periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) of the hip would depend on the duration of a patient's symptoms, and that the optimal diagnostic threshold would also depend on this period of time.

Patients and Methods

The synovial WBC count and percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (%PMN), and the serum CRP and ESR levels obtained > six weeks after primary THA were compared between 50 infected and 88 non-infected THAs, and in patients with symptoms for more than or less than two weeks. Diagnostic thresholds for the synovial WBC count were calculated using area under the curve calculation.

Results

The synovial WBC count was significantly higher in patients with symptoms for ≤ two weeks compared with those with symptoms for > two weeks (p = 0.03). The optimal threshold for diagnosing PJI for the synovial WBC count was 5750 cells/µL (sensitivity 94; specificity 100; PPV 100%; NPV 89%; AUC 99%) and 1556 cells/µL (sensitivity 91; specificity 94; PPV 87% and NPV 97%; AUC 95%), respectively. The thresholds for the cut-offs based on duration of symptoms improved the diagnostic performance of this test.

Conclusion

This study shows that the diagnostic thresholds for synovial fluid analysis in late periprosthetic infection following THA may depend on duration of symptoms. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2016;98-B:1355–9.

### Results of aspiration, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein in patients with known prosthetic joint infection on chronic suppression [^114hQ6SH]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The primary laboratory predictor of those who failed with CAS was elevated ESR. Second, elevated PMN% and synovial WBC were determined to be the strongest indicators of PJI in a patient who was treated with antibiotics before diagnosis, whereas CRP and ESR were more likely to normalize. This suggests that patients with strong clinical suspicion for PJI on antibiotics should be aspirated regardless of normalized ESR and CRP.

### Evidence-based diagnostics: adult septic arthritis [^111Zyui6]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acutely swollen or painful joints are common complaints in the emergency department (ED). Septic arthritis in adults is a challenging diagnosis, but prompt differentiation of a bacterial etiology is crucial to minimize morbidity and mortality.

Objectives

The objective was to perform a systematic review describing the diagnostic characteristics of history, physical examination, and bedside laboratory tests for nongonococcal septic arthritis. A secondary objective was to quantify test and treatment thresholds using derived estimates of sensitivity and specificity, as well as best-evidence diagnostic and treatment risks and anticipated benefits from appropriate therapy.

Methods

Two electronic search engines (PUBMED and EMBASE) were used in conjunction with a selected bibliography and scientific abstract hand search. Inclusion criteria included adult trials of patients presenting with monoarticular complaints if they reported sufficient detail to reconstruct partial or complete 2 × 2 contingency tables for experimental diagnostic test characteristics using an acceptable criterion standard. Evidence was rated by two investigators using the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS). When more than one similarly designed trial existed for a diagnostic test, meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model. Interval likelihood ratios (LRs) were computed when possible. To illustrate one method to quantify theoretical points in the probability of disease whereby clinicians might cease testing altogether and either withhold treatment (test threshold) or initiate definitive therapy in lieu of further diagnostics (treatment threshold), an interactive spreadsheet was designed and sample calculations were provided based on research estimates of diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic risk, and therapeutic risk/benefits.

Results

The prevalence of nongonococcal septic arthritis in ED patients with a single acutely painful joint is approximately 27% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 17% to 38%). With the exception of joint surgery (positive likelihood ratio [+LR] = 6.9) or skin infection overlying a prosthetic joint (+LR = 15.0), history, physical examination, and serum tests do not significantly alter posttest probability. Serum inflammatory markers such as white blood cell (WBC) counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) are not useful acutely. The interval LR for synovial white blood cell (sWBC) counts of 0 × 10⁹−25 × 10⁹/L was 0.33; for 25 × 10⁹−50 × 10⁹/L, 1.06; for 50 × 10⁹−100 × 10⁹/L, 3.59; and exceeding 100 × 10⁹/L, infinity. Synovial lactate may be useful to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of septic arthritis with a +LR ranging from 2.4 to infinity, and negative likelihood ratio (-LR) ranging from 0 to 0.46. Rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of synovial fluid may identify the causative organism within 3 hours. Based on 56% sensitivity and 90% specificity for sWBC counts of > 50 × 10(9)/L in conjunction with best-evidence estimates for diagnosis-related risk and treatment-related risk/benefit, the arthrocentesis test threshold is 5%, with a treatment threshold of 39%.

Conclusions

Recent joint surgery or cellulitis overlying a prosthetic hip or knee were the only findings on history or physical examination that significantly alter the probability of nongonococcal septic arthritis. Extreme values of sWBC (> 50 × 10(9)/L) can increase, but not decrease, the probability of septic arthritis. Future ED-based diagnostic trials are needed to evaluate the role of clinical gestalt and the efficacy of nontraditional synovial markers such as lactate.

### Red cell distribution width as a potential new biomarker to predict the clinical severity of acute diverticulitis [^113tdppH]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Data collection and definitions

The medical records were examined to assess the following data of patients with diverticulitis: age and sex, comorbidity status, localization, Hinchey class, type of treatment administered, type of surgery performed (if surgical treatment was performed), length of stay in hospital, and laboratory findings.

Radiological diverticulitis severity was determined by the Hinchey classification. Patients were classified into four classes: I: Localized abscess (paracolonic), II: Pelvic, intra-abdominal, or retroperitoneal abscess, III: Generalized purulent peritonitis, IV: Generalized fecal peritonitis. Comparisons in this study were performed for Class I versus Classes II-IV.

The approach to the diagnosis and treatment for acute diverticulitis was conducted according to the guidelines of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons. Initially, all patients received conservative antibiotic therapy. The need for surgical intervention was defined as cases requiring immediate surgery due to complications (e.g. perforation, abscess) or failure of conservative management, as determined by the clinical team based on patient condition and radiological findings. The clinical severity of diverticulitis was classified according to the treatment applied, in two groups: the first group (invasive group) included patients who required surgery or interventional radiological procedures at any stage of the treatment process. The second group (conservative group) included patients for whom medical treatment alone was sufficient for treatment.

We examined laboratory results routinely ordered when patients were diagnosed with diverticulitis. All laboratory measurements including complete blood count (CBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level were performed in the certified biochemistry laboratory of our hospital using calibrated devices and with manufacturer protocols and kits. Hemoglobin level, platelet count, white blood cell (WBC) count and red cell distribution width (RDW) were extracted from routine CBC data.

Outcomes

The primary outcome of the study was to investigate independent variables associated with the clinical and radiological severity of the diverticulitis.

### Enhancing diagnostics in orthopedic infections [^111sBwq4]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Synovial fluid analysis. Synovial fluid sampling is obtained as standard of care in both suspected native and prosthetic joint septic arthritis. Synovial fluid white cell count of 50,000/μL is typically used as the cutoff for native joint septic arthritis. However, a recent large study using receiver operating curve analysis suggested a lower threshold of 33,000 cells/μL and 16,000 cells/μL for patients who did or did not receive prior antibiotics, respectively. The thresholds used for PJI are lower, and interpretation needs to consider the joint involved, timing of implantation of the joint, and duration of symptoms. A prospective study of patients undergoing revision total knee arthroplasty identified an optimal cut off rate of 1,700 leukocytes/μL, giving a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 88% for diagnosing PJI. When applied to this study, increasing the cutoff to 2,500 leukocytes/μL reduced sensitivity to 44%. In their retrospective review of synovial fluid aspirates undertaken post total hip arthroplasty, Choi et al. found that synovial fluid white blood cell (WBC) count in arthroplasty patients with symptoms for up to 2 weeks was significantly higher than that in patients with symptoms for more than 2 weeks. A 2018 meta-analysis evaluated accuracy and yield of synovial fluid analysis in PJI including both hips and knees. Only 10 articles met inclusion criteria but reported an optimal threshold of 3,000 leukocytes/μL, concluding that lower cutoffs were associated with lower specificity. However, they report that due to inadequate number of clinical studies involving total knee replacements, precise assessment of accuracy of synovial fluid analysis in detecting total knee arthroplasty infection was precluded. Interpretation of synovial fluid analysis in both native and prosthetic joint arthritis is complicated in the setting of inflammatory arthropathies. Thus, interpretation of synovial fluid analysis should consider the clinical context, patient comorbidities, and immune status, and for prosthetic joints, the duration of symptoms, timing relative to surgery, and joint involved.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^1125rGaP]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — synovial fluid testing and diagnostic ranges: Regardless of how joint fluid is obtained, an adequate volume of fluid should be submitted to the laboratory rather than a culture swab, and synovial fluid WBC count and Gram stain should be performed, with the WBC count an important but rough guide that should be interpreted in clinical context. In ABA, joint fluid WBC counts are usually greater than 50 000/μl and often exceed 100 000/μl with a neutrophil predominance, whereas transient nonbacterial synovitis commonly shows 5000 to 15 000/μl with mononuclear predominance, and in JIA it is typically < 50 000/μl. Lyme arthritis may mimic ABA, with over half of pediatric cases exceeding 50 000 WBC/μl; in one Lyme-endemic study, children with intermediate (25 000 to 75 000 cells/mm3) hip-joint WBC counts were most likely to have ABA, followed by Lyme arthritis and then transient nonbacterial synovitis. Two small recent studies suggest potential moderate utility of urine dipstick leukocyte esterase test results on synovial fluid as a rapid discriminator of infection, but further validation is required.

Urinary tract infection in pediatric patients — bag versus catheter urine and white blood cell thresholds are reported as follows: Leukocyte esterase had higher sensitivity (84% leukocyte esterase versus 39% nitrites), and leukocyte esterase specificity was lower in bag urine (84%) than catheterization urine (94%). Urine white blood cells per high-power field (WBC/hpf) showed graded likelihood ratios (LRs): LR = 19 for WBC count greater than 20/hpf, LR = 18.2 for 11 to 20 WBCs/hpf, LR = 2.8 for 6 to 10 WBCs/hpf, LR = 1 for 3 to 5 WBCs/hpf, and LR = 0.3 for 0 to 2 WBCs/hpf. Relative risk of an ambiguous culture was higher for bag specimens at 2.7 (95% CI 1.7 to 4.5), with absolute risks 7.4% in bag urine versus 2.7% with catheterization; 21 cultures (95% CI 13 to 53) by catheterization would be required to avoid 1 ambiguous bag culture. With a 5% prevalence and bagged urine specificity of 70%, the positive predictive value of a bag culture is 15% and 85% of positives would be false; a positive bagged urinalysis result should prompt a urine culture obtained by catheterization or suprapubic aspiration.

### Septic arthritis in immunosuppressed patients: Do laboratory values help? [^117HnvGm]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

There are approximately 20,000 cases of septic arthritis diagnosed annually in the United States. It is a diagnosis that can be associated with notable morbidity, including joint destruction, sepsis, and even increased mortality, made worse by a delay in treatment. Prompt diagnosis therefore becomes critical for reducing complications. Accurate diagnosis, however, may be challenging because several pathologies such as crystalline arthropathies or inflammatory arthropathies may present with a similar clinical picture.

Septic arthritis has historically been diagnosed by combining clinical examination and laboratory data, with a positive culture remaining the benchmark for diagnosis. Waiting for the culture results however may require several days, which can lead to increased morbidity. Clinicians must therefore rely on testing that is obtained more rapidly but may not be specific for septic arthritis. Historically, these tests have included a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), synovial fluid cell count, and percent of synovial fluid neutrophils (% neutrophils). Previous studies have suggested the use of a synovial fluid cell count of > 50,000 cells/mm −3 from a native joint aspiration as the threshold for the diagnosis of septic arthritis. The addition of serum white blood cells (WBC) > 11.0 × 10 9 /L and ESR > 30 mm/hr with this synovial fluid cell count threshold has been reported to have a sensitivity approaching 100%.

Despite the near-dogmatic approach to the 50,000 cell cutoff, the evidence to support this value is limited. In addition, it is unknown if patients in an immunosuppressed state can mount an effective immune response to trigger this cutoff or if a lower value should be used for these patients to avoid a delayed or missed diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to review our immunosuppressed patients who had a diagnosis of septic arthritis to determine whether 50,000 cells/mm −3 is a reliable cutoff for this patient population.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1172qasr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections in cancer patients with neutropenia — assessment recommendations emphasize episode classification, tissue diagnosis, risk stratification, and extent-of-infection workup. Determine whether the current presentation of fever and neutropenia is the patient's initial episode, persistent unexplained fever after 4–7 days, or a subsequent recurrent episode (strong, low). Aggressively determine the etiology by aspiration and/or biopsy of lesions and submit material for thorough cytological/histological assessments. Risk-stratify patients: high-risk are those with anticipated prolonged (> 7 days) and profound neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 100 cells/μL) or a Multinational Association for Supportive Care (MASCC) score of < 21; low-risk are those with anticipated brief (< 7 days) neutropenia and few comorbidities (strong, low) or a MASCC score of ≥ 21 (strong, moderate). Determine the extent of infection via thorough physical examination, blood cultures, chest radiograph, and additional imaging (including chest CT) as indicated by clinical signs and symptoms (strong, low).

Surgical site infections (SSIs) after operations — initial management and when to use antibiotics — are outlined as follows: surveillance standards mandate 30 days of follow-up for operations without placement of prosthetic material and for 1 year for operations where a prosthesis was inserted; the most important therapy for an SSI is to open the incision, evacuate the infected material, and continue dressing changes until the wound heals by secondary intention; if there is < 5 cm of erythema and induration with minimal systemic signs (temperature < 38.5°C, white blood cell (WBC) count < 12 000 cells/μL, and pulse < 100 beats/minute), antibiotics are unnecessary; patients with temperature > 38.5°C or heart rate > 110 beats/minute or erythema extending beyond the wound margins for > 5 cm may require a short course (eg, 24–48 hours) of antibiotics and opening of the suture line; for intestinal or female genital tract operations with mixed flora, antibiotics considered suitable for treatment of intra-abdominal infection are appropriate, and when MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) risk is present the initial antibiotic should include vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, or ceftaroline plus piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftriaxone and metronidazole for gram-negative and anaerobic coverage; for incision and drainage of superficial abscesses, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended.

### Evaluation of patients with leukocytosis… [^112ow8Tj]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, often defined as an elevated white blood cell count greater than 11, 000 per mm 3 in nonpregnant adults, is a relatively common finding with a wide differential. It is important for clinicians to be able to distinguish malignant from non-malignant etiologies, and to differentiate between the most common nonmalignant causes of leukocytosis. 3), which can arise from infections, stressful conditions, chronic inflammation, medication use, and other causes. 1–7, 9, 10 Lymphocytosis can occur in patients with pertussis, syphilis, viral infections, hypersensitivity reactions, and certain subtypes of leukemia or lymphoma. An elevated WBC count is a suggestive, but not definitive, marker of the presence of significant infection.

For example, the sensitivity and specificity of an elevated WBC count in diagnosing acute appendicitis are 62% and 75%, respectively. 15, 16 For diagnosing serious bacterial infections without a source in febrile children, the discriminatory value of leukocytosis is less than that of other biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein or procalcitonin. 17 Although a WBC count greater than 12, 000 per mm 3 is one of the criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, leukocytosis alone is a poor predictor of bacteremia and not an indication for obtaining blood cultures. 18, 19. Initial laboratory evaluation should include'a repeat complete blood count to confirm the elevated WBC level, with differential cell counts and a review of a peripheral blood smear.

The peripheral smear should be examined for toxic granulations, platelet clumps, the presence of immature cells, and uniformity of the WBCs. On evaluation of a leukocytosis with lymphocyte predominance, a monomorphic population is concerning for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, whereas a pleomorphic lymphocytosis is suggestive of a reactive process.

### White blood cell count does not predict meningitis… [^1144Gx1s]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: How useful is the white blood cell count for ruling out bacterial meningitis in sick, febrile infants. Setting: Emergency department Study Design: Cohort. Synopsis: This study evaluated the role of the peripheral WBC count in ruling out bacterial meningitis in 5, 353 infants between the ages of three days and 89 days. At the institution where the research was conducted, all infants presenting with a temperature of 38°C or higher underwent a sepsis evaluation, including a peripheral and cerebrospinal WBC count. The investigators evaluated all children for whom cerebrospinal fluid samples were obtained. Even though the peripheral WBC count was not used to determine which children would have a lumbar puncture, there probably were children for whom a peripheral WBC count was performed but a lumbar puncture was not. The overall prevalence of bacterial meningitis was 0.

41 percent. The rate of meningitis was 3. 2 percent for a WBC count of less than 5, 000 per mm. 3 and 0. 29 percent for a WBC count of more than 5, 000 per mm
3. Overall, 64 percent of infants with bacterial meningitis would be falsely excluded if a WBC count between 5, 000 and 20, 000 cells per mm 3 was accepted as low risk. Using a cut-off of more than 15, 000 cells per mm 3 as the criterion of high risk would fail to identify 73 percent of infants with meningitis. Bottom Line: The peripheral WBC count cannot be used to safely identify febrile infants who do not have bacterial meningitis.
