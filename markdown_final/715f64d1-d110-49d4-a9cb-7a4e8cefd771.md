## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the combination of urinary frequency, urgency, and burning with urination (dysuria) has a 96% sensitivity for diagnosing urinary tract infection, and is requesting a source that supports this claim. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the highest-quality evidence says about the diagnostic accuracy of symptom combinations in women with suspected uncomplicated cystitis. Then, I should verify whether any guideline or meta-analysis reports a 96% sensitivity figure for that exact triad. Next, I will check for the closest high-probability symptom combination and its reported likelihood. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent discrepancies and state what the evidence actually supports, including any caveats about population and definitions.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical question and the exact triad being evaluated. The triad of frequency, urgency, and dysuria is indeed the classic symptom complex clinicians use to suspect acute uncomplicated cystitis in women, but I need to check whether any study quantifies the sensitivity of that exact triad at 96% or close to it [^11697iDy] [^1132xnmk].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence on symptom-based diagnosis. The JAMA Rational Clinical Examination review shows that in women with urinary symptoms, the probability of UTI is about 50% with one or more symptoms, but the combination of dysuria plus frequency without vaginal discharge or irritation raises the probability to more than 90%, effectively ruling in the diagnosis based on history alone. However, it reports likelihood ratios rather than a raw sensitivity estimate, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret that as sensitivity [^115Pb52w].

> Wait, let me verify whether any contemporary guideline cites a 96% figure for that triad. The 2025 AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline meta-analysis reports that the combination of sudden-onset dysuria and frequency without vaginal discharge confers a 90% probability of UTI when defined as greater than 10^4 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen; again, this is a probability statement rather than a sensitivity, and it is 90%, not 96% [^116cFAjd].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any of the provided sources actually state a 96% sensitivity for the frequency–urgency–dysuria triad. I need to check systematically: the JAMA review, the AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline, and the EAU guidance all discuss high-probability symptom constellations but do not provide a 96% sensitivity figure for that exact triad. The closest high-probability estimate is around 90% for dysuria plus frequency without vaginal symptoms, which aligns with the AUA/CUA/SUFU meta-analysis rather than a 96% sensitivity claim [^115Pb52w] [^116cFAjd].

> I should double-check whether the 96% figure might come from a different context or symptom set. The 97% figure that appears in the corpus pertains to interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome criteria describing pain that worsens with bladder filling and improves with emptying, which is a different disease construct and not a UTI diagnostic sensitivity metric; conflating these would be a mistake, so I need to ensure I do not import that unrelated statistic into UTI diagnosis [^115ZfYqT].

> Let me consider the clinical implications so I do not overstate certainty. Even when dysuria and frequency coexist without vaginal symptoms, the probability reaches about 90%, not 100%, and guidelines still emphasize integrating symptoms with urinalysis and, when appropriate, culture, particularly in recurrent presentations or atypical features; this reinforces that a 96% sensitivity claim for the triad is unsupported by the cited evidence base [^116cFAjd] [^113gEoge] [^1132xnmk].

> Conclusion: I should confirm the bottom line clearly. There is no source in the provided materials that documents a 96% sensitivity for the frequency–urgency–dysuria triad. The best-supported figure is approximately 90% probability for the combination of sudden-onset dysuria and frequency without vaginal discharge, as reported in the 2025 AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline meta-analysis, with the JAMA Rational Clinical Examination similarly describing a greater-than-90% probability for dysuria plus frequency without vaginal irritation, not a 96% sensitivity [^116cFAjd] [^115Pb52w].

---

I can't find a source that reports a 96% sensitivity for the triad of frequency, urgency, and burning with urination for UTI. The best-supported figure is that **dysuria plus frequency without vaginal discharge** confers about a 90% probability of UTI in young women [^115Pb52w] [^116cFAjd]. No guideline or study in the provided references reports a 96% sensitivity for the exact triad; the closest high-certainty estimate is **~90%**, and sensitivity varies by population and definition [^11549KRB] [^113r1RCg].

---

## Evidence supporting diagnostic accuracy of urinary symptoms

Several studies and guidelines address the diagnostic value of urinary symptoms for UTI:

- **JAMA Rational Clinical Examination**: Dysuria, frequency, and urgency increase the likelihood of UTI, but no study reports a 96% sensitivity for the triad. The strongest evidence shows dysuria plus frequency without vaginal discharge yields ~90% probability of UTI in young women [^115Pb52w].

- **AUA/CUA/SUFU 2025 guideline**: A meta-analysis found sudden-onset dysuria plus frequency without vaginal discharge confers ~90% probability of UTI (> 10^4 CFU/mL single uropathogen). It does not report 96% sensitivity for the triad [^116cFAjd].

- **EAU 2025 guideline**: Recommends diagnosing cystitis in women with dysuria, frequency, and urgency and no vaginal discharge, but does not quantify sensitivity or specificity [^11697iDy].

- **AAFP 2024**: Diagnoses uncomplicated UTI in women with typical acute LUTS and no vaginal discharge, but does not provide a 96% sensitivity figure [^111rAs3W].

## Summary of evidence

| **Source** | **Reported sensitivity or diagnostic probability** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| JAMA Rational Clinical Examination | ~90% probability for dysuria + frequency without vaginal discharge | Does not report 96% sensitivity for triad |
| AUA/CUA/SUFU 2025 guideline | ~90% probability for dysuria + frequency without vaginal discharge | Does not report 96% sensitivity for triad |
| EAU 2025 guideline | Recommends triad for diagnosis | No quantitative sensitivity reported |
| AAFP 2024 | Typical symptoms suffice for diagnosis | No quantitative sensitivity reported |

---

## Conclusion

There is **no source in the provided references** that reports a 96% sensitivity for the triad of frequency, urgency, and burning with urination for UTI. The highest-certainty estimate is ~90% probability for dysuria plus frequency without vaginal discharge in young women, and sensitivity varies by population and diagnostic criteria [^115Pb52w] [^116cFAjd].

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definitions and terminology state that a commonly used definition describes urinary tract infection (UTI) as an infection of the lower and/or upper genitourinary tract which is diagnosed based on the presence of a pathogen in the urinary tract and associated symptoms, with limited evidence to support any "gold standard" UTI definition for epidemiologic or clinical research; this statement endorses a clinically useful, culture-based definition for rUTI of at least 2 culture-proven episodes in 6 months, or at least 3 in 1 year, and distinguishes relapse as UTI symptoms with the same uropathogen within 2 weeks of completing appropriate antibiotic therapy versus recurrence beyond the initial 2 weeks or with a different uropathogen.

The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge for physicians in triaging patients in emergency rooms. We found a potentially dangerous overlap of classical urinary symptoms and the as yet not fully described symptoms of COVID-19. After a patient was primarily triaged as a urosepsis case and then subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19, we focused on an increase in urinary frequency as a symptom of COVID-19 and identified this in seven males out of 57 patients currently being treated in our COVID-19 wards. In the absence of any other causes, urinary frequency may be secondary to viral cystitis due to underlying COVID-19 disease. We propose consideration of urinary frequency as an anamnestic tool in patients with infective symptoms to increase awareness among urologists during the current COVID-19 pandemic to prevent fatal implications of misinterpreting urological symptoms.

Strengths and limitations

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the utility of symptoms and signs in diagnosing UTI in older adult outpatients. Our search strategy was broad, in order to maximise chances of capture of relevant studies. We contacted several authors of studies to clarify details in the papers being screened for inclusion. Dual extraction of all data was performed. Data was extracted as fully as possible, providing gender specific data when possible. However, due to the breadth of the review, and given the difficulty of search terms in this area it is highly likely we have missed studies, especially unpublished studies. Whilst we were able to extract data for a wide range of symptoms and signs, due to variations in the way they were reported, meta-analysis was only possible for two symptoms.

Our results should be interpreted with caution as a number of the included studies were of poor quality, there was high heterogeneity between the included studies, and few symptoms and signs were assessed across more than one study. We postulate that differences in study design, the low quality of a number of the included studies and differences in definition of symptoms and signs may explain the observed heterogeneity. Furthermore, we assessed multiple independent symptoms and signs; having applied 95% confidence intervals, we might expect that 1 in 20 of our estimates might produce significant results as a result of chance.

A number of the studies were rated as 'high risk' across a number of the QUADAS-2 domains. However, we also recognise that in studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs, by their very nature, it is difficult to entirely eliminate subjectivity and a degree of bias. For example, incorporation bias is largely unavoidable because diagnoses of infections are often made taking into account symptoms and signs, as well as test results. Partly as a result of this as well as lack of standardisation of methodology, the feasibility of pooling results from such studies is restricted by significant heterogeneity. Insufficient studies were included within the meta-analysis to allow for meaningful subgroup analysis to be performed to explore the high heterogeneity.

### What is the predictive value of urinary symptoms for diagnosing urinary tract infection in women? [^112Mf85y]. Family Practice (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our aim was to determine the probability of correctly diagnosing urinary tract infections (UTIs) from urinary symptoms and signs, studying their sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio (LR) when clinical history, signs and reactive strip test results are taken into account.

Methods

An epidemiological analysis with a diagnostic and clinical orientation was carried out in a primary health care setting. The subjects comprised 343 women ≥ 14 years of age who consulted their family physician for incident urinary tract symptoms. A guided medical examination was carried out using a check-list formulary, reactive strip test, urine culture and the clinical course of all patients.

Results

The pre-test probability of having UTI among patients with incident urinary symptoms is 0.484 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.431–0.536]. Positive LRs for UTI are: painful voiding 1.31 (95% CI 1.12–1.54), urgency 1.29 (95% CI 1.12–1.50), urinary frequency 1.16 (95% CI 1.06–1.28) and tenesmus 1.16 (95% CI 1.02–1.32). The probability of UTI is reduced by the presence of genital discomfort, dyspareunia, vaginal discharge, positive lumbar fist percussion and perineal discomfort. Nitrites on the urine reactive strip test increase the probability of UTI by > 5 times, moderate pyuria increases it by > 1.5 times, and the presence of both findings does so by > 7 times.

Conclusions

In women with urinary symptoms, a thorough clinical examination, together with performance of a reactive strip test during the office visit, improves the chances of detecting UTI.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — evaluation trigger per AGS/IDSA: Guidelines from the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) state that evaluation and treatment for suspected urinary tract infections should be reserved for acute-onset (< 1 week) dysuria or fever in association with other specific UTI-associated symptoms and signs.

### Acute uncomplicated UTIs in adults: rapid evidence review [^1132xnmk]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

An acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract with no sign of systemic illness or pyelonephritis in a noncatheterized, nonpregnant adult with no urologic abnormalities or immunocompromise. In women, a self-diagnosis of a UTI with the presence of typical symptoms (e.g., frequency, urgency, dysuria/burning sensation, nocturia, suprapubic pain), without vaginal discharge, is accurate enough to diagnose an uncomplicated UTI without further testing. Urine culture and susceptibility testing should be reserved for women with recurrent infection, treatment failure, history of resistant isolates, or atypical presentation to make a definitive diagnosis and guide antibiotic selection. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin for five days, fosfomycin in a single dose, trimethoprim for three days, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days. Symptomatic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and delayed antibiotics may be considered because the risk of complications is low. Increased fluids, intake of cranberry products, and methenamine hippurate can prevent recurrent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is also effective in preventing recurrence but has a risk of adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. Men with lower UTI symptoms should always receive antibiotics, with urine culture and susceptibility results guiding the antibiotic choice. Clinicians should also consider the possibility of urethritis and prostatitis in men with UTI symptoms. First-line antibiotics for men with uncomplicated UTI include trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin for seven days. Uncomplicated UTIs in nonfrail women and men 65 years and older with no relevant comorbidities also necessitate a urine culture with susceptibility testing to adjust the antibiotic choice after initial empiric treatment; first-line antibiotics and treatment durations do not differ from those recommended for younger adults.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostic policy considerations: Harms/risks/costs state that stringent diagnostic criteria may miss a small number of UTIs, the benefit-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm, and value judgments note that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria may be harmful; the role of patient preferences is that parents prefer no action in the absence of a UTI (avoiding false-positive results) over a very small chance of missing a UTI, with exclusions noted as none, intentional vagueness as none, and policy level as recommendation.

Follow-up evaluation in recurrent urinary tract infection — for patients with persistent UTI symptoms after microbiological cure, clinicians should evaluate for alternative causes to patient symptoms (Expert Opinion). Clinicians should explore alternative diagnoses for patients who continue to experience persistent lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) after achieving microbiological cure of a UTI, as symptoms may stem from other underlying conditions such as overactive bladder, bladder pain syndrome, pelvic floor disorders or even undiagnosed genitourinary malignancy. Acquired myofascial tension of the pelvic floor musculature, characterized by pelvic pain, urinary frequency/urgency and difficulties voiding, can mimic UTI symptoms but requires a different management approach, and psychological factors such as anxiety or depression may also contribute to LUTS.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11665bAL]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To critically appraise and evaluate the diagnostic value of symptoms and signs in identifying UTI in older adult outpatients, using evidence from observational studies.

Methods

We searched Medline and Medline in process, Embase and Web of Science, from inception up to September 2017. We included studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and/or signs in predicting UTI in outpatients aged 65 years and above. Study quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool.

Results

We identified 15 eligible studies of variable quality, with a total of 12,039 participants (range 65–4259), and assessed the diagnostic accuracy of 66 different symptoms and signs in predicting UTI. A number of symptoms and signs typically associated with UTI, such as nocturia, urgency and abnormal vital signs, were of limited use in older adult outpatients. Inability to perform a number of acts of daily living were predictors of UTI: For example, disability in feeding oneself, + ve LR: 11.8 (95% CI 5.51–25.2) and disability in washing one's hands and face, + ve LR: 6.84 (95% CI 4.08–11.5).

Conclusions

The limited evidence of varying quality shows that a number of symptoms and signs traditionally associated with UTI may have limited diagnostic value in older adult outpatients.

### Diagnosis of urinary incontinence [^112fxrZA]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Urinary incontinence is common, increases in prevalence with age, and affects quality of life for men and women. The initial evaluation occurs in the family physician's office and generally does not require urologic or gynecologic evaluation. The basic workup is aimed at identifying possible reversible causes. If no reversible cause is identified, then the incontinence is considered chronic. The next step is to determine the type of incontinence (urge, stress, overflow, mixed, or functional) and the urgency with which it should be treated. These determinations are made using a patient questionnaire, such as the 3 Incontinence Questions, an assessment of other medical problems that may contribute to incontinence, a discussion of the effect of symptoms on the patient's quality of life, a review of the patient's completed voiding diary, a physical examination, and, if stress incontinence is suspected, a cough stress test. Other components of the evaluation include laboratory tests and measurement of postvoid residual urine volume. If the type of urinary incontinence is still not clear, or if red flags such as hematuria, obstructive symptoms, or recurrent urinary tract infections are present, referral to a urologist or urogynecologist should be considered.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116MiZwv]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Currently, there is a lack of authoritative guidance to aid clinicians in making accurate diagnoses when UTI presents atypically. For example, there is no specific NICE guidance relating to the clinical features of UTI in older adults. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) recognises that typical symptoms used to diagnose UTI, such as dysuria and urinary frequency, may not apply to all frail, older women in whom atypical presentations are common. However, these atypical presentations are not fully explained within the guideline. In order to effectively diagnose and treat UTI in older adult outpatients, a clearer understanding of the clinical features that predict infections is required. The aim of this systematic review is therefore to determine the clinical features associated with UTI in older adult outpatients.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for recurrent urinary tract infection in women, more specifically with respect to urine tests, AUA/CUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend to document evidence of inflammation (pyuria) and the presence of uropathogenic bacteria in association with symptomatic episodes in order to make a diagnosis of rUTIs.

Implications for future research

In order to make robust conclusions about the diagnostic value of symptoms and signs in diagnosing UTI in older adults, additional high quality studies are required. More studies assessing the utility of combinations of different symptoms in diagnosing UTI would also be beneficial. It would be helpful if definitions of symptoms and signs were consistent across studies, or at least reported in full and transparently, to allow meaningful comparisons between studies and pooling of results. Building up the evidence base for the clinical predictors that predict UTI in older adult outpatients could facilitate robust guidance, generation of clinical prediction rules, and improve the accuracy of the diagnosis. Further studies in this area are needed in order to make confident assertions of the utility of different symptoms and signs in diagnosing these infections in older adults.

### Urinary ATP as an indicator of infection and inflammation of the urinary tract in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms [^1178kxRa]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

ATP has been proposed as a potential clinical marker of infection for both acute and chronic LUTS. To avoid premature use, when assessing the diagnostic potential of test, it is important to assess first whether the measure explains the symptoms and other manifestations of the disease of interest. The data published here demonstrate that urinary ATP does not offer any additional benefit to tests currently used in screening for infection in patients presenting with LUTS, and therefore does not show promise for future development of a diagnostic test for this particular group. This observation is confirmed in the ROC curves that explore sensitivity and specificity properties.

Our results demonstrate that patients with LUTS and any pyuria do not manifest a significantly raised urine ATP concentration. It is only when there is pyuria of greater than 10 wbc μl -1, which is a currently used marker of urinary infection, that there is a significantly raised urinary ATP. However, this signal was not a discriminating marker for low levels of lower urinary tract inflammation (pyuria 1–9 wbc μl -1) as shown by our second regression model, and it is in these clinical circumstances that there is greatest need for novel clinical surrogate markers. It has been shown that low-level pyuria, voiding symptoms, overactive bladder symptoms and pain symptoms all correlate with urinary infection. Only voiding symptoms explained a small amount of the variance in ATP. These findings are therefore discouraging.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the recurrence of clinical UTIs, as defined by the presence of any of the following symptoms: dysuria, nocturia, urgency, fever, urinary frequency, burning, suprapubic pain, and loin pain. This outcome was chosen because recurrent UTIs are most commonly diagnosed based on clinical symptoms in women, with symptoms being the primary guide for treatment decisions. While microbiological confirmation (e.g. positive urine culture) would provide a more objective measure of UTI, clinical symptoms alone are frequently sufficient for diagnosing recurrent UTIs in clinical practice. The secondary outcomes included positive urine cultures associated with UTI symptoms, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and adverse effects (e.g. nausea, diarrhea, rash, and others).

Screening

After deduplication, in which we used Endnote online™ 20 (Clarivate, Philadelphia, PA), two independent researchers (NH and GO) screened the studies by title and abstract, and disagreements were solved by a third (JC). Following this process, full text screening was performed. No automation tools were used during the screening process.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two authors (BP and NH) independently extracted the data based on a predefined protocol and disagreements were solved by a third (JC). The data primarily assessed were the type o study, the language of each paper, number of patients enrolled, mean age of patients, methenamine dosage, which antibiotic was used and each dose, the duration of follow-up, and all the outcomes previously mentioned. Risk of bias was assessed in randomized studies using version 2 of the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool (RoB 2). Two independent authors completed the risk of bias assessment (NH and GO). Disagreements were resolved through a consensus after discussing reasons for discrepancy. Regarding the UTI definition of each study included, it was not possible to obtain since it was lacking in the majority of them.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113r1RCg]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Summary ROC plots

Both urinary incontinence and dysuria were predictors of UTI [+ ve LR: 1.96 (95% CI 1.48–2.60) and + ve LR: 1.70 (95% CI 1.12–2.57), respectively]. Absence of these symptoms did not help to rule out a diagnosis of UTI (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 shows that urinary incontinence and dysuria were quite specific, but not sensitive for UTI.

Summary ROC plots for both urinary frequency and nocturia revealed high heterogeneity and so we did not calculate pooled estimates for these symptoms (See supplementary file 2).

Dumbbell plots

Urinary tract specific symptoms

Estimates for UTI specific symptoms were divided into seven broad categories, with gender specific estimates given when possible (Fig. 3). Much variation was found in the way that symptoms were described by studies. For example, incontinence was defined in six different ways, dysuria in five different ways, and urinary frequency was described in six different ways (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3 shows that when both sexes were assessed together, incontinence and a change in the character of urine were found to be predictors of UTI. One of the three estimates for dysuria produced a significant result. In women, of the four estimates for urinary incontinence, only one predicted UTI. This was also true of urinary frequency, where one of four estimates produced a significant result. Of the six estimates for nocturia in women, only one was significant in predicting UTI. None of the eight estimates for dysuria and urgency in women were significant, and absence of these symptoms did not help rule out UTI. Cloudy urine was a significant predictor of UTI in women, but not foul smelling urine or haematuria.

In men, there was only a single estimate for both urinary incontinence and frequency, but both produced significant results. Nocturia was not a predictor of UTI. However, unlike in women, dysuria was helpful in diagnosing UTI. Cloudy urine, foul smelling urine and haematuria were all predictors of UTI in men. Of note, all of the estimates in men came from a single studythat was assessed as low risk against six of the seven QUADAS-2 domains (Fig. 2 b).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to urinalysis, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain urinalysis in patients with dysuria to determine the cause, particularly in patients with recurrent UTIs, when there is suspicion for complicated UTI, and to prevent repeat encounters and repeat courses of antibiotics.

Context

Symptoms suggestive of acute urinary tract infection (UTI) constitute one of the most common reasons for women to visit clinicians. Although the clinical encounter typically involves taking a history and performing a physical examination, the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical assessment for UTI remains uncertain.

Objective

To review the accuracy and precision of history taking and physical examination for the diagnosis of UTI in women.

Data Sources

We conducted a MEDLINE search for articles published from 1966 through September 2001 and manually reviewed bibliographies, 3 commonly used clinical skills textbooks, and contacted experts in the field.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they contained original data on the accuracy or precision of history or physical examination for diagnosing acute uncomplicated UTI in women. One author initially screened titles and abstracts found by our search. Nine of 464 identified studies met inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently abstracted data from the included studies. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus with a third author.

Data Synthesis

Four symptoms and 1 sign significantly increased the probability of UTI: dysuria (summary positive likelihood ratio [LR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–2.0), frequency (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–3.0), hematuria (LR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3–2.9), back pain (LR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2–2.1), and costovertebral angle tenderness (LR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.5). Four symptoms and 1 sign significantly decreased the probability of UTI: absence of dysuria (summary negative LR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.7), absence of back pain (LR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7–0.9), history of vaginal discharge (LR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9), history of vaginal irritation (LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9), and vaginal discharge on examination (LR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5–0.9). Of all individual diagnostic signs and symptoms, the 2 most powerful were history of vaginal discharge and history of vaginal irritation, which significantly decreased the likelihood of UTI when present (LRs, 0.3 and 0.2, respectively). One study examined combinations of symptoms, and the resulting LRs were more powerful (24.6 for the combination of dysuria and frequency but no vaginal discharge or irritation). One study of patients with recurrent UTI found that self-diagnosis significantly increased the probability of UTI (LR, 4.0).

Conclusions

In women who present with 1 or more symptoms of UTI, the probability of infection is approximately 50%. Specific combinations of symptoms (eg, dysuria and frequency without vaginal discharge or irritation) raise the probability of UTI to more than 90%, effectively ruling in the diagnosis based on history alone. In contrast, history taking, physical examination, and dipstick urinalysis are not able to reliably lower the posttest probability of disease to a level where a UTI can be ruled out when a patient presents with 1 or more symptoms.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definition and diagnostic criteria emphasize that this Guideline supports the most commonly used definition of two episodes of acute bacterial cystitis within a six-month period sometime within the preceding year, and any patient experiencing episodes of symptomatic acute cystitis after previous resolution of similar symptoms meets the criteria for rUTI. Strong evidence suggests that the diagnosis of acute bacterial cystitis should include the combination of acute-onset symptoms referable to the urinary tract, urinary inflammation on microscopic urinalysis (pyuria), and laboratory confirmation of significant bacteriuria, with Table 1 detailing components such as acute-onset symptoms including dysuria with increased urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence; urinary tract inflammation defined as pyuria ≥ 5 WBC/high power field (hpf) on microscopic urinalysis; and detection of a bacterial uropathogen. Without symptoms, bacteriuria of any magnitude is considered asymptomatic bacteriuria, and patients who recur rapidly within two weeks of initial treatment or who display bacterial persistence without symptom resolution may require imaging, cystoscopy, or other further investigation for bacterial reservoirs.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — urine culture diagnostic thresholds and reporting: A positive urine culture is typically characterized by bacteriuria of at least 10^5 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, although according to the European Association of Urology guidelines, a count of 10^2 CFU/mL in symptomatic patients is sufficient for diagnosis; Canadian guidelines state that even 10^2 CFU is sufficient in the setting of UTI symptoms, and certain laboratories may report 10^4 or less as "no growth".

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^111xQbU4]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline — overactive bladder (OAB) definition and scope: Overactive bladder (OAB) is "a clinical diagnosis characterized by the presence of bothersome urinary symptoms", and most studies "exclude individuals with symptoms related to neurologic conditions". The International Continence Society (ICS) defines OAB as the presence of "urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology", and OAB symptoms consist of "urgency, frequency, nocturia and urgency incontinence".

In a multihospital cohort study of 3392 patients, positive urinalysis parameters had poor positive predictive value for diagnosing urinary tract infection (UTI). Combined urinalysis parameters (pyuria or nitrite) performed better than pyuria alone for ruling out UTI. However, performance of all urinalysis parameters was poor in older women.

Symptoms — dysuria is a key symptom of bacterial cystitis, and in young women there is a 90% probability of a UTI when she reports dysuria and frequency in the absence of vaginal discharge or irritation; history and examination increase UTI probability with dysuria (likelihood ratio [LR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–2), frequency (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–3.3), hematuria (LR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3–2.9), back pain (LR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2–2.1), and costovertebral angle tenderness (LR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.5), whereas the probability is reduced with a history of vaginal discharge (LR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9) or vaginal irritation (LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9); with aging, acute dysuria remains reliable, new-onset frequency or urgency correlates with UTI, and new-onset urinary incontinence should prompt evaluation for UTI, but worsening of chronic incontinence or other urinary symptoms are not reliably associated with UTI.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11741p3H]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

We obtained a number of conflicting results for estimates of the same symptom in relation to UTI. One point estimate for urinary incontinence in the summary ROC plot was a distinct outlier. Incontinence was described in six different ways by included studies; including "self-reported", "medical diagnosis of incontinence" and "incontinence (excluding stress)". The way in which incontinence was defined by the outlying study, and the potential impact of this on the point estimate is unclear.

Daley et al.found flank pain to be a predictor of UTI, whilst Juthani-Mehta et al.did not. There was also discrepancy between these two studies in their estimates for change in the character of urine and change in the voiding pattern. The reason for the difference in results between the studies is uncertain. The studies had similar prevalence of infection, study setting, age of participants, exclusion criteria and reference standard.

Comparison with existing guidelines

A decision aid within SIGN guideline 88 supplementary material, aims to guide clinicians in managing older patients with fever. The aid suggests that in the absence of symptoms indicative of respiratory, gastrointestinal, or skin or soft tissue infection, two or more of the following symptoms suggest that UTI is likely: dysuria, urgency, frequency, urinary incontinence, shaking/chills, flank/suprapubic pain, frank haematuria and new onset or worsening or pre-existing confusion or agitation. However, the findings from our review does not support the use of some of these symptoms. We did not find urgency to be predictive of UTI; nor did we find dysuria, frequency, incontinence or haematuria to predict UTI in women. However, only one of the studies in our review assessed the diagnostic use of combinations of symptoms in diagnosing infection. Furthermore, the symptoms assessed in this review were not in the context of fever. The SIGN guideline decision aid was developed by the Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group. Of note, they cite five references that were used to formulate the guidance: two from the Health Protection Agency, SIGN guideline 88, one qualitative case study, and one cluster randomised clinical trial.

In this first episode of the Microbiologist in the Clinic series, clinicians and laboratory scientists share their perspectives about a 30 y/o woman, who is seeking specialty consultation for frequent episodes of urinary urgency, frequency, and dysuria, which respond to short courses of antibiotics. Although her home dipsticks suggest that she has a UTI, and her urinalysis typically has a moderate number of white blood cells, her urine cultures are always negative. The challenges of this clinical presentation are discussed with evidence for evaluation and treatment.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113gEoge]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in women: Clinicians should obtain urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity with each symptomatic acute cystitis episode prior to initiating treatment in patients with rUTIs. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) Although no randomized, prospective studies were identified that were specifically designed to document direct effects of procuring urinalysis and urine culture with antibiotic sensitivities prior to initiating treatment, the bulk of observational data supports the comprehensive laboratory diagnostic evaluation of each episode (e.g., urinalysis and standard urine culture), and every effort should be made to obtain urinalysis, microbiological identification, and antimicrobial resistance patterns to confirm the diagnosis and follow clinical responses to management; the routine prescription of antibiotics based on patient symptoms without microbiological evaluation should be discouraged, and independent evaluation of each symptomatic episode not only allows for the modification of treatment plans as needed to address atypical or antimicrobial-resistant bacteria but will also help to identify those patients with one of the numerous alternative diagnoses who would benefit from a different approach to treatment.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^115NH6v9]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Adult urodynamics — overactive bladder (OAB), urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) and mixed urinary incontinence are defined as symptom complexes that include a component of urinary urgency with or without incontinence in the absence of infection or other pathology. Urgency is the sudden uncontrollable desire to void that is difficult to defer and may or may not be associated with urinary incontinence. OAB is a syndrome in which several of the storage-related lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) coexist with urgency being the principal and essential parameter, and by definition at least one parameter must exist in addition to the urgency in order to diagnose OAB. Mixed incontinence is the combination of SUI and urge incontinence, patients will often describe urinary frequency with low-volume voids, nocturia is a more variable part of the OAB complex and usually has a multifactorial etiology, and patients with nocturia as a primary symptom that significantly affects quality of life require separate investigation and are beyond the scope of this guideline.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^11549KRB]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms note that acute-onset symptoms attributable to the urinary tract typically include dysuria in conjunction with variable degrees of increased urinary urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence. Dysuria (urethral burning during voiding) is central in the diagnosis of UTI, and acute-onset dysuria is a specific symptom, with more than 90% accuracy for UTI in young women in the absence of concomitant vaginal irritation or increased vaginal discharge. Dysuria can have other causes (e.g., atrophic vaginitis, pelvic floor myofascial pain, vulvar lichen sclerosus), and the specificity of this symptom outside of this narrow population has not been defined. In older adults, the symptoms of UTI may be less clear, and careful evaluation of their chronicity becomes an important consideration when the diagnosis of UTI is in doubt.

### Evaluation of dysuria in adults… [^1178k3To]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Dysuria is the sensation of pain, burning, or discomfort on urination. 1, 2 Although many physicians equate dysuria with urinary tract infection, it is actually a symptom that has many potential causes. Empiric treatment with antibiotics may be inappropriate, except in carefully selected patients. 3–5. HISTORY The timing, frequency, severity, and location of dysuria are important. In adult women, a history of external dysuria suggests vaginal infection or inflammation, whereas a history of internal dysuria suggests bacterial cystitis or urethritis. 1 Pain at the onset of urination is usually caused by urethral inflammation, but suprapubic pain after voiding is more suggestive of bladder inflammation or infection. Longer duration and more gradual onset of symptoms may suggest C. trachomatis infection, whereas sudden onset of symptoms and hematuria suggests bacterial infection.

It is important to inquire about the presence of other genitourinary symptoms. Dysuria is frequently accompanied by urinary frequency, hesitation, slowness, or urgency. Urinary frequency is most often caused by decreased bladder capacity or painful bladder distention. Other causes include overflow secondary to BPH, urethral pathology, and, rarely, a central or peripheral neurologic disorder. Urinary hesitation and slow urination are most commonly caused by urethral obstruction but may also be secondary to decreased bladder contractility. Urinary urgency occurs as a result of trigonal or posterior urethral irritation caused by inflammation, stones, or tumor and is common with cystitis. Urethral discharge is highly associated with urethritis. 19 In men, urethral discharge and dysuria are the most common symptoms of sexually transmitted urethritis. Information should also be obtained about the patient's sexual and general medical history.

In sexually active patients, urethritis or vulvovaginitis can be a likely cause of dysuria. A history of sexually transmitted disease can point to urethral scarring or a current STD, especially in patients with high-risk sexual behaviors. Patients who have diabetes mellitus may present with vulvovaginitis secondary to candidiasis. 6 Mild tenderness can be present in prostatitis or prostatodynia.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^117KZpWR]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women — evaluation: Clinicians should obtain a complete patient history and perform a pelvic examination in women presenting with rUTIs. (Clinical Principle) Patients with rUTIs should have a complete history obtained, including LUTS such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, nocturia, incontinence, hematuria, pneumaturia, and fecaluria; further information to obtain includes any history of bowel symptoms such as diarrhea, accidental bowel leakage, or constipation; recent use of antibiotics for any medical condition; prior antibiotic-related problems (e.g. C. difficile infection); antibiotic allergies and sensitivities; back or flank pain; catheter usage; vaginal discharge or irritation; menopausal status; post-coital UTI; contraceptive method; and use of spermicides or estrogen- or progesterone-containing products. Details of prior urinary tract or pelvic surgery should be obtained, and patients should be queried as to travel history and history of working or walking for long periods of time, and UTI history includes frequency of UTI, antimicrobial usage, and documentation of positive cultures and the type of cultured microorganisms. Patient history should document the symptoms the patient considers indicative of a UTI, the relationship of acute episodes to infectious triggers (e.g., sexual intercourse), antimicrobials used for each episode, responses to treatment for each episode, as well as the results of any prior diagnostic investigations, and it is also important to note the relationship of infections to hormonal influences (e.g., menstruation, menopause, exogenous hormone use) as well as concomitant medication usage or behaviors that may alter infection susceptibility, including prior antimicrobial treatment, immunomodulatory medications, and topicals such as spermicides. At the initial presentation for rUTI evaluation, a physical examination including an abdominal and detailed pelvic examination should be performed to look for any structural or functional abnormalities; pelvic support for the bladder, urethra, vagina, and rectum should be documented, noting the compartment and stage of any clinically significant prolapse; and the bladder and urethra should be palpated directly for evidence of urethritis, urethral diverticulum, Skene's gland cyst, or other enlarged vulvar or vaginal cysts.

### Nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infections: a diagnostic accuracy study [^116aTtRP]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

We applied a very stringent definition of confirmed UTIs, requiring a set of urinary signs/symptoms and a positive urine culture. Some studies only demand a positive urine sample for their UTI diagnosis, an outcome which might not be appropriate given the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in NHs. Half of all urine cultures in our study were positive, while a quarter were contaminated and thus considered negative. Our protocol gave preference to a clean midstream sample. Notwithstanding training was provided, contaminated samples were to be expected. We included all residents in our study, even those with physical or cognitive impairments in whom it can be challenging to collect a clean-catch sample.

There is lack of empirical data on which signs/symptoms are associated with UTIs in a geriatric population. Clinical features clearly indicating UTIs in adults are not always presented by older persons or they may not be able to communicate them. The association between non-specific signs, such as confusion or falls, and UTIs also remains unclear. Decision algorithms for UTIs in an older population, whether or not living in LTCFs, are hence often based on expert opinion and consensus. The Stone criteria we used are a good example of this. These criteria are intended for surveillance and benchmarking purposes and are therefore designed to be highly specific, not sensitive. In the absence of formal evidence with respect to an optimal gold standard for UTI diagnosis in an older population, we felt that the Stone criteria were the best available and acceptable to use in this study. After all, a positive urine culture could not be used as a gold standard for a UTI because of the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in this NH population.

A study of Walker et al. showed that there was a wide range of indicators, more subtle than the classic symptoms of a UTI (e.g. dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain), that influenced the ordering of cultures and the prescribing of antibiotics in both general practitioners and nurses. In our questionnaire, we therefore also included signs/symptoms which are not widely accepted and sometimes even controversial for the diagnosis of a UTI in an older adult, e.g. cloudy or foul smelling urine. Nonetheless, these changes in the characteristics of the urine are often reported by NH staff as triggers for UTI suspicions and we also wanted to explore if this was the case in our participating facilities. In our study, it were mostly nurses and nursing assistants who reported these signs.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^115kFmKv]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Background — definitions and measurement in overactive bladder (OAB) state that this guideline is focused on the evaluation and treatment of idiopathic OAB, and the IUGA/ICS joint terminology defines OAB as "urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without UUI, in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology"; urgency is the "complaint of a sudden, compelling desire to pass urine which is difficult to defer" and is considered the hallmark symptom of OAB; increased daytime urinary frequency is the "complaint that micturition occurs more frequently during waking hours than deemed normal", daytime void number can be measured with a voiding diary or self-report and, traditionally, "up to seven micturition episodes during waking hours has been considered normal"; nocturia is interruption of sleep to micturate with each void preceded and followed by sleep, and UUI is involuntary leakage associated with urgency with incontinence episodes measured by diary or self-report and leakage quantity estimated with pad counts.

### Phenazopyridine hcl 100mg [^114QyWPk]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Phenazopyridine HCl is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the mucosa of the lower urinary tract caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters.

The use of phenazopyridine for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. The drug should be used for symptomatic relief of pain and not as a substitute for specific surgery or antimicrobial therapy.

Phenazopyridine is compatible with antimicrobial therapy and can help relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antimicrobial therapy controls the infection.

Treatment of a urinary tract infection with phenazopyridine should not exceed 2 days. There is no evidence that the combined administration of phenazopyridine and an antimicrobial provides greater benefit than administration of the antimicrobial alone after 2 days. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)

European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: Urinalysis should be performed at initial evaluation and when clinically indicated at follow‐up visits for individuals with neurological diseases and urinary symptoms. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 94%).

Clinical Question 4. Should urine cultures versus no testing be offered for individuals with neurological disease and urinary symptoms?

Quantitative urine culture is used to diagnose a UTI by testing for the type of organisms and antibiotic sensitivity, and should be performed only in patients with symptoms such as dysuria, cloudy and/or malodorous urine, lower abdominal pain, and fever.

Recommendation: A urine culture should be performed for individuals with neurological diseases reporting urinary symptoms only if there is a suspicion of a UTI. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 91%).

Clinical Question 5. Should individuals with neurological diseases reporting urinary symptoms complete a bladder diary versus not complete a bladder diary?

Recording fluid intake, ideally together with urine output, helps to corroborate the history, recognize beverages and drinking habits detrimental to urinary symptoms, and provide an assessment of the functional bladder capacity. Nocturnal polyuria and polydipsia can be diagnosed only by using a bladder diary.

Recommendation: A three‐day bladder diary should be completed by individuals with neurological diseases having urinary problems at initial evaluation and at follow‐up visits when clinically indicated to provide an objective assessment of urinary symptoms. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 94%).

Clinical Question 6. Should individuals with neurological disease reporting urinary symptoms have their post‐void residual measured vs. not have their post‐void residual measured?

Post‐void residual volume is defined as the volume of urine left in the urinary bladder at the end of micturition and is a valuable indicator of bladder emptying.

### Presentation, pattern, and natural course of severe symptoms, and role of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance among patients presenting with suspected uncomplicated urinary tract infection in primary care: observational study [^1122CXsh]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Table 2
Relation between antibiotic resistance and duration of symptoms rated moderately bad or worse with adjustment for potential confounders. Figures are incidence rate ratios (95% confidence intervals)

*Sensitivity groups are compared with patients with sensitive infection who were given antibiotics.

†If compete data available for univariate analysis are used estimates are: unknown 1.00 (0.81 to 1.25), resistant 1.41 (1.14 to 1.75), no antibiotic 1.32 (0.97 to 1.81), urethral syndrome 1.29 (1.13 to 1.47).

‡All variables that significantly relate to outcome are included in this table and table 3. Other variables assessed in every model were: age leaving full time education, marital status, number of medical problems, previous duration of symptoms, and perception of doctor communication (communication and partnership approach, health promotion, interest in effect on life) and health anxiety (Whitely index).

Table 3
Association of antibiotic resistance and other variables with severity of symptoms in frequency group* at days 2 to 4 (increased day frequency, increased night frequency, and urgency and dysuria)

*In factor analysis of severity of symptoms at day 1 there were two groups of symptoms: "frequency" group (increased day frequency, increased night frequency, and urgency and dysuria) (Cronbach's α = 0.77) and "unwell" group (abdominal pain, restricted activities, and feeling unwell) (Cronbach's α = 0.80). At days 2–4 when symptoms remain most problematic, there was similar pattern (that is, frequency and unwell groups of symptoms, Cronbach's α = 0.79 and 0.86, respectively). Score for frequency symptoms presented as mean of all items.

†0 = no, 6 = as bad as it could be.

‡As in previous tables sensitivity groups are compared with sensitive group given antibiotics as comparison group. If complete data available for univariate analysis are used estimates are: sensitive 1.82 (1.37); resistant 2.37 (1.38); no antibiotic 1.99 (1.40); urethral syndrome 1.95 (1.37).

§β coefficients are estimates of increase in frequency symptoms for one unit increase in independent variable — for example, for every 1 point increase in rating of positive approach, severity score decreases by mean of 0.04.

### The optimal use of diagnostic testing in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis [^113i5848]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated cystitis is a common and costly disorder in women, and there is considerable variation in the diagnostic strategies currently used in clinical practice. Because the diagnosis of cystitis can be established in most patients using the history alone, the clinician's responsibility is to determine which patients require additional diagnostic testing. Patients with typical symptoms (i.e., dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria), without risk factors for complicated infection or pyelonephritis, and without a history of vaginal discharge, have a very high probability of cystitis and are appropriate candidates for empiric treatment. It is more difficult, however, to rule out infection in patients with suspected cystitis. Because the prevalence of culture-proven infection is very high in women who present with ≥ 1 symptom, and because the treatment threshold for this condition is low, a urine culture is generally required to rule out infection in patients with atypical symptoms, even in the presence of a negative dipstick test. In population-based, before-and-after studies, use of diagnostic algorithms has been shown to significantly decrease the use of urinalysis, urine culture, and office visits while increasing the percentage of patients who receive recommended antibiotics. These strategies have substantially reduced the cost of managing cystitis without an increase in adverse events or a decrease in patient satisfaction. Randomized controlled trials are needed to more closely examine the outcomes, costs of care, and patient satisfaction from different diagnostic and management strategies.

### Evidence-based criteria for pain of interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome in women [^115ZfYqT]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

No diagnostic physical signs, urologic findings, or laboratory tests are available for interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS). Its diagnosis is determined by symptoms and the exclusion of mimicking diseases. We hypothesized that certain pain characteristics are sensitive criteria for diagnosing IC/PBS.

Methods

In women with recent-onset IC/PBS recruited in 2004 to 2006 for the case-control study, "Events Preceding Interstitial Cystitis", we identified the locations of each patient's pain and in a nonleading way asked about the effects of 17 different experiences (criteria) on the pain. We identified a set of criteria that described the largest number of patients in the Events Preceding Interstitial Cystitis study. In a secondary analysis of another cohort recruited by others in 1993 to 1997, the Interstitial Cystitis Database, we determined the proportion of patients captured by these same criteria.

Results

In the Events Preceding Interstitial Cystitis study, pain that worsened with a certain food or drink and/or worsened with bladder filling and/or improved with urination was reported by 151 (97%) of 156 patients. These were the only three criteria that applied directly to the bladder. The same three criteria described the pain of 262 (97%) of 270 women in the Interstitial Cystitis Database who "definitely" had IC/PBS.

Conclusions

An hypothesis generated in one IC/PBS patient group and tested in another — pain that worsened with certain food or drink and/or worsened with bladder filling and/or improved with urination — was described by 97% of the patients with IC/PBS in each cohort. This triad might describe the pain of IC/PBS and contribute to a sensitive case definition. Estimating specificity awaits comparison with other diseases with similar symptoms.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116cFAjd]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — evaluation and diagnostic accuracy in suspected recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI): A meta-analysis of 9 studies found that the combination of sudden-onset dysuria and frequency without vaginal discharge confers a 90% probability of UTI, defined in this report as > 10^4 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen. In the same study, approximately 50% of women with one or more UTI symptoms (e.g., dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria, or back pain), who lacked that very specific combination of symptoms did not have cystitis, suggesting misdiagnosis of acute UTI is common. In-person assessment significantly improves UTI diagnostic accuracy; culture positivity rates for those tested following virtual assessment (29%) are less than half that for patients seen in person (64%). Given the number of conditions that share significant symptomatology with UTI and the common misdiagnosis of acute cystitis, patients with rUTI warrant evaluation with an examination at least at their initial presentation to rule out alternative explanations for the patient's relapsing symptoms and to identify any structural or functional abnormalities that may be contributing to infection recurrence, and additional examinations with subsequent infections are not required, particularly when presenting symptoms are consistent with prior episodes, but may be useful in situations where the patient's symptoms are atypical or fail to resolve with appropriate treatment.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111b9CJm]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Life expectancy is increasing and the population of older people is growing: people over 65 years constitute one sixth of the population, but account for one in three outpatient attendances. Moreover, the older population is at increased risk of bacterial infections, which can cause significant morbidity, mortality and further exacerbate hospital attendance. Of the bacterial infections, urinary tract infection (UTI) is the commonest in older adults. If not treated promptly, sepsis may ensue. Each year in the UK there are 150,000 cases of sepsis in the population, causing 44,000 deaths.UTI is the commonest cause of sepsis in older adults, with urinary sepsis causing an in-hospital mortality of 33% in this age group. In the United States (US), sepsis is the tenth leading cause of death in patients over 65.

UTI is the leading cause of emergency hospital admissions for acute conditions that could effectively be managed in the community. Over 65 s account for three times as many admissions to hospital for UTI compared to younger adults.6 The cost of hospitalizations is significant; in the UK, hospitalisations for UTI cost £316 million per annum respectively. Adults in the US aged 65–84 years account for over a quarter of hospital stays, and compared to other age groups have the highest average cost per stay at $12,300. Preventing hospital admission for UTI requires early recognition and treatment. However, UTI in older adults often presents atypically, which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. A study of older adults in primary care found that UTI was the second most common infection initially missed by clinicians, with many of the reasons for not making the diagnosis at the earliest possible opportunity related to problems with history taking. Symptoms and signs typically associated with infection in younger patients, such as fever, might be absent in older people. Of note, however, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common in older adults and should not be treated with antimicrobials.

Pyridium is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. Because it provides only symptomatic relief, prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when symptoms are controlled.

The analgesic action may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics. It is, however, compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed two days because there is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit than administration of the antibacterial alone after two days. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.)

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112kisNv]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Search strategy

We performed searches in Medline and Medline in process, Embase and Web of Science, from inception up to September 2017 (See supplementary file 1 for full strategy). We also conducted searches of the bibliography of retrieved full texts. Two reviewers (OAG and JMOM) independently determined study eligibility. Disagreements were resolved through discussion, and where controversy remained, the opinion of a third reviewer was sought (TRF).

Inclusion criteria

We included studies: of cohort and cross-sectional design; assessing the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and/or signs in predicting UTI; providing a reference standard for confirming diagnosis of infection; conducted in the outpatient setting of developed countries (e.g. General Practice, nursing homes, and outpatient clinics); and in patients over 65 years. We included studies in which a small proportion of participants were aged under 65 years. If the age range of participants was not clear from the full text, we contacted the authors of studies to clarify.

To meet our inclusion criteria studies had to provide data to enable construction of two by two tables for calculation of diagnostic accuracy parameters (e.g. sensitivity and specificity).

Exclusion criteria

We excluded studies: of immunosuppressed participants (such as active cancer or receiving chemotherapy); conducted in developing countries, as we anticipated considerable variation in the timing and mode of presentation of UTI, such that findings may not be applicable to developed countries; not published in English; with non-human subjects; and systematic reviews, case reports, case series and conference abstracts. Systematic reviews were used as a point of reference. We excluded studies conducted in Accident and Emergency (A&E) Units. Whilst A&E units forms part of outpatient care, the prevalence of serious disease in A&E is likely to be higher than in settings outside of hospital.

Quality assessment

Two reviewers (OAG and JMOM) independently assessed the quality of included studies according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Disagreements were resolved through discussion, and where controversy remained, the opinion of a third assessor was sought (AP).

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections across age groups [^1135JKJ5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common outpatient infections, but predicting the probability of urinary tract infections through symptoms and test results can be complex. The most diagnostic symptoms of urinary tract infections include change in frequency, dysuria, urgency, and presence or absence of vaginal discharge, but urinary tract infections may present differently in older women. Dipstick urinalysis is popular for its availability and usefulness, but results must be interpreted in context of the patient's pretest probability based on symptoms and characteristics. In patients with a high probability of urinary tract infection based on symptoms, negative dipstick urinalysis does not rule out urinary tract infection. Nitrites are likely more sensitive and specific than other dipstick components for urinary tract infection, particularly in the elderly. Positive dipstick testing is likely specific for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy, but urine culture is still the test of choice. Microscopic urinalysis is likely comparable to dipstick urinalysis as a screening test. Bacteriuria is more specific and sensitive than pyuria for detecting urinary tract infection, even in older women and during pregnancy. Pyuria is commonly found in the absence of infection, particularly in older adults with lower urinary tract symptoms such as incontinence. Positive testing may increase the probability of urinary tract infection, but initiation of treatment should take into account risk of urinary tract infection based on symptoms as well. In cases in which the probability of urinary tract infection is moderate or unclear, urine culture should be performed. Urine culture is the gold standard for detection of urinary tract infection. However, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, particularly in older women, and should not be treated with antibiotics. Conversely, in symptomatic women, even growth as low as 10 2 colony-forming unit/mL could reflect infection. Resistance is increasing to fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Most uropathogens still display good sensitivity to nitrofurantoin. First-line treatments for urinary tract infection include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (when resistance levels are < 20%). These antibiotics have minimal collateral damage and resistance. In pregnancy, beta-lactams, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be appropriate treatments. Interpreting the probability of urinary tract infection based on symptoms and testing allows for greater accuracy in diagnosis of urinary tract infection, decreasing overtreatment and encouraging antimicrobial stewardship.

### Interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome (IC / BPS) diagnosis: current limitations and a pragmatic clinical diagnostic definition [^112cy9EG]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop a consensus on diagnostic criteria for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS).

Materials and Methods

A subcommittee was identified based on expertise in IC/BPS diagnostic criteria. An outline was generated and iteratively modified until it was found to be acceptable by subcommittee members as the basis for manuscript generation. The manuscript was presented and revised in two iterations according to feedback from international key opinion leaders at the Global Consensus on IC/BPS and the AUA Annual Meeting, respectively.

Results

The patient history and physical examination are necessary components in the diagnosis of IC/BPS. Urinalysis and urine culture are necessary laboratory tests to rule out exclusionary conditions including active infection. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) criteria, which were established in 1988 for research purposes, pose several limitations and result in the exclusion of a large proportion of IC/BPS patients when applied clinically. Thus, we put forth a pragmatic and streamlined definition that is aligned with existing clinical guidance and standard diagnostic workup.

Conclusions

The clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS is based on history, physical examination, and urine studies. IC/BPS is clinically defined as an unpleasant sensation (e.g. pain, discomfort, pressure, burning) that worsens with bladder filling and improves with bladder emptying, of 3 or more months duration, in the absence of exclusionary diagnoses that would likely account for the symptomatology. A substantial number of IC/BPS patients have comorbid pelvic disorders (e.g., pelvic floor dysfunction, vulvodynia, endometriosis) which require separate treatment.

Trial Registration

This study is not a clinical trial and thus does not warrant registration as such.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^112zeBj6]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) impose a substantial burden on patient quality of life and urine testing accounts for the majority of workload in many clinical microbiology laboratories. Traditional UTI diagnosis relies on symptoms, urinalysis, and culture which are interpreted based on historical guidelines. This approach, while foundational, presents limitations, particularly in complex cases. Low-level bacteriuria and the presence of fastidious organisms are often overlooked or entirely missed in standard urine culture, stressing the need for novel diagnostic methods and technologies. This mini-review summarizes the existing state of UTI diagnostics in 2024 and covers current and upcoming technologies including rapid molecular-based pathogen identification, next-generation sequencing, and advanced antimicrobial susceptibility testing. However, these methods represent unique challenges, and as they are implemented, they will require the field to adapt to new concepts to avoid misdiagnosis and overtreatment.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111dhTj8]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

There is limited evidence of varying quality appraising the utility of a range of symptoms and signs in diagnosing UTI in older adult outpatients. A number of symptoms and signs traditionally associated with UTI such as urgency, nocturia and abnormal vital signs may be of limited diagnostic value in older adult outpatients. Less classical features, such as inability to perform a range of acts of daily living, might be better predictors of UTI. More evidence from high quality studies conducted in this area is needed.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent diagnosis in children who are referred to the urologist. Although most infections will resolve without complication after appropriate treatment, a wide array of potential complicating factors exists, which can make difficult the rapid resolution of a UTI. Clinical scenarios involving these factors require a high index of suspicion and prompt initiation of appropriate therapy.

### Urinary symptoms and their associations with urinary tract infections in urogynecologic patients [^114NVNDe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess urinary symptoms associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) in a urogynecologic population of women.

Methods

In this cohort study, we enrolled 150 urogynecologic patients who completed the validated UTI Symptom Assessment questionnaire and contributed transurethral catheterized urine samples. The primary measure (UTI diagnosis) was defined in three ways. Self-report (a nonculture-based UTI diagnosis) was defined by a yes or no response to the query "Do you think you have a UTI?" Two culture-based UTI diagnoses also were analyzed: standard urine culture (10 colony-forming units [CFU]/mL or greater) and enhanced quantitative urine culture (10 CFU/mL or greater) of any uropathogen. Statistical analyses were performed on patient demographics and urinary symptom prevalence among patient groups.

Results

Although the presence of the urinary symptoms of frequency and urgency (respectively) differ somewhat between UTI-positive and UTI-negative women (self-report [P = .005 and P < .001], standard urine culture [P = .038 and P = .044], or enhanced quantitative urine culture [P = .059 and P = .098]), the presence of dysuria (pain or burning) during urination was significantly more prevalent in UTI-positive women for all UTI definitions (self-report P < .001, standard urine culture P < .001, and enhanced quantitative urine culture P = .010). Furthermore, women reporting dysuria had higher severity and bother scores for all other urinary symptoms assessed by the UTI Symptom Assessment questionnaire compared with women not reporting dysuria (frequency P = .001, urgency P = .006, dysuria P < .001).

Conclusion

Our findings show that, in women seeking urogynecologic care, the presence of frequency and urgency of urination does not confirm a culture-based UTI diagnosis. Instead, clinicians can more readily detect UTI using the presence of dysuria, which more effectively discriminates UTI-positive and UTI-negative individuals, regardless of the culture-based method used to diagnose UTI.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114HaXjM]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Highlights

- Older adults may present atypically with UTI and making a diagnosis can be difficult.
- There is limited authoritative guidance on how older adult outpatients present with UTI.
- Symptoms and signs traditionally associated with UTI (e.g. nocturia, urgency and abnormal vital signs) may have limited utility in diagnosing these infections in older adult outpatients.
- Disability in performing a number of acts of daily living may be better predictors of UTI; high quality studies should be conducted in this area to confirm this.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1123yACV]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — molecular diagnostics with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provide broader organism detection and quantitative pathogen load yet currently lack rigorous outcome evidence; preliminary studies show potential benefits but raise concerns about overdiagnosis and limited applicability to atypical presentations. PCR is only able to detect taxa targeted by pre-selected primers, while NGS provides a broader representation of all bacteria present, and PCR can determine the quantitative amount of each pathogen present, while NGS cannot reliably provide a readout of overall bacterial levels, yet these techniques currently lack rigorous evidence that urine multiplex molecular tests improve diagnosis or clinical outcomes. Preliminary evidence includes a small prospective randomized study of men and women with symptoms of acute cystitis (N = 44) in which NGS-guided treatment exhibited greater symptomatic improvement than standard urine culture, a large retrospective analysis where PCR diagnostics were associated with reduced emergency department presentations and fewer subsequent hospitalizations, and randomized trials in women with complicating factors documenting improved outcomes with PCR-based guidance confirming shorter testing times, reduced empiric antibiotic prescribing, and fewer repeat visits. However, these trials involved patients with complicating factors who may differ from women without them and who tend to exhibit higher rates of bacteriuria even without infection, so more sensitive detection methods would be expected to increase overdiagnosis; these findings applied to participants with a high pretest probability of urinary tract infection, and no studies have demonstrated utility of these molecular approaches for atypical presentations such as pelvic pain or chronic lower urinary tract symptoms.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^115aGm7b]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) — patient symptoms: Pain (including sensations of pressure and discomfort) is the hallmark symptom, and using "pelvic pain" as the key descriptor captured 100% of one population. Voiding frequency is almost universal (92% of one population) and urinary urgency is also extremely common (84% of the same population), though urgency is a characteristic symptom of overactive bladder (OAB) and can confound diagnosis. Pain can worsen with bladder filling ("painful bladder filling") or present as a strong urge to urinate due to pain, pressure, or discomfort ("painful urgency"), and the median time to develop the full symptom complex of frequency, urgency, and pain was reported to be two years in one study.

### Phenazopyridine [^113Ni1wq]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Phenazopyridine HCl is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the mucosa of the lower urinary tract caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters.

The use of phenazopyridine for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. The drug should be used for symptomatic relief of pain and not as a substitute for specific surgery or antimicrobial therapy.

Phenazopyridine is compatible with antimicrobial therapy and can help relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antimicrobial therapy controls the infection.

Treatment of a urinary tract infection with phenazopyridine should not exceed 2 days. There is no evidence that the combined administration of phenazopyridine and an antimicrobial provides greater benefit than administration of the antimicrobial alone after 2 days. (See Dosage and Administration.)

### Lower urinary tract symptoms that predict microscopic pyuria [^115dzJky]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

A most important finding from this study has been the discovery that in women, voiding symptoms play an important part in the complex associated with pyuria, pain features but is only evident for the higher levels of pyuria; it would seem that voiding symptoms are more discriminating.

There are many symptom scores reported in the literature that measure the experience of lower urinary tract disease, designed and validated by others. We would not have invested the effort required to develop this inventory without good reason. There is a growing realisation that the methods used to screen for urine infection in clinical practice are far from accurate and that their sensitivities do not justify the given status as arbitrators of the presence or absence of infection. We have recently reported that in patients with chronic LUTS, the dipstick test is at best 59% sensitive and others have shown a diverse urinary microbiome in patients with incontinence and urgency when routine urine cultures are negative. In truth, we do not have reliable methods for achieving such decisive diagnoses. We must therefore rely on the symptoms and signs, which may be no bad thing. We must take a history, examine the patient and not delegate the diagnostic decision to a single test.

The questionnaire that is described in this paper was designed to measure the symptomatic manifestations of pyuria. We could not validate against proven UTI because there is no contemporary microbiological method capable of furnishing the necessary data with sufficient accuracy. Microscopic pyuria, measured by immediate microscopy of a fresh, unstained and unspun specimen of urine in a haemocytometer is the best marker of urinary infection that we have, despite its surrogacy.

The 39 questions that make up the questionnaire had their origin in the free texts collected when patients were asked to describe their condition in their own words. Many of the early years of this project were devoted to obtaining these data and fashioning them into an inventory requiring dichotomized responses. Fidelity to the original source data was maintained throughout so that the questionnaire was not altered to accommodate data from investigations or diagnostic categorization. The correlates show that the patients' own descriptions of their states concur with the pathophysiology.

The symptoms score proved a good predictor of microscopic pyuria and monitor of disease progression. The dependent variable, pyuria, is the best surrogate marker of UTI available. The score correlated with measures of quality of life. Voiding symptoms were proved indicators of mild disease with pain indicating more severe inflammatory responses.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115SLWCR]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

The evidence from studies of predictors of infection in older adult outpatients is sparse, of variable quality and demonstrates that a number of urinary symptoms commonly associated with UTI, such as nocturia and urgency, have limited use for diagnosing UTI. In men, incontinence, foul smelling urine and haematuria were predictors of UTI, but not in women. Importantly, abnormal vital signs (fever, tachycardia and hypotension) are of limited value in UTI diagnosis. Symptoms that may be less typically associated with UTI, such as inability to perform a number of acts of daily living (poor functional status), were strong predictors of UTI. It must be noted, however, that the majority of these estimates were derived from a single studyand are likely to be highly correlated with each other.

Haematuria was found to be of diagnostic value in diagnosing UTI in men, but not in women. We postulate that this could be a result of increased chance of contamination of urine specimens with blood in women, making it less discriminatory for UTI in females. Up to 40% of post-menopausal women have atrophic vaginitis, which can result in microscopic haematuria on urine dipstick. Urinary incontinence was found to be a strong predictor of UTI in men but not in women. This may be due to incontinence being approximately twice as common in women compared to men, and therefore less specific for the presence of UTI in women. Similarly, it may be that abnormal vital signs (such as fever, tachycardia and hypotension) were not found to be predictive of UTI, as if combined with other symptoms (such as breathlessness), they might better predict a different infection (such as a chest infection). We were only able to identify a single estimate for the value of combinations of symptoms in diagnosing UTI.

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^113vD2ya]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A urinary tract infection (UTI) is the leading reason why patients seek treatment in primary care. One in three women will be treated with antibiotics for UTI by the age of 24 and 40% to 50% of women will experience one or more UTIs in their lifetime, with 10–15% experiencing recurrent infections. A UTI is commonly identified among young adolescents attending sexual health centres and accounts for 17% of treatment cases. In the adult population of 65 years and older, a UTI is the second most common cause of infectious disease related to hospitalisations in the USA. A UTI is a debilitating condition causing the onset of painful urination (dysuria), increased urinary frequency, the inability to start urinating (hesitancy) and the sensation of a sudden need to urinate (urgency), all of which are classified as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Many clinical guidelines advocate urinary dipstick testing for leucocyte esterase and nitrite as a means of detecting UTI, but evidence suggests that their utility might be limited. Dipstick analyses are surrogate tests, referenced not to microscopic pyuria but to a gold standard urine culture threshold for UTI, which guidelines accept as being between 10 3 cfu mL −1 and 10 6 cfu mL −1 of the pure growth of a single urinary pathogen. This test has attracted criticism too. Furthermore, the literature shows that the methods of sample collection for urine culture have never been validated in appropriate clinical trials. Justification for the use of such methods is based on plausible assumptions without supporting evidence. It is now recognised that routine urinalyses, including dipstick and culture, are insensitive, thus missing genuine infection in many symptomatic patients.

We also included some studies in which small numbers of participants were recorded as having cancer; these participants may have been immunosuppressed. However, we also recognise that a number of older people have malignancy as a co-morbidity. This might actually be more representative of real populations that clinicians treat.

We deliberately excluded studies conducted in A&E units in an attempt to make the results more relevant to primary care, and therefore may not be generalizable to emergency rooms. We included four studies that included a small proportion of the total participants under the age of 65 years. In one study,11% of participants were under 65 years of age, however, the author informed us that the two by two table data remained essentially unchanged after excluding them. Given the author's assertions we can be confident that this would not have biased the estimates obtained. Another studyhad an age range of 64–97 years, and in another, participants ranged from 64 to 102 years. In the study by Sundvall et al.the age range was 63–100 years; the author was able to confirm that there was only one participant aged 63 years, and all others were aged 65 years and above. For one study, we were unable to contact the authors to clarify the age of participants in the paper, however, due to the setting being a nursing home, we were confident that the majority, if not all, participants would be over 65 years.

We extracted episodic data into two by two tables when we were unable to extract participant data for one study. This may have led to over-estimation of the number of people with UTI, as the number of episodes of occurrence of a symptom or sign did not equate to the number of participants who experienced the symptom or sign. This is unlikely to have affected sensitivity, specificity or likelihood ratios. It may, however, have led to over-estimation of the positive predictive value and under-estimation of the negative predictive value. Finally, we excluded non-English studies and may therefore have omitted studies otherwise suitable for inclusion.

### Management of urinary tract infections in elderly patients: strategies for improvement [^114LsLE4]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Problem

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections affecting the elderly in both the primary and secondary care settings. Despite being common, the inpatient management of UTIs has been suboptimal. Clinicians are often overtreating elderly patients on the basis of non-specific symptoms. In most cases, there are insufficient recorded enquiries of lower urinary tract symptoms. Urine samples are also poorly collected for cultures and sensitivities. Therefore, many patients may be treated with antimicrobials to which the causative organism is resistant.

This project aimed to look into potential strategies for improving the management of UTI in elderly medical inpatients. These include increasing adherence to Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidelines on the diagnosis of UTI, increasing the frequency and timeliness of urinary culture collection in suspected UTI, and increasing use of urine culture sensitivities to tailor antimicrobial therapy.

Risk of bias

Fig. 2 a and 2 b show that none of the included studies were assessed as low risk of bias against all of the domains in the QUADAS-2 tool. Three studies (20%) were assessed as low risk of bias with regard to the flow and timing of the index and reference tests, and nine had low risk of bias with regard to patient selection. Two were low risk with regard to the reference test;, for many studies it was unclear whether the reference standard was interpreted with knowledge of the index test results (symptoms and signs). Applicability of the index test to the review question was assessed as unclear or high risk of bias in only one study. Six studies were rated as high risk due to prolonged intervals between index test and reference standard.,

Symptoms and signs

We identified 66 different symptoms and signs in relation to UTI (Figs. 3–5). There were sufficient studies to look at four symptoms using ROC plots (Fig. 6 and supplementary file 2). The other symptoms and signs have been presented as individual study estimates on dumbbell plots.

Within each plot, symptoms have been divided into categories. Positive and negative likelihood ratios with 95% confidence intervals are presented for each symptom. The black dot within the dumbbell plot represents the pre-test probability of UTI (i.e. prevalence). The red dot represents the probability of UTI after a positive test (i.e.g.iven that the symptom is present), and the green dot represents the probability of UTI after a negative test (i.e.g.iven that the symptom is absent).

Medical history and bladder symptom assessment — clinician assessment of patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB should characterize symptoms, assess severity and duration, exclude alternative diagnoses, and identify complicated signs or symptoms that may necessitate referral or additional evaluation. Bladder symptom assessment should include questions about typical OAB symptoms (urinary urgency, daytime and nighttime frequency, urgency urinary incontinence [UUI]), other urinary storage impairments (stress incontinence, incontinence without sensation), and the ability to empty the bladder (straining to void, poor force of stream, urinary hesitancy, history of urinary retention, sensation of incomplete emptying). Predominant emptying symptoms can indicate an elevated post-void residual (PVR) and/or bladder outflow obstruction (BOO), especially in patients with prostates. Certain signs or symptoms may suggest a more complicated process that may require further evaluation include abdominal pain, pelvic pain, hematuria, recurrent UTI, sudden onset of severe OAB symptoms, concomitant neurologic symptoms (blurred vision, limb weakness or numbness), and bowel dysfunction (fecal incontinence, severe constipation). The presence of incomplete emptying or other complicated symptoms warrants specialist evaluation.

### Urine trouble: should we think differently about UTI? [^115iUiqd]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is clinically important, given that it is one of the most common bacterial infections in adult women. However, the current understanding of UTI remains based on a now disproven concept that the urinary bladder is sterile. Thus, current standards for UTI diagnosis have significant limitations that may reduce the opportunity to improve patient care. Using data from our work and numerous other peer-reviewed studies, we identified four major limitations to the contemporary UTI description: the language of UTI, UTI diagnostic testing, the Escherichia coli-centric view of UTI, and the colony-forming units (CFU) threshold-based diagnosis. Contemporary methods and technology, combined with continued rigorous clinical research can be used to correct these limitations.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113LV38Z]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

Evidence from included studies suggests that a number of symptoms and signs traditionally thought to be associated with UTI, may be of limited diagnostic value in older adults. This review highlights the complexity of diagnosing UTI in older adults, and the breadth of their clinical presentations. The results of this review are based on evidence from studies of variable quality and therefore should be treated with caution. Further high quality studies, with large numbers of participants, need to be performed to corroborate these findings. This would assist clinicians with prompt and accurate diagnosis of true UTI, encouraging appropriate treatment with antimicrobials. Clarity in this area may also help clinicians to differentiate UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, reducing inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions for the latter condition, thereby improving antimicrobial stewardship. It is unclear how application of information from this review might translate into improved diagnostic rates of UTI in older adults or improve appropriate antimicrobial prescribing.

Diagnostic stewardship — pretest probability and UTI ordering context — Pretest estimates of disease are based on the incidence of disease in specific populations and how risk factors or symptoms modify probability, and this estimation is challenging in patients with nonspecific symptoms. In elderly patients, urine cultures are often ordered for nonspecific symptoms such as failure to thrive or fatigue, and the incidence of urinary tract infections in elderly women is higher than the general population as is the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria.

### Interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome: appropriate diagnosis and management [^113Xap69]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is characterized by urinary frequency, urgency, and pelvic pain in the absence of any other identifiable pathology. Initial identification of IC/PBS is challenging, as patients may have a range of symptoms that overlap with other disorders, including urinary tract infection (UTI). These patients may be treated empirically with antibiotics; however, many patients with such symptoms are actually culture negative and are later diagnosed with IC/PBS. This review describes the importance of recognizing the symptom overlap between IC/PBS and UTI and focuses on approaches to the diagnosis and management of IC/PBS. Physicians can improve patient care by considering IC/PBS early in the differential diagnosis.

THE CLINICAL LANDSCAPE OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

An estimated 400 million urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur each year globally, with over 200,000 associated deaths, making UTIs one of the most common bacterial diseases and drivers of antimicrobial usage. UTIs disproportionately affect women, up to 60% of whom experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. This association is generally attributed to anatomy, although hormonal factors also play an increasingly recognized role, including in relation to the vaginal microbiome. Traditionally, a UTI is defined by clinical signs and symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, pelvic or lower abdominal pain, pyuria, or urinary incontinence — often in combination with identification of an offending pathogen via urine culture. This symptom-based approach to UTIs can lack sensitivity or specificity in certain populations, including the very young and elderly, or individuals who are chronically catheterized, with urologic or neurologic abnormalities. For these patients, signs and symptoms can be ambiguous.

### Current controversies in urinary tract infections: ICI-RS 2017 [^111R3npi]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

The current definition of urinary tract infection (UTI) relies on laboratory and clinical findings, which may or may not be relevant, depending upon the patient group under consideration. This report considers the utility of current definitions for UTI in adults with and without underlying neurological conditions in order to identify gaps in current understanding and to recommend directions for research.

Methods

This is a consensus report of the proceedings of Think Tank TT3: "How do we define and when do we treat UTI in neurological and non-neurological adult patients?" from the annual International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICI-RS), June 8–10, 2017 (Bristol, UK).

Results

Evidence considering the definitions of UTI in patients with and without neurological diseases was reviewed and synthesized. We examined research on laboratory methods and clinical definitions, focusing on specific cut-off values for the quantification of significant bacteriuria, and leucocyturia. Several areas were identified, mostly related to the lack of evidence-based definitions of significant bacteriuria for different patient groups, as well as uncertainties about the role of inflammatory biomarkers, and non-specific symptoms and signs.

Conclusions

One of the biggest challenges in clinical practice is to discriminate between asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic UTI. Future research should concentrate on risk factors for developing symptomatic UTI in different patient groups. Targeted investigations for specific populations, such as the frail elderly, and patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction, are still needed.

### Evaluation of dysuria in men… [^1121oYdt]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Dysuria is the sensation of pain or burning on urination. In males, this sensation is usually felt in the distal urethra during voiding and resolves shortly after micturition. The timing of the discomfort can often predict its location in the urinary tract. 1 Pain at the start of urination usually indicates a urethral source of inflammation. More severe pain occurring over the suprapubic area on completion of urination suggests inflammation of the bladder.
2. Urinary symptoms are far more common in women than in men and in older men than in younger men. 3 Population-based surveys suggest that urinary tract symptoms significant enough to cause persons to seek medical attention occur in about 0. 6 percent of women per year and about
0. 1 percent of men each year. 4 Voiding symptoms in men increase significantly between the ages of 40 and 60 years, reflecting the rising prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia in aging men.

Dysuria is often associated with other irritative voiding symptoms, such as urgency, frequency and nocturia, but its most common cause is urinary tract infection. Urinary stasis resulting from urethral obstruction makes BPH a very common predisposing factor for urinary tract infection. The most common cause of recurring urinary tract infection in men is chronic bacterial prostatitis. 8 Furthermore, as men age, urinary obstruction can induce changes in bladder compliance that result in both obstructive symptoms and increased irritative symptoms, including dysuria. 9, 10. Organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis preferentially infect the urethra. 16 Urethral discharge is the most frequent manifestation of infection with these organisms. Discharge that is thick and discolored typifies gonococcal urethritis, whereas watery, scant or mucoid discharge is most common with nonspecific urethritis caused by infection with C.

trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum. Prostatitis can cause a sensation of rectal pain or perineal aching. A urethral discharge may indicate a sexually transmitted disease, and the color, type and amount of discharge should be determined. Bladder cancer can cause dysuria and hematuria. Prostate cancer rarely results in dysuria or other urinary symptoms.

### The diagnosis and treatment of adult urinary tract infections in the emergency department [^115d1h84]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Emergency medicine has been called the art of "making complicated clinical decisions with limited information". This description is particularly relevant in the case of diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Although common, UTIs are often challenging to diagnose given the presence of non-specific signs and symptoms and over-reliance on laboratory findings. This review provides an interdisciplinary interpretation of the primary literature and practice guidelines, with a focus on diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship in the emergency department.

Urinalysis general considerations — Urinalysis cannot substitute for urine culture to document the presence of UTI but needs to be used in conjunction with culture; because urine culture results are not available for at least 24 hours, there is considerable interest in tests that may predict the culture result and enable presumptive therapy, and urinalysis can be performed on any specimen, including one collected from a bag applied to the perineum, but the specimen must be fresh (< 1 hour after voiding with maintenance at room temperature or < 4 hours after voiding with refrigeration) to ensure sensitivity and specificity.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114MyDo6]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Data extraction and analysis

Two reviewers (OAG and JMOM) independently extracted data from individual studies into two by two tables. When it was not possible from the available information to extract data for individual participants, episodic data was used; one participant may have experienced more than one illness episode. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion, or the opinion of a third reviewer was sought (TRF). We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and pre- and post-test probabilities of disease for each symptom or sign in relation to UTI. When an empty cell rendered these calculations impossible, a continuity correction factor of 0.5 was added in the table.

Where the diagnostic accuracy of a clinical feature in predicting UTI could be assessed across four or more studies, we plotted the results in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) spaceand, unless heterogeneity were very high, estimated pooled sensitivity and specificity and summary ROC curves were produced using the bivariate modelin STATA v.13.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) with the "metandi" command. We estimated heterogeneity between studies through visual inspection of the ROC plots, assessment of the 95% prediction region around the summary operating point, and the 95% confidence region. When more than one definition of the same symptom or sign was reported by the same study, we used the definition that was most similar to those described by other studies for pooling results. We planned to perform subgroup and sensitivity analyses to further investigate significant heterogeneity, however, we did not have sufficient included studies to allow for meaningful evaluation.

We present all other results narratively and on a dumbbell plot derived in Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA). The plots include the pre-test probability (UTI prevalence), and the post-test probability of UTI given presence or absence of the symptom or sign in question (derived using the positive or the negative likelihood ratio, respectively). Study specific estimates were sorted into categories based on the type of symptom or sign reported and separated according to gender, if gender-specific results were available. We classed symptoms as helpful rule in or rule out tests for UTI if the LR + or LR- were statistically significant, respectively.

### Expert panel recommendations on lower urinary tract health of women across their life span [^112es4fn]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Women of reproductive age also have a significant risk of UTI. The National Ambulatory Care Survey reported almost 30 million physician office visits for UTI from 2002 to 2007 (6-year count), with women over 45 accounting for over 26 million (> 87%; 60% over 55 years old) of those visits. Hospitalization rates for UTI in women over 65 were 4–45 times higher than for younger women. However, the epidemiology and treatment of UTIs are complicated due to the lack of objective diagnostic measures, including variations in collection (clean catch versus catheterized), lack of routine cultures to confirm diagnosis, nonspecific symptoms, and lack of guidelines on the use of antibiotics.

New evidence showed that urine is not sterile, highlighting our lack of understanding of the roles of asymptomatic versus symptomatic bacteria. In addition, the definition of recurrent infections is debatable, further leading to either lack of appropriate treatment or mistreatment.

The prevalence of bladder pain syndrome (BPS) among women (3.8%) was as high as other painful conditions, such as migraine (2.1%), asthma (3.7%), and back pain (4.1%), and was much more prevalent in women than men. Women with bladder pain also had chronic pelvic pain. Women with BPS less than 30 years of age are more likely to experience urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria, dyspareunia, and pain in their external genitalia than older women who were more likely to experience nocturia, UI, and Hunner's ulcer disease. While we understand the impact BPS has on women, an improved understanding of the etiology is needed to develop targeted and effective therapies.

Menopause and aging

Menopause is associated with higher risk of recurrent UTI, UI, LUTSs, and OAB, among other conditions. In addition, there is limited understanding of whether hormones affect urological function and, if so, the underlying mechanism(s). For instance, 70% of women reported onset of UI at the onset of menopause, but epidemiological studies that controlled for age suggested the effect might be driven by aging and not menopause specifically.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^112xwVrk]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — treatment framework and differential diagnosis: The evidence base used to support this guideline did not favor stepwise "first"→"second"→"third line therapy", and to eliminate the concept of "step therapy", options are grouped by invasiveness with an emphasis on shared decision-making to select therapies based on the patient's needs, desires, and side effect tolerance; there are eight treatment categories: incontinence management strategies, behavioral therapies, optimization of co-morbidities, non-invasive therapies, pharmacologic therapies, minimally invasive therapies, invasive therapies, and indwelling catheters, and patients may select from multiple categories simultaneously. Differential diagnosis and contributors include that interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome shares urinary frequency and urgency with or without UUI, but bladder and/or pelvic pain, including dyspareunia, is crucial; genitourinary syndrome of menopause can contribute to urgency and incontinence symptoms and there is some evidence for improvement with vaginal (but not systemic) estrogen; urinary tract infection can mimic OAB but is generally acute, shorter in duration, accompanied by cues such as dysuria or suprapubic discomfort, and resolves with antibiotics; and lower urinary tract symptoms related to neurological conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis are considered neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction and not idiopathic OAB. Patients with prostates experience OAB nearly as often as those without and may be underdiagnosed and undertreated; some have both benign prostatic hyperplasia and OAB, while others have OAB alone and would benefit from diagnosis specific treatment. Because the term "refractory OAB" lacks a clear definition and consensus, the guideline has refrained from using it.

### The association of vulvar pain and urological urgency and frequency: findings from a community-based case-control study [^117FdEDv]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Vulvodynia is chronic debilitating burning vulvar pain or pain on contact. Although women who suffer from vulvodynia are more likely than others to experience co-morbid interstitial cystitis (IC) and urinary tract infections (UTIs), few studies have explored whether women with vulvodynia experience adverse urinary symptoms (lower urinary tract symptoms [LUTS]) in the absence of urological pain.

Methods

Two hundred and eleven participants with and 226 participants without clinically confirmed vulvodynia completed the Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Frequency (PUF) questionnaire and were scored using all questions, and then a subset of questions relating only to their current frequency and bother of urination during day and night, and the frequency, severity and bother of urgency after voiding. Total, symptom, and bother scores were compared in women with and without vulvodynia, and regression models estimated adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the various LUTS symptoms.

Results

As expected, 40% of women with vulvodynia met the criteria for IC (PUF > 12) compared with 2% without vulvodynia. After excluding questions related to bladder or vulvovaginal pain, women with vulvodynia, compared with those without, were skewed toward higher PUF scores, including being 2.4 times more likely to report usually or always bothered by night-time voiding (95% CI 1.22–4.74), and 18 times more likely to report moderate/severe urgency after urination (95% CI 5.48–64.12).

Conclusions

Women with vulvodynia are substantially more likely to report voiding dysfunction and symptoms of urgency than women with no history of vulvar pain. These findings are independent of comorbid interstitial cystitis or history of UTIs.

### A reference standard for urinary tract infection research: a multidisciplinary Delphi consensus study [^113T1p6Z]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The absence of a consensus-based reference standard for urinary tract infection (UTI) research adversely affects the internal and external validity of diagnostic and therapeutic studies. This omission hinders the accumulation of evidence for a disease that imposes a substantial burden on patients and society, particularly in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance. We did a three-round Delphi study involving an international, multidisciplinary panel of UTI experts (n = 46) and achieved a high degree of consensus (94%) on the final reference standard. New-onset dysuria, urinary frequency, and urinary urgency were considered major symptoms, and non-specific symptoms in older patients were not deemed indicative of UTI. The reference standard distinguishes between UTI with and without systemic involvement, abandoning the term complicated UTI. Moreover, different levels of pyuria were incorporated in the reference standard, encouraging quantification of pyuria in studies done in all health-care settings. The traditional bacteriuria threshold (10 5 colony-forming units per mL) was lowered to 10 4 colony-forming units per mL. This new reference standard can be used for UTI research across many patient populations and has the potential to increase homogeneity between studies.

### Evaluation of dysuria in adults [^116shPap]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Dysuria, defined as pain, burning, or discomfort on urination, is more common in women than in men. Although urinary tract infection is the most frequent cause of dysuria, empiric treatment with antibiotics is not always appropriate. Dysuria occurs more often in younger women, probably because of their greater frequency of sexual activity. Older men are more likely to have dysuria because of an increased incidence of prostatic hyperplasia with accompanying inflammation and infection. A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of dysuria. Urinalysis may not be needed in healthier patients who have uncomplicated medical histories and symptoms. In most patients, however, urinalysis can help to determine the presence of infection and confirm a suspected diagnosis. Urine cultures and both urethral and vaginal smears and cultures can help to identify sites of infection and causative agents. Coliform organisms, notably Escherichia coli, are the most common pathogens in urinary tract infection. Dysuria can also be caused by noninfectious inflammation or trauma, neoplasm, calculi, hypoestrogenism, interstitial cystitis, or psychogenic disorders. Although radiography and other forms of imaging are rarely needed, these studies may identify abnormalities in the upper urinary tract when symptoms are more complex.

### Urinary ATP as an indicator of infection and inflammation of the urinary tract in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms [^1121mGnE]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

"Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms" (LUTS) is a collective term describing urinary storage problems such as frequency, urgency and urge incontinence; voiding difficulties such as hesitancy, reduced stream, intermittency and incomplete voiding; sensory symptoms that include various experiences of pain; and stress urinary incontinence. There is considerable overlap between these symptoms so that diagnostic categorisation is difficult. Whatever the symptom mix, the exclusion of urinary tract infection (UTI) is a mandatory first step in the assessment of all LUTS. Whilst acute UTI is not diagnostically challenging, in the case of LUTS without acute frequency and dysuria, exclusion of infection poses a diagnostic challenge.

There are good reasons to scrutinise urinary adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) as a possible surrogate marker of UTI since the reliability of popular diagnostic methods used to exclude UTI have been questioned. Published guidelines across Europe, USA and the UK reveal significant discrepancies in the choice of a quantitative threshold used to define significant bacteriuria. The clean-catch, midstream urine (MSU) sample culture in the UK and Europe commonly uses the Kass (1957) criterion of 10 5 colony forming units (cfu) mL -1 of a single species of a known urinary pathogen. Kass drew these data from 74 women with acute pyelonephritis and 337 normal controls, a select sample unrepresentative of wider lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Despite its limitations, this criterion has become a ubiquitous reference standard and has been challenged by several groups. The European Associate of Urology (EUA) guidelines for urological infections emphasise that no single threshold can be applied in all clinical situations. The urinary dipstick tests for nitrite and leucocyte esterase are also commonly used as a bedside screening test for infection and as a measure of a positive urine culture. However the use of urinary dipstick have been validated against the urine culture to a threshold of 10 5 colony forming units (cfu) mL -1 and given the recent criticism of the Kass criterion, urinary dipstick have also recently been found to be unreliable.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^1133Hoy2]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU overactive bladder guideline — definition and scope — defines overactive bladder (OAB) by the International Continence Society (ICS) as "urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), in the absence of urinary tract infection (UTI) or other obvious pathology". The purpose of this OAB guideline is "to provide evidence-based guidance to all types of clinicians and patients regarding the evaluation, management, and treatment of idiopathic OAB", and it "informs the reader on valid diagnostic processes and provides an approach to maximizing symptom control and patient QoL through shared decision-making, while minimizing adverse events and burden of disease", with "The strategies and approaches recommended in this guideline represent best, evidence-based and consensus-based methods".

### Presentation, pattern, and natural course of severe symptoms, and role of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance among patients presenting with suspected uncomplicated urinary tract infection in primary care: observational study [^112NZrMu]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Pattern and duration of symptoms

Symptoms started on average a median of three days previously (interquartile range 3–7) and 63/478 (13%) had symptoms for more than 10 days. Previous duration neither predicted duration of symptom after the consultation nor altered the estimates of antibiotic resistance. Table 1 shows the mean duration of more severe symptoms (defined as the duration of days when any symptom in the diary was rated moderately bad or worse is) after the consultation. The most common symptom that patients rated as a moderately bad problem was daytime frequency (397, 78%), and more than half the patients also rated their dysuria, urgency, and nocturia as a moderately bad problem; 241 (47%) patients were considerably unwell, and 214 (42%) rated restriction of activities a moderately bad problem or worse. Daytime frequency was the longest lasting symptom, but most other symptoms rated as a moderately bad problem lasted three days on average. Around 6% (38) of women did not rate any symptoms as moderately bad or worse. After consultation, 8% (55) of women experienced a week or more of symptoms they classed as moderately bad or worse. Among women in whom no urinary tract infection was confirmed (that is, patients with so called "urethral" syndrome) there was a similar pattern of severity of symptoms to those with confirmed infection.

Compared with patients who had an organism sensitive to antibiotics, when we controlled for confounding variables the duration of symptoms rated as a moderately bad problem was 50–60% longer among patients with antibiotic resistant organisms or who did not receive an antibiotic (tables 1 and 2). Patients with urethral syndrome were less affected. The duration of symptoms rated as moderately bad was also less when the doctor was positive about diagnosis. Symptoms lasted longer in women with frequent somatic symptoms, previous cystitis, and more severe symptoms at baseline. Thus in a woman with higher than median baseline severity (> 3), previous cystitis, and higher than the median somatic symptoms (> 3), moderately bad or worse symptoms will last twice as long as the average (incidence rate ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.61 to 2.57) and in a woman with two of these features 64% longer (1.64, 1.33 to 2.03). Antibiotic resistance and lack of antibiotic treatment were also associated with greater severity of frequency symptoms (table 3).
