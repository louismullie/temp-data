## Question

What did the REDECAP trial demonstrate about high-flow oxygen plus suctioning for tracheostomy decannulation in critically ill adults?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the REDECAP trial demonstrated about high-flow oxygen plus suctioning for tracheostomy decannulation in critically ill adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and population. Then, I should verify the exact interventions in the intervention and control arms. Next, I will review the primary and key secondary outcomes and their statistical significance. After that, I need to check safety signals and decannulation failure rates. Finally, I will synthesize the clinical implications and consider how this fits with broader evidence and guidelines, making sure I don't overstate anything beyond the data.

> Let me first confirm the study design and population so I don't jump to conclusions. REDECAP was a multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial conducted in five ICUs, enrolling 330 conscious, critically ill adults with a tracheostomy who had been weaned from mechanical ventilation, with a mean age of 58.3 years and 68.2% male, which establishes a representative ICU population for decannulation decisions [^116xtEiB].

> I need to verify the interventions precisely. The intervention group received continuous high-flow oxygen therapy delivered via the tracheostomy with readiness for decannulation determined by the frequency of suctioning needed, whereas the control group underwent a 24-hour capping trial with intermittent high-flow oxygen therapy. Both arms used high-flow oxygen, but the key difference was continuous delivery plus suctioning frequency as a decannulation trigger in the intervention arm versus capping with intermittent high-flow in the control arm [^116xtEiB].

> Now, the primary outcome. Hold on, I should double-check the magnitude and confidence interval. Time to decannulation was significantly shorter in the intervention group with a median of 6 days versus 13 days in the control group, yielding an absolute difference of 7 days with a 95% confidence interval of 5 to 9 days. This was analyzed with a log-rank test and represents a clinically meaningful reduction in time to decannulation [^116xtEiB] [^116xtEiB].

> Next, I should review secondary outcomes and make sure I cite the correct figures. The incidence of pneumonia and tracheobronchitis was lower in the intervention group, and hospital length of stay was shorter, while other outcomes such as decannulation failure, weaning failure, sepsis, multiorgan failure, and ICU and hospital mortality were similar between groups. Importantly, decannulation failure occurred in 2.4% with the intervention versus 5.6% with capping, suggesting a safety signal favoring the intervention, though I should note that the trial was not powered for decannulation failure as a primary endpoint [^116xtEiB] [^113vkFXA].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical implications before overstating. The authors concluded that basing decannulation on suctioning frequency plus continuous high-flow oxygen therapy reduced time to decannulation without increasing decannulation failure, which aligns with the observed 7-day median reduction and the lower failure rate. This supports a protocolized approach that uses secretion burden as a practical bedside readiness marker rather than relying solely on a 24-hour capping trial [^116xtEiB] [^113vkFXA].

> I should consider how this fits with broader evidence and guidelines. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about generalizability. The AARC guideline supports the use of weaning and decannulation protocols to improve time to decannulation, and observational data suggest multidisciplinary tracheostomy teams and bundles can reduce time to decannulation and complications, though most of that evidence is lower quality and not specific to high-flow tracheal oxygen strategies. Still, REDECAP's RCT adds high-quality evidence that a suctioning-frequency–guided strategy with continuous high-flow oxygen can safely accelerate decannulation in appropriately selected ICU patients [^114SJdGg] [^117Qf4QD] [^116xtEiB].

> But wait, what if the benefit is just from high-flow oxygen rather than the suctioning-based readiness assessment? Let me reconsider. Physiologically, high-flow tracheal oxygen can improve oxygenation and may modestly influence airway mechanics, yet REDECAP's design isolates the decision algorithm rather than the oxygen modality itself, since both arms received high-flow oxygen. This strengthens the inference that the readiness criterion and continuous delivery, rather than high-flow per se, drove the faster, safe decannulation observed in the intervention arm [^116xtEiB] [^1131ZPBn].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. The REDECAP trial demonstrated that in critically ill adults with a tracheostomy who are weaned from ventilation, using continuous high-flow oxygen with decannulation readiness determined by suctioning frequency shortened the time to decannulation by a median of 7 days and reduced respiratory infections and hospital length of stay, without increasing decannulation failure. This supports adopting a protocolized, secretion-burden–guided approach to decannulation in suitable ICU patients [^116xtEiB] [^113vkFXA].

The REDECAP trial showed that using **high-flow oxygen with suctioning frequency as a decannulation criterion** reduced time to decannulation by a median of 7 days (6 vs 13 days) compared with 24-hour capping plus intermittent high-flow oxygen, without increasing decannulation failure or adverse events [^116xtEiB]. This strategy also lowered pneumonia/tracheobronchitis and shortened hospital stay, supporting a **suction-guided, high-flow approach** to safely accelerate decannulation in critically ill adults [^116xtEiB].

## Study design and methodology

- **Design**: Multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial.
- **Setting**: Five ICUs in Spain.
- **Population**: 330 conscious, critically ill adults with tracheostomy after weaning from mechanical ventilation.
- **Intervention**: Continuous high-flow oxygen via tracheostomy with decannulation based on suctioning frequency (≤ 2 suctionions/12 h for 24 h).
- **Control**: 24-hour capping trial plus intermittent high-flow oxygen.
- **Primary outcome**: Time to decannulation.
- **Secondary outcomes**: Decannulation failure, weaning failure, respiratory infections, sepsis, multiorgan failure, ICU/hospital stay, mortality.

---

## Key findings

| **Outcome** | **Intervention group** | **Control group** | **Difference** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Time to decannulation (median) | 6 days (IQR 5–7) | 13 days (IQR 11–14) | 7 days shorter (95% CI 5–9) |
| Decannulation failure | 2.4% | 5.6% | Not significant |
| Pneumonia/tracheobronchitis | Lower incidence | Higher incidence | Significant |
| Hospital length of stay | Shorter | Longer | Significant |
| ICU length of stay | Similar | Similar | Not significant |
| Mortality | Similar | Similar | Not significant |

---

## Clinical implications

- **Faster decannulation**: The intervention reduced time to decannulation by 7 days without increasing failure, enabling earlier airway restoration and potential benefits in communication, swallowing, and mobility.
- **Reduced infections**: Lower pneumonia/tracheobronchitis suggests improved airway hygiene and less invasive manipulation.
- **Shorter hospital stay**: Earlier decannulation may reduce resource use and healthcare costs.
- **Safety**: No increase in decannulation failure or other adverse outcomes supports the safety of this approach.

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Open-label design**: Potential bias; however, objective outcomes limit this concern.
- **Single-country setting**: Generalizability may vary; replication is warranted.
- **Patient selection**: Conscious, cooperative patients with controlled secretions; applicability to other populations is uncertain.
- **Suctioning frequency threshold**: The ≤ 2 suctionions/12 h cutoff was prespecified; optimal thresholds need validation.

---

## Comparison with existing evidence

Prior practice relied on **capping trials** to assess readiness, but evidence was limited and heterogeneous [^116kAz6v]. REDECAP is the first RCT to test suctioning frequency as a decannulation criterion, providing robust evidence that this strategy accelerates decannulation without compromising safety [^116xtEiB]. It aligns with guidelines endorsing protocolized weaning/decannulation to improve time to decannulation [^114SJdGg] [^117Qf4QD].

---

## Practical application

- **Implementation**: Use continuous high-flow oxygen via tracheostomy with decannulation when suctioning needs are ≤ 2 per 12 hours for 24 hours.
- **Monitoring**: Watch for secretion retention, respiratory distress, or oxygenation decline during the trial.
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Coordinate with respiratory therapy, speech therapy, and nursing to optimize outcomes.

---

The REDECAP trial demonstrates that **high-flow oxygen with suctioning frequency as a decannulation criterion** safely shortens time to decannulation, reduces respiratory infections, and decreases hospital length of stay in critically ill adults with tracheostomy, offering a practical, evidence-based pathway to faster liberation from tracheostomy.

Background

When patients with a tracheostomy tube reach a stage in their care at which decannulation appears to be possible, it is common practice to cap the tracheostomy tube for 24 hours to see whether they can breathe on their own. Whether this approach to establishing patient readiness for decannulation leads to better outcomes than one based on the frequency of airway suctioning is unclear.

Methods

In five intensive care units (ICUs), we enrolled conscious, critically ill adults who had a tracheostomy tube; patients were eligible after weaning from mechanical ventilation. In this unblinded trial, patients were randomly assigned either to undergo a 24-hour capping trial plus intermittent high-flow oxygen therapy (control group) or to receive continuous high-flow oxygen therapy with frequency of suctioning being the indicator of readiness for decannulation (intervention group). The primary outcome was the time to decannulation, compared by means of the log-rank test. Secondary outcomes included decannulation failure, weaning failure, respiratory infections, sepsis, multiorgan failure, durations of stay in the ICU and hospital, and deaths in the ICU and hospital.

Results

The trial included 330 patients; the mean (± SD) age of the patients was 58.3 ± 15.1 years, and 68.2% of the patients were men. A total of 161 patients were assigned to the control group and 169 to the intervention group. The time to decannulation was shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (median, 6 days [interquartile range, 5 to 7] vs. 13 days [interquartile range, 11 to 14]; absolute difference, 7 days [95% confidence interval, 5 to 9]). The incidence of pneumonia and tracheobronchitis was lower, and the duration of stay in the hospital shorter, in the intervention group than in the control group. Other secondary outcomes were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Basing the decision to decannulate on suctioning frequency plus continuous high-flow oxygen therapy rather than on 24-hour capping trials plus intermittent high-flow oxygen therapy reduced the time to decannulation, with no evidence of a between-group difference in the incidence of decannulation failure.

### High-flow oxygen with capping or suctioning for tracheostomy decannulation [^113vkFXA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study REDECAP was published by Gonzalo Hernández Martínez and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Critical illness, Weaning from mechanical ventilation and Mechanical ventilation. In the REDECAP study, the trial question was: what is the role of high-flow oxygen and suctioning for tracheostomy decannulation in critically ill adults? In the REDECAP study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the REDECAP study, the population was: 330 patients (105 female, 225 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill adult patients in the ICU who had a tracheostomy tube after being weaned from mechanical ventilation. The key exclusion criteria were contraindication for decannulation at randomization, an age < 18 years, expected death before hospital discharge. In the REDECAP study, the interventions were: n = 169 intervention (assessment of suctioning frequency plus receipt of continuous high-flow oxygen therapy) n = 161 control (24-hour capping trial plus receipt of intermittent high-flow oxygen therapy). In the REDECAP study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in time to decannulation (6 days vs. 13 days; AD -7 days, 95% CI -5 to -9). In the REDECAP study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in decannulation failure (2.4% vs. 5.6%; ARD -3.2, 95% CI -8.1 to -1.2) No significant difference in weaning failure (6.5% vs. 16.8%; ARD -10.3, 95% CI -17.4 to 3.4) No significant difference in duration of hospital stay (48 days vs. 62 days; AD -14 days, 95% CI -33 to 9). In the REDECAP study, the conclusion was: in critically ill adult patients in the ICU who had a tracheostomy tube after being weaned from mechanical ventilation, intervention was superior to control with respect to time to decannulation.

Key messages

- Patient level of consciousness, cough effectiveness, secretions, and oxygenation help clinicians determine whether to recommend tracheostomy removal.

- Decannulation failure is the need to reinsert an artificial airway within 48 to 96 hours of planned tracheostomy removal.

- Clinicians are willing to accept a 2% to 5% decannulation failure rate.

### Current evidence for the effectiveness of heated and humidified high flow nasal cannula supportive therapy in adult patients with respiratory failure [^111TNVTj]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Certain questions remain unanswered, however, such as the optimal flow and the subset of patients who would benefit the most from HFNC therapy. Studies including other types of surgical patients, such as abdominal surgery (the OPERA trial) and lung resection, will be published in the near future.

Critically ill tracheostomized patients

Weaning of tracheostomized patients is still a challenge. To our knowledge, only one randomized trial has included high flow therapy in the protocol. This was a single-center study including 181 critically ill tracheostomized patients who were randomized to have the tracheal cuff deflated or not during spontaneous breathing trials. All patients received high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy through a direct tracheostomy connection to the maximum tolerated flow and conditioned up to 37 °C. Although that study was not specifically designed to assess the effectiveness of high flow through the trachea, the authors hypothesized that HFNC therapy may have some benefits in the weaning process of tracheostomized patients with a deflated tracheal cuff. Positive airway pressure may theoretically reduce microaspirations and, with a deflated cuff, a higher flow is conveyed through the pericannular space, allowing for better drainage of secretions.

Liberation from ventilator

Twenty studies investigated topics related to weaning from mechanical ventilation. Five studies compared protocolised weaning models and reported successful weaning in 77%–89% of patients. Those studies reported that the use of protocols resulted in no difference in the time to weaning, length of stay, rates of emergent reintubation or readmission to the ICU. Two studies addressed nurse-led and protocolised weaning. One randomised trial compared nurse-led protocolised weaning and physician-led weaning, and found that patients were more likely to be weaned prior to ICU discharge in the nurse-led group (77% protocolised vs 45% physician led, p = 0.031). A prospective study involving 192 patients found that there was no difference in weaning outcomes when medical management was provided by an attending physician and either a unit-based nurse practitioner, or a critical care rotational fellow.

Three studies evaluated predictors of successful weaning outcomes or decannulation. Two studies found that weaning or decannulation success was more likely in patients that were able to increase the force-generating capacity of the diaphragm. An observational study of 49 patients found that the ability to generate peak cough flows of greater than 160 L/min was predictive of successful decannulation. In a retrospective audit of 129 patients in a Dutch medical-surgical ICU, patients whose primary pathology was neurosurgical or cardiopulmonary were statistically more likely to have shorter weaning times (3–7 days) when compared with medical (9 days) or surgical (8 days) patients.

An observational study of 25 patients compared T-piece ventilation and continuous positive pressure ventilation during weaning and found that T-piece ventilation resulted in improved arterial and central venous oxygenation. One letter reported that configuring the mixing tube between the T-piece and Venturi mask connector improved oxygenation. Three articles, including a case report and an abstract, discussed the use of high-flow oxygen during weaning. One of these studies, a randomised cross-over trial, found that during cuff deflation, the use of high-flow oxygen improved oxygenation when compared with T-piece ventilation alone (p < 0.02). Two studies evaluated different types of humidification systems and concluded that heat-moisture-exchange systems and heated humidifiers provided adequate humidification, and that cold humidifiers provided inadequate humidification in 50% of patients.

### Effects of preoxygenation with intratracheal suctioning during extubation: an alternating cluster-controlled trial (INtratracheal suctioning and oxygenation AT extubation [INNOVATE]) [^114LHfwy]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent guidelines recommend oxygen application throughout the entire intubation and extubation processes for safety reasons. Although this may be a sensible concept in patients with difficult airways, safety data from our trial suggest that, in general, extubation at a low F 2 does not harm patients and may improve outcomes such as the ICU length of stay. No differences in mortality or the hospital length of stay were found in our large patient cohort.

Recent studies have shown that postextubation strategies employing high-flow nasal oxygen or NIV are more effective than standard oxygen therapy in reducing reintubation rates among high-risk patients. In very high-risk patients, a strategy using NIV is superior to high-flow therapy. A recent meta-analysis confirmed these findings but demonstrated that NIV reduced reintubation rates only when it was used as a primary strategy and not as a rescue strategy. This finding supports the definition of our primary composite outcome in which the use of NIV is considered an extubation failure. At the time of the trial, extubation to NIV or a high flow was not the standard of care at our institution, which made it at all possible to perform such a trial in a pragmatic way. Guidelines published after the completion of our trial suggest the definition of extubation failure as death or reintubation within 7 days after extubation or ICU discharge, independent of any NIV.

Key messages

HFNC showed promise in reducing the need for intubation, mechanical ventilation and escalation of respiratory support compared to COT. Large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to provide more robust evidence.

The findings of our trial sequential analysis further emphasise the need for new trials to address this unresolved question. To advance the field, we propose a novel methodological approach. Initially, the focus should be directed towards the development and validation of a comprehensive scoring system aimed at identifying patients who derive optimal benefit from tracheostomy. Subsequently, multicentre randomised trials should be meticulously conducted, with patient selection guided by this newly developed score. This approach aims to definitively establish whether the timing of tracheostomy holds substantial significance. Finally, once this novel dataset is available, a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis can be conducted to assimilate the latest insights and further refine our understanding of this critical aspect of patient care.

### Tracheostomy decannulation: marathons and finish lines [^111ix6xA]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Critically ill patients with a tracheostomy who are recovering from respiratory failure eventually require evaluation for airway decannulation. Although expert recommendations guide decisions for managing decannulation, few if any investigative data exist to inform evidence-based care. Consequently, practice variation limits the effectiveness of weaning from tracheostomy. In an investigation reported in this issue of Critical Care, the authors surveyed experienced physicians and respiratory therapists to assess their opinions on managing airway decannulation and identified several clinical factors that they recommend for selecting patients for tracheostomy tube removal. The authors propose that these factors can assist with designing clinical trials of tracheostomy decannulation. Pending completion of such studies, this report underscores the problem of practice variation in managing tracheotomized patients after critical illness. An important implication of the study is that care providers should recognize our knowledge deficit and develop systematic protocols for improving patient care using quality improvement techniques. Such models exist in the literature for adult patients and for children with tracheostomies who are managed by expert teams with requisite knowledge and skills.

### Determinants of tracheostomy decannulation: an international survey [^111BvEaD]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our study provides the first survey of contemporary tracheostomy decannulation practices. Our data indicate that clinicians consider a patient's level of consciousness, cough effectiveness, secretions, and oxygenation when determining whether to recommend tracheostomy removal. Clinicians define decannulation failure as the need to reinsert an artificial airway within 48 to 96 hours of planned tracheostomy removal and are willing to accept a 2% to 5% failure rate. The development of evidence-based tracheostomy guidelines will facilitate the safe and effective management of patients with tracheostomies.

The two groups were well balanced in terms of age, sex, and ICU length of stay, except BMI was higher in the low-F₂ group (Table 1). No correlations greater than 0.7 were found among the explanatory variables.

TABLE 1.
Baseline Characteristics Between the Two Treatment Groups

The primary outcome was reached in 166 (8.8%) patients in the high-F₂ group vs. 129 (7.2%) patients in the low-F₂ group. Multiple logistic regression after model selection (Supplementary Material 2,) revealed that the treatment strategy with a low F₂ and no suction had an odds ratio (OR) of 0.77 (0.60–0.98; p = 0.032), that is, a 23% risk reduction compared with the treatment strategy with a high F₂ and suction (Fig. 2 A, Table 2). The model included the admission type, APACHE II score, sex, BMI, age, and length of the first intubation. All variables, except the length of the first intubation and sex, were significantly associated with the primary outcome (Table 3).

### Tracheostomy decannulation [^111bxFC1]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

The respiratory therapist plays an integral role in tracheostomy tube decannulation. Removal of the tracheostomy tube should be considered only if the original upper-airway obstruction is resolved, if airway secretions are controlled, and if mechanical ventilation is no longer needed. Predictors of success include ability to produce a vigorous cough and the absence of aspiration. Tracheostomy decannulation requires caution, particularly following a prolonged period of tracheostomy use. The tracheostomy tube decannulation process is well suited for therapist-implemented protocols.

### Effects of preoxygenation with intratracheal suctioning during extubation: an alternating cluster-controlled trial (INtratracheal suctioning and oxygenation AT extubation [INNOVATE]) [^114w9mX8]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Does extubation with a low inspired oxygen fraction without intratracheal suctioning improve patient outcomes?

Findings: This alternating cluster-controlled trial shows, that the low F₂ (35%)/no suctioning strategy resulted in a significant reduction in the primary outcome–defined as a composite of reintubation and/or noninvasive ventilation within 48 hours after extubation–compared with the high F₂ (100%)/suctioning group.

Meaning: The results of our study support the implementation of low oxygen fraction without suctioning during extubation and its benefit on the outcome in intubated patients in the ICU.

Extubation is a key event for critically ill patients toward the end of weaning and liberation from mechanical ventilation. Extubation failure, occurring in 10–15% of ICU patients, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It can result from airway failure (inability to keep the airway open and clear secretions) or weaning failure (inability to breathe without assistance). The literature on extubation in critical care focuses on weaning strategies (i.e. measures before extubation) and measures such as high-flow nasal oxygen or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) to prevent impending failure after extubation.

Specific procedures for extubation have rarely been investigated. Guidelines describe extubation as a type of reverse intubation, usually involving airway suctioning and preoxygenation with a F₂ of 100%. Airway suctioning before extubation may be associated with postextubation complications; however, the data are inconsistent. High fractions of inspired oxygen are linked to the development of atelectasis and other pulmonary complications. The use of lower F 2 for extubation has been discussed as an alternative strategy. Available data, mostly from postoperative care, have been derived from observational studies, with only small datasets available from prospective randomized trials, and the results remain conflicting with regard to whether low levels of oxygen during extubation provide favorable outcomes. As a rare exception, the guidelines of the French Society for Anesthesia and Reanimation recommend no preoxygenation and no suctioning in their extubation algorithm, though without specific evidence.

In this single-center alternating cluster-controlled trial, we compared the prevalence of extubation failure, defined as the need for reintubation and/or NIV within 48 hours after extubation, between two extubation strategies: either airway suctioning together with preoxygenation at a F 2 of 100% or extubation without suctioning at a F 2 of 35%. We hypothesized that a strategy of lower oxygen and no airway suctioning would result in a lower extubation failure rate.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^113S1PWg]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Respiratory — tracheostomy management in significant/severe respiratory distress and/or inadequate oxygenation — If patient on ventilator, remove from vent and attempt BVM ventilation. For suctioning/clearing obstruction, remove any cap, filter, or speaking valve that may be connected to the tracheostomy; provide passive oxygenation with high flow oxygen over nose/mouth and stoma to avoid hypoxia during procedure; remove inner cannula if present; attempt to pass appropriately sized suction catheter through tracheostomy; if needed, use 1–3 mL sterile saline directly into the tracheostomy to loosen secretions and help clear obstruction. If suction catheter will not pass, the tracheostomy needs to be changed emergently due to obstruction. Once obstruction is cleared, assist ventilations as needed with BVM to tracheostomy tube, provide passive oxygenation or return patient to ventilator via tracheostomy tube.

### Effects of preoxygenation with intratracheal suctioning during extubation: an alternating cluster-controlled trial (INtratracheal suctioning and oxygenation AT extubation [INNOVATE]) [^114L69Dy]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, the optimal oxygen fraction and intratracheal suction during extubation have never been studied in the ICU. In addition, there is no evidence-based standard of care for extubation, despite its routine occurrence in nearly all intubated ICU patients.

In this trial, the physiologic effects of the low F₂ strategy without suctioning resulted in significantly higher P/F ratios and lower respiratory rates after extubation, with reduced need for respiratory support like high-flow therapy. Although the absolute differences in respiratory rate and ICU length of stay after extubation are small, the statistically significant findings in a large cohort support the study's primary hypothesis (Figs. 2 and 3). We hypothesize, that atelectasis may be the main driver of the difference in extubation failure between the two groups. Our data do not allow us to determine the effect size of each intervention component (i.e. no suctioning or a low F 2) on the difference in the primary outcome. Based on our results, an optimal F₂ strategy for maximizing safety (i.e. the time until desaturation in the case of emergency reintubation) and preventing adsorption atelectasis needs to be determined in future research and may theoretically lie anywhere between 35% and 100%.

Key messages

Early tracheotomy reduces the days of sedation of patients with seven or more days of ventilatory support
Early tracheotomy may lead to unnecessary procedures due to the limited medical capacity to predict within the first week, those patients that may require prolonged ventilatory support
Critically ill patients selected by attending physician during the first week of MV as candidates to receive a tracheotomy are characterized by an unfavorable clinical course and may benefit from early tracheotomy

### Effects of preoxygenation with intratracheal suctioning during extubation: an alternating cluster-controlled trial (INtratracheal suctioning and oxygenation AT extubation [INNOVATE]) [^1116xprw]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE:

Extubation is a critical event for patients in the ICU. Preoxygenation and intratracheal suctioning during extubation may contribute to atelectasis. However, evidence concerning extubation procedures and their impact on patient outcomes is limited. This study aimed to compare two extubation strategies: one using preoxygenation with 100% F₂ combined with intratracheal suctioning, and the other using a low F₂ (35%) without suctioning.

DESIGN:

A single-center, alternating cluster-controlled trial.

SETTING:

Tertiary level interdisciplinary adult ICU.

PATIENTS:

A total of 3,675 patients were randomized into two groups: 1) F₂ 100% with suctioning (n = 1,877, 51.1%) and 2) F₂ 35% without suctioning (n = 1,798, 48.9%).

INTERVENTIONS:

Comparison of two extubation strategies: F₂ 100% with suctioning vs. F₂ 35% without suctioning.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:

The primary outcome was a composite of reintubation and/or noninvasive ventilation within 48 hours after extubation. Secondary outcomes included the components of the primary endpoint, the need for nasal high-flow oxygenation or changes in the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P/F ratio) after extubation. Differences in outcomes were assessed via adjusted logistic or linear regression models. The low F₂/no suctioning strategy resulted in a 23% reduction in the primary outcome (odds ratio 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60–0.98; p = 0.032) compared with the high F₂/suctioning group. In addition, the P/F ratio in the low F₂/no suctioning group was significantly higher, with an estimated mean difference of 4.72 kPa (95% CI, 4.12–5.32; p < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS:

Extubation with a low-inspired oxygen fraction and without suctioning appears safe and may improve patient-relevant outcomes. Further research is necessary to optimize F 2 settings and secretion management during extubation in critically ill patients.

### Effects of preoxygenation with intratracheal suctioning during extubation: an alternating cluster-controlled trial (INtratracheal suctioning and oxygenation AT extubation [INNOVATE]) [^114Fmsfa]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Extubation is a critical event for patients in the ICU. Preoxygenation and intratracheal suctioning during extubation may contribute to atelectasis. However, evidence concerning extubation procedures and their impact on patient outcomes is limited. This study aimed to compare two extubation strategies: one using preoxygenation with 100% Fio₂ combined with intratracheal suctioning, and the other using a low Fio2 (35%) without suctioning.

Design

A single-center, alternating cluster-controlled trial.

Setting

Tertiary level interdisciplinary adult ICU.

Patients

A total of 3,675 patients were randomized into two groups: 1) Fio₂ 100% with suctioning (n = 1,877, 51.1%) and 2) Fio₂ 35% without suctioning (n = 1,798, 48.9%).

Interventions

Comparison of two extubation strategies: Fio₂ 100% with suctioning vs. Fio₂ 35% without suctioning.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcome was a composite of reintubation and/or noninvasive ventilation within 48 hours after extubation. Secondary outcomes included the components of the primary endpoint, the need for nasal high-flow oxygenation or changes in the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P/F ratio) after extubation. Differences in outcomes were assessed via adjusted logistic or linear regression models. The low Fio₂/no suctioning strategy resulted in a 23% reduction in the primary outcome (odds ratio 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60–0.98; p = 0.032) compared with the high Fio₂/suctioning group. In addition, the P/F ratio in the low Fio2/no suctioning group was significantly higher, with an estimated mean difference of 4.72 kPa (95% CI, 4.12–5.32; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Extubation with a low-inspired oxygen fraction and without suctioning appears safe and may improve patient-relevant outcomes. Further research is necessary to optimize Fio2 settings and secretion management during extubation in critically ill patients.

DISCUSSION

In this large single-center study, we demonstrated that in intubated patients in the ICU, an extubation strategy with a lower F 2 target and without suctioning resulted in a lower number of patients with extubation failure, defined as reintubation or the need for NIV within 48 h after extubation. The intervention showed a risk reduction for the primary outcome, though the individual components didn't reach statistical significance (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, fewer patients needed high-flow therapy or the composite endpoint of a high flow, NIV, and reintubation in the lower F₂ group without suction.

The intervention modified two aspects of the previous extubation strategy. First, a lower F₂ concentration was used. Although a high F 2 may theoretically increase the time until desaturation when emergency reintubation is needed, it can reduce the functional residual capacity through the promotion of adsorption atelectasis. Benoit et al demonstrated a higher prevalence of absorption atelectasis with a high F 2 before extubation in a small cohort of 30 patients. N₂, which accounts for almost 80% of ambient air, is not actively resorbed into the bloodstream and prevents adsorption atelectasis. In cases of a high F₂, the entire alveolar gas is absorbed, and atelectasis occurs. Second, suctioning was not used during extubation. Suction may be important in removing secretions that may otherwise impair the airway. On the other hand, removing the tracheal tube with continuous suction may be associated with the occurrence of atelectasis. Recently, positive pressure during extubation has been tested in patients who are under anesthesia and in critically ill patients. In all these studies, which included between 69 and 725 patients and assessed safety outcomes or complications, no significant differences were found, but the results revealed a trend favoring the positive pressure groups. A recent randomized trial involving 70 patients revealed via lung ultrasound improved lung aeration while using a positive pressure extubation strategy.

Evidence.

Weaning and spontaneous breathing trials.

A meta-analysis of 10 randomized control trials including 3,165 patients showed no significant difference in the successful extubation, reintubation rate, ICU mortality, and ICU length of stay between spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) using low levels of pressure support and a T-piece. Three well-performed trials in resource-rich ICUs clearly showed benefit from early SBTs. – However, because of much aerosol generating from a T-piece trial, a low-level pressure support is the preferred method for SBTs in COVID-19 patients. Anecdotal evidence demonstrated longer intubation periods, higher volume of secretions, and airway edema in mechanical ventilated COVID-19 patients, all of these factors increase the risk of post-extubation respiratory failure. Therefore, we suggest a higher degree of readiness for weaning and direct supplementation of low-flow oxygen after extubation in COVID-19 patients.

Extubation.

The consensus statement published by an "Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society"and the "Difficult Airway Society, the Association of Anesthetists the Intensive Care Society, the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine and the Royal College of Anesthetists", and two additional opinions, suggest that safe, simple, familiar, reliable, and robust practices should be adopted for all episodes of airway management for patients with COVID-19. Staff members should wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during extubation. Efforts should be made to minimize coughing and exposure to infected secretions at extubation time by previous suctioning of secretions. Before extubation, all necessary equipment should be checked. A regular surgical mask should then be placed on the patient's chin, and nasal prongs with low-flow oxygen should be applied after extubation. After extubation, ensure the patient immediately wears a face mask and their oxygen mask or nasal cannula, when practical. When available, a high-flow nasal cannula or NIV should be used after extubation to prevent reintubation. Information on tracheostomy is available in another article.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of adult patients with tracheostomy in the acute care setting [^117Qf4QD]. Respiratory Care (2021). High credibility.

Adult tracheostomy management in the acute care setting — evidence from multiple observational studies of low to moderate quality indicates that tracheostomy bundles, a multidisciplinary tracheostomy team, and tracheostomy weaning and decannulation protocols can reduce time to decannulation in tracheostomized adult patients, and the use of tracheostomy weaning and decannulation protocols can decrease the time to decannulation, with reports of successful decannulation even among patients usually deemed difficult or impossible to wean after implementation of protocols. There is some evidence that a multidisciplinary tracheostomy team can reduce length of stay (LOS) and tracheostomy-related complications, but there is insufficient evidence regarding the effect of weaning and decannulation protocols on these outcomes, and there is also insufficient evidence regarding the effect of tracheostomy teams and weaning/decannulation protocols on tracheostomy-related cost. Clinical outcomes may vary by underlying disease process, as studies have noted that intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital LOS, time to decannulation, and time to oral intake commencement may vary based on underlying disease processes, and there is strong evidence that protocols in liberating patients from mechanical ventilation reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation. More rigorously designed studies are needed to inform clinical decision-making in the care of tracheostomized adult patients in the acute care setting.

### Effect of early vs late tracheostomy placement on survival in patients receiving mechanical ventilation: the tracMan randomized trial [^113yH9tF]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Tracheostomy is a widely used intervention in adult critical care units. There is little evidence to guide clinicians regarding the optimal timing for this procedure.

Objective

To test whether early vs late tracheostomy would be associated with lower mortality in adult patients requiring mechanical ventilation in critical care units.

Design and Setting

An open multicentered randomized clinical trial conducted between 2004 and 2011 involving 70 adult general and 2 cardiothoracic critical care units in 13 university and 59 nonuniversity hospitals in the United Kingdom.

Participants

Of 1032 eligible patients, 909 adult patients breathing with the aid of mechanical ventilation for less than 4 days and identified by the treating physician as likely to require at least 7 more days of mechanical ventilation.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1 to early tracheostomy (within 4 days) or late tracheostomy (after 10 days if still indicated).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality and the analysis was by intention to treat.

Results

Of the 455 patients assigned to early tracheostomy, 91.9% (95% CI, 89.0%-94.1%) received a tracheostomy and of 454 assigned to late tracheostomy, 44.9% (95% CI, 40.4%-49.5%) received a tracheostomy. All-cause mortality 30 days after randomization was 30.8% (95% CI, 26.7%-35.2%) in the early and 31.5% (95% CI, 27.3%-35.9%) in the late group (absolute risk reduction for early vs late, 0.7%; 95% CI, -5.4% to 6.7%). Two-year mortality was 51.0% (95% CI, 46.4%-55.6%) in the early and 53.7% (95% CI, 49.1%-58.3%) in the late group (P = 0.74). Median critical care unit length of stay in survivors was 13.0 days in the early and 13.1 days in the late group (P = 0.74). Tracheostomy-related complications were reported for 6.3% (95% CI, 4.6%-8.5%) of patients (5.5% in the early group, 7.8% in the late group).

Conclusions and Relevance

For patients breathing with the aid of mechanical ventilation treated in adult critical care units in the United Kingdom, tracheostomy within 4 days of critical care admission was not associated with an improvement in 30-day mortality or other important secondary outcomes. The ability of clinicians to predict which patients required extended ventilatory support was limited.

### Effect of high-flow oxygen versus T-piece ventilation strategies during spontaneous breathing trials on weaning failure among patients receiving mechanical ventilation: a randomized controlled trial [^114DGmbC]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is used widely to determine whether a patient is ready for extubation and liberation from mechanical ventilation. Because both premature and delayed extubation are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, timely liberation from mechanical ventilation is crucial in critically ill patients. The most common strategies used during SBT are T-piece ventilation and low-pressure support ventilation (PSV). One systematic review of studies that compared different methods for SBT found that T-piece ventilation seems to reflect more accurately the physiological conditions after extubation, whereas PSV reduces respiratory effort compared with T-piece ventilation. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) found that the use of a shorter, less demanding SBT strategy led to significantly higher rates of successful extubation. However, although the latest guideline suggests the initial SBT be conducted with low PSV based on limited data, choosing the best ventilation strategies during SBT remains a challenging task.

High-flow oxygen therapy offers several physiological advantages and may lead to improved comfort and clinical outcomes in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. High-flow oxygen therapy is used increasingly for several indications in critically ill patients, including de novo hypoxemic respiratory failure, postextubation, postoperative respiratory failure, and palliative care. Based on the results of RCTs, use of prophylactic high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and/or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) after extubation is now used widely and is considered as the first-line prophylactic respiratory support option in patients at risk for reintubation. However, there is limited evidence on the efficacy and safety of the high-flow oxygen ventilation strategy during SBT. Moreover, the physiological effects of high-flow oxygen therapy via tracheostomy (HFOT TRACHEAL) are lower than HFNC, likely because the tracheostomy connection interface is completely open system. To date, only one recent pilot RCT of patients at high risk of weaning failure showed that the high-flow oxygen SBT neither increased the reintubation rate nor accelerated mechanical ventilation weaning compared with T-piece SBT.

In this study, we hypothesized that the high-flow oxygen ventilation strategy during SBT might reduce the rate of weaning failure compared with T-piece ventilation during SBT. Here, we investigated the effect of high-flow oxygen versus T-piece ventilation strategies during SBT on rates of weaning failure among patients receiving mechanical ventilation.

### Effects of preoxygenation with intratracheal suctioning during extubation: an alternating cluster-controlled trial (INtratracheal suctioning and oxygenation AT extubation [INNOVATE]) [^1171WyWm]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Ethical Approval

The protocol was submitted to the ethical committee of the canton of Bern, Switzerland (project ID 2018–00446, project title Innovate-Intratracheal suctioning and oxygenation at extubation, decision letter dated July 5, 2018). The committee granted a waiver of informed consent due to the cluster design and the absence of an internationally agreed-upon procedural standard. As such, procedures were followed in accordance with the ethical standards of the regional ethics committee and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. The trial was registered on March 9, 2018 at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03468036). After the ethics committee granted the waiver, the registration was no longer updated.

Study Design and Participants

The study was performed as an alternating cluster-controlled trial from October 2019 to December 2021 at the Department of Intensive Care Medicine at the Inselspital, the University Hospital of Bern in Switzerland. This 28-bed department is the only provider of adult intensive care in the hospital. The clusters were designed to last for three months per extubation strategy, with the cluster sequence described in Supplementary Table 1. From March to April 2020, the study was interrupted because of the first COVID-19 wave in Switzerland, when hospital and university regulations prohibited active research. All intubated adult patients were eligible, unless tracheotomized, or treated with palliative care (i.e. patients with a do-not-reintubate order). Only the first intubation was considered during a single ICU admission.

Exposures

Before the trial, the standard of care for extubation at this center was a preoxygenation period of 10 min with a F 2 of 100%. Patients were disconnected from the ventilator and no manual ventilation was used during the extubation. The endotracheal tube was then removed under active suctioning with a curved suction catheter (Dahlhausen Medizintechnik, Germany; 12 Charrière; L 60 cm). Trained ICU nurses performed extubation after conferring with the treating physician. No closed suction systems were used.

The intervention tested in the trial was an adapted extubation procedure. Patients received 35% F₂ for 10 ± 3 min without preoxygenation. After disconnecting from the ventilator, the endotracheal tube was then removed without intratracheal suction. Other aspects of invasive mechanical ventilation, sedation, and postextubation care were left to the discretion of the treating physician and unit protocols. All patients followed a standardized weaning protocol during their time on mechanical ventilation.

### Effect of postextubation high-flow nasal cannula vs conventional oxygen therapy on reintubation in low-risk patients: a randomized clinical trial [^1149joDE]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Studies of mechanically ventilated critically ill patients that combine populations that are at high and low risk for reintubation suggest that conditioned high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy after extubation improves oxygenation compared with conventional oxygen therapy. However, conclusive data about reintubation are lacking.

Objective

To determine whether high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy is superior to conventional oxygen therapy for preventing reintubation in mechanically ventilated patients at low risk for reintubation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted between September 2012 and October 2014 in 7 intensive care units (ICUs) in Spain. Participants were 527 adult critical patients at low risk for reintubation who fulfilled criteria for planned extubation. Low risk for reintubation was defined as younger than 65 years; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score less than 12 on day of extubation; body mass index less than 30; adequate secretions management; simple weaning; 0 or 1 comorbidity; and absence of heart failure, moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, airway patency problems, and prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to undergo either high-flow or conventional oxygen therapy for 24 hours after extubation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was reintubation within 72 hours, compared with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel χ² test. Secondary outcomes included postextubation respiratory failure, respiratory infection, sepsis and multiorgan failure, ICU and hospital length of stay and mortality, adverse events, and time to reintubation.

Results

Of 527 patients (mean age, 51 years [range, 18–64]; 62% men), 264 received high-flow therapy and 263 conventional oxygen therapy. Reintubation within 72 hours was less common in the high-flow group (13 patients [4.9%] vs 32 [12.2%] in the conventional group; absolute difference, 7.2% [95% CI, 2.5% to 12.2%]; P = 0.004). Postextubation respiratory failure was less common in the high-flow group (22/264 patients [8.3%] vs 38/263 [14.4%] in the conventional group; absolute difference, 6.1% [95% CI, 0.7% to 11.6%]; P = 0.03). Time to reintubation was not significantly different between groups (19 hours [interquartile range, 12–28] in the high-flow group vs 15 hours [interquartile range, 9–31] in the conventional group; absolute difference, -4 [95% CI, -54 to 46]; P = 0.66]. No adverse effects were reported.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among extubated patients at low risk for reintubation, the use of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen compared with conventional oxygen therapy reduced the risk of reintubation within 72 hours.

### Use of tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic: American College of Chest Physicians / American association for bronchology and interventional pulmonology / association of interventional pulmonology program directors expert panel report [^114WAwpe]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Tracheostomy during COVID-19 — postprocedural care and aerosol-minimizing measures include use of enhanced PPE with the least number of HCWs present, and, if available, single-use disposable equipment should be used; whenever possible, the patient should maintain a closed circuit at all times regardless of mechanical ventilation requirements, and if no longer requiring mechanical ventilation but not ready for capping trials, a closed circuit can be fashioned using a heat moisture exchanger with viral filter and in-line suction to minimize aerosol generation; heat moisture exchanger filters on tracheal masks increase the resistance of the flow and may get clogged; inner cannulas should be changed on an as-needed basis rather than a scheduled routine; tracheostomy tube changes can potentially be delayed until the patient tests negative for COVID-19, unless there is a clinical reason to proceed earlier; when using inhaled therapies, if the patient is on mechanical ventilation, an in-line nebulizer is preferred and if decannulated, a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer is recommended; institutions have developed local guidance for when patients with COVID-19 can be cleared to move to a non-NP room (can be two negative nasopharyngeal swabs vs a negative nasopharyngeal swab and a negative tracheal aspirate); for decannulation, a rapid protocol is recommended to minimize aerosol generation; if the patient can tolerate their initial tracheostomy tube with the cuff deflated and either a speaking valve or a capping trial, then minimizing tracheostomy tube changes is advised; if a larger tracheostomy tube has been placed, HCWs could try to minimize the number of tracheostomy tube changes and expedite a decannulation protocol as safe; typically, these patients are discharged to a long-term acute care facility; however, some long-term acute care facilities may not accept a patient with a tracheostomy tube prior to the first tracheostomy tube change and may require conversion to negative COVID-19 testing.

Standardized tracheostomy tube capping and de-cannulation algorithm

Capping was defined as successful if there was no oxygen desaturation, if the oxygen requirement had not increased to 40% FiO₂ or higher, or if the cap or plug had not been removed for any reason, such as suctioning, desaturation, shortness of breath, or hemodynamic instability. If the patient did not tolerate capping, the trial was aborted, the RCP and attending physician were notified, and the capping trial was restarted the following day using the conservative approach discussed above. If the patient passed the capping trial, the result was shared with attending physician for decision whether to proceed de-cannulation. The tracheostomy tube was removed and the stoma was covered with a sterile gauze ball and Primapore dressing. Following de-cannulation, the patients were monitored with continuous pulse oximetry for at least 24 h.

### Early versus late tracheostomy in critically ill COVID-19 patients [^11617XfC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of early tracheostomy as an intervention for critically ill COVID-19 patients is unclear. Previous reports have described prolonged intensive care stays and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation in critically ill COVID-19 patients, particularly in those developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pre-pandemic evidence on the benefits of early tracheostomy is conflicting but suggests shorter hospital stays and lower mortality rates compared to late tracheostomy.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of early tracheostomy compared to late tracheostomy in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, which comprises CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and medRxiv, as well as Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index) and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions. We conducted the searches on 14 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSI) evaluating early tracheostomy compared to late tracheostomy during SARS-CoV-2 infection in critically ill adults irrespective of gender, ethnicity, or setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs and the ROBINS-I tool for NRSIs. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for outcomes of our prioritized categories: mortality, clinical status, and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. As the timing of tracheostomy was very heterogeneous among the included studies, we applied GRADE only to studies that defined early tracheostomy as 10 days or less, which was chosen according to clinical relevance.

Main Results

We included one RCT with 150 participants diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 24 NRSIs with 6372 participants diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. All participants were admitted to the ICU, orally intubated and mechanically ventilated. The RCT was a multicenter, parallel, single-blinded study conducted in Sweden. Of the 24 NRSIs, which were mostly conducted in high- and middle-income countries, eight had a prospective design and 16 a retrospective design. We did not find any ongoing studies. RCT-based evidence We judged risk of bias for the RCT to be of low or some concerns regarding randomization and measurement of the outcome. Early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in overall mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.29; RD 67 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 178 fewer to 108 more; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). As an indicator of improvement of clinical status, early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation (MD 1.50 days fewer, 95%, CI 5.74 days fewer to 2.74 days more; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). As an indicator of worsening clinical status, early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in the incidence of adverse events of any grade (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.13; RD 47 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 164 fewer to 102 more; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence); little to no difference in the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.23 to 5.20; RD 3 more per 1000, 95% CI 30 fewer to 162 more; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported need for renal replacement therapy. Early tracheostomy may result in little benefit to no difference in ICU length of stay (MD 0.5 days fewer, 95% CI 5.34 days fewer to 4.34 days more; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). NRSI-based evidence We considered risk of bias for NRSIs to be critical because of possible confounding, study participant enrollment into the studies, intervention classification and potentially systematic errors in the measurement of outcomes. We are uncertain whether early tracheostomy (≤ 10 days) increases or decreases overall mortality (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.43 to 5.00; RD 143 more per 1000, 95% CI 174 less to 1218 more; I² = 79%; 2 studies, 719 participants) or duration to liberation from mechanical ventilation (MD 1.98 days fewer, 95% CI 0.16 days fewer to 4.12 more; 1 study, 50 participants), because we graded the certainty of evidence as very low. Three NRSIs reported ICU length of stay for 519 patients with early tracheostomy (≤ 10 days) as a median value, which we could not include in the meta-analyses. We are uncertain whether early tracheostomy (≤ 10 days) increases or decreases the ICU length of stay, because we graded the certainty of evidence as very low.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-certainty evidence that early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in overall mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation compared with late tracheostomy. In terms of clinical improvement, early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in duration to liberation from mechanical ventilation compared with late tracheostomy. We are not certain about the impact of early tracheostomy on clinical worsening in terms of the incidence of adverse events, need for renal replacement therapy, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or the length of stay in the ICU. Future RCTs should provide additional data on the benefits and harms of early tracheostomy for defined main outcomes of COVID-19 research, as well as of comparable diseases, especially for different population subgroups to reduce clinical heterogeneity, and report a longer observation period. Then it would be possible to draw conclusions regarding which patient groups might benefit from early intervention. Furthermore, validated scoring systems for more accurate predictions of the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation should be developed and used in new RCTs to ensure safer indication and patient safety. High-quality (prospectively registered) NRSIs should be conducted in the future to provide valuable answers to clinical questions. This could enable us to draw more reliable conclusions about the potential benefits and harms of early tracheostomy in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

### Early versus late tracheostomy in people with multiple trauma [^113X2Fz2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

According to TraumaRegister DGU (the trauma registry of the German Trauma Society), 83% of trauma patients are admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), with 34.8% receiving mechanical ventilation. However, specific data for people with multiple trauma are lacking. Prolonged ventilation due to acute respiratory failure or difficult weaning are common indications for tracheostomy in critically ill people. Despite numerous studies, the optimal timing for tracheostomy remains unclear. This review was initiated during the development of the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF) S3 guideline 'Intensivmedizin nach Polytrauma' (intensive care after multiple trauma) to systematically assess the effects of early versus late tracheostomy in people with multiple trauma in the ICU.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of early tracheostomy compared with late tracheostomy in adults with multiple trauma in the intensive care unit.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP from inception to 15 March 2024 without language restrictions. We also screened reference lists and contacted experts in the field.

Eligibility Criteria

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) comparing early and late tracheostomy, defined according to any cutoff time point, in critically ill adults with multiple trauma, irrespective of sex, ethnicity, disease severity, or setting. We excluded studies published as abstract only, studies recruiting people with only one type of trauma, and studies recruiting people who needed immediate tracheostomy.

Outcomes

The critical outcome was all-cause mortality. Important outcomes included duration of stay (ICU or hospital), quality of life, pulmonary complications, adverse events, and time from tracheostomy to decannulation.

Risk Of Bias

We used Cochrane risk of bias tools (RoB 2 for RCTs and ROBINS-I for NRSIs) to assess risk of bias at the outcome level.

Synthesis Methods

Our meta-analyses used a random-effects model. Our main comparison was early tracheostomy (< 10 days) versus late tracheostomy (≥ 10 days) after intubation. Because the timing of early tracheostomy varied considerably across studies, we explored the impact of different timings in subgroup analyses. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

Included Studies

We included one RCT (60 participants) and 22 NRSIs (44,811 participants). The RCT was a single-centre, parallel-group trial conducted in the USA over 38 months. It was halted prematurely after the first interim analysis. Most NRSIs (91%) were retrospective. Six studies, including the RCT, specifically addressed our main comparison (< 10 days vs ≥ 10 days).

Synthesis Of Results

Evidence from the RCT (60 participants) suggested that early tracheostomy (< 10 days) compared with late tracheostomy (≥ 10 days) may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 2.03; very low-certainty evidence), ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD) -0.30 days, 95% CI -17.64 to 17.04; very low-certainty evidence), or rate of pneumonia (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.22; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence for all three outcomes is very uncertain. No data were available for quality of life, adverse events, or time from tracheostomy to decannulation. NRSI data suggested that early tracheostomy compared with late tracheostomy may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.88) or rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia (unadjusted RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.56). One NRSI with adjusted data suggested that early tracheostomy may reduce ICU length of stay (1/HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.71), while unadjusted data from two NRSIs suggested that early tracheostomy may increase in-hospital mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.36; odds ratio (OR) 1.22, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.41). The evidence for all these outcomes was very uncertain. The certainty of the evidence was consistently rated as very low across outcomes. The most common reason for downgrading was imprecision, due to small sample sizes, wide CIs including both benefit and harm, and analyses including data from only one study. In NRSIs, additional downgrades were due to serious risk of bias, particularly related to potential confounding and unclear adjustment for baseline differences. We identified one ongoing trial.

Authors' Conclusions

Early tracheostomy (< 10 days after intubation) may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality, ICU length of stay, or rate of pneumonia compared with late tracheostomy (≥ 10 days), but the evidence is very uncertain. No data were available on quality of life, adverse events, or time from tracheostomy to decannulation. Adjusted NRSI data suggest that early tracheostomy may reduce ICU length of stay, but the evidence is very uncertain. Given the limited RCT data and the heterogeneity of NRSIs, future research should focus on standardising definitions of multiple trauma and timing of tracheostomy, while also addressing equity by including diverse populations and settings. More high-quality studies are needed to confirm possible benefits of early tracheostomy, with particular attention to adjusted analyses and outcomes such as mortality, ICU length of stay, and pulmonary complications. Further studies should also explore the long-term effects of tracheostomy on survival, quality of life, and functional outcomes to guide evidence-based clinical decision-making in multiple trauma care.

This approach integrates high‐acuity treatments such as intravenous medications, oxygen therapy, and continuous monitoring along with telehealth and wearable device monitoring. The "Hospital at Home" model saw earlier adoption in the United Kingdom and Australia to alleviate hospital demand, whereas in the United States, its expansion was catalyzed by the COVID‐19 pandemic, which accelerated regulatory support and reimbursement options for home‐based acute care. The hospital discharge data are consistent with previously published Australian data. Hospital survival of 13% for this cohort compares favorably with previous studies reporting mortality of 13% to 19%.,

The GTC has collaborated with more than 70 hospitals across multiple countries, including in‐depth studies on the patient journey. In the United Kingdom, patients with new tracheostomies are typically managed within a single hospital system for their entire inpatient stay. This "one‐stop" approach likely contributes to a higher rate of primary hospital decannulation compared to countries where patients are often transferred to another facility for ongoing rehabilitation with the tracheostomy still in place. When tracheostomies are performed to assist with ventilator weaning in critically ill patients, a higher mortality rate is anticipated. Therefore, death with a tracheostomy still in place leads to a shorter hospital length of stay and a classification of non‐decannulated status, given that many do not recover enough to attempt decannulation. Further data collection is necessary to understand the implications of these differences in healthcare systems, particularly how variations in tracheostomy management pathways impact decannulation success, hospital resource utilization, and long‐term patient outcomes.

### Determinants of tracheostomy decannulation: an international survey [^117W6m5r]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tracheostomy is probably the most common surgical procedure performed on critically ill patients. Approximately 10% of mechanically ventilated critically ill patients receive a tracheostomy to facilitate prolonged airway and ventilatory support. The recent development of percutaneous dilational tracheostomy techniques has made tracheostomy a routine procedure commonly performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit (ICU). Prolonged tracheostomy tube placement may expose patients to an increased risk of late complications, including tracheal stenoses, bleeding, fistulas, infections, and aspiration. Psychological implications are profound with patients experiencing reduced body image perceptions and life satisfaction. Removing a tracheostomy is a fundamental step in rehabilitating a patient recovering from critical illness.

The frequency of tracheostomy in the management of patients receiving mechanical ventilation contrasts with the lack of evidence as to when a tracheostomy tube should be removed. It appears that the majority of critically ill tracheostomized patients who survive to ICU discharge can eventually be successfully decannulated. Limited uncontrolled pilot studies and expert guidelines have proposed that decannulation be considered in patients once respiratory mechanics are adequate, mechanical ventilation is no longer needed, upper airway obstruction is resolved, airway secretions are controlled, and swallowing has been evaluated. It is unclear to what extent these publications guide clinician decision-making. To complicate matters, the long-term management of tracheostomized patients often is fragmented between different health care settings and providers because recovery from critical illness takes months. Consequently, the clinicians faced with the decision whether or when to decannulate a tracheostomized patient are often not the same physicians who inserted the tracheostomy and may have limited experience with such patients. Since little is known about how clinicians make decisions to decannulate tracheostomized patients, we conducted a survey to determine the factors clinicians consider to be important in recommending decannulation and to ascertain their opinions regarding the definition of decannnulation failure.

Discussion

Our study was designed to examine tracheostomy decannulation opinions at major centers around the world. The results demonstrate three major findings. First, clinicians are able to identify patient factors that they believe are important in the decision to decannulate a tracheostomized patient. Second, there is significant variability in clinicians' decannulation opinions. Third, clinicians are able to define decannulation failure and identify what they believe are acceptable rates of failure.

Clinicians are able to identify patient factors that they believe are important in the decision to decannulate a tracheostomized patient. However, there is significant variability in clinicians' opinions. For example, decannulation recommendations varied between physicians and respiratory therapists as well as between clinicians who worked at acute facilities and those who worked at chronic care facilities. Our results are consistent with a growing body of scientific literature suggesting that factors idiosyncratic to health care providers are major determinants of the medical decisions and care that patients receive. Tracheostomy care, therefore, is likely to vary significantly depending on the individual clinician responsible for a patient's care. Our findings highlight the need for clinical studies in tracheostomy care to guide clinical decision-making. Clinicians indicated in our survey that, in determining whether to decannulate a tracheostomized patient, the patient's level of consciousness, ability to tolerate tracheostomy capping, cough effectiveness, secretions, and oxygenation needed to be evaluated. Although the ability to tolerate tracheostomy capping was judged to be an important determinant of tracheostomy decannulation, it did not influence clinicians' recommendations in the clinical scenarios. Previous studies and guidelines have also suggested that maximal expiratory pressure, peak cough flows, arterial blood gases, and upper airway endoscopy may be useful in the decannulation decision-making process, although these factors require special equipment and expertise and are more complicated than the simple bedside criteria employed in our study. We propose that a patient's level of consciousness, cough effectiveness, secretions, and oxygenation be tested in a clinical trial as four simple bedside factors to consider in determining whether to decannulate a tracheostomized patient.

### Cough augmentation techniques for extubation or weaning critically ill patients from mechanical ventilation [^113WtNgv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There are various reasons why weaning and extubation failure occur, but ineffective cough and secretion retention can play a significant role. Cough augmentation techniques, such as lung volume recruitment or manually- and mechanically-assisted cough, are used to prevent and manage respiratory complications associated with chronic conditions, particularly neuromuscular disease, and may improve short- and long-term outcomes for people with acute respiratory failure. However, the role of cough augmentation to facilitate extubation and prevent post-extubation respiratory failure is unclear.

Objectives

Our primary objective was to determine extubation success using cough augmentation techniques compared to no cough augmentation for critically-ill adults and children with acute respiratory failure admitted to a high-intensity care setting capable of managing mechanically-ventilated people (such as an intensive care unit, specialized weaning centre, respiratory intermediate care unit, or high-dependency unit). Secondary objectives were to determine the effect of cough augmentation techniques on reintubation, weaning success, mechanical ventilation and weaning duration, length of stay (high-intensity care setting and hospital), pneumonia, tracheostomy placement and tracheostomy decannulation, and mortality (high-intensity care setting, hospital, and after hospital discharge). We evaluated harms associated with use of cough augmentation techniques when applied via an artificial airway (or non-invasive mask once extubated/decannulated), including haemodynamic compromise, arrhythmias, pneumothorax, haemoptysis, and mucus plugging requiring airway change and the type of person (such as those with neuromuscular disorders or weakness and spinal cord injury) for whom these techniques may be efficacious.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 4, 2016), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to April 2016), Embase (OvidSP) (1980 to April 2016), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (1982 to April 2016), and ISI Web of Science and Conference Proceedings. We searched the PROSPERO and Joanna Briggs Institute databases, websites of relevant professional societies, and conference abstracts from five professional society annual congresses (2011 to 2015). We did not impose language or other restrictions. We performed a citation search using PubMed and examined reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. We contacted corresponding authors for details of additional published or unpublished work. We searched for unpublished studies and ongoing trials on the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch) (April 2016).

Selection Criteria

We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that evaluated cough augmentation compared to a control group without this intervention. We included non-randomized studies for assessment of harms. We included studies of adults and of children aged four weeks or older, receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in a high-intensity care setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts identified by our search methods. Two review authors independently evaluated full-text versions, independently extracted data and assessed risks of bias.

Main Results

We screened 2686 citations and included two trials enrolling 95 participants and one cohort study enrolling 17 participants. We assessed one randomized controlled trial as being at unclear risk of bias, and the other at high risk of bias; we assessed the non-randomized study as being at high risk of bias. We were unable to pool data due to the small number of studies meeting our inclusion criteria and therefore present narrative results rather than meta-analyses. One trial of 75 participants reported that extubation success (defined as no need for reintubation within 48 hours) was higher in the mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) group (82.9% versus 52.5%, P < 0.05) (risk ratio (RR) 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 2.20, very low-quality evidence). No study reported weaning success or reintubation as distinct from extubation success. One trial reported a statistically significant reduction in mechanical ventilation duration favouring MI-E (mean difference -6.1 days, 95% CI -8.4 to -3.8, very low-quality evidence). One trial reported mortality, with no participant dying in either study group. Adverse events (reported by two trials) included one participant receiving the MI-E protocol experiencing haemodynamic compromise. Nine (22.5%) of the control group compared to two (6%) MI-E participants experienced secretion encumbrance with severe hypoxaemia requiring reintubation (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.10). In the lung volume recruitment trial, one participant experienced an elevated blood pressure for more than 30 minutes. No participant experienced new-onset arrhythmias, heart rate increased by more than 25%, or a pneumothorax. For outcomes assessed using GRADE, we based our downgrading decisions on unclear risk of bias, inability to assess consistency or publication bias, and uncertainty about the estimate of effect due to the limited number of studies contributing outcome data.

Authors' Conclusions

The overall quality of evidence on the efficacy of cough augmentation techniques for critically-ill people is very low. Cough augmentation techniques when used in mechanically-ventilated critically-ill people appear to result in few adverse events.

### Tracheostomy and weaning [^114Y3JBT]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

No hypothesis relating to respiratory care in the intensive care unit has proved more difficult to study in an objective fashion than the commonly held belief that tracheostomy hastens weaning from ventilatory support. Tracheostomy might facilitate weaning by reducing dead space and decreasing airway resistance, by improving secretion clearance, by reducing the need for sedation, and by decreasing the risk of aspiration. Available evidence indicates that dead space and airway resistance are in fact reduced, although whether the magnitude of these reductions explains the clinical observation of more rapid weaning after tracheotomy is less certain. Most of the data on this subject come from laboratory experiments and short-term physiologic studies on clinically stable patients, and the available evidence from clinical trials with weaning as a primary end point is scant. One large multicenter trial showed no advantage to early tracheotomy but demonstrated how difficult it is to get clinicians to manage their patients with regimens that go against their strongly held opinions. The most recent clinical trial found that percutaneous dilational tracheotomy performed in the first 2 days in patients projected to need > 14 days of ventilatory support greatly reduced ventilator and intensive care unit days, and decreased both the incidence of pneumonia and overall mortality, in comparison with tracheostomy done after day 14. Conducting such trials is difficult because of investigator and clinician bias, the inability to predict which patients will actually require prolonged mechanical ventilation, and several other factors discussed in this article. Tracheotomy probably does aid in liberating some patients from ventilatory support, but this may be as much from its effect on clinician behavior as from any physiologic impact.

Tracheostomy during COVID-19 — team composition and ventilator circuit guidance state We recommend that in patients with COVID-19 related respiratory failure, tracheostomy is performed by a team consisting of the least number of providers with the highest level of experience (Strong Consensus). Remarks: We suggest that prior to the initiation of tracheostomy, a multidisciplinary group of providers including the primary critical care team, palliative care, infectious disease, the procedural and airway team utilize respective expertise to determine the goals of care, patient selection, procedural considerations, as well as workflow to optimize safety of both patient and HCW (Strong Consensus). We suggest that patients be maintained with a closed circuit while on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and with in-line suction (Strong Consensus).

### A core outcome set for critical care ventilation trials [^11256gVN]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

This COS defines randomization as the measurement start point for the time-related outcomes, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of stay. Participants considered randomization a more reliable start point as it marks commencing delivery of the experimental or control intervention to modify an outcome. However, for research designs where randomization does not signal commencement of intervention delivery, the COS recommends that alternative start point should be clearly justified and defined.

The recommended endpoint for extubation and duration of mechanical ventilation is defined as "successful extubation" and "unassisted breathing", respectively, at 48 hours. A previous round table conference on weaning defined 48 hours as the time-point measure of success, but this is now more than 10 years old. In the light of newer practices incorporating noninvasive ventilation as a weaning strategy or to treat post extubation respiratory distress, arguably identification of success of extubation should be at a more distal time-point. However, although there is no evidence for adopting the 48-hour period to define success, in the current study, participant expert opinion upheld 48 hours because any subsequent need for intubation and ventilation would likely be related to a new clinical event. Additionally, the endpoint for duration of mechanical ventilation, "unassisted breathing", is defined as a patient being free from invasive ventilation, including extracorporeal lung support and noninvasive ventilation delivering volume or pressure support. Although we recognize that continuous positive airway pressure and high-flow oxygen therapy may not be truly "unassisted", these modes of ventilation were excluded from the definition of assisted breathing. Further, high-flow oxygen therapy devices technically only modify percentage of oxygen delivery and rate of gas flow rather than assisted support as provided by the other forms of mechanical ventilation.

### Effect of high-flow oxygen therapy vs conventional oxygen therapy on invasive mechanical ventilation and clinical recovery in patients with severe COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial [^1118FZXG]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study HiFlo-COVID was published by Gustavo A Ospina-Tascón and colleagues in 2021 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection and Hypoxemic respiratory failure. In the HiFlo-COVID study, the trial question was: is high-flow oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula superior to conventional oxygen therapy in patients with severe COVID-19? In the HiFlo-COVID study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the HiFlo-COVID study, the population was: 199 patients (65 female, 134 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with respiratory distress and a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to FiO₂ < 200 due to COVID-19. The key exclusion criteria were indication for immediate orotracheal intubation, pregnancy, chronic liver disease, active bacterial or fungal infection, history of COPD. In the HiFlo-COVID study, the interventions were: n = 99 high-flow oxygen therapy (breathing support with high-flow oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula) n = 100 conventional oxygen therapy (oxygen therapy by conventional nasal cannula/prongs, venturi mask, or mask with reservoir). In the HiFlo-COVID study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the rate of intubation within 28 days (34.3% vs. 51%; HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.96). In the HiFlo-COVID study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the rate of clinical recovery within 28 days (77.8% vs. 71%; HR 1.39, 95% CI 1 to 1.92) Significant increase in ventilator-free days at day 28 (28 days vs. 24 days; OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.64) No significant difference in death at day 28 (8.1% vs. 16%; HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.16). In the HiFlo-COVID study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in suspected bacterial pneumonia, bacteremia. In the HiFlo-COVID study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with respiratory distress and a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to FiO2 < 200 due to COVID-19, high-flow oxygen therapy was superior to conventional oxygen therapy with respect to the rate of intubation within 28 days.

### Effect of high-flow oxygen therapy vs conventional oxygen therapy on invasive mechanical ventilation and clinical recovery in patients with severe COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial [^117MevNY]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The effect of high-flow oxygen therapy vs conventional oxygen therapy has not been established in the setting of severe COVID-19.

Objective

To determine the effect of high-flow oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula compared with conventional oxygen therapy on need for endotracheal intubation and clinical recovery in severe COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted in emergency and intensive care units in 3 hospitals in Colombia. A total of 220 adults with respiratory distress and a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen of less than 200 due to COVID-19 were randomized from August 2020 to January 2021, with last follow-up on February 10, 2021.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive high-flow oxygen through a nasal cannula (n = 109) or conventional oxygen therapy (n = 111).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The co-primary outcomes were need for intubation and time to clinical recovery until day 28 as assessed by a 7-category ordinal scale (range, 1–7, with higher scores indicating a worse condition). Effects of treatments were calculated with a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for hypoxemia severity, age, and comorbidities.

Results

Among 220 randomized patients, 199 were included in the analysis (median age, 60 years; n = 65 women [32.7%]). Intubation occurred in 34 (34.3%) randomized to high-flow oxygen therapy and in 51 (51.0%) randomized to conventional oxygen therapy (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39–0.96; P = 0.03). The median time to clinical recovery within 28 days was 11 (IQR, 9–14) days in patients randomized to high-flow oxygen therapy vs 14 (IQR, 11–19) days in those randomized to conventional oxygen therapy (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00–1.92; P = 0.047). Suspected bacterial pneumonia occurred in 13 patients (13.1%) randomized to high-flow oxygen and in 17 (17.0%) of those randomized to conventional oxygen therapy, while bacteremia was detected in 7 (7.1%) vs 11 (11.0%), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with severe COVID-19, use of high-flow oxygen through a nasal cannula significantly decreased need for mechanical ventilation support and time to clinical recovery compared with conventional low-flow oxygen therapy.

### Tracheostomy for COVID-19: evolving best practice [^117No419]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Why perform a tracheostomy?

Tracheostomy can benefit patients who require prolonged ventilation: enabling sedation to be reduced or stopped; enabling the removal of the trans-laryngeal tube to facilitate laryngeal rehabilitation; and offering an interface for variable invasive ventilator support without having to resort to re-sedation and tracheal re-intubation. Considering that patients with COVID-19 typically have longer periods of ventilation than patients with other viral pneumonias, it is not surprising that studies have demonstrated that tracheostomy for COVID-19 disease may confer a survival benefit, aid weaning from ventilatory support, and may ease the burden upon critical care resources. Recent UK data highlighted that non-COVID-19 tracheostomy patients typically spend a median of 50 days in hospital, 28 days with a tracheostomy in situ, and 23 days within the ICU. It is easy to appreciate how critical care resources may become overwhelmed following a surge in demand. When resources become stretched, decisions regarding resource allocation become more challenging, and difficult judgments balancing tracheostomy, prolonged ventilation, rehabilitation and the potential of providing a real benefit for long-term quality of life need to be made.

What makes a patient with COVID-19 different when considering tracheostomy? With the high transmissibility and risk of serious illness, the potential risks to healthcare staff need to be considered in addition to the potential benefits to the patient. One argument surrounds the challenges of primary extubation, with higher rates of reintubation reported in patients with COVID-19. Prolonged periods of tracheal intubation associated with the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and the routine use of systemic corticosteroids contribute to respiratory muscle deconditioning, which can make going straight from an endotracheal tube to self-supported breathing challenging. Urgent re-intubation of a critically hypoxic patient has clear risks for the patient, but it is also important to consider the risks to attending staff. Non-invasive ventilation, face-mask continuous positive airway pressure, or high-flow nasal oxygen pose potential risks to healthcare staff through infectious aerosol generation, compounded by the risks associated with re-intubation.

### Early versus late tracheostomy for critically ill patients [^111iB7xf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term mechanical ventilation is the most common situation for which tracheostomy is indicated for patients in intensive care units (ICUs). 'Early' and 'late' tracheostomies are two categories of the timing of tracheostomy. Evidence on the advantages attributed to early versus late tracheostomy is somewhat conflicting but includes shorter hospital stays and lower mortality rates.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of early (≤ 10 days after tracheal intubation) versus late tracheostomy (> 10 days after tracheal intubation) in critically ill adults predicted to be on prolonged mechanical ventilation with different clinical conditions.

Search Methods

This is an update of a review last published in 2012 (Issue 3, The Cochrane Library) with previous searches run in December 2010. In this version, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 8); MEDLINE (via PubMed) (1966 to August 2013); EMBASE (via Ovid) (1974 to August 2013); LILACS (1986 to August 2013); PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) at www.pedro.fhs.usyd.edu.au (1999 to August 2013) and CINAHL (1982 to August 2013). We reran the search in October 2014 and will deal with any studies of interest when we update the review.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials (RCTs or QRCTs) comparing early tracheostomy (two to 10 days after intubation) against late tracheostomy (> 10 days after intubation) for critically ill adult patients expected to be on prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data and conducted a quality assessment. Meta-analyses with random-effects models were conducted for mortality, time spent on mechanical ventilation and time spent in the ICU.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs (N = 1977 participants). At the longest follow-up time available in these studies, evidence of moderate quality from seven RCTs (n = 1903) showed lower mortality rates in the early as compared with the late tracheostomy group (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.98; P value 0.03; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) ≅ 11). Divergent results were reported on the time spent on mechanical ventilation and no differences were noted for pneumonia, but the probability of discharge from the ICU was higher at day 28 in the early tracheostomy group (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.55; P value 0.006; NNTB ≅ 8).

Authors' Conclusions

The whole findings of this systematic review are no more than suggestive of the superiority of early over late tracheostomy because no information of high quality is available for specific subgroups with particular characteristics.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of adult patients with tracheostomy in the acute care setting [^115AuFdb]. Respiratory Care (2021). High credibility.

Tracheostomy teams — A systematic review and meta-analysis included only 7 observational studies that were of low to moderate quality, and after publication 2 additional observational studies were published, yielding 10 studies (all observational) that focused on tracheostomy teams. Of these 10 studies, 8 reported time to decannulation as an outcome, and 3 of these 8 reported a significant decrease in time to decannulation in subjects managed by a tracheostomy team. Five studies reported length of stay (LOS) as an outcome and found significantly decreased LOS, whereas 1 study reported on ICU LOS with no significant difference. Three studies reported speaking valve use as an outcome with a significant increase after tracheostomy team implementation. Six studies reported tracheostomy-related complications or adverse clinical events as an outcome, and all 6 reported significantly less adverse clinical outcomes; one study reported tracheostomy-related cost and one study reported tracheostomy tube downsizing time. Evidence supports the addition of a multidisciplinary tracheostomy team to the management strategy of tracheostomized adult patients in the acute care setting (Evidence level B; median score 7, range 5–8), and a multidisciplinary tracheostomy team can decrease time to decannulation, LOS, and tracheostomy-related adverse events and increase speaking valve use; the composition of the tracheostomy team should follow local custom.

### Established adult tracheostomy tube exchange: how often is enough? [^114zapSZ]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, there is no clinical consensus on how often adults with long-term tracheostomies should have their tubes exchanged. For high-functioning patients who are able to provide diligent tracheostomy care tubes can be exchanged every 6months. Patients who have a difficult time with tracheostomy care should have them exchanged every 1-3months.

### Determinants of tracheostomy decannulation: an international survey [^116kAz6v]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Although tracheostomy is probably the most common surgical procedure performed on critically ill patients, it is unknown when a tracheostomy tube can be safely removed.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional survey of physicians and respiratory therapists with expertise in the management of tracheostomized patients at 118 medical centers to characterize contemporary opinions about tracheostomy decannulation practice and to define factors that influence these practices.

Results

We surveyed 309 clinicians, of whom 225 responded (73%). Clinicians rated patient level of consciousness, ability to tolerate tracheostomy tube capping, cough effectiveness, and secretions as the most important factors in the decision to decannulate a patient. Decannulation failure was defined as the need to reinsert an artificial airway within 48 hours (45% of respondents) to 96 hours (20% of respondents) of tracheostomy removal, and 2% to 5% was the most frequent recommendation for an acceptable recannulation rate (44% of respondents). In clinical scenarios, clinicians who worked in chronic care facilities (30%) were less likely to recommend decannulation than clinicians who worked in weaning (47%), rehabilitation (53%), or acute care (55%) facilities (p = 0.015). Patients were most likely to be recommended for decannulation if they were alert and interactive (odds ratio [OR] 4.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.27 to 6.90; p < 0.001), had a strong cough (OR 3.84, 95% CI 2.66 to 5.54; p < 0.001), had scant thin secretions (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.19; p < 0.001), and required minimal supplemental oxygen (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.86; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Patient level of consciousness, cough effectiveness, secretions, and oxygenation are important determinants of clinicians' tracheostomy decannulation opinions. Most surveyed clinicians defined decannulation failure as the need to reinsert an artificial airway within 48 to 96 hours of planned tracheostomy removal.

### Expert consensus statements for the management of COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure using a Delphi method [^1148zDdF]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented pressure on healthcare system globally. Lack of high-quality evidence on the respiratory management of COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure (C-ARF) has resulted in wide variation in clinical practice.

Methods

Using a Delphi process, an international panel of 39 experts developed clinical practice statements on the respiratory management of C-ARF in areas where evidence is absent or limited. Agreement was defined as achieved when > 70% experts voted for a given option on the Likert scale statement or > 80% voted for a particular option in multiple-choice questions. Stability was assessed between the two concluding rounds for each statement, using the non-parametric Chi-square (χ²) test (p < 0.05 was considered as unstable).

Results

Agreement was achieved for 27 (73%) management strategies which were then used to develop expert clinical practice statements. Experts agreed that COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is clinically similar to other forms of ARDS. The Delphi process yielded strong suggestions for use of systemic corticosteroids for critical COVID-19; awake self-proning to improve oxygenation and high flow nasal oxygen to potentially reduce tracheal intubation; non-invasive ventilation for patients with mixed hypoxemic-hypercapnic respiratory failure; tracheal intubation for poor mentation, hemodynamic instability or severe hypoxemia; closed suction systems; lung protective ventilation; prone ventilation (for 16–24 h per day) to improve oxygenation; neuromuscular blocking agents for patient-ventilator dyssynchrony; avoiding delay in extubation for the risk of reintubation; and similar timing of tracheostomy as in non-COVID-19 patients. There was no agreement on positive end expiratory pressure titration or the choice of personal protective equipment.

Conclusion

Using a Delphi method, an agreement among experts was reached for 27 statements from which 20 expert clinical practice statements were derived on the respiratory management of C-ARF, addressing important decisions for patient management in areas where evidence is either absent or limited.

Trial Registration

The study was registered with Clinical trials.gov Identifier: NCT04534569.

### High-flow nasal cannula compared with conventional oxygen therapy or noninvasive ventilation immediately postextubation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1114BvTR]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Reintubation after failed extubation is associated with increased mortality and longer hospital length of stay. Noninvasive oxygenation modalities may prevent reintubation. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the safety and efficacy of high-flow nasal cannula after extubation in critically ill adults.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science.

Study Selection

We included randomized controlled trials comparing high-flow nasal cannula to other noninvasive methods of oxygen delivery after extubation in critically ill adults.

Data Extraction

We included the following outcomes: reintubation, postextubation respiratory failure, mortality, use of noninvasive ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay, complications, and comfort.

Data Synthesis

We included eight randomized controlled trials (n = 1,594 patients). Compared with conventional oxygen therapy, high-flow nasal cannula decreased reintubation (relative risk, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30–0.70; moderate certainty) and postextubation respiratory failure (relative risk, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30–0.91; very low certainty), but had no effect on mortality (relative risk, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.57–1.52; moderate certainty), or ICU length of stay (mean difference, 0.05 d fewer; 95% CI, 0.83 d fewer to 0.73 d more; high certainty). High-flow nasal cannula may decrease use of noninvasive ventilation (relative risk, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.34–1.22; moderate certainty) and hospital length of stay (mean difference, 0.98 d fewer; 95% CI, 2.16 d fewer to 0.21 d more; moderate certainty) compared with conventional oxygen therapy, however, certainty was limited by imprecision. Compared with noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula had no effect on reintubation (relative risk, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.86–1.57; low certainty), mortality (relative risk, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.82–1.53; moderate certainty), or postextubation respiratory failure (relative risk, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.48–1.41; very low certainty). High-flow nasal cannula may reduce ICU length of stay (moderate certainty) and hospital length of stay (moderate certainty) compared with noninvasive ventilation.

Conclusions

High-flow nasal cannula reduces reintubation compared with conventional oxygen therapy, but not compared with noninvasive ventilation after extubation.

### High-flow oxygen therapy and other inhaled therapies in intensive care units [^114XXrC2]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

In this Series paper, we review the current evidence for the use of high-flow oxygen therapy, inhaled gases, and aerosols in the care of critically ill patients. The available evidence supports the use of high-flow nasal cannulae for selected patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure. Heliox might prevent intubation or improve gas flow in mechanically ventilated patients with severe asthma. Additionally, it might improve the delivery of aerosolised bronchodilators in obstructive lung disease in general. Inhaled nitric oxide might improve outcomes in a subset of patients with postoperative pulmonary hypertension who had cardiac surgery; however, it has not been shown to provide long-term benefit in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Inhaled prostacyclins, similar to inhaled nitric oxide, are not recommended for routine use in patients with ARDS, but can be used to improve oxygenation in patients who are not adequately stabilised with traditional therapies. Aerosolised bronchodilators are useful in mechanically ventilated patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but are not recommended for those with ARDS. Use of aerosolised antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia and ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis shows promise, but the delivered dose can be highly variable if proper attention is not paid to the delivery method.

### Early nasal high-flow versus venturi mask oxygen therapy after lung resection: a randomized trial [^1166bkSz]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Differently, encouraging results emerge from trials comparing HFNC and low-flow oxygen in patients after thoracic surgery, who represent a specific population deemed at high risk for respiratory complications. When tested after thoracoscopic lung resection, HFNC was shown to improve oxygenation and decrease the rate of postoperative complications, with a possibly reduced postoperative length of stay.

If different studies addressed the differences between post-extubation HFNC and low-flow oxygen, data on the clinical comparison between HFNC and Venturi mask are limited and confined to the setting of critical illness. Thanks to the air entrainment effect, Venturi masks are capable to provide the patient with a nominal gas flow often above 30 l/min, at predetermined FiO₂. This allows delivery of mid-to-high gas flow with essentially stable FiO 2 and makes the Venturi system an optimal, easy-to-use, "conventional strategy" for oxygen therapy in patients with high respiratory demand. Accordingly, while the benefit on oxygenation by HFNC over low-flow oxygen is immediate and pronounced, it appears milder and delayed over Venturi mask. This aspect contributes to explain why, despite improving weaning outcome in critical patients if compared to low-flow oxygen (and performing as well as NIV in high-risk patients), the clinical effect of HFNC might be limited when compared to Venturi mask, as shown in the present investigation. Importantly, whether any difference exists between HFNC and Venturi masks in terms of weaning outcome in the intensive care unit will be clarified by the results of a recent large randomized study (NCT02107183).

### Tracheostomy management in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: an international multicenter retrospective study [^116sWTtM]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) in adults with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been shown to be associated with better outcomes than conventional mechanical ventilation alone in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to rescue acute lung injury in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (EOLIA) trial, with that position supported by the post hoc Bayesian analysis of EOLIA, and 2 subsequent meta-analyses. With the ultimate goal of using ECMO to protect the lung by minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury beyond current standard of care, an ultra-protective lung ventilation strategy targeting very low driving pressures and tidal volumes has largely been adopted across centers with high ECMO volume. However, these patients are likely to receive prolonged mechanical ventilation. For instance, mechanical ventilation duration was 22 (11–34) days in the ECMO arm of the EOLIA trial, whereas it was 40 (23–68) days in a non-selected group of 84 ECMO patients surviving to 6 months. Tracheostomy is generally a common procedure for patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation. Recent trials comparing "early" tracheostomy (i.e. within 8 days of endotracheal intubation) versus "late" tracheostomy (i.e. after at least 10 days of mechanical ventilation) in non-ECMO patients found no difference in overall mortality, hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. Tracheostomy may be beneficial by lowering airway resistance, improving oral hygiene, and making the airway more secure. It is also associated with less sedative and analgesic administration, earlier oral nutrition, better comfort, and ease of care. However, these benefits were reported in a general critically ill population. The risks and outcomes may differ when applied to patients receiving ECMO, given the severity of illness, ECMO-induced coagulopathy, frequent thrombocytopenia, and high risk of bleeding in these patients, which could influence the decision for tracheostomy, adverse event profiles, and outcomes. Currently available data in this specific population are scarce and limited to small, single-center cohorts.

The objectives of this international, multicenter, retrospective study were: (1) to assess the prevalence, timing, and tracheostomy-related management of ECMO-supported ARDS patients in large volume ECMO centers; (2) to investigate the association between the timing of the tracheostomy (i.e. during or after ECMO) and related complications, sedative, analgesic, and transfusion use; and (3) to report factors influencing the decision to perform a tracheostomy during ECMO or after ECMO decannulation in that population.

Certainty of evidence for PSG in decannulation pathways — The certainty of evidence is low due to heterogeneity, with time frame definitions for decannulation failure ranging from 6 months to 2 years, and formal airway assessments were indicated to be crucial, with most studies reviewed (18 of 21) documenting completion of a formal airway assessment.

### Effect of postextubation high-flow nasal cannula vs noninvasive ventilation on reintubation and postextubation respiratory failure in high-risk patients: a randomized clinical trial [^115Ga8Nn]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

High-flow conditioned oxygen therapy delivered through nasal cannulae and noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) may reduce the need for reintubation. Among the advantages of high-flow oxygen therapy are comfort, availability, lower costs, and additional physiopathological mechanisms.

Objective

To test if high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy is noninferior to NIV for preventing postextubation respiratory failure and reintubation in patients at high risk of reintubation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter randomized clinical trial in 3 intensive care units in Spain (September 2012-October 2014) including critically ill patients ready for planned extubation with at least 1 of the following high-risk factors for reintubation: older than 65 years; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score higher than 12 points on extubation day; body mass index higher than 30; inadequate secretions management; difficult or prolonged weaning; more than 1 comorbidity; heart failure as primary indication for mechanical ventilation; moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; airway patency problems; or prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to undergo either high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy or NIV for 24 hours after extubation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were reintubation and postextubation respiratory failure within 72 hours. Noninferiority margin was 10 percentage points. Secondary outcomes included respiratory infection, sepsis, and multiple organ failure, length of stay and mortality; adverse events; and time to reintubation.

Results

Of 604 patients (mean age, 65 [SD, 16] years; 388 [64%] men), 314 received NIV and 290 high-flow oxygen. Sixty-six patients (22.8%) in the high-flow group vs 60 (19.1%) in the NIV group were reintubation (absolute difference, -3.7%; 95% CI, -9.1% to ∞); 78 patients (26.9%) in the high-flow group vs 125 (39.8%) in the NIV group experienced postextubation respiratory failure (risk difference, 12.9%; 95% CI, 6.6% to ∞). Median time to reintubation did not significantly differ: 26.5 hours (IQR, 14–39 hours) in the high-flow group vs 21.5 hours (IQR, 10–47 hours) in the NIV group (absolute difference, -5 hours; 95% CI, -34 to 24 hours). Median postrandomization ICU length of stay was lower in the high-flow group, 3 days (IQR, 2–7) vs 4 days (IQR, 2–9; P = 0.048). Other secondary outcomes were similar in the 2 groups. Adverse effects requiring withdrawal of the therapy were observed in none of patients in the high-flow group vs 42.9% patients in the NIV group (P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among high-risk adults who have undergone extubation, high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy was not inferior to NIV for preventing reintubation and postextubation respiratory failure. High-flow conditioned oxygen therapy may offer advantages for these patients.

### Tracheotomy in ventilated patients with COVID-19 [^113eR9Et]. Annals of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic is characterized by rapid respiratory decompensation and subsequent need for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in severe cases. Approximately 3%–17% of hospitalized patients require invasive mechanical ventilation. – Current recommendations advocate for early intubation, with many also advocating the avoidance of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation such as high-flow nasal cannula, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and bag-masking as they increase the risk of transmission through generation of aerosols. –

### Physiological effects of high-flow tracheal oxygen in tracheostomized patients weaning from mechanical ventilation [^1131ZPBn]. Respiratory Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

High-flow tracheal oxygen (HFTO) is being used as supportive therapy during weaning in tracheostomized patients difficult to wean from invasive mechanical ventilation. There is, however, no clinical evidence for such a strategy. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to summarize studies evaluating the physiologic effects of HFTO during tracheostomy-facilitated weaning and to identify potential areas for future research in this field.

Methods

Observational and interventional studies on critically ill subjects weaning from mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy published until December 22, 2022, were eligible. Studies on high-flow oxygen, only in children, non-human models or animals, on clinical outcome only, abstracts without full-text availability, case reports, and reviews were excluded. Main outcomes were end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) and tidal volume using electrical impedance tomography, respiratory effort assessed by esophageal manometry, work of breathing and neuroventilatory drive as assessed by electrical activity of the diaphragm (EA di) signal, airway pressure (P aw), oxygenation (P aO2 /F IO2 or S pO2 /F IO2), breathing frequency, tidal volume, and P aCO2.

Results

In total, 1,327 references were identified, of which 5 were included. In all studies, HFTO was administered with flow 50 L/min and compared to conventional O 2 therapy in a crossover design. The total average duration of invasive ventilation at time of measurements ranged from 11–27 d. In two studies, P aO2 /F IO2 and mean P aw were higher with HFTO. EELV, tidal volumes, esophageal pressure swings, and EA di were similar during high-flow tracheal oxygen and conventional O 2 therapy.

Conclusions

The main physiological effect of HFTO as compared to conventional O 2 therapy in tracheostomized subjects weaning from mechanical ventilation was improved oxygenation that is probably flow-dependent. Respiratory effort, lung aeration, neuroventilatory drive, and ventilation were similar for HFTO and conventional O 2 therapy. Future studies on HFTO should be performed early in the weaning process and should evaluate its effect on sputum clearance and patient-centered outcomes like dyspnea.

Good practice point, high-flow humidified nasal oxygen via nasal cannulae
✓ High flow nasal oxygen should be considered as a potentially superior alternative to reservoir mask treatment in patients with acute respiratory failure without hypercapnia. ii

P. Patients with tracheostomy or laryngectomy (see section 10.3)
P1. When oxygen is required by patients with prior tracheostomy or laryngectomy, a tracheostomy mask (varying the flow as necessary) should achieve the desired oxygen saturation (tables 1–4). An alternative delivery device, usually a T-piece device fitted directly to the tracheostomy tube, may be necessary if the patient deteriorates (grade D).

Q. Humidification of oxygen (see section 10.2)
Q1. Humidification is not required for the delivery of low-flow oxygen (mask or nasal cannulae) or for the short-term use of high-flow oxygen. It is not therefore required in prehospital care. Pending the results of clinical trials, it is reasonable to use humidified oxygen for patients who require high-flow oxygen systems for more than 24 hours or who report upper airway discomfort due to dryness (grade D).
Q2. In the emergency situation, humidified oxygen use can be confined to patients with tracheostomy or an artificial airway although these patients can be managed without humidification for short periods of time (eg, ambulance journeys) (grade D).
Q3. Humidification may also be of benefit to patients with viscous secretions causing difficulty with expectoration. This benefit can be achieved using nebulised normal saline (grade D).
Q4. Bubble bottles which allow a stream of oxygen to bubble through a container of water should not be used because there is no evidence of a clinically significant benefit but there is a risk of infection (grade D).

### Impact of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy on the pressure of the airway system in humans [^116ftGU4]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: The understanding of how pharyngeal pressure is transmitted to the trachea with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) implementation and the behavior of tracheal pressure in the presence of mouth leaks remains controversial. This study aimed to assess the impact of HFNC administration on tracheal pressure by comparing measurements taken with open and closed mouth with varying flows. Methods: A crossover study was conducted between March 2019 and June 2023. Subjects age > 18 years, with a tracheostomy and who were in the process of decannulation were included. Tracheal and pharyngeal pressures were measured by using specific devices, with different HFNC flows and mouth conditions. Results: Nine subjects were assessed: 77% women, with an average age of 60.5 years. Tracheal pressure was significantly higher than pharyngeal pressure only in baseline conditions (P = 0.03). With regard to the rest of the scenarios, there were no significant differences between both pressures. Tracheal pressure was higher than the baseline condition both with an open mouth and a closed mouth (P = 0.02). The tracheal pressure at 60 L/min with an open mouth was higher than at 40 L/min (P = 0.042). The median pharyngeal pressure with a closed mouth was higher than with an open mouth, both with 40 and 60 L/min of flow (P = 0.048 and P < .001, respectively). Pharyngeal pressure at 60 L/min with an open mouth was higher than both baseline condition and at 40 L/min (P = 0.002 and P = 0.043, respectively). However, pharyngeal pressure with the closed mouth was significantly higher than with the open mouth both with 40 and 60 L/min of flow (P = 0.031 and P = 0.02 respectively). Conclusions: The implementation of HFNC changes airway pressures with values that impact at a tracheal level as flow increases. Our data contribute to the difficult interpretation of the existing interrelation between the flow and its effects on the respiratory system.

### Surgical versus dilational tracheostomy in patients with severe stroke: a SETPOINT2 post hoc analysis [^116BC5GC]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

The Stroke-Related Early Tracheostomy vs Prolonged Orotracheal Intubation in Neurocritical Care Trial 2 (SETPOINT2) trial randomly assigned 382 mechanically ventilated patients with severe stroke predicted to require tracheostomy to either an early approach to tracheostomy or to a standard approach, including extubation or tracheostomy, if needed. Six months after stroke onset, there were no differences of functional outcome between the groups. DT was the preferred method according to the trial protocol, however, ST was also permitted and was performed in a substantial number of trial participants. Within the subgroup of tracheostomized patients (n = 307), 41 patients received an ST.

We aimed to compare patients of the SETPOINT2 trial treated with ST and those treated with DT, matched for stroke type and patient age at stroke onset. The frequency of decannulation within the first 6 months after stroke onset was defined as the primary outcome.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study is the most extensive assessment of the practice of tracheostomy in patients with ARDS treated with ECMO. The main findings were (1) a tracheostomy was performed in 45% of this large cohort, with 67% of them done during ECMO; (2) tracheostomy appeared safe, even while patients were still receiving ECMO, with uncommon early complications; (3) bleeding around the tracheostomy site was significantly more frequent when the procedure was performed during ECMO than after ECMO decannulation; (4) the reduction in doses of sedative medications and patient awakening occurred later post-tracheostomy when performed during ECMO.

We found that tracheostomy was frequent among ECMO patients in these four high volume ECMO centers. However, the approach to tracheostomy was by no means uniform across ICUs that contributed to this cohort. We found substantial between-center differences in the incidence and timing of tracheostomy, which persisted even after adjustment for pre-ECMO covariates. Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy was the main technique used during ECMO (76%). Compared to open surgical tracheostomy, this technique (also referred to as bedside tracheostomy), requires a shorter procedure time, eliminates schedule difficulties associated with the operating room, avoids risky transport, and allows pursuing intensive monitoring. Tracheostomy was undertaken in 45% of our study cohort, which is more frequent than in studies in general ARDS cohorts. In a large international, multicenter, unselected, prospective cohort study of patients with ARDS, only 14% of the patients with severe ARDS had a tracheostomy. This rate was even lower in the context of COVID-19 with a tracheostomy reported in only 7% of severe ARDS patients. When performed during ECMO, patients had a tracheostomy after 11 (6–20) days of mechanical ventilation, which contrasts with general ARDS patients whose tracheostomy is most commonly performed after 14 days after initiation of mechanical ventilation, and a low proportion of patients received tracheostomy within 7 days. The increased use of tracheostomy in the ECMO population may be attributable to prolonged mechanical ventilation duration and ICU length of stay, a need for airway access for secretion management, and improvement of the patient's comfort while reducing sedation and promoting spontaneous breathing. The optimal timing of tracheostomy has been controversial. Two large randomized controlled trials and a subsequent meta-analysis demonstrated that early tracheostomy (i.e. less than 7 days after intubation) provided no benefit in terms of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay, rates of mortality or infectious complications. However, a recent meta-analysis reported lower ventilator-associated pneumonia rates and shorter durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay with early tracheostomy. While the number of patients alive at hospital discharge was greater in the after ECMO tracheostomy group compared to the during-ECMO or no tracheostomy groups, competing confounders and an obvious immortality bias preclude assigning any causality between the timing of tracheostomy for ECMO patients and outcomes in our study. Patients with more severe lung impairment, as seen during ECMO, may have a prolonged need for deep sedation, neuromuscular blockade, or prone positioning on ECMO.

AARC Clinical Practice Guideline — endotracheal suctioning pre-oxygenation: In preparation for the suctioning event, delivery of 100% oxygen in pediatric and adult patients and 10% increase of baseline in neonates for 30–60 seconds prior to the suctioning event is suggested, especially in patients who are hypoxemic before suctioning; this may be accomplished by adjusting the FiO2 setting on the mechanical ventilator or by use of a temporary oxygen-enrichment program, while manual ventilation is not recommended and practitioners should ensure that PEEP is maintained if no other alternative is available to hyper-oxygenate.

### Controlled apneic tracheostomy in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^116Ghx6J]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, patients with respiratory failure are candidates for tracheostomy if they require mechanical ventilatory support for 7 to 10 days or more. A tracheostomy facilitates ventilator weaning, reduces the need for sedation, enables earlier patient mobilization, and decreases the risk of laryngotracheal stenosis. In the context of the current pandemic, tracheostomy helps mitigate the potential hazards associated with therapies such as high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation, which can generate potentially infectious aerosolized particles. In addition, in the context of limited intensive care unit (ICU) space and resources, tracheostomy facilitates patient transition from ICU-level care to inpatient rehabilitation, resulting in net increase of available ICU beds for other patients in need.

The risk of infectious aerosolization poses a challenge to traditional practices guiding patient selection, timing, and appropriateness for tracheostomy in patients with SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure. Current literature suggests that the overall prognosis for patients with COVID-19 in the ICU is poor. Uncertainties regarding disease progression, and data portending dismal outcomes, raise concerns that tracheostomy for patients with COVID-19 may be a clinically futile pursuit; in certain centers, tracheostomy has been eliminated from consideration for any patient with suspicion for active viral shedding. Aerosolized transmission raises significant infectious concerns for health care workers performing procedures on patients with COVID-19 and generates fear regarding the potential impact of frontline health care workers succumbing to the disease. Finally, in an era of acute resource shortages, the procedure requires consumption of PPE, which may be scarce in supply.

Determining the optimal technique, selection criteria, and timing for tracheostomies in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure is at the forefront of clinical need. Here, we describe our early pandemic experience at a single, tertiary care academic institution performing tracheostomies in patients with respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We present a framework for tracheostomy team organization, a modified procedural technique to minimize risk of viral transmission, and a discussion of patient as well as health care personnel outcomes.

Bronchoscopy before tracheostomy decannulation — evidence certainty and recommendations reflect low-quality data and explicit graded guidance: the certainty of evidence was low with several studies small (< 20 patients), including only young children (< 2 yr of age) or excluding congenital malformations, and unclear bronchoscopy practices. The low certainty of evidence resulted in a conditional recommendation for bronchoscopy to evaluate symptoms; however, a strong recommendation was made for bronchoscopy before tracheostomy decannulation based on the panel's unanimous opinion that decannulation without bronchoscopy could be life threatening if an airway lesion was not identified and addressed.

Endotracheal tube suctioning — shallow versus deep technique recommendations and physiologic effects: In a randomized trial, both groups were suctioned at the same vacuum pressure (−120 mm Hg) with a maximum of 3 times, each for 15 s; in the shallow group the catheter was inserted no further than the end of the ETT, whereas in the deep group it was advanced until resistance and then pulled back 1 cm before suctioning, with breathing frequency and SpO₂ changes similar between groups and the deep group requiring suctioning less frequently. Based on available evidence, the shallow suctioning technique should be used routinely to avoid potential airway trauma (evidence level B, median appropriateness score 7.7, range 7–8), and deep suctioning should generally be used only when shallow suctioning is ineffective with consideration of potential airway trauma and negative physiologic effects (evidence level B, median appropriateness score 7.2, range 7–8).

Indications for tracheostomy in the COVID‐19 pandemic

The predominant indication for tracheostomy remains facilitating, and weaning from, prolonged mechanical ventilation. Actual or anticipated airway obstruction remains the primary surgical indication. Other indications include inadequate laryngeal reflexes and the need for invasive pulmonary hygiene in patients unable to clear respiratory secretions. However, decision‐making needs to be adapted for the COVID‐19 pandemic.

Delaying tracheostomy insertion exposes patients to the risks of: direct airway complications of prolonged trans‐laryngeal tracheal intubation; lung injury from prolonged mechanical ventilation; and prolonged critical care stay, such as excessive sedation, nosocomial infection and physiological deconditioning. Patient selection for attempted primary tracheal extubation should be based on established practice. However, failed primary tracheal extubation associated with urgent rescue oxygenation and re‐intubation risks exposing patients to potential morbidity and mortality, and exposes clinical staff to potential infection. Therapies for failed extubation, such as high‐flow nasal oxygenation, continuous positive airway pressure or non‐invasive ventilation, generate potentially hazardous aerosols to varying degrees and may not be appropriate. They also impose a strain on ward‐level hospital oxygen delivery capacity. A conservative approach to attempted primary tracheal extubation is recommended, restricted to those predicted to have a high chance of success. Elective tracheostomy offers a 'closed' system for controlled weaning of respiratory support which may be preferable to a high‐risk primary tracheal extubation strategy. Patients continuing to receive ventilatory support via a tracheostomy can be managed with reduced or no sedation, which may ease logistical work‐loads, reduce the requirement for specialist critical care nursing, and facilitate transfer to lower acuity care areas to maintain intensive care capacity.

Anecdotal reports are emerging of significant laryngeal oedema and laryngeal ulceration in patients with COVID‐19. Whereas post‐intubation laryngeal oedema is not uncommon in the critically ill, coronaviruses are known to cause laryngitis and it is plausible that SARS‐CoV‐2 has additional direct laryngeal effects in some people. A pre‐extubation tracheal tube cuff deflation 'leak test' should be considered as a screening surrogate of upper airway patency, with laryngoscopy indicated if there is doubt. Tracheostomy may be indicated if airway oedema does not improve over time, especially when the larynx appears significantly oedematous at laryngoscopy. The role of steroids in treating airway oedema in the setting of COVID‐19 is uncertain.

### Non-invasive ventilation versus invasive weaning in critically ill adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114zXDiH]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Extubation to non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been investigated as a strategy to wean critically ill adults from invasive ventilation and reduce ventilator-related complications.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, proceedings of four conferences and bibliographies (to June 2020) for randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared extubation with immediate application of NIV to continued invasive weaning in intubated adults and reported mortality (primary outcome) or other outcomes. Two reviewers independently screened citations, assessed trial quality and abstracted data.

Results

We identified 28 trials, of moderate-to-good quality, involving 2066 patients, 44.6% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Non-invasive weaning significantly reduced mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.74; high quality), weaning failures (RR 0.59, 95%CI 0.43 to 0.81; high quality), pneumonia (RR 0.30, 95%CI 0.22 to 0.41; high quality), intensive care unit (ICU) (mean difference (MD) -4.62days, 95%CI -5.91 to -3.34) and hospital stay (MD -6.29days, 95%CI -8.90 to -3.68). Non-invasive weaning also significantly reduced the total duration of ventilation, duration of invasive ventilation and duration of ventilation related to weaning (MD -0.57, 95%CI -1.08 to -0.07) and tracheostomy rate. Mortality, pneumonia, reintubation and ICU stay were significantly lower in trials enrolling COPD (vs mixed) populations.

Conclusion

Non-invasive weaning significantly reduced mortality, pneumonia and the duration of ventilation related to weaning, particularly in patients with COPD. Beneficial effects are less clear (or more careful patient selection is required) in non-COPD patients.

### Impact of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy on the pressure of the airway system in humans [^112JqiSE]. Respiratory Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The understanding of how pharyngeal pressure is transmitted to the trachea with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) implementation and the behavior of tracheal pressure in the presence of mouth leaks remains limited. This study aimed to assess the impact of HFNC administration on tracheal pressure by comparing measurements taken with open and closed mouth with varying flows.

Methods

A crossover study was conducted between March 2019 and June 2023. Subjects age > 18 years, with a tracheostomy and who were in the process of decannulation were included. Tracheal and pharyngeal pressures were measured by using specific devices, with different HFNC flows and mouth conditions.

Results

Nine subjects were assessed: 77% women, with an average age of 60.5 years. Tracheal pressure was significantly higher than pharyngeal pressure only in baseline conditions (P = 0.03). With regard to the rest of the scenarios, there were no significant differences between both pressures. Tracheal pressure was higher than the baseline condition both with an open mouth and a closed mouth (P = 0.02). The tracheal pressure at 60 L/min with an open mouth was higher than at 40 L/min (P = 0.042). The median pharyngeal pressure with a closed mouth was higher than with an open mouth, both with 40 and 60 L/min of flow (P = 0.048 and P < .001, respectively). Pharyngeal pressure at 60 L/min with an open mouth was higher than both baseline condition and at 40 L/min (P = 0.002 and P = 0.043, respectively). However, pharyngeal pressure with the closed mouth was significantly higher than with the open mouth both with 40 and 60 L/min of flow (P = 0.031 and P = 0.02 respectively).

Conclusions

The implementation of HFNC changes airway pressures with values that impact at a tracheal level as the flow used increases. Our data contribute to the difficult interpretation of the existing interrelation between the programmed flow and its effects on the respiratory system.

### Predictors of decannulation success in tracheostomy: a 10-year analysis of the global tracheostomy collaborative database [^115hQZLL]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Tracheostomy is a common airway access procedure, but practices around aftercare and decannulation vary based on patient, provider, and contextual factors. Tracheostomy may be performed for indications including need for prolonged mechanical ventilation, upper airway obstruction, airway protection, or pulmonary hygiene. The incidence of tracheostomy varies geographically due to differences in healthcare systems, patient populations, and clinical practices. In resource‐rich countries, approximately 250,000 tracheostomies are performed annually, with approximately 100,000 in the United States. In the United Kingdom, approximately 15,000 tracheostomies are performed each year, whereas 20,000 are performed annually in Australia and New Zealand. Although tracheostomy can facilitate ventilator weaning and improve patient outcomes in critical care, it is associated with significant periprocedural and post‐procedural complications such as tube displacement, tube obstruction, bleeding, infection, tracheal stenosis, and granulation tissue formation, associated with morbidity and mortality. Therefore, tracheostomy decannulation is a key goal, performed once a patient can breathe independently, manage secretions, and protect the airway. This assessment often requires interprofessional collaboration for optimal patient‐centered care.,

Patients and families commonly report negative experiences related to tracheostomy, including reduced well‐being and quality of life, difficulties caring for the tracheostomy, changes to speech and communication, disfigurement and altered body image, stigma, and social withdrawal. From a patient's perspective, decannulation represents a major milestone toward independence and a return to a more normal way of life. The ability to breathe freely, speak without assistance, and eat and drink normally can enhance physical and psychosocial well‐being. Healthcare professionals strive for safe and efficient tracheostomy decannulation, but the decision‐making process is complex, influenced by numerous factors affecting both timing and outcomes. However, decannulation decision‐making is complex, influenced by patient and institutional factors, including variability in clinical protocols. From a healthcare system perspective, prolonged tracheostomy care imposes substantial burdens, particularly regarding staff training requirements and the need for high‐acuity care settings.

### Proposed decannulation criteria for COVID-19 patients [^114Jm8xD]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A 66-yr-old man had been intubated for 21 days for severe COVID-19 infection. He then underwent tracheotomy, retained the tube for 2 mos, and then was discharged home on 10 liters of O2/min breathing via a tracheostomy collar. We were consulted for tracheostomy tube decannulation. Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation was used via the tracheostomy tube to clear secretions, increase vital capacity, and normalize O2 saturation. He practiced nasal and mouthpiece noninvasive ventilatory support once a capped fenestrated cuffless tracheostomy tube was placed, although he did not need noninvasive ventilatory support after decannulation. He was decannulated despite O2 dependence. Although he required antibiotics for almost 3 mos before decannulation and after it, he had no further episodes of lung infection for at least the next 4 mos from the point of decannulation.

AARC clinical practice guideline — timing of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) initiation defines early versus late use and describes limited evidence. Early versus late initiation of HFNC was defined as studies that compared HFNC initiation early rather than later (as escalation of therapy) in their clinical course; the committee found only 2 studies meeting these criteria, and results suggest that earlier application of HFNC may reduce ICU and hospital LOS, but the evidence available is low quality due to a lack of randomized controlled trials.

As-needed versus time-based suctioning frequency — evidence and recommendation: In a randomized, controlled trial of 180 very low birthweight neonates randomized to receive suctioning every 4 h or every 8 h, plus as needed, no differences in mechanical ventilation days, hospital LOS, bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or adverse events were found between groups, and in a randomized controlled trial of 90 pediatric subjects randomized to artificial airway suctioning either every 2 h or as-needed there were no differences in VAP, mechanical ventilation days, ICU LOS, or mortality; no studies addressed suctioning frequency in adults. Based on the evidence presented in these studies, as-needed suctioning is just as effective as routine suctioning and does not increase morbidity or mortality in neonatal and pediatric populations, and the current evidence supports the previous recommendation to perform airway suctioning of the artificial airway only as needed (evidence level B; appropriateness score 8).

### Tracheostomy for COVID-19: evolving best practice [^114nDkGj]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

The global pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a dramatic impact upon all areas of healthcare, and this is no more evident than in critical care. Management of the critically ill evolved over time, with variability in admission criteria and the use of invasive ventilation reported from around the world and within individual countries. However, the majority of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) required advanced respiratory support, often for longer periods than expected when compared with historical viral pneumonias. Tracheostomy is an entrenched element of modern critical care, with the dominant indication established as facilitating long-term ventilation and 'weaning' from respiratory support. Additional indications include actual or threatened upper airway obstruction, facilitating pulmonary clearance and to offer a degree of 'protection' against pulmonary aspiration. Prior to this pandemic, tracheostomy could be anticipated in 8–13% of patients receiving advanced respiratory support in modern ICUs; usually temporary, but often in situ for several weeks (a median of 28 days in one recent UK-wide study). Reported rates of tracheostomies utilized during the coronavirus pandemic vary significantly from 16% to 61%, but are certainly significantly higher than pre-pandemic rates.

As with many aspects of management, our understanding of how best to employ tracheostomy during the pandemic has evolved. There are many potential benefits of tracheostomy for the patient and for stressed healthcare systems, which have led some institutions to employ tracheostomy relatively early in the patient's ICU stay, but detailed outcome data from large case series are not available. Tracheostomy insertion and subsequent management also requires trained, equipped and supported staff to minimize the potential for complications and patient safety incidents. It is essential that we understand which patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may benefit from tracheostomy, along with when and how it should be employed. Importantly, in non-COVID-19 patients, only around 20% of tracheostomy patients survive beyond ICU discharge to 1 year, repeatedly raising questions about patient selection, which are relevant as hospitals around the world struggle to manage large volumes of critically ill patients. These problems are compounded in the pandemic with patients frequently managed in makeshift or unfamiliar settings, often by non-CU trained medical, nursing and allied healthcare professional staff.

In this state-of-the-art review, we consider these important issues affecting around one-fifth of critically ill patients presenting to our ICUs with severe respiratory failure resulting from COVID-19.

### Care of infants and children with tracheostomies: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^116Cf9c4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Justification

Recognizing the limited evidence surrounding the use of capped PSGs for decannulation, we support providers in choosing the most appropriate surveillance option (i.e. PSG vs. oximetry), based on clinical characteristics and accessibility to PSG. Studies indicate that patients who fail overnight tracheostomy tube capping or decannulation are identified relatively quickly, suggesting other measurements of gas exchange in conjunction with direct observation may suffice. This recommendation prioritizes timely decannulation opportunities without compromising patient safety.

### Can high-flow nasal cannula reduce the rate of reintubation in adult patients after extubation? A meta-analysis [^114BoQhK]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving method, which has been proved to improve gas exchange as well as decrease work of breathing due to fully or partially spontaneous breathing replacement. Unfortunately, invasive mechanical ventilation has been increasingly recognized to be associated with various adverse events, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and barotrauma. Moreover, the hospital mortality of patients admitted into intensive care unit(ICU) remains as high as 30.7%. Timely extubation is one way of minimizing the morbidity. However, it is estimated that 12 to 14% of patients who undergo planned extubation will require reintubation within 48 to 72 h, most within the first 24 h.

NIPPV may prevent post-extubation respiratory failure and avoid reintubation if it is applied soon after extubation. In addition, according to the most recent guidelines, preventive NIPPV was recommend in patients with high risk of reintubation. However, numerous potential hazards, such as skin damage, eye irritation, interface intolerance, diet and expectoration interruption, might block the usage of NIPPV in clinical practice. Thus, potential substitutions of NIPPV without the adverse events mentioned above are imperatively needed.

High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a new technique of oxygen delivering, which delivers heated and humidified oxygen via special devices at a rate of up to 60 L/min. Because of the widely proved clinical efficacy together with easy application and good patient tolerance in critically ill infants and children, physicians began to focus on the potential roles of HFNC in improving clinical outcomes in adult patients. However, contradictory conclusions were drawn in spite of large number of clinical trials. Fernandez and colleagues conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 155 high-risk non-hypercapnic patients and they found that HFNC could not decrease rate of reintubation compared with conventional oxygen therapy (COT) (11% vs. 16%, P = 0.5). On the contrary, a recent randomized trial by Hernández demonstrated that, compared with COT, HFNC could reduce the reintubation rate among extubated patients at low-risk (4.9% vs. 12.2%, P = 0.004).

Factors Associated With Time‐to‐Successful Decannulation

Results from an adjusted regression model examining time‐to‐decannulation showed that younger age was associated with a higher likelihood of successful decannulation, with each lower age decade being more likely to be decannulated compared to those aged 70 or older (Figure 2). Adjusting for other demographic and clinical factors, there was no difference in the likelihood of decannulation by sex (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.97, female vs male; 95% CI: 0.90‐1.05; P = 0.45). Patients with a tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction were more likely to be decannulated compared to those with a tracheostomy for ventilation facilitation (HR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.54‐2.22; P < .001). No significant differences were observed for other tracheostomy indications, including aspiration (HR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.60‐1.03; P = 0.08), secretion retention (HR = 1.29; 95% CI: 0.66‐2.52; P = 0.45), or any other indication (HR = 1.45; 95% CI: 0.79‐2.69; P = 0.23).
