## Question

Management of intraduct pappiloma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of intraductal papilloma of the breast. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the entity and distinguishing it from similarly named lesions in other organs. Then, I should verify the diagnostic pathway and the role of core needle biopsy versus vacuum-assisted excision. Next, I will stratify risk by the presence or absence of atypia and assess upgrade rates. After that, I need to integrate patient-specific and lesion-specific risk modifiers. Finally, I will outline management options, including excision, surveillance, and vacuum-assisted excision, and close with a practical algorithm and counseling points, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity so we don't conflate terms. Intraductal papilloma of the breast is a papillary proliferation within a breast duct, typically presenting with bloody nipple discharge or as a retroareolar mass; it is distinct from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas and intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct, which have different malignant potentials and management paradigms, so I need to keep the discussion breast-specific here [^6ce41dd8] [^82aa9525].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic pathway and sampling method, because management hinges on accurate diagnosis and concordance. Ultrasound is the primary modality for detecting intraductal masses and guiding biopsy, with MRI useful for mapping extent when malignancy is suspected; core needle biopsy establishes the diagnosis, but vacuum-assisted excision (VAE) provides larger tissue volume and can serve as both diagnostic and therapeutic in select cases, which I should keep in mind as I weigh upgrade risk and completeness of excision [^6ce41dd8] [^f39ebc06] [^915e1d50].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about excising everything. I need to stratify by pathology on core biopsy. The pivotal split is papilloma without atypia versus papilloma with atypia, because upgrade to malignancy differs markedly between these groups and drives management recommendations [^cb73e021] [^59ceaa6e].

> I will now examine upgrade rates to anchor decisions. For papilloma with atypia, pooled analyses show a carcinoma upgrade rate around 36%, with some series reporting 20–30%, so surgical excision is recommended to exclude occult DCIS or invasive disease. For papilloma without atypia, upgrade is about 5% overall, with many contemporary series showing 1–3% upgrade to invasive cancer, supporting a more selective approach rather than routine excision in all cases [^cb73e021] [^59ceaa6e] [^6f3a9329] [^5345ad55].

> Wait, let me verify patient- and lesion-specific modifiers that can shift risk upward even in the "without atypia" group. Older age, larger size, peripheral location, multiplicity, incomplete sampling, imaging–pathology discordance, and personal history of breast cancer have all been associated with higher upgrade risk; conversely, small lesions under 1 cm with more than 50% of the lesion removed on biopsy and concordant imaging carry very low upgrade risk, which can inform surveillance in carefully selected patients [^2b9da1c6] [^6eeb8b0b] [^cb73e021].

> Let me consider management for papilloma with atypia first, because that is the clearest case. Given the 20–36% upgrade risk, surgical excision is the standard of care; I should confirm that margins are assessed and that any DCIS or invasive component is addressed per breast-conserving principles, with multidisciplinary coordination for margin management and adjuvant therapy if indicated [^59ceaa6e] [^a6e07f5c].

> Now, for papilloma without atypia, I should double-check the balance between overtreatment and missed upgrades. Options include surgical excision, vacuum-assisted excision, or imaging surveillance; excision remains reasonable for symptomatic patients, those with risk modifiers, or when imaging–pathology discordance exists, whereas surveillance is acceptable in low-risk, asymptomatic, concordant cases with small lesions and adequate sampling, with typical follow-up at 6–12 month intervals for 1–2 years and then annual imaging if stable [^2b9da1c6] [^6f3a9329] [^07cb76ce].

> But wait, what if we can remove the lesion percutaneously and avoid surgery altogether. Vacuum-assisted excision is a valuable middle ground for lesions under about 2 cm, especially when the papilloma is the target and there are no worrisome imaging features; VAE achieves complete removal in many cases and has low upgrade rates when the lesion is entirely excised, though I need to ensure radiologic–pathologic concordance and arrange appropriate follow-up imaging to confirm stability [^f39ebc06] [^915e1d50].

> I should confirm the role of multidisciplinary review, because it meaningfully reduces unnecessary surgery. Prospective data show that after MDT review, patients with pure intraductal papilloma 1 cm or smaller, with more than half of the lesion removed on biopsy, had a 0% upgrade rate and could safely omit excision, whereas those with larger size, incomplete sampling, or atypia were channeled to surgery; this supports a standardized, risk-adapted approach rather than a blanket recommendation [^6eeb8b0b].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, and I will sanity-check each step against the evidence. If core biopsy shows papilloma with atypia, proceed to surgical excision. If core biopsy shows papilloma without atypia, assess concordance, size, sampling adequacy, symptoms, and risk factors; excise if symptomatic, discordant, larger than 1 cm, incompletely sampled, peripheral/multiple, or in patients with personal history of breast cancer; consider VAE for small, accessible lesions with concordant imaging; and select surveillance for small, concordant, adequately sampled lesions in low-risk patients, with defined imaging intervals and a low threshold to escalate if there is progression or new symptoms [^59ceaa6e] [^2b9da1c6] [^f39ebc06].

> Hold on, I should verify counseling points so expectations are clear. Patients should understand that even with papilloma without atypia, there is a small but real upgrade risk, that surveillance requires reliable follow-up, and that symptoms such as new bloody discharge or a new mass warrant prompt evaluation; shared decision-making is essential, and documentation of concordance and the rationale for surveillance versus excision should be explicit in the record [^2b9da1c6] [^6f3a9329].

> Finally, I need to ensure I am not conflating entities. If the clinical context suggests pancreatic or biliary intraductal papillary lesions rather than breast, the management diverges substantially and should follow organ-specific guidelines; keeping the discussion breast-focused avoids misapplication of evidence and prevents overtreatment or undertreatment in the wrong organ system [^82aa9525] [^f957dfeb].

Intraductal papilloma management is **risk-stratified** based on atypia, size, symptoms, and radiologic–pathologic concordance [^2b9da1c6]. Papillomas with atypia have a **20–30% upgrade risk** and require surgical excision [^59ceaa6e]; those without atypia have a **1–5% upgrade risk** and can be managed with surveillance if small, asymptomatic, and concordant, reserving excision for larger, symptomatic, or discordant lesions [^2b9da1c6] [^cb73e021]. Vacuum-assisted excision is appropriate for small, accessible lesions, while open surgery is used for larger or peripheral lesions [^f39ebc06]. Follow-up with clinical exam and imaging is essential, and multidisciplinary review helps tailor management to individual risk [^6eeb8b0b].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis and risk stratification rely on **imaging and biopsy**:

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound is first-line for suspected papillomas, especially with nipple discharge; mammography may show retroareolar nodules or calcifications; MRI can define extent and detect multifocality [^6ce41dd8] [^28c0e4c9].

- **Biopsy**: Core needle biopsy (CNB) is standard; vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) improves sampling and can be therapeutic for small lesions [^f39ebc06] [^915e1e50].

- **Pathology**: Papillomas are classified as benign, atypical, or malignant; atypia significantly increases upgrade risk [^cb73e021].

---

## Risk stratification and management

Management is **individualized** based on atypia, lesion size, symptoms, and concordance:

| **Risk category** | **Features** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| High risk | - Atypia on biopsy <br/> - Size > 1 cm <br/> - Symptoms (bloody discharge, palpable mass) <br/> - Radiologic–pathologic discordance | Surgical excision is recommended due to 20–30% upgrade risk [^59ceaa6e] [^cb73e021] |
| Intermediate risk | - No atypia <br/> - Size 0.5–1 cm <br/> - Minimal symptoms <br/> - Concordant imaging | Consider excision or close surveillance (6–12 month imaging) [^2b9da1c6] [^07cb76ce] |
| Low risk | - No atypia <br/> - Size < 0.5 cm <br/> - Asymptomatic <br/> - Concordant imaging | Surveillance with clinical exam and imaging is reasonable [^2b9da1c6] [^07cb76ce] |

---

## Surgical management

Surgical excision is indicated for high-risk lesions or when **upgrade risk is unacceptable**:

- **Techniques**: Circumareolar incision with duct excision is common; vacuum-assisted excision is an option for small, accessible lesions [^f39ebc06].

- **Margins**: Clear margins are preferred; positive margins may require re-excision [^notfound].

- **Outcomes**: Most excised papillomas are benign; upgrade to DCIS or invasive carcinoma occurs in 1–5% without atypia and 20–30% with atypia [^cb73e021] [^59ceaa6e].

---

## Non-surgical management

Surveillance is appropriate for **low-risk lesions**, with **follow-up** every 6–12 months with clinical exam and imaging, continuing annually if stable [^2b9da1c6]. Patient selection should be limited to reliable patients with small, asymptomatic, concordant lesions without atypia [^6eeb8b0b]. Counseling should explain the small upgrade risk and the need for adherence to follow-up [^2b9da1c6].

---

## Special considerations

Multiple papillomas carry a higher malignancy risk and often warrant **excision** [^a6e07f5c]. Pediatric and adolescent patients are rare; management should be individualized, with excision for symptomatic or large lesions [^f8ebf0fd]. Recurrence is uncommon after complete excision but may occur with multifocal disease or incomplete removal, so ongoing surveillance is prudent [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Regular follow-up is essential for both surgical and non-surgical patients, with **clinical exams** every 6–12 months for 1–2 years, then annually if stable. Imaging (ultrasound or MRI) should be performed at 6–12 month intervals initially, then annually if stable. Patient education should emphasize symptom awareness and prompt reporting of new discharge, masses, or changes [^notfound].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

A **multidisciplinary approach** involving breast surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, and oncologists ensures accurate diagnosis, risk stratification, and individualized management [^6eeb8b0b].

---

Intraductal papilloma management is **risk-adapted**: excise high-risk lesions, surveil low-risk lesions, and use VAB for select small lesions. Regular follow-up and multidisciplinary care optimize outcomes and minimize overtreatment [^2b9da1c6].

Introduction

The management of intraductal papillomas of the breast has been controversial; some advocate surgical excision of all lesions despite benign pathologic features, whereas others excise only those specimens with atypia.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of 129 core-biopsy-proven papillomas of the breast with atypia (n = 43) and without atypia (n = 86) and determined the rate of missed carcinoma in surgically excised specimen in each group.

Results

Carcinoma was found in 22.5% of the surgically excised specimens in the atypia group (9/40) and in 3% of the surgically excised specimens in the no atypia group (1/29).

Conclusions

Our findings confirm the practice that papillomas with atypical features should be excised, and suggest that in patients with adequate follow-up, benign papillomas may be managed conservatively.

Similarly, in a series of 18 patients with early-stage acinic cell carcinomas of the parotid gland without adverse features, only one patient experienced a recurrence with a median follow-up of 64 months. 320In another series by Stodulski et al, 32232 low- or intermediate-grade parotid cancers managed with surgery alone with negative but close surgical margins, a 5-year DFS of 90. 6% was observed.

### Practice bulletin no. 164: diagnosis and management of benign breast disorders [^a6e07f5c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Intraductal papillomas — presentation, risk, and management are summarized as follows: Solitary lesions can cause nipple discharge and occur most commonly in women aged 30–50 years, are typically small (2–4 mm), but can present as a palpable mass up to 5 cm. If atypia is present on core biopsy, surgical excision is recommended because carcinoma is diagnosed in 15–20% of women with excisional specimens. Multiple peripheral papillomas do not typically present with discharge, and coexisting or subsequent breast cancer is diagnosed in approximately one third of these women.

### Multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^8e89eb96]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms have gained recognition in recent years as premalignant precursors to pancreatic cancer that enable early detection and often are found incidentally at imaging. Accurate diagnosis and optimal, finely tuned management of these lesions are important and require collaboration across various disciplines, including radiology, endoscopy, surgery, and pathology. Several imaging modalities can visualize these lesions adequately, each with specific advantages and disadvantages. Multidetector computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are generally the first-line imaging modalities; endoscopic imaging such as endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are beneficial when the former 2 modalities are equivocal. Surgical candidates generally include patients with main duct lesions or branch duct lesions greater than 3 cm or any possessing a solid component. A management algorithm indicating when surgery should be pursued is proposed. For nonsurgical and postsurgical patients, follow-up management is important to monitor growth and recurrence, and risks from repeated radiation exposure should be taken into account. Furthermore, issues of multifocality and increased predisposition of the pancreas to ductal adenocarcinoma must be addressed at follow-up evaluation. A follow-up management algorithm also is proposed in this review.

### Resource guide: surgical management of benign or high-risk lesions [^2b9da1c6]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Intraductal papilloma (IP) without atypia — management includes ensuring concordance and tailoring excision to symptoms. As with other high-risk or benign lesions, careful radiographic and pathologic concordance is recommended. Asymptomatic intraductal papillomas can undergo active imaging surveillance, supported by a prospective multicenter registry that enrolled 116 asymptomatic patients with intraductal papillomas and BI-RADS ≤ 4 and found a 1.7% upgrade to DCIS regardless of lesion size or patient age, with no invasive cancers identified. Several large retrospective studies have reported 1–5% upgrade rates for asymptomatic intraductal papillomas with excellent clinical, radiologic, and pathologic concordance, and factors associated with higher risk of upgrade include size > 1 cm, age > 50 years at diagnosis, lesion multiplicity, location (peripheral), and > 50% of the lesion remaining after CNB, though these associations are not consistent across studies. Symptomatic intraductal papillomas that present as a palpable mass or with nipple discharge are associated with a slightly higher risk of upgrade to DCIS or invasive cancer, and surgical excision can be considered to rule out malignancy and provide symptom relief.

### Are we overtreating intraductal papillomas? [^b529f6bf]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The management of intraductal papillomas (IDPs) diagnosed on core needle biopsy (CNB) remains controversial regarding whether excision is required. We evaluated whether excision of IDPs might be overtreatment based on a consecutive patient population where all IDPs were routinely excised.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of consecutive patients treated with excision of IDPs at our institution from 2009 to 2016. We evaluated the rate of upgrade of IDPs on CNB and factors predicting for malignant upgrade.

Results

Of 153 CNB specimens, 136 (88.9%) were IDPs without atypia and 14 (9.2%) showed atypia. The overall upgrade rate on final pathology was 7.3% with 1.3% for invasive cancer, 2.7% for ductal carcinoma in situ, and 3.3% for atypical ductal hyperplasia. Of the 14 patients with atypia on CNB, two of these patients (14.2%) were found to have ductal carcinoma in situ. In the absence of atypia on CNB, upgrade rates were 1.5% for invasive and 1.5% for in situ carcinoma. Personal history of breast cancer and magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy predicted for malignant upgrade.

Conclusions

IDPs on CNB have a low chance of harboring an occult malignancy. Given the low probability of upgrade to invasive breast cancer, it is reasonable to consider watchful surveillance in the absence of a prior personal history of breast cancer or atypia on CNB.

### Intraductal papilloma with benign pathology on breast core biopsy: to excise or not? [^87101953]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The management of intraductal papillomas on core biopsy continues to be controversial. Papillomas with atypia are typically excised. However, it is unclear whether surgical excision is warranted for benign lesions.

Methods

A retrospective review of our institution's pathology and radiology databases from January 2009 through May 2014 identified 119 patients with a diagnosis of benign papilloma without atypia on core biopsy. We determined the rate of carcinoma identification on surgical excision.

Results

The average patient age was 52.8 years (range 24–84 years). Indication for core biopsy included: abnormal imaging (n = 106), nipple discharge (n = 21), or palpable mass (n = 24). Seventy-five patients underwent surgical excision after core biopsy. Sixteen patients (21.3%) had atypia in the excision specimen (combination atypical ductal hyperplasia, n = 11; atypical lobular hyperplasia, n = 8; lobular carcinoma-in situ, n = 3), 15 (93.8%) of which were in the surrounding breast tissue. Two patients (2.7%) had malignancy (ductal carcinoma-in situ and micropapillary carcinoma-in situ). As a result of surgical findings, 12% of patients had a change in management. In comparing those with benign findings on surgical pathology and those whose disease was upstaged, there was no statistically significant difference in family history of breast cancer, indication for core biopsy, mammographic findings, or location of papilloma.

Conclusions

Benign papillomas diagnosed on core biopsy are rarely upstaged to malignancy on surgical excision. However, at least 21% of patients may have atypical findings in the surrounding tissue, which could change clinical management. Surgical excision should be considered in patients with benign papillomas.

### Intraductal papillomas from the parotid gland [^a262a61f]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Intraductal papillomas have been mostly described in minor salivary glands but are extremely rare in the parotid gland. Consequently, limited information is available to guide otolaryngologists and pathologists in managing intraductal papillomas, specifically in the parotid gland. Diagnosing intraductal papillomas in this location poses significant challenges. In this report, the authors present a new case and first conduct a systematic literature review of the intraductal papillomas originating from the parotid gland. This study contributes valuable insights that can improve diagnostic accuracy, providing more precise treatments, and patient outcomes in cases of intraductal papillomas in the parotid gland.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: clinical surveillance and management decisions [^39ec19c7]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas is a relatively rare cystic neoplasm. Although most IPMNs appear to be benign and may be managed by surveillance, all IPMNs are considered premalignant lesions with malignant potential. As such, current efforts are focused on identifying those neoplasms that are at high risk for malignancy to optimize treatment strategy and outcome. IPMNs with invasive carcinoma have clinical outcomes that approach those of conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Management guidelines recommend surgical resection for IPMNs with high-risk imaging or cytologic features. The role of adjuvant therapy is unclear, and we review the evidence for chemoradiation here. Some studies suggest adjuvant chemoradiation may have the greatest impact in malignant IPMNs with adverse histologic features, that is, lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis or positive surgical margins. As more IPMNs are recognized and treated, more evidence will accumulate to guide clinicians regarding appropriate use of radiotherapy in the management of IPMN.

### Resource guide: surgical management of benign or high-risk lesions [^59ceaa6e]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Papillary lesions — indications for excision are as follows: When no further pathologic characterization is provided, the lesion should be surgically excised; intraductal papilloma with atypia or atypical papillary lesions are pathologically upgraded at the time of surgical excision up to 20–30% of the time, therefore surgical excision for these lesions is recommended.

### The landmark series: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas-from prevalence to early cancer detection [^c8aa54a9]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

This article is structured as a toolkit of relevant landmark articles essential to current intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) care. Four elements will be highlighted. First, the studies quantifying the prevalence of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) and IPMNs in the general population are addressed. No longer considered a rare disease, providing an accurate estimate of the numbers of patients with IPMN frames the relevance of the topic. Since the definition and classification of IPMN was not formally adopted by the World Health Organization until 1996, modern-era studies have been selected. Second, the main clinical management guidelines are discussed in context. A concise description of the methodology used to develop the recommendations in each guideline is given, followed by direct comparison of management strategies in the different guidelines. Third, the evidence on surveillance discontinuation is discussed. The reason for highlighting this ongoing and timely debate is that non-resected IPMNs are currently considered for lifelong surveillance. Given the high prevalence of IPMNs and length of surveillance, the burden on patients and the health care system worldwide demands a reassessment of surveillance discontinuation for specific subsets of IPMNs. Fourth, due to the limitations and low specificity of current guidelines to identify appropriate patients for pancreatic resection more accurately, the main studies on new cyst biomarker panels to predict IPMNs at high-risk for cancer are discussed. The goal of molecular diagnostics of cyst fluid aims to reduce the number of unnecessary resections that are performed every year, while also providing information on the malignant potential of lesions under surveillance. A final comment on the role of the immune system in IPMN progression is given, as opportunities for early immunotherapeutic intervention could change the course of this disease.

### Benign breast intraductal papillomas without atypia at core needle biopsies: is surgical excision necessary? [^6f3a9329]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine the upgrade rate of image-guided core needle biopsy (CNB)-proven benign breast intraductal papillomas (IDPs) without atypia to high-risk benign lesions or malignancy after surgical excision.

Methods

A retrospective database search at a single institution identified 102 adult female patients with benign breast IDPs without atypia diagnosed on imaging-guided CNBs who subsequently had surgical excisions between 2011 and 2016. Patient characteristics, imaging features, biopsy techniques, and the pathology reports from imaging-guided CNBs and subsequent surgical excisions were reviewed. The upgrade rate to malignancies or high-risk benign lesions was determined at the patient level.

Results

The upgrade rate to malignancy was 2.9% (3/102), including two cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and one case of microinvasive (< 1 mm) ductal carcinoma arising from DCIS. The upgrade rate to high-risk benign lesions was 7.8% (8/102), with seven cases of atypical ductal hyperplasia and one case of atypical lobular hyperplasia. A personal history of breast cancer and a larger mean lesion size were significantly associated with an upgrade to malignancy (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

The management of benign breast IDPs without atypia detected on imaging-guided CNBs is controversial. Our results suggest risk stratification is important in approaching these patients. Although surgical excision should be considered for all benign breast IDPs without atypia, observation with serial imaging may be appropriate in selected low-risk patients. This approach will save many women from surgeries and decrease the cost of medical care.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: current understanding and future directions for stratification of malignancy risk [^15537e5f]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

The incidence of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) has been increasing over the past decade, mainly owing to increased awareness and the increased use of cross-sectional imaging. The Sendai and Fukuoka consensus guidelines provide us with clinical management guidelines and algorithms; however, the clinical management of IPMNs continues to be challenging. Our incomplete understanding of the natural history of the disease, and the events and pathways that permit progression to adenocarcinoma, result in difficulties predicting which tumors are high risk and will progress to invasive disease. In this review, we summarize the current management guidelines and describe ongoing efforts to more clearly stratify IPMNs by risk of malignancy and identify IPMNs with malignant potential or ongoing malignant transformation.

### Multidisciplinary review of intraductal papilloma of the breast can identify patients who may omit surgical excision [^6eeb8b0b]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to define contemporary management recommendations regarding who would benefit from surgical excision of intraductal papilloma (IDP).

Methods

A prospective database from a single institution identified patients with IDP on percutaneous biopsy from February 2015 to September 2020. Categorical patient demographic, biopsy, and pathologic variables were analyzed using Fisher's exact test and continuous demographic and imaging variables using the Mann-Whitney U test.

Results

IDP was present in 416 biopsies, at a median age of 56 years. The median size was 0.9 cm, and the majority had greater than 50% of the target excised by biopsy. Surgical excision was performed for 124 of 416 biopsies (29.8%). Upgrade to malignancy was identified in 14 (11.3%): 8 to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 6 to invasive cancer. Upgrade was significantly associated with concurrent ipsilateral breast cancer (p = 0.027), larger imaging size (p = 0.045), < 50% excised with biopsy (p = 0.02), and atypia involving IDP (p = 0.045). Age, clinical presentation, and concurrent contralateral cancer were not significantly associated with upgrade. Lowest upgrade risk (0%) was in pure IDP ≤ 1 cm with > 50% removed by biopsy. Of 401 biopsies that either did not upgrade or undergo excision, 7 (1.7%) developed subsequent breast cancer over a median follow-up of 23.5 months (interquartile range [IQR] 11,41), none at IDP site.

Conclusions

After multidisciplinary review, the management of IDP can be stratified into low- and high-risk for upgrade groups using key criteria. Low-risk group may omit surgical excision, because those patients have 0% risk of upgrade over the limited short-term follow-up.

### Diagnosis and management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia [^40f223ef]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) encompasses a spectrum of neoplastic change in the epithelial lining of the pancreatic duct. As such, it is difficult to predict the presence of malignancy, and pancreatic resection is established as the only effective treatment for IPMN. There is controversy about the natural history, evaluation, surgical management and surveillance of IPMN; as IPMN is being increasingly recognized, this controversy is being brought to the forefront of clinical practice. This review presents pooled surgical data, future directions and a proposed algorithm for the management of patients with IPMN.

### Upgrade rate and predictive factors for breast benign intraductal papilloma diagnosed at biopsy: a meta-analysis [^cb73e021]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Current standard management for intraductal papilloma (IDP) diagnosed at biopsy indicates complete surgical resection, but there are increasing controversies over whether and when routine excision is indeed necessary.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the carcinoma upgrade rate and identify the associated predictive factors for IDP diagnosed at biopsy by meta-analysis.

Methods

We searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases for studies published from 2009 to 2020 that investigated the upgrade rate and predictive factors of IDP diagnosed at biopsy.

Results

A total of 7016 IDP cases diagnosed at biopsy and histologically examined after surgical excision were pooled from 44 original studies. The pooled prevalence of IDP in breast biopsy findings was 4.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4–4.7%] and the majority of IDP tumors were benign. The pooled upgrade rates to carcinoma for benign IDP and atypical IDP were 5.0% (95% CI 4.4–5.5%) and 36.0% (95% CI 32.7–39.2%), respectively. In addition, we identified 10 predictive upgrade factors for benign IDP, including Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 5, BI-RADS 4C, mass and calcification in the mammographic finding, bloody nipple discharge, imaging-histological discordance, peripheral IDP, palpable mass, BI-RADS 4B, microcalcification, and lesion size ≥ 1 cm. The upgrade rates associated with these predictive factors ranged from 7.3 to 31.1%.

Conclusion

Surgical excision appears a reasonable recommendation for atypical IDP. Patients with benign IDP exhibiting one or more predictive factors might benefit from surgical excision, while patients with asymptomatic benign IDP without these predictive factors can be managed by imaging surveillance.

### Non-mass-associated intraductal papillomas: is excision necessary? [^fbcf0246]. Human Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillomas (IDPs) of the breast can be associated with a variety of clinical symptoms and radiologic findings. Surgical excision is often recommended based on the possibility of an associated high-grade lesion. Although the rate of upgrades has been extensively evaluated for IDPs, many studies are hindered by broad inclusion criteria, a lack of pathologic-radiologic concordance, and no standard definition of what constitutes an upgrade. In the current study, we evaluate the risk of upgrade for a specific subset of IDPs: non-mass-associated IDPs. We identified all breast needle core biopsies with a diagnosis of IDP between 2003 and 2010. Patients with associated masses, architectural distortion, or ipsilateral breast cancer were excluded. All needle core biopsy slides and relevant imaging studies were reviewed to ensure pathologic-radiologic concordance. Excision pathology was also reviewed; an upgrade was defined as the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma in the excision. Seventy-nine IDPs that met inclusion criteria were identified and were further divided into 3 histologic categories: micropapilloma, fragmented IDP, and atypical IDP. Micropapillomas and fragmented IDPs had no upgrades (0/37). In patients who did not undergo excision, none subsequently developed ipsilateral breast cancer (follow-up, 50–61 months). This is in contrast to atypical IDPs that had a 33% upgrade rate. One patient with an unexcised atypical IDP developed ipsilateral breast cancer within 2 years. Our data suggest that conservative follow-up is reasonable for non-mass-associated IDPs without atypia regardless of microscopic size, provided that careful pathologic-radiologic correlation is achieved.

### Intraductal papilloma of the breast: prevalence of malignancy and natural history under active surveillance [^07cb76ce]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal management of intraductal papillomas (IPs) without atypia diagnosed on needle core biopsy (NCB) is unclear. This study analyzed the malignancy risk of immediately excised IPs and characterized the behavior of IPs under active surveillance (AS).

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the pathology and imaging records of patients diagnosed with IPs without atypia on NCB during a 10-year period (1999–2019). The malignancy upgrade rate was assessed in patients who had an immediate surgical excision, and the rates of both radiographic progression and development of malignancy were assessed in a cohort of patients undergoing AS.

Results

The inclusion criteria were met in 152 patients with 175 IPs with a mean age of 51 ± 13 years. The average size of the IPs on initial imaging was 8 ± 4 mm. Most of the lesions (57%, n = 99) were immediately excised, whereas 76 (43%) underwent AS with interval imaging with a median follow-up period of 15 months (range, 5–111 months). Among the immediately excised IPs, surgical pathology revealed benign findings in 97% (n = 96) and ductal carcinoma in situ in 3% (n = 3). In the AS cohort, 72% (n = 55) of the IPs remained stable, and 25% (n = 19) resolved or decreased in size. At 2 years, 4% had increased in size on imaging and were subsequently excised, with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, n = 1) and benign pathology (n = 1) noted on final pathology.

Conclusions

In a large series of breast IPs without atypia, no invasive carcinoma was observed after immediate excision, and 96% of the lesions had not progressed on AS. This suggests that patients with IP shown on NCB can safely undergo AS, with surgery reserved for radiographic lesion progression.

### The management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^06afbd35]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) are mucinous cystic tumors of the pancreas, which were first classified into a unified diagnosis by the World Health Organization in 1996. These lesions originate from the cells of the pancreatic ductal system and may grossly or microscopically involve the pancreatic ducts in a diffuse or multifocal fashion. As experience with IPMN increases, it is becoming more evident that this process presents as a spectrum of neoplasia with significant variation regarding the clinical and radiologic presentation, malignant potential, and disease-specific outcome. IPMN encompasses a spectrum of precursor lesions, from adenoma to intraductal carcinoma to invasive cancer, with molecular data supporting the premise that this dysplastic process has the potential to progress from low-grade dysplasia to invasive carcinoma. Controversy over the management of IPMN exists because of the difficulty in obtaining a preoperative histologic diagnosis, the broad spectrum of neoplasia, the lack of understanding as to the frequency and time to malignant progression. This article describes the radiologic and histopathologic classification system of IPMN; the biologic behavior of these lesions, and the diagnostic testing most commonly used, and discusses the current treatment controversies.

### Evidence-based pragmatic approach to the management of borderline or high-risk breast lesions [^6feca747]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2022). Medium credibility.

The management of borderline or high-risk breast lesions (HRLs) remains controversial. We propose a pragmatic evidence-based approach based on lesion type. For lobular carcinoma in situ with pleomorphism, papilloma with atypia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, and fibroepithelial lesions, surgical consultation and excision are recommended. Patients with other borderline or HRLs are referred for surgical consultation to discuss excision versus surveillance. Our recommendations align with American Society of Breast Surgeons guidelines, which aim to reduce unnecessary surgery and ensure appropriate follow-up.

### Are clinical guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms followed? a single-center analysis [^152a0d32]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to determine how frequently guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are followed and establish factors associated with failure.

Methods

Four hundred forty-five patients with radiographic diagnosis of IPMN 1 cm or greater between January 1, 2003 and January 1, 2013 were included. We defined failure of guideline adherence if the following occurred: (a) failure of acknowledgment of IPMN, (b) failure to undergo endoscopic ultrasound, (c) failure to undergo resection, or (d) failure to undergo at least 1 surveillance image within 2 years after diagnosis.

Results

Failure of guideline adherence was observed in 58% of patients and evident across all the respective criteria (A: 38%, B: 25%, C: 29%, D: 33%). Age older than 68 years (P < 0.01), American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 3 or higher (P < 0.0001), benign findings on imaging (P < 0.0001), and major comorbid conditions (P < 0.01) were factors associated with higher rate of failure to compliance. On multivariate logistic regression, American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 3 or higher and benign features were associated with 4.0 times (95% confidence interval, 2.02–8.06) and 2.6 times (95% confidence interval, 1.60–4.07) higher odds of failure to compliance with guidelines, respectively.

Conclusions

Compliance with clinical guidelines for the management of IPMN is poor. Socioeconomic factors do not seem to create a disparity to care. However, many patients with IPMN have other medical diagnoses that take priority over IPMN surveillance and treatment.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia [^7b13c614]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia is a neoplastic disorder of varying degree and extent that affects the pancreatic ductal epithelium. Clinical presentations may vary from an asymptomatic incidental finding to obstructive jaundice. Harbingers of malignancy include symptoms of jaundice, weight loss, or new-onset diabetes. In the absence of findings that correlate with malignancy, natural history is unknown. Management of these patients is controversial, and should be individualized based on surgical risk.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: a clinicopathologic review [^550ebe85]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is an intraductal mucin-producing epithelial neoplasm that arises from the main pancreatic duct (MD-IPMN), secondary branch ducts (BD-IPMN), or both (mixed type; Mix-IPMN). Neoplastic progression from benign adenoma to invasive adenocarcinoma has not been proven but is generally thought to occur. With increasing recognition of IPMN, our understanding of the diagnosis and management of the tumors is evolving. At present, treatment options for patients with IPMN range from observation to pancreatic resection depending on the natural history of the lesion. This review focuses on currently available data that guide management decisions for patients with IPMN.

The purpose of this work is to provide the reader with an accurate overview focused on the main high-risk lesions of the breast: atypical intraductal epithelial proliferation (AIEDP), lobular neoplasia (including the subcategories lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical lobular hyperplasia), flat epithelial atypia, radial scar and papillary lesions, and phyllodes tumor. Beyond presenting the radiological aspects of these lesions and the recent literature, information about their potential upgrade rates will be discussed in order to provide useful guidance for appropriate clinical management while avoiding the risks of unnecessary surgical intervention (overtreatment). In Table 1, the management and radiological follow-up recommendations for each high-risk lesion have been summarized. We note that further studies are needed to enable a more personalized approach; new diagnostic tools such as artificial intelligence could find their place in tailoring the diagnostic process and determine the appropriate imaging follow-up.

### High-risk lesions of the breast: concurrent diagnostic tools and management recommendations [^4c62c281]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast lesions with uncertain malignant behavior, also known as high-risk or B3 lesions, are composed of a variety of pathologies with differing risks of associated malignancy. While open excision was previously preferred to manage all high-risk lesions, tailored management has been increasingly favored to reduce overtreatment and spare patients from unnecessary anxiety or high healthcare costs associated with surgical excision. The purpose of this work is to provide the reader with an accurate overview focused on the main high-risk lesions of the breast: atypical intraductal epithelial proliferation (atypical ductal hyperplasia), lobular neoplasia (including the subcategories lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical lobular hyperplasia), flat epithelial atypia, radial scar and papillary lesions, and phyllodes tumor. Beyond merely presenting the radiological aspects of these lesions and the recent literature, information about their potential upgrade rates is discussed in order to provide a useful guide for appropriate clinical management while avoiding the risks of unnecessary surgical intervention (overtreatment).

clinical studies. The endpoints currently used in clinical studies supporting FDA approval are cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2+ and 3+. CIN2+ refers to any lesion that is grade CIN2 or greater, including CIN3 and cancer. CIN3+ refers to any lesion that is grade CIN3 or greater. 50% will spontaneously clear within 1–2 years. HR HPV viral load has been identified as a major factor associated with cervical precancer, especially for the alpha 9 genotype family, which contains types 16, 31, 33, 35, 52, and 58. Therefore, HR HPV devices utilize a "clinical cutoff" panel.

Each slide was independently reviewed by. CIN2 lesions in the primary endpoint for cervical disease. These studies have indicated that almost half of all CIN2 lesions will regress spontaneously, with lesions that are negative for HPV types 16 and 18 having the highest rates of regression. For this reason, performance using the CIN3+ endpoint. above, with increased vaccination uptake, it is expected that the prevalence of CIN3 will decrease, resulting in even fewer samples from women with CIN3+ to evaluate. The proportion of CIN2 lesions that are associated with HR HPV infections will also decrease, leaving a higher proportion of benign, regressive lesions in the CIN2+ endpoint. For these reasons, finding a way to enroll a sufficient number of women with CIN3+ histology will be critical in accurately establishing HR HPV device performance. rescreened at the 1 year mark.

This could lead to performance estimates that are not entirely representative of the intended use population. Another risk associated with this approach is that colposcopy referrals are not conducted under a standardized clinical protocol. Referrals would instead be made at the physician's discretion based on SOC HPV and cytology results.

### A retrospective observational study of intraductal breast papilloma and its coexisting lesions: a real-world experience… [^497a7ee6]. ASCO (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract e13558 Background: Breast intraductal papilloma comprises a wide spectrum of lesions, ranging from benign intraductal papilloma to papilloma with foci of atypia or papillary carcinoma, it can harbor occult malignancy also. The management of papilloma remains controversial. Methods: The current study is a retrospective analysis to investigate the intraductal breast papilloma and its coexisting lesions in the real-world practice. We identified 4450 intraductal breast papilloma patients with surgical excision from November 1999 through July 2017 at the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University. Results:

18. 36% intraductal breast papilloma coexisting with malignant lesions of breast,
37. 33% coexisting with atypia hyperplasia, 25. 24% coexisting with benign lesions, only
19. 10% without concomitant.
36. 80% intraductal breast papilloma had nipple discharge,
51. 46% had palpable breast mass.
16.

45%had nipple discharge and palpable breast mass meanwhile.
28. 18% experienced discomfort or asymptomatic.
98. 99% had ultrasonic abnormality and
53. 06% had intraductal hypoechoic by ultrasonic.
31. 89% had mammographic distortion and
14. 45% had microcalcification in mammography. The intraductal breast papilloma with malignancy had significantly relations with clinical manifestations such as palpable breast mass, the concurrent nipple discharge and palpable mass. The coexisting malignancy also related with ultrasonic abnormality, mammographic distortion and microcalcification in mammography, not related with the intraductal hypoechoic by ultrasonic.

Conclusions: Although the sonography and mammography has been proven crucial in identifying the papilloma and its coexisting lesions, more than half of intraductal papilloma coexisting with malignancy or atypia hyperplasia, and the clinical information for papilloma and its coexist lesions are nonspecificity, we recommend a more aggressive approach including surgical excision of all benign intraductal papillary lesions.

### Upgrade rate of intraductal papilloma diagnosed on core needle biopsy in a single institution [^bcd698fe]. Human Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

The management of intraductal papilloma (IDP) diagnosed on core needle biopsy (CNB) is controversial due to the variable upgrade rates to breast carcinoma (BC) on subsequent surgical excision reported in the literature. The purpose of our study was to investigate the upgrade rate of IDP diagnosed on CNB to BC in subsequent surgical excision and the impact of clinical, pathologic, and radiologic variables. This is a retrospective cohort of all women who had a diagnosis of IDP on a CNB between 2005 and 2018 in a tertiary academic center with subsequent surgical excision. Upgrade was defined as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive carcinoma on surgical excision. Statistical analyses included Pearson's chi-square, Wilcoxon rank-sum, and logistic regression. A total of 216 women with IDP in a CNB were included. Nineteen patients (8.8%) upgraded to BC in the overall cohort, including 14 DCIS and 5 invasive carcinomas. An upgrade rate of 27% was found in atypical IDP (14 of 51 cases), while only 3% of pure IDP upgraded to BC (5 of 165 cases). Older age (> 53 years) at the time of biopsy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–1.09, p = 0.027) and concomitant atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) (OR = 9.69, 95% CI = 3.37–27.81, p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with upgrade. Our results support surgical excision of IDP on CNB when associated with ADH or diagnosed in women aged older than 53 years. The low surgical upgrade rate of 3% for pure IDP on CNB in younger women should be part of the management discussion.

Guidelines for Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN) Management

2015 American Gastroenterological Association Guideline on the Diagnosis and Management of Asymptomatic Neoplastic Pancreatic Cysts

These guidelines were established by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) for the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic PCNs (Table 1). The AGA guidelines only address asymptomatic cysts and do not evaluate the impact of symptoms on the management of these cysts. The AGA guidelines were established following a systematic evaluation of the relevant evidence on the management of these pancreatic cysts. An expert consensus was acquired on clinically relevant questions regarding diagnosis and management. The conclusions of the systematic reviews are reported in the AGA's technical reviewand were used by the AGA's Clinical Practice Guideline Committee as the basis for the formal guidelines. Specifically, the recommendations use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Notably, the committee graded all the evidence related to the management of pancreatic cysts to be very low in quality because most of the data were collected from case series. Thus, all their statements were considered conditional and dependent on each patient's situation.

### Current understanding and management of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate [^1824673b]. Current Oncology Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review will discuss current understanding and management approaches of Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P). IDC-P is a histological finding characterized by neoplastic cells that expand but do not invade prostate ducts.

Recent Findings

The presence of IDC-P on a prostate biopsy is almost always associated with an invasive disease component and is independently associated with worse clinical outcomes in both early and late disease. These tumors are enriched for mutations in homologous DNA recombination repair (HRR) leading to high genomic instability. Multiparametric MRI with targeted biopsy may aid in diagnosis. Given the poor clinical outcomes associated with this histologic entity, its presence in biopsies should warrant consideration of aggressive management.

### Papillary neoplasms of the breast: a review [^149e03df]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Interpretation of papillary lesions of the breast remains a challenging task because of the wide morphologic spectrum encountered in the benign, atypical, and malignant subtypes. Data on clinical significance and outcome of papillary lesions, with superimposed atypia or areas similar to ductal carcinoma in situ partially replacing the benign elements, are sparse. Furthermore, complete excision of even a fully developed papillary carcinoma confined to a dilated or cystic duct is associated with an excellent prognosis, whereas a complex papilloma extending into multiple branches of a duct may ultimately recur as a carcinoma because of incomplete excision of microscopic foci. This makes an outcome-based classification difficult.

Objective

An arbitrary yet practical approach to classification is outlined, with discussion of methods to circumvent the various diagnostic difficulties. The limitations in precise diagnosis of papillary lesions in aspirates are addressed, and the implications of finding papillary lesions in core biopsies are discussed. Although the focus is on intraductal lesions, associated invasive carcinomas and invasive micropapillary carcinoma are also presented.

Data Sources

The literature on papillary lesions and invasive micropapillary carcinoma is reviewed.

Conclusions

It would be prudent to completely excise any papillary lesion that has not been entirely removed by the initial core biopsy. The optimal management of localized papillary lesions is complete excision with a small rim of uninvolved breast tissue without any prior needle instrumentation if and when the papillary nature can be determined by imaging. Thus managed, most of these lesions behave indolently, and outcome is usually excellent.

### Management of patients with pancreatic cysts: analysis of possible false-negative cases of malignancy [^b78c98db]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines for pancreatic cyst management have been published by several groups. The strategy for frankly malignant cysts is clearly one of resection, whereas the management of cysts in the absence of frank malignancy remains challenging. While a cautious approach (resection) makes sense when considering the mortality rate of pancreatic cancer, surgery has its own significant mortality and morbidity to consider, especially as most resected pancreatic cysts are found to be benign.–Currently, in the absence of definitive malignancy by cytology, indications for surgery are largely based upon particular morphologic features according to International Consensus Group 2012 (Fukuoka) guidelines. Absolute indications include suspicion of mucinous cystic neoplasm, main duct-associated intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, solid pseudopapillary tumor, or presence of "high-risk stigmata" (obstructive jaundice in a patient with a cystic lesion of the pancreatic head, enhancing solid component, main pancreatic duct ≥ 10 mm). For other cyst types that may have malignant potential but no worrisome morphologic features or high-risk stigmata (eg, branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms), the general recommendation is frequent surveillance at variable intervals based on cyst size. These surveillance interval recommendations have generally been determined based upon physician gestalt, but lack supporting evidence regarding their ability to detect high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and early invasive malignancy.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^9d388a8e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) — post-resection recurrence risk and surveillance intervals: Retrospective studies have reported a high risk of recurrence, 17–65% in IPMNs with pancreatic cancer, and these patients should be followed per pancreatic cancer guidelines. After resection of an IPMN with high-grade dysplasia, recurrence rates of 13–31% are reported and we recommend surveillance with MRI or EUS on a 6-month basis; the median time to recurrence varies from 19 to 47 months, with a wide range of 4 to 180 months. For surgically resected IPMN with low- or intermediate-grade dysplasia, recurrence is 0–22%; in the absence of pancreatic cysts in the remnant, surveillance with MRI every 24 months appears reasonable. If there is an IPMN in the remnant pancreas, patients should be followed based on the size of the largest IPMN, and the shortest surveillance interval should be followed (i.e., if there is a 1.5 cm cyst then surveillance would be yearly).

### Variability in the management recommendations given for high-risk breast lesions detected on image-guided core needle biopsy at U.S. academic institutions [^d8b62b4c]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to describe and compare the management recommendations provided in the setting of a high-risk lesion diagnosed on core needle biopsy of the breast at academic institutions across the United States. We contacted breast imagers at U.S. academic institutions via email and asked them to complete a voluntary online survey. The survey consisted of eight questions regarding the management recommendations given when core biopsy yields various high-risk lesions. We received survey responses from 41 of the 59 institutions contacted (69% response rate). Surgical excision was the most frequently reported recommendation given for all high-risk lesions; however, the proportion varied from 95% for atypical ductal hyperplasia and papilloma with associated atypia, 76% for flat epithelial atypia, 73% for radial scar/complex sclerosing lesion, 71% for lobular carcinoma in-situ, 61% for atypical lobular hyperplasia, to 39% for intraductal papilloma without atypia. Our study demonstrates inconsistency in the management recommendations given for high-risk lesions detected on core needle biopsy at academic institutions nationally. This outcome suggests that patients may benefit from the creation of consensus recommendations for the management of high-risk lesions detected on core needle biopsy.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^f957dfeb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile ducts (IPNB) — risk, epidemiology, subtypes, and management — IPNB is 1 of 3 preinvasive biliary lesions, is a precursor to cholangiocarcinoma, and has a high malignant potential because 40%–80% of IPNB can harbor malignancy. The median age at presentation is 60–66 years with a male-to-female ratio 2:1. There are 4 morphologic subtypes: intraductal mass with proximal duct dilatation, diffuse ductal dilatation without a visible mass, intraductal mass with both proximal and distal ductal dilatation, and focal aneurysmal dilatation of the duct with a cystic and solid intraductal mass. Treatment is surgical resection of the bile duct with or without associated hepatic resection depending on size, extent, and invasiveness, and imaging cannot exclude concomitant cholangiocarcinoma; therefore, a complete resection is needed for accurate histopathologic grading and to assess margins. Continued surveillance imaging is recommended even after surgical resection.

### Imaging approaches to diagnosis and management of common ductal abnormalities [^f72e1e89]. Radiographics (2012). Low credibility.

Ductal disease is an important, often overlooked, and poorly understood issue in breast imaging that results in delays in diagnosis and patient care. The differential diagnosis for an intraductal mass is broad and includes inspissated secretions, infection, hemorrhage, solitary or multiple papillomas, and malignancy. Each breast is composed of eight or more ductal systems, with most disease arising in the terminal ductal-lobular unit. Imaging evaluation of the ductal system usually entails a combination of mammography, galactography, ultrasonography (US), and in some cases magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The most common finding with all modalities is ductal dilatation with a focal or diffuse abnormality. Benign diseases of the ducts include duct ectasia, blocked ducts, inflammatory infiltrates, periductal mastitis, apocrine metaplasia, intraductal papillomas, and papillomatosis. Malignant diseases of the ducts include ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive ductal carcinoma, and Paget disease. Most commonly performed with US or MR imaging guidance, percutaneous biopsy methods are helpful in diagnosis and management of ductal findings. Because most findings are smaller than 1 cm, located within a duct, and thus sometimes not visible after a single pass, vacuum-assisted devices help improve the accuracy of sampling.

### High-risk lesions of the breast: concurrent diagnostic tools and management recommendations [^f39ebc06]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Overall, high-risk lesions have a low risk of malignancy. Nevertheless, up to 35% of lesions of uncertain malignant potential (B3) are subsequently upgraded at surgical specimen to DCIS or low-grade carcinoma. These lesions are highly heterogeneous and can be classified according to the presence or absence of associated atypia. For this reason, some authors suggested a further histological classification for B3 lesions into B3a and B3b depending on whether atypia is absent or present. While open excision was previously preferred to manage all high-risk lesions, tailored management has been increasingly favored to reduce overtreatment and spare patients from unnecessary anxiety or high healthcare costs associated with surgical excision. According to recent guidelines, high-risk lesions may be managed with imaging follow-up, vacuum-assisted excision (VAE) or open excision. In some particular cases such as benign papillomas, VAE is used to replace surgical diagnostic biopsy. Compared to VAB, the sampling in VAE is performed with larger needles (7 gauge to 11 gauge needles) and about 4 g of tissue is removed, which is often estimated by multiplying the number of cores with estimated weight of each core dependent on the needle size. This procedure largely reduces the risk of false-negative results or pathological underestimation. For most patients with small high-risk lesions (< than 20 mm), excision with VAE ensures complete sampling and might be sufficient as the only therapeutic method. For patients with atypical intraductal epithelial proliferation, papilloma with atypia or phyllodes tumor, surgical management is still preferred. As to the time of follow-up and the imaging method to be used in patients with a personal history of a B3 lesion, there is still a lack of evidence to establish comprehensive guidelines.

### Expert consensus on endoscopic papillectomy using a Delphi process [^7d8aa350]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Patient selection.

Although certain features would define a lesion as most likely malignant, none of the mentioned characteristics should be considered as an independent reason to refer for surgical management (Supplementary Table 2).

Considering the risk of incomplete endoscopic resection, consensus exists that patients should be referred for surgical management when ingrowth in the pancreatic duct (PD) or common bile duct (CBD) of > 1 cm is present (76%) (Table 1). Jaundice (86%), ingrowth in the PD (79%) or CBD ≤ 1 cm (86%), and classification as an umbilicated lesion (a sign of central retraction) (82%) are not considered independent reasons to refer the patient for surgical management (Table 2). Nonetheless, no consensus exists on which additional techniques should be used to endoscopically resect ingrowth in the CBD or PD ≤ 1 cm (Supplementary Table 2–3). Furthermore, no agreement exists that intraductal extension should be ruled out routinely before resection (53%) (Supplementary Table 2).

Moreover, in case a patient is unfit for surgery, endoscopic resection can, if technically feasible, still be considered in case of adenocarcinoma (75%) or ingrowth in the CBD > 1 cm (81%) (Table 2). Additionally, intraductal radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been successfully described in small studies. – Accordingly, experts agree that EP with the additional use of RFA can be considered in a patient who is not a surgical candidate when ingrowth in the CBD > 1 cm is present (75%) (Table 1). However, no consensus exists whether to consider endoscopic resection in combination with RFA when surgery is still an option (44%) (Supplementary Table 3).

### Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct: clinical, imaging, and pathologic features [^03717ae7]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

We outline the concept of intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB), discuss the morphologic features of IPNB and the differential diagnoses, and describe the radiologic approaches used in multidisciplinary management.

Conclusion

The concept of IPNB has been evolving. Because the imaging features of IPNB can be variable, different mimickers according to IPNB subtype can be considered. A multimodality approach is essential to obtain an optimal diagnosis and establish treatment plans.

### Management of benign intraductal solitary papilloma diagnosed on core needle biopsy [^5e52f00c]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to determine whether surgical excision of benign solitary intraductal papillomas (BSIP) diagnosed by core needle biopsy (CNBx) without an associated high-risk lesion and concordant with imaging is justified.

Methods

A review of all papillary lesions diagnosed by CNBx from January 2003 to June 2010 was performed. Available histologic and radiologic materials were evaluated in a blinded fashion by three pathologists and three dedicated breast radiologists, respectively, to assess for concordance. The papillary lesions were designated as benign, atypical, or malignant. There were 16 BSIPs excluded because of an adjacent high-risk lesion or same-quadrant ipsilateral cancer. All immediate and delayed excisional specimens were reviewed. Clinical and radiologic data were recorded.

Results

A total of 299 papillary lesions diagnosed on CNBx and concordant with imaging were identified. Of these, 240 (80%) were classified as benign, 49 (16%) atypical, and 10 (3%) malignant. After exclusions, 77 of 224 women in our study cohort (34%) underwent surgical excision with no atypical or malignant upgrades. Of the remaining 147 women diagnosed with a BSIP on CNBx, 47 (32%) were lost to follow-up and 100 (68%) were observed. All 100 observed patients had stable imaging findings at follow-up (4.8–93.8 months, mean 36.0 months).

Conclusions

The likelihood of diagnosing atypia or malignancy after surgical excision of a BSIP diagnosed on CNBx without associated high-risk lesion or ipsilateral quadrant malignancy is extremely low. For this distinct subset of patients with a BSIP, these data justify close imaging follow-up, rather than surgical excision.

### High-risk lesions of the breast: concurrent diagnostic tools and management recommendations [^76f1ecaa]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Papillary lesions

Papillary lesions include a large number of rare lesions, accounting for approximately 3% of all breast malignancies. They are seen most frequently in women aged 30–50 years old; by contrast, they are rarely reported in adolescents. Papillary lesions may be classified as solitary intraductal papillomas, multiple intraductal papillomas, papillomas with atypia, papillomas with DCIS, and papillary invasive carcinomas. Their appearances in the breast vary clinically, radiologically, and pathologically, and familiarity with the features of malignant and benign papillary lesions is required to plan management.

Histopathology

Papillary lesions are composed of papillary fronds which are attached to the inner mammary ductal wall through a fibrovascular core and which extend into the lumen of the duct (Fig. 5 b). Ductal epithelial and myoepithelial cells line the fibrovascular core, and it is these epithelial cells that can undergo degrees of apocrine metaplasia. From the histological point of view, papillary lesions are an inhomogeneous group of lesions, classified by the WHO as follows:
Papilloma without atypia
Papilloma with atypia (ADH or classical LN), both belonging to the B3 category on BI-RADS (small solitary papillomas (< 2 mm) can be categorized as B2 lesion, if the lesion is completely surrounded by a duct structure)
Papilloma with DCIS or papilloma completely involved by more extended DCIS (encapsulated papillary carcinoma)
Solid papillary carcinoma belonging to B4 or B5a category

Usually, papillary lesions can be divided according to their localization into two main groups: central (generally isolated), i.e. arising from the ducts of the sub-areolar region sparing TDLU; and peripheral (generally multiple), i.e. originating from TDLU following the involvement of galactophorous ducts.

### Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate: a distinct histopathological entity with important prognostic implications [^13e63137]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDCP) has been described as a lesion associated with poor prognostic features in prostate cancer. Its recognition and reporting in prostate specimens, particularly in needle biopsies, is critical as it carries significant implications for patient management. Recent histological definitions have been proposed to assist in the recognition of IDCP and to help distinguish it from lesions with similar appearance, but different clinical behaviour. In this review, a historical overview of the description of IDCP will be presented followed by a summary of the current histological diagnostic criteria and the recommendations for management and reporting of IDCP.

### Papillary lesions of the breast: selected diagnostic and management issues [^f8674c1b]. Histopathology (2008). Low credibility.

The assessment and categorization of papillary lesions remains one of the most challenging areas in breast pathology. In this review, we will focus on several diagnostic and management issues related to papillary breast lesions that are frequently encountered in daily practice. These include: (i) the distinctions among papillomas with atypia (atypical papillomas), papillomas with ductal carcinoma in situ, and papillary ductal carcinoma in situ; (ii) recent developments in our understanding of encapsulated ('intracystic') papillary carcinomas and solid papillary carcinomas; and (iii) the impact of core needle biopsy on management decisions and specimen evaluation. The role of immunohistochemistry in the evaluation of these lesions, particularly the role of myoepithelial cell markers, will be emphasized.

### Papillary neoplasms of the breast: WHO classification, multimodality imaging, and radiologic-pathologic correlation [^7f39d4b0]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

The fifth edition of the World Health Organization Classification system for breast tumors defines five distinct categories of papillary breast neoplasms characterized by papillary architecture composed of arborizing fibrovascular cores. The lesions span a wide spectrum of benign, atypical, and malignant neoplasms classified based on the nature of proliferating epithelial cells and the presence or absence of basal myoepithelial cells. The pathologic diagnosis of different papillary lesions on the basis of core needle biopsy can be challenging due to limited tissue sampling, artifacts, and overlapping morphologic features and immunohistochemical staining patterns. A distinction must be made between noninvasive and invasive forms of malignant papillary tumors because the prognostic staging and clinical management differ. A recent paradigm shift in management strategy favors a more conservative approach of surveillance rather than routine surgical excision for benign intraductal papillomas without atypia. The authors provide an overview of the various papillary lesions of the breast and their WHO classification. A description of the clinical, multimodality imaging, and histopathologic features is provided, along with an illustrative review of radiologic-pathologic correlation. Understanding the histologic and biologic spectrum of papillary lesions and radiologic-pathologic correlation is key for clinical management. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### The landmark series: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas-from prevalence to early cancer detection [^56d023ca]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Indications for Surgery

The indications for surgery in these guidelines are listed in detail in Table 1. For main duct IPMN (MD-IPMN), the recommendation from the IAP guidelines is surgical resection for all surgical candidates with main pancreatic duct diameter > 10 mm, jaundice, or mural nodules; however, the European guidelines recommend that all patients with MD-IPMN should undergo resection if they are fit for surgery. Both the European and IAP guidelines describe the value of frozen section biopsies to determine the extent of resection. In both guidelines, additional resection is warranted to obtain a negative margin if invasive cancer or high-grade dysplasia is found at the initial resection margin, whereas further resection is not necessary if low-grade dysplasia is discovered at the margin.

From the AGA guidelines, the general indications for surgery for asymptomatic pancreatic cysts include both a solid component and a dilated pancreatic duct and/or concerning features on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and fine-needle aspiration (FNA). The concerning features on EUS/FNA include solid component, dilated duct, or positive cytology. Because the presence of these concerning features increases the risk for malignancy, surgery is recommended for these patients as it would reduce the risk of mortality from carcinoma. In addition, AGA guidelines suggest that surgical candidates be referred to centers that have demonstrated expertise in pancreas surgery in order to decrease immediate postoperative mortality and optimize long-term survival.

For BD-IPMN, a generally conservative management strategy is suggested in the IAP guidelines for patients without features that predict invasive carcinoma or high-grade dysplasia. The IAP guidelines also describe the absolute indications for resection of BD-IPMNs, which are positive cytology for high-grade dysplasia and the presence of mural nodules ≥ 5 mm. Notably, cyst size alone is not considered an appropriate parameter to indicate surgery; however, cysts > 2 cm in patients < 65 years of age are considered as candidates for resection given the lifelong cumulative risk of high-grade dysplasia and invasive carcinoma. The European guidelines share the same absolute indications as the IAP guidelines in addition to the presence of jaundice and solid mass. Relative indications for surgery listed in the European guidelines prompt consideration of surgery, while the equivalent worrisome features in the IAP guidelines require EUS to be performed, and only to consider surgery if specific features are present (Table 1).

### Proper management and follow-up strategy of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^aceadb75]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

It has been reported that main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms are more invasive and have a worse prognosis than branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Therefore, an aggressive surgical approach has mainly been recommended for all MD-IPMNs. However, the surgical management of BD-IPMNs has been controversial and the consensus guidelines are not specific for an indicator of malignancy in BD-IPMNs. The objective of this study was to determine the proper management and follow-up strategy of BD-IPMNs.

Methods

We monitored and analysed patients with presumed BD-IPMNs between March 1995 and March 2010.

Result

The mean value of the initial cyst size in all patients with BD-IPMNs was 2.19 cm. Amongst 194 patients with BD-IPMNs, 34 underwent immediate surgical resection, 152 were followed conservatively. Amongst the 152 conservatively managed patients, 18 (11.8%) underwent surgical resection after a median follow-up of 12.7 months (range, 3–48 months). In 132 patients who were managed conservatively without surgery, the mean incremental rate of cyst size growth was 0.0038 cm/month during a median of 30.7 months of follow-up and there were no IPMN-related deaths.

Conclusion

Amongst patients with BD-IPMNs, about 10% have surgery within approximately 1 year from the time of diagnosis because of the occurrence of new malignant stigmata. Therefore, a conservative approach without surgery and careful follow-up every 3 months or 6 months during the first year after diagnosis can be safely advocated in patients with BD-IPMNs larger than 10mm in size who have no risk factors for malignant IPMNs.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts [^ebd4cd7c]. Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline on asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts focuses on adult patients with cysts detected by radiology and uses the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework phrased in the population, intervention, comparator, outcome (PICO) format. The scope pertains only to asymptomatic pancreatic neoplastic cysts, does not evaluate the impact of symptoms, and excludes solid papillary neoplasms, cystic degeneration of adenocarcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, and main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) without side branch involvement. Incidental identification is common with modern imaging, and subsequent evaluations and interventions can be invasive, expensive, and harmful. Management emphasizes identifying the small minority of cysts with early invasive cancer or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) so that appropriately timed surgical resection can reduce mortality, while acknowledging that surgery is associated with significant morbidity and some mortality. Common diagnostic tools — including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology — have suboptimal sensitivities and specificities for identifying patients at highest risk. For each PICO statement, both the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation are provided, with quality described on a 4-point scale from high to very low.

### Pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm masquerading as ampullary adenoma: a diagnostic puzzle [^f15bfe17]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cystic lesions of the pancreas are increasingly found on imaging investigations, mostly on magnetic resonance scans. Most of these cysts are asymptomatic; however, symptoms such as pancreatitis episodes, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting and jaundice may arise according to the cyst's location, size and nature. The fundamental question regarding the clinical management of a pancreatic cystic lesion lies in the malignant potential associated with this cyst. Several reviews and guidelines exist on the appropriate work-up and management of pancreatic cysts.

On the other hand, the management of ampullary adenomas has been revolutionized by endoscopic treatment and management, with the advent of endoscopic papillectomy (EP), and advances in endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and ERCP. Treatment modalities for ampullary tumors have included pancreatoduodenectomy and transduodenal excision, which are surgical procedures, and endoscopic papillectomy. Ampullary adenomas seem to follow the well-established adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence; they are thus considered premalignant and warrant endoscopic or surgical resection. The indications for EP are under constant review and expanding, while size larger than 5 cm, ulceration, friability or spontaneous bleeding are contraindications for EP. Intraductal extension is another contraindication for EP and can be assessed by EUS or ERCP. EUS performs similarly to ERCP in evaluating intraductal extension.

In the case presented above, obstructive jaundice and the endoscopic image of an ampullary mass suggested the diagnosis of ampullary adenoma. The dilatation of both bile and pancreatic ducts was attributed to obstruction from the adenoma. MRCP and ERCP did not show any intraductal extension and despite the large size, initial treatment with en bloc EP was deemed reasonable. On recurrence though, this study emphasizes the need for further sampling and reevaluation of the patient. A rare pathology, an IPMN protruding through Vater's ampulla, was actually the underlying lesion, but was not accurately diagnosed in the first instance, even histopathologically. The latter cannot easily differentiate between an ampullary tubulovillous adenoma and a papillary mucinous tumor, without the relevant clinical suspicion. In conclusion, IPMN should be included in the differential diagnosis for endoscopically detected ampullary adenomas, especially in the presence of a grossly dilated pancreatic duct.

### High-risk lesions of the breast: concurrent diagnostic tools and management recommendations [^6ce41dd8]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Papillomas can be asymptomatic and detected at routine breast screening. However, when symptomatic, they can be present as a palpable mass near the nipple or with bloody nipple discharge, in up to 20–50% of cases, due to pedicle torsion. Mammography is limited with poor sensitivity and specificity; when visible, mammographic findings are represented by asymmetric areas of increased density, dilated ducts, or solitary lesions with associated microcalcifications. Since the features of papillary lesion at mammography can be non-specific, the main role of this technique is the detection of microcalcifications that can be suspicious and related to papillary malignant lesions (Fig. 7).

Fig. 7
Three different cases of solitary papillomas. 1. a, b Ultrasound shows dilated ducts and an oval and isoechoic intraductal mass with a fibrovascular stem, demonstrated with color Doppler imaging. 2. c, d Ultrasound shows a complex cystic mass with dominant cystic component within a small solid nodule. 3. e Mammography demonstrates a lobular isodense mass in the retroareolar region and (f) ultrasound shows a corresponding intraductal mass

Breast ultrasound is of great value in the diagnosis of papillomas, whether conventional ultrasound, Doppler ultrasound, or elastography. Ultrasound may demonstrate a solid, round mass; a mass with well-defined borders; an intra-cystic mass; or a hypo-echoic, well-defined mass in a dilated duct. The fibrovascular stalk of papillomas can be further assessed with color or power Doppler ultrasound. Elastography can show increased stiffness of the area within the duct which increases the degree of suspicion of malignancy, which can be helpful in differential diagnosis.

MRI is useful for determining the extent of disease in cases when a diagnosis of papilloma has already been established. MRI allows a comprehensive assessment including the identification of connections with the ductal system and a more accurate estimation of disease extent in cases of malignant papillary lesions. The MRI protocol should include acquisitions before and after intravenous contrast administration, due to the significant enhancement of small papillary lesions. MR ductography images can also be obtained to map the entire breast ductal system, whereby the ductal system would be characterized by strong enhancement in which papillomas can be detected as defects (Table 3).

### High-risk lesions of the breast: concurrent diagnostic tools and management recommendations [^6047dd23]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Prognosis

The risk of an invasive cancer onset is two times that of the normal population for the central form and three times for the peripheral form, with a higher risk of invasive cancer onset of up to 7.5% in the case of papilloma with atypia. The diagnosis of multiple peripheral papillomas (so-called "papillomatosis") at CNB increases the risk of an invasive breast carcinoma or DCIS up to 30% (if atypia is present).

It is important to note that the upgrade rates for papillary lesions vary widely in the literature and may be as low as 3.1% for solitary papillomas. Several studies have attempted to identify which patients among those with papillary lesions are suitable for surgery, focusing on clinical, radiological, and histological features that can predict the upgrade rate after percutaneous biopsy. In their study, Qaemali et al. investigated whether histologic findings (necrotic foci and calcifications) or clinical data (age, symptoms) could predict malignancy, demonstrating that none of those factors achieved a statistical significance for that purpose. On the contrary, other researchers have found that microcalcifications (identified histologically), lesion size (at least > 1 cm), older patient age, and certain histologic features are among the factors that are most predictive of upgrade to malignancy. Khan et al. evaluated the rate of concurrent malignancies for intraductal papilloma diagnosed at CNB and assessed the long-term risk of developing a breast cancer, obtaining an upgrade after surgery of 7.5% for intraductal papillomas that were atypia-free vs 32% for those with atypia and 33% for patients with simultaneous ADH/ALH. Other studies focused on the type of needle used, which resulted in an upgrade rate ranging from 0 to 12% for papillomas without atypia when a CNB is performed, while no upgrade to malignancy has been reported for papillomas without atypia diagnosed with VAB. For papillomas with atypia, the upgrade rates to malignancy are more variable, ranging from 21 to 72% for diagnosis at CNB and from 0 to 28% for diagnosis at VAB (Table 2).

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: have IAP consensus guidelines changed our approach? results from a multi-institutional study [^81e74a2d]. Annals of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the influence of consensus guidelines on the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and the subsequent changes in pathologic outcomes.

Background

Over time, multiple guidelines have been developed to identify high-risk IPMN. We hypothesized that the development and implementation of guidelines should have increased the percentage of resected IPMN with high-risk disease.

Methods

Memorial Sloan-Kettering (MSK), Johns Hopkins (JH), and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) databases were queried for resected IPMN (2000–2015). Patients were categorized into main-duct (MD-IPMN) versus branch-duct (BD-IPMN). Guideline-specific radiographic/endoscopic features were recorded. High-risk disease was defined as high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma. Fisher's exact test was used to detect differences between institutions. Logistic regression evaluated differences between time-points [preguidelines (pre-GL, before 2006), Sendai (SCG, 2006–2012), Fukuoka (FCG, after 2012)].

Results

The study included 1210 patients. The percentage of BD-IPMN with ≥ 1 high-risk radiographic feature differed between centers (MSK 69%, JH 60%, MGH 45%; P < 0.001). In MD-IPMN cohort, the presence of radiographic features such as solid component and main pancreatic duct diameter ≥ 10mm also differed (solid component: MSK 38%, JH 30%, MGH 18%; P < 0.001; duct ≥ 10mm: MSK 49%, JH 32%, MGH 44%; P < 0.001). The percentage of high-risk disease on pathology, however, was similar between institutions (BD-IPMN: P = 0.36, MD-IPMN: P = 0.48). During the study period, the percentage of BD-IPMN resected with ≥ 1 high-risk feature increased (52% pre-GL vs 67% FCG; P = 0.005), whereas the percentage of high-risk disease decreased (pre-GL vs FCG: 30% vs 20%). For MD-IPMN, there was not a clear trend towards guideline adherence, and the rate of high-risk disease was similar over the time (pre-GL vs FCG: 69% vs 67%; P = 0.63).

Conclusion

Surgical management of IPMN based on radiographic criteria is variable between institutions, with similar percentages of high-risk disease. Over the 15-year study period, the rate of BD-IPMN resected with high-risk radiographic features increased; however, the rate of high-risk disease decreased. Better predictors are needed.

### High-risk lesions of the breast: concurrent diagnostic tools and management recommendations [^cff492fa]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Management

Certain clinical and imaging factors including patient age, lesion multiplicity, and peripheral location are associated with increased breast cancer risk. Overall, management depends on a number of factors, including age at diagnosis, lesion type, and presence of atypia. As previously mentioned, it is well established that a papillary lesion with atypia diagnosed at CNB can show malignant evolvement or simultaneous malignancy. The histopathological assessment of papillary lesions with atypia requires the pathologist to assess the size of the area of atypia which cannot be measured if it is distributed between multiple cores. Papilloma with atypia should undergo surgical excision, according to NHSBSP. For papillomas without atypia, management options are variable. A papillary lesion which has already undergone CNB or VAB does not need to undergo further surgical excision if the histologic sample is sufficient (100 mm²) and an agreement with imaging findings is found; for papillomatosis, surgery is recommended. Current recommendations from the second International Consensus Conference on lesions of uncertain malignant potential (B3) is that a papillary lesion that is visible on imaging should undergo VAE. For larger lesions that cannot be completely removed, surgery is recommended. The NHSBSP suggests VAE as a second assessment tool in cases where a papillary lesion without atypia is diagnosed at VAB or CNB (Table 1).

### Do all presumed BD-IPMNs require lifelong surveillance? Clinical outcomes and implications of guidelines-based discontinuation [^2d8809d7]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of presumed branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs) without worrisome features (WF) or high-risk stigmata (HRS) remains controversial, particularly regarding the duration of surveillance.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective single-center study including patients with presumed BD-IPMNs without WF or HRS at diagnosis, followed between 2014 and 2023. Clinical, radiological, and pathological data were collected. Outcomes included malignant progression, surgery, and mortality. Subgroup analyses assessed patients with ≥ 5years of follow-up, potentially meeting discontinuation criteria.

Results

413 patients met inclusion criteria. Median age at diagnosis was 65 years; 64% were women. Median cyst size was 10 mm, and median follow-up 36 months. WF developed in 20% of patients and HRS in 0.7%. Four patients (0.26/100 person-years) experienced malignant progression, all within 30 months from diagnosis; two underwent surgery, revealing adenocarcinoma in both. In 108 patients followed ≥ 5 years, 89 remained stable. None developed cancer, required surgery, or died from BD-IPMN. Seven developed WF after 5 years. Depending on criteria, 49% according to Marchegiani and 63% according to Kyoto would qualify for discontinuation of surveillance.

Conclusions

In real-world practice, malignant progression of presumed BD-IPMNs without WF/HRS is rare and tends to occur early. After 5 years of stability, surveillance discontinuation may be safe in selected subgroups, although prospective validation is needed.

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^5685ea6f]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas is a disease with a high prevalence. It is estimated that the prevalence of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) in the general population is approximately 20–30% and that half of these are IPMNs. While it is recognized that IPMNs can progress to cancer, the high prevalence of IPMNs and the low incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) in the general population indicate that only a minority of IPMNs progress to invasive carcinoma. Considering that IPMN of the pancreas was defined by the World Health Organization only as recently as in 1996, there is a lack of information regarding the natural history of these neoplasms and in particular regarding long-term prognosis. Published data show that the risk for cancer differs according to the epithelial type of IPMN and that it is higher in IPMNs affecting the main pancreatic duct, either in isolation or combined with branch duct involvement (main-duct or mixed-type IPMNs, respectively). For this reason, current guidelines recommend surgical resection for all IPMNs with involvement of the main pancreatic duct, provided the patient is fit for surgery. In contrast, the risk for cancer is significantly lower for IPMNs that are limited to branch ducts (branch-duct IPMN); therefore, surgical resection is considered to be an indication in only a minority of patients with branch-duct IPMN. However, because it is currently not possible to predict which of the IPMNs that do not require surgical resection will progress to cancer, a large proportion of patients require life-long follow-up. Data from the literature support the current conservative management of the majority of patients with "small" (< 3–4 cm) branch-duct IPMNs, who do not have IPMN-related symptoms and do not present worrisome radiological features. Invasive carcinoma is reported to develop during follow-up in 1–11% of patients.–The risk for pancreatic cancer developing at a distance from the IPMN also seems to be increased, with a 5-year incidence reported in approximately 7% of patients under surveillance and a standardized incidence ratio of 15.8- to 26-fold. Even though published data support the safety of surveillance for the majority of patients with IPMN, experiences are not uniformly positive. This is most likely explained by the use of different inclusion criteria and different indications for surgery or surveillance as well as by the small size of some of the study cohorts.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^9a06d564]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cyst management — patients who should have no further evaluation include those for whom Patients who are not medically fit for surgery should not undergo further evaluation of incidentally found pancreatic cysts, irrespective of cyst size (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) and asymptomatic cysts diagnosed as pseudocysts on initial imaging and clinical history or as serous cystadenomas do not require treatment or further evaluation (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Supporting risk data in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) cohorts show that among 725 patients 55% underwent resection and 45% underwent surveillance; after a median follow-up of 5 years, 24% of the patients had died and 78% of the deaths were not related to IPMNs, with the chance of a non-IPMN-related death within 3 years of diagnosis 11-fold higher for patients with a CACI of 7 or more and the median survival time for patients with a CACI score of ≥ 7 43 months. An additional series of 793 patients with IPMN reported that during a median follow-up of 50 months, 15% died, with causes of death pancreatic cancer in 26%, extrapancreatic cancer in 38%, other diseases in 32%, and unknown in 3.4%.

### Branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: does cyst size change the tip of the scale? A critical analysis of the revised international consensus guidelines in a large single-institutional series [^5b77df50]. Annals of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to critically analyze the safety of the revised guidelines, with focus on cyst size and worrisome features in the management of BD-IPMN.

Background

The Sendai guidelines for management of branch duct (BD) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) espouse safety of observation of asymptomatic cysts smaller than 3 cm without nodules (Sendai negative). Revised international consensus guidelines published in 2012 suggest a still more conservative approach, even for lesions of 3 cm or larger. By contrast, 2 recent studies have challenged the safety of both guidelines, describing invasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ in 67% of BD-IPMN smaller than 3 cm and in 25% of "Sendai-negative" BD-IPMN.

Methods and Results

Review of a prospective database identified 563 patients with BD-IPMN. A total of 240 patients underwent surgical resection (152 at the time of diagnosis and 88 after being initially followed); the remaining 323 have been managed by observation with median follow-up of 60 months. No patient developed unresectable BD-IPMN carcinoma during follow-up. Invasive cancer arising in BD-IPMN was found in 23 patients of the entire cohort (4%), and an additional 21 patients (3.7%) had or developed concurrent pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. According to the revised guidelines, 76% of resected BD-IPMN with carcinoma in situ and 95% of resected BD-IPMN with invasive cancer had high-risk stigmata or worrisome features. The risk of high-grade dysplasia in nonworrisome lesions smaller than 3 cm was 6.5%, but when the threshold was raised to greater than 3 cm, it was 8.8%, and 1 case of invasive carcinoma was found.

Conclusions

Expectant management of BD-IPMN following the old guidelines is safe, whereas caution is advised for larger lesions, even in the absence of worrisome features.

### Identification of patients with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and very low risk of cancer: multicentre study [^7d61cff5]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the general population, the prevalence of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas is around 8 per cent. Most lesions are branch-duct (BD) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), which are usually detected incidentally. They have a more indolent behaviour than mixed-type or main-duct IPMNs. In 2006, international consensus guidelinesincorporated non-operative management for low-risk asymptomatic IPMNs less than 30 mm in size, with negative cytology, and without nodules and main pancreatic duct (MPD) dilatation. Updates of the guidelines in 2012and 2017introduced two categories of risk for malignancy, namely worrisome features (WF) and high-risk stigmata (HRS), and surveillance was recommended for BD-IPMNs lacking these features. A similar approach was proposed in the 2018 European guidelines, and has been validated by different studies. Internationaland Europeanguidelines propose a different surveillance schedule for low-risk BD-IPMNs, but they are concordant in supporting lifetime observation unless patients become unfit for surgery. A more liberal approach has been suggested by the American Gastroenterological Association guidelines, which include discontinuation of surveillance after 5 years in the absence of significant changes. Although lifetime surveillance is costly, a general recommendation for discontinuation after 5 years may be inappropriate. Therefore, studying the progression of low-risk BD-IPMN is clinically relevant for a better definition of surveillance timing and possible discontinuation in selected patients. The aim of the present study was to describe the natural history of low-risk BD-IPMNs, to identify risk factors for the development of WF/HRS and pancreatic malignancies, and to eventually define a subgroup of patients at low or no risk of progression over time.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^8e61d480]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

ASGE guideline — Choledocholithiasis management recommendations include: In patients with intermediate risk of choledocholithiasis we suggest either EUS or MRCP given high specificity; consider factors including patient preference, local expertise, and availability. In patients with gallstone pancreatitis without cholangitis or biliary obstruction/choledocholithiasis we recommend against urgent (< 48 hours) ERCP. In patients with large choledocholithiasis we suggest performing large balloon dilation after sphincterotomy rather than endoscopic sphincterotomy alone. For patients with large and difficult choledocholithiasis we suggest intraductal therapy or conventional therapy with papillary dilation; this may be impacted by local expertise, cost, patient and physician preferences.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^1df7559d]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is characterized by enhanced mucus secretion. It is a benign or low-grade neoplasm associated with a dilated main pancreatic duct, patulous ampullary orifice, and abundant mucus secretion. Foci of aggressive cancer may arise and become invasive. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure IPMN, but the extent of pancreatic resection and the intraoperative margins remain areas of controversy. The risks of total pancreatectomy must be weighed against the risk for developing cancer in the residual pancreas. Risks must be factored against the natural course of the disease and the likelihood of malignancy developing over the life expectancy.

### Evaluation of the guidelines for management of pancreatic branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [^83bd87fc]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The 2006 Sendai Consensus Guidelines recommend surgical resection for all suspected branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (BD-IPMN) greater than 3 cm irrespective of symptoms, and those less than 3 cm with worrisome features. We aimed to evaluate the surgical characteristics of these guidelines retrospectively in pathologically confirmed cases of BD-IPMN.

Methods

IPMNs resected at our institution (1995–2006) were classified as main-duct predominant or branch-duct (BD) predominant based on preoperative imaging and postoperative histology. Resected BD-IPMNs were classified histologically: low risk (adenoma, borderline) and high risk (carcinoma in situ or invasive cancer). Clinical data (presence of symptoms, mural nodule, dilated pancreatic duct, and cyst size) were correlated with pathology.

Results

Between 1995 and 2006, there were 204 patients who underwent surgical resection of pancreatic cysts. Sixty-one patients had IPMN including 31 with BD-IPMN. A total of 74.2% (23 of 31) of BD-IPMNs would have been recommended for surgical resection including 69.2% (18 of 26) of low-risk lesions and 100% (5 of 5) of high-risk lesions. All 8 cases of BD-IPMN that would have been recommended for nonsurgical management were low-risk lesions. The positive predictive value of the guidelines is 21.7% (95% confidence interval, 9.7%-41.9%). The negative predictive value is 100% (95% confidence interval, 67.6%-100.0%). Between 2000 and 2007, 351 patients with likely BD-IPMN were evaluated but not resected.

Conclusions

Implementation of the Consensus Guidelines to our single-institution, referral-based, surgical BD-IPMN population would have recommended resection of all histologically high-risk lesions. All lesions recommended for nonsurgical management were histologically low-risk lesions. For presumed BD-IPMNs less than 3 cm, the application of the Consensus Guidelines may reduce the resection rate for low-risk lesions.

Figure 3
Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. The dilatation of the main pancreatic duct can be observed

The differential diagnosis of cystically dilated side branches includes serous cystadenoma or mucinous cystic neoplasm. Sometimes IPMN can be confused with chronic pancreatitis, but the normal appearing pancreatic parenchyma and the presence of mucus are in favor of IPMN. However, chronic pancreatitis can complicate the course of IPMN as a result of ductal obstruction from the tumor or the mucus. Imaging features suggestive of malignant transformation include a large unilocular cystic area, focal hypoechoic areas, or mural nodules. Aggressive tumors can invade the duodenum or the common bile duct, adjacent lymph nodes, vascular structures and peripancreatic space.

After the diagnosis of an IPMN, a recommendation for surgical resection is usually made if the patient is a good surgical candidate, taking into account comorbidities, patient's age and IPMN subtype. In 2006, the working group of the International Association of Pancreatology proposed Consensus Guidelines for the management of BDT-IPMN (Sendai Consensus Guidelines). These guidelines recommend surgical resection for all BDT-IPMN greater than 3 cm irrespective of symptoms, and for all BDT-IPMNs less than 3 cm with any one of several worrisome features including the presence of cyst-related symptoms, mural nodule, or a dilated pancreatic duct greater than 6 mm. For presumed BDT-IPMNs less than 3 cm, the application of the Consensus Guidelines may reduce the resection rate for low-risk lesions.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) — distribution, multiplicity, malignancy risk, and fluid characteristics are outlined, noting multifocality and elevated carcinoembryonic antigen in cyst fluid. IPMNs may involve side branches only, the main duct, or a combination of both termed mixed IPMN, in up to 40% of cases multiple IPMNs occur, main duct IPMN has a high risk of malignancy with 38–68% harboring high-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer in resected specimens, and when fluid is obtained the cyst fluid CEA is usually elevated.

### Should we excise? Are there any clinical or histologic features that predict upgrade in papillomas, incidental or non-incidental? [^31119d86]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical decision to excise intraductal papilloma (IDP) without atypia diagnosed on biopsy remains controversial. We sought to establish clinical and histologic predictors (if any) which may predict upgrade in IDP. 296 biopsies (in 278 women) with histologic diagnosis of IDP without atypia were retrospectively identified and placed into Incidental (no corresponding imaging correlate), or Non-incidental (positive imaging correlate) groups. 253/296 (85.5%) cases were non-incidental, and 43/296 (14.5%) were incidental. 73.1% (185/253) non-incidental and 48.8% (21/43) incidental cases underwent excision. 12.4% (23/185) non-incidental cases underwent an upgrade to cancer or high-risk lesion; namely 8-Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 8-atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), 6-lobular neoplasia, and 1-flat epithelial atypia. There was no histopathologic feature on the biopsy in the non-incidental group which predicted upgrade; however a past history of atypia was significantly associated with upgrade. 2 of the 21 incidental cases upgraded (1 to ADH and 1 to lobular neoplasia); the former had a past history of ADH. Both incidental upgrades were > 1 mm in size, and were not completely excised on the biopsy. None of the incidental cases which appeared completely excised on biopsy upgraded, irrespective of the size on biopsy. These findings suggest that all non-incidental IDPs should be considered candidates for surgical excision, given the 12.4% upgrade rate and no definitive histologic predictors of upgrade. Patients with incidental IDPs (if < 1 mm, completely excised on biopsy and with no history of high risk breast lesion) can be spared excision.

### Microcalcification is an important factor in the management of breast intraductal papillomas diagnosed on core biopsy [^4f1469bb]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

The follow-up excision (FUE) results were analyzed from 370 cases diagnosed as intraductal papilloma on breast core needle biopsy (CNB) with no history of malignancy or other risk factors. Of these cases, 98.6% were rendered a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score of 4 on mammography before the CNB. Fifty-one cases (13.8%) were found to have microcalcifications on microscopic examination of CNB. A total of 7 (1.9%) of 370 cases were upgraded to invasive carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ, or pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ on FUE. Six of 51 (11.8%) cases with microcalcifications found on imaging and CNB were upgraded to ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma, whereas only 1 (0.3%) of 319 cases without microcalcifications was upgraded to pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (P = 0.003). Results of a multivariate analysis adjusted for age confirmed that microcalcifications was a risk factor for upgrading to cancer, independent of age. Our results indicate that surgical excision is required for intraductal papilloma diagnosed on CNB if microcalcifications are present. However, excision may not be required for those who have no microcalcifications on CNB and no other known risk factors.

### European evidence-based guidelines on pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^9256c34d]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines on the management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN) are lacking. This guideline is a joint initiative of the European Study Group on Cystic Tumours of the Pancreas, United European Gastroenterology, European Pancreatic Club, European-African Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association, European Digestive Surgery, and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. It replaces the 2013 European consensus statement guidelines on PCN. European and non-European experts performed systematic reviews and used GRADE methodology to answer relevant clinical questions on nine topics (biomarkers, radiology, endoscopy, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), serous cystic neoplasm, rare cysts, (neo)adjuvant treatment, and pathology). Recommendations include conservative management, relative and absolute indications for surgery. A conservative approach is recommended for asymptomatic MCN and IPMN measuring < 40 mm without an enhancing nodule. Relative indications for surgery in IPMN include a main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter between 5 and 9.9 mm or a cyst diameter ≥ 40 mm. Absolute indications for surgery in IPMN, due to the high-risk of malignant transformation, include jaundice, an enhancing mural nodule > 5 mm, and MPD diameter > 10 mm. Lifelong follow-up of IPMN is recommended in patients who are fit for surgery. The European evidence-based guidelines on PCN aim to improve the diagnosis and management of PCN.

### Surgical follow-up and clinical presentation of 142 breast papillary lesions diagnosed by ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy [^194b66ff]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical management of breast intraductal papilloma (IDP) remains controversial. The objective of this study was to survey a large cohort of benign IDP diagnosed on core needle biopsy (CNB) and to evaluate their clinical presentation and potential risk of associated atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma as identified by follow-up surgical excision.

Methods

We analyzed 345 IDP on CNB; 142 (41.2%) received a subsequent surgical excision while 203 (58.8%) cases did not. Specimens were categorized as IDP, IPD+ADH, IDP+ALH, and DCIS. In patients with surgical follow-up the upgrade to a lesion of greater clinical significance was analyzed according to race, clinical presentation and multiplicity of papillomas.

Results

Of the 142 cases, 125 (93.9%) patients had a single IDP, while 17 cases were among 8 patients with multiple IDPs. Patients were predominantly asymptomatic with CNB obtained as follow-up to an abnormal mammogram. Among solitary benign IDP, nearly 25% were upgraded (p < 0.001): 14.0% to ADH and 10.5% to DCIS. For patients with IDP+ADH on initial CNB, 22.2% were upgraded to DCIS. Of the asymptomatic cases 11.4% were upgraded to DCIS, while none of the symptomatic patients showed such upgrade (p < 0.001). In patients with no surgical excision 17 (8.3%) continue to have an abnormal mammogram.

Conclusions

We recommend routine mammogram and surgical excision of all IDPs identified on CNB because almost one-fourth (24.5%) of solitary IDP at CNB were upgraded to either ADH or DCIS and the majority of cases were asymptomatic.

The 10-year distant disease-free survival improved from 60% to 88% by adding chemotherapy to tamoxifen in the high-risk group, while no benefit was observed in the low recurrence score group. A total of 1, 550 women with high clinical risk and low genomic risk, and 592 women with low clinical risk and high genomic risk, were randomly assigned to receive or not receive chemotherapy. The primary goal of the study was to determine whether patients with high clinical risk, but low genomic risk, who did not receive chemotherapy had a 5-year survival rate without distant metastases of 92% or lower.
- This end point was met because the observed rate in the group was 94. 7%. However, among patients with high clinical risk but low genomic risk, the rate of 5-year survival without distant metastases was 1.

### Management of pancreatic cysts: a multidisciplinary approach [^37a4f5b4]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

An increasing number of patients are being diagnosed with pancreatic cysts. Pancreatic cysts are best evaluated by a team of healthcare professionals that includes gastroenterologists, surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, oncologists and geneticists.

Recent Findings

The international consensus guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and mucinous cystic neoplasm were updated in 2012, incorporating research that had been reported over a 5-year span since the publication of the previous guidelines. There are significant changes in the new guidelines, which include redefining main duct IPMN and removing the recommendation for surgical resection based on size alone. In addition, the discovery of molecular markers of cyst type promises to revolutionize the way patients are diagnosed and managed.

Summary

The diagnosis and management of patients with pancreatic cysts have progressed significantly in recent years. Large prospective, multicenter trials are now needed to validate the new international consensus guidelines and to assess the accuracy of new molecular markers.

Breast masses presenting in adolescent boys are rare and are almost uniformly owing to gynecomastia. Although surgical referral for breast masses in adolescent boys is common, intervention is typically for cosmesis. We report the case of a 14-year-old boy who presented with an enlarging unilateral breast mass, which was found to be owing to an intraductal papilloma at the time of surgical excision.

### Expert consensus on endoscopic papillectomy using a Delphi process [^68c7b4f4]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

The first endoscopic papillectomy (EP) for papillary adenoma (n = 2) was described in 1983, and the first substantial cohort (n = 25) was published 10 years later. A number of predominantly retrospective case and cohort studies have been published subsequently. – Despite the lack of randomized controlled trials and prospective series, EP for papillary adenoma is considered a relatively safe, minimally invasive treatment for lesions without significant intraductal extension or invasive disease. It has proven difficult to generate high-level scientific knowledge on the best treatment algorithm primarily because of low incidence and therefore difficult to conduct large prospective or randomized controlled studies. Subsequently, a consensus for EP practices has not been established. In 2015 the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy attempted to develop an evidence-based guideline on the role of endoscopy in papillary and duodenal adenomas. However, based on the current literature only limited recommendations regarding the optimal diagnostic workup, treatment, and follow-up protocol could be made. Unsurprisingly, at present there remains a wide variety in daily practice, mostly based on individual preferences.

The aim of this study was to assess the level of consensus among international experts and to obtain further consensus by using a Delphi process. The Delphi method was developed by the Rand Corporation in the 1950s and was originally used in forecasting. Since then, the Delphi method is considered to be a reliable instrument to develop clinical consensus guidelines. This iterative structured process is widely used to achieve expert consensus for subjects where no definitive evidence is available and where expert opinion is important. – The process consists of a series of questionnaires (usually 3), and after each round the responses are summarized and anonymously redistributed for discussion in the next round(s). Accordingly, the ultimate goal is to conduct a proposal for a more standardized treatment protocol on the performance of EP.

### Controversies regarding encapsulated papillary carcinoma of the breast: an approach to evaluation and categorisation [^fbf57ddf]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

EPC that lacks a peripheral MEC layer, as demonstrated using IHC, has low metastatic potential despite clinical staging as an in situ tumour. It is advisable to include this information in the pathology report so that patients and their treating physician are aware of the low risk of metastases associated with these lesions that are staged as in situ disease to avoid overtreatment rather than to reflect their biology(EPC lacking MECs are recognized to have some metastatic potential, but the risk is too low to justify a diagnosis of invasive carcinoma and the current consensus opinion is to stage and manage these tumours as in situ disease; pTis). In addition, despite WHO guidance, the final classification of these lesions is based on the interpretation of a constellation of features that have some subjectivity and the concordance of classifying such lesions is not perfect.

MECs lining the fibrovascular cores are typically absent in papillary Ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS, EPC, and invasive papillary carcinoma. The demonstration of MECs lining the fibrovascular cores of a papillary carcinoma supports the diagnosis of an intraductal papilloma colonized by DCIS (Figure 3). The extent of colonization of papilloma by DCIS is inversely related to detectable MEC marker expression within the lesion. Some intraductal papillary tumours are composed of papilloma focally involved by neoplastic cells just sufficient for the classification of DCIS, while other tumours may comprise a predominant single population of neoplastic epithelial cells, with occasional residual MECS lining the fibrovascular cores and represent the other end of the spectrum of colonization. Regardless of the extent of residual papilloma and in the absence of any accompanying invasive disease, these tumours represent true in situ disease and have a superior prognosis to EPC with no risk of metastasis.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^e3200bcc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Table 3 (continued) — management of biliary hamartomas, peribiliary cysts, intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile ducts, choledochal cysts, and hydatid cysts: Biliary hamartomas and peribiliary cysts are benign malformations and do not require surveillance imaging. Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile ducts are premalignant biliary lesions with a high risk of malignant transformation, and thus, continued surveillance imaging is recommended even after surgical resection. Management and treatment of choledochal cysts is based on type of cyst and risk of malignant transformation; Type I or IV choledochal cysts are most commonly associated with malignancy and should undergo surveillance imaging, although a specific interval cannot be recommended. In both type IV and V choledochal cysts, when resection is not feasible, liver transplantation should be considered. For hydatid cysts, medical therapy with anthelmintic drugs is indicated before surgery or cyst puncture in symptomatic or active cysts to prevent recurrence, secondary seeding, or to decrease cyst pressure or in inoperable cases, and medical therapy alone is not recommended unless percutaneous aspiration or surgery is contraindicated.

### Bloody nipple discharge due to intraductal papilloma in an adolescent girl [^f8ebf0fd]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

An early adolescent girl was referred to our breast surgery clinic with multiple right-sided breast masses and several months of unilateral bloody nipple discharge. MRI demonstrated multiple enhancing masses in the right breast with intrinsic hypertensive T1 signal of the ducts extending to the nipple. A biopsy showed partially sclerosed intraductal papillomas without atypia or malignancy. Following extensive counselling with the patient and her family, two palpable breast masses and a single central breast duct responsible for bloody nipple discharge were fully excised. Histopathological analysis showed unique overlapping features of resembling intraductal papilloma, nipple adenoma and fibroadenomas. The patient has had resolution of her bloody nipple discharge and excellent cosmetic outcomes post-surgery. Intraductal papilloma is rare in the adolescent population and the risk of concurrent and future malignancy is not well established. Thus, a tailored approach to the work-up and management of paediatric breast masses is essential.

### Large breast lump with bloody nipple discharge: benign intraductal papilloma [^cddfd4a8]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 32-year-old woman presented with a 3 cm×3 cm left breast lump associated with bloody nipple discharge during her early pregnancy. Examination and ultrasonography showed benign features, whereas core needle biopsies revealed a benign papilloma. Six months after her delivery, a 6 cm×6 cm benign papilloma was completely excised via circumareolar incision. The majority of intraductal papillomas are small; however, they can also present as a large mass rarely. We should be wary of a malignant papillary lesion when there is the presence of atypia on core needle biopsy or imaging-histology discordance. A concordant benign papilloma with benign imaging findings is otherwise reassuring. Clinicians need to be aware of this uncommon presentation of large intraductal papilloma as a complete curative excision can be achieved through a cosmetically placed incision.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^82aa9525]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Premalignant pancreatic tumors — mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are cystic lesions often incidentally discovered; lesions involving the main duct have a higher malignant potential than those in the branches, with the risk of malignancy being around 62%, and the risk of malignancy in MCNs is < 15%. An international group of experts has established guidelines for IPMNs and MCNs; the international group strongly recommends resection in fit patients with main-duct IPMNs ≥ 10 mm, while for branch-duct IPMNs surveillance is considered an appropriate option in patients who are older or ineligible for resection or for cysts lacking high-risk stigmata. Branch-duct IPMNs that have an enhancing mural nodule ≥ 5 mm or are in the head of the pancreas causing obstructive jaundice should be considered for resection in patients who can undergo surgery; patients with resected IPMNs are followed with imaging studies to identify recurrences, and for MCNs the international group recommends resection for all patients who can undergo surgery.

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^104fc457]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study represents one of the largest, single-institution analysis of the results of a surveillance program for patients with IPMN, who were managed according to current guidelines. Our study was one of the few to report on the outcome of patients whose IPMN required resection but who could not undergo surgery due to general contraindications. The study results support the recommendations of current guidelines by demonstrating that the majority of patients with branch-duct IPMN (78.5% in this study) can be managed safely with a conservative approach. The mortality rate due to the development of IPMN-associated cancer or concomitant pancreatic cancer separate from the IPMN is 1% in the cohort of patients who were under surveillance as recommended by the guidelines. This does not exceed the mortality rate associated with pancreatic surgery, even in the most experienced centers. Interestingly, the cumulative risk for IPMN progression increased over time and was 70% at 5 years and 97.5% at 10 years from the time of detection of the IPMN. Even the cumulative risk for progression to an IPMN that required surgery increased continuously and reached 26% at 5 years and 72.1% at 10 years of follow-up. Interestingly, the percentage of patients with an IPMN that developed features requiring surgery increased significantly also after 5 years of follow-up. The median time from first diagnosis of an IPMN (not requiring resection) to surgery was 48 months. The final histology of IPMNs that progressed and required surgery confirmed that the large majority of these lesions (85.4%) represented a true surgical indication, either with respect to the IPMN type (main-duct or mixed-type) or the grade of dysplasia (high-grade dysplasia to invasive carcinoma). This indicates that the detection of changes in cyst characteristics or in patient symptoms is indeed more predictive than a simple "one shot" evaluation at the time of first diagnosis. The observations in this study demonstrate that progression of IPMNs that do not fulfill criteria for surgery to lesions that require resection can occur even after 5 years or more following diagnosis. These observations validate and support the recommendations of the European and International guidelines regarding the necessity of a life-long follow-up of these patients. Moreover, the findings of the current study do not support the recent statement from the American Gastroenterological Association (ASA), which suggests that surveillance does not need to be continued for cysts without significant change after 5 years of follow-up. Considering that both the risk for progression and the risk for surgery gradually increase over time, our results support also the recommended strategy of a low frequency of control investigations in the initial years of the screening program, followed by an intensified protocol after 5 years. The results of this study further show that radiological prominence of the main pancreatic duct (diameter ≥ 6 mm) is associated with an increased risk for progression. This observation confirms the importance and prognostic significance of even mild pancreatic duct dilatation, as recently reported by Hackert et al. and stated by the European guidelines. Furthermore, the current analysis shows that localization of an IPMN in the pancreatic head also is associated with an increased risk for progression. This finding seems to confirm previous observations by Ammori et al.

### An update on multimodal imaging strategies for nipple discharge: from detection to decision [^915e1d50]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

On MRI, intraductal lesions are hypointense on T2- and T1-weighted imaging and show enhancement on post-contrast dynamic T1-weighted sequences. In post-contrast sequences, multiple peripheral papillomas may show a linear or segmental NME that may resemble DCIS.

A retrospective study of 45 patients found MRI to have significantly higher sensitivity than CEM in the diagnosis of IP (100% versus 65%, respectively) among lesions of all sizes, particularly in lesions smaller than 5 mm.

Fragments from a benign papilloma in a core-needle biopsy (CNB) are classified as lesions of uncertain malignant potential (B3 lesions), as IP can coexist with higher-grade malignant lesions. When IP with atypia, such as atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), is identified on CNB, the upgrade rate to DCIS or invasive carcinoma upon excision is significantly higher compared to IP without atypia (26.9% versus 2.3%, respectively). Vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) is the procedure of choice for suspected papillary lesions due to its superior diagnostic accuracy. IP with ADH should be surgically excised. For IPs without atypia that are completely removed by VAB, imaging surveillance is sufficient. However, for IPs without atypia that are either too large or anatomically inaccessible for percutaneous removal, open excision is recommended. Some studies suggest that active surveillance alone may be an appropriate alternative to surgery for benign papillomas with radiologic-pathologic concordance to avoid overtreatment. Multidisciplinary teams should guide therapeutic decisions for each B3 lesion.

### Treatment and outcome of 341 papillary breast lesions [^16f105b3]. World Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Papillary breast lesions constitute a pathological heterogeneous group and display diverse clinical and imaging features. This study was conducted to analyze the upgrade rate of intraductal papilloma diagnosed on core needle biopsy and to assess the possible risk factors associated with upgrade to higher-risk lesions. We also examined the long-term outcomes in patients who received resection of the papillary lesions.

Materials and Methods

The clinical and pathology records of 324 female patients who were diagnosed with papillary lesions based on core needle biopsy (CNB) from February 2010 to October 2016 at our institution were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were grouped by initial diagnosis into two groups (papilloma with or without atypia) and followed-up for long-term outcomes. For the upgrade to higher-risk lesions after excision, upgraded lesions were compared with benign papillomas for the collected variables.

Results

A total of 341 lesions were included for final analysis, and all were available for follow-up. Papillomas with or without atypia diagnosed by CNB were found in 9 and 332 lesions, respectively. Papillomas without atypia on CNB were treated by open excision (n = 265) or vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) (n = 67), which yielded similar event-free rate (p = 0.19). The upgrade rate of this group to higher-risk lesions was 9.9%. Peripheral (p = 0.011) lesions in postmenopausal (p = 0.001) or older (p = 0.001) patients with papillomas without atypia based on CNB showed significantly higher upgrade rates. Papillomas with atypia on CNB were all managed by open excision, and concurrent malignancy was found in two lesions.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our results support benign papillary lesions based on CNB require further treatment. Peripheral lesions occurring in older or postmenopausal women are at higher risk for upgrade.

### Multimodality approach to the nipple-areolar complex: a pictorial review and diagnostic algorithm [^28c0e4c9]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Solitary intraductal papilloma

Although an intraductal papilloma can appear at any age, it is most common between the third and fifth decades of life, and has a low incidence in men. Intraductal papillomas are proliferative lesions in which a vascular-connective axis is lined with a layer of myoepithelial or basal cells and another layer of luminal epithelial cells. Intraductal papillomas originate in the proximal or retroareolar ducts and generally cause obstruction and ectasia of the duct. Intraductal papilloma is the most common cause of pathological nipple discharge (48%), followed by duct ectasia (15–20%). Less frequently, this lesion can present as a palpable mass.

Mammography shows a nodular or oval lesion with well-defined margins in the retroareolar region. Up to 25% have benign calcifications. Small papillomas in the retroareolar region are often occult because of the high density and technical difficulty of evaluating this region by mammography. On ultrasound, they can be seen as an intraductal mass near the nipple (with or without associated ectasia), as an intracystic mass (Fig. 24), or as a predominantly solid lesion that fills the entire duct. Internal flow related to a vascular pedicle may be seen on Doppler imaging (Fig. 19). Galactography generally reveals an intraductal filling defect (Fig. 25) or ductal cutoff (Fig. 16). On MRI, intraductal papilloma can be seen as an enhancing mass with circumscribed or irregular margins in association with ductal dilation, as ductal dilation without an intraductal mass, or as a solid-cystic mass. Small papillomas might not be visible on MRI.

Regarding surgical interventions for ampullary cancer, more specifically with respect to endoscopic papillectomy (indications), ESGE 2021 guidelines recommend to perform endoscopic papillectomy in patients with ampullary adenoma without intraductal extension, because of good results regarding outcomes (technical and clinical success, morbidity, and recurrence).

### Radiology-pathology conference: papillary carcinoma of the breast [^cfc34caa]. Clinical Imaging (2005). Low credibility.

Papillary carcinoma of the breast is a rare breast carcinoma. It can be classified into invasive and noninvasive types. It can also be classified into intracystic and intraductal papillary carcinoma. Different radiological features are found to be associated with different histological types. Pitfalls are found to be associated with fine needle aspiration and core biopsy in the evaluation of papillary lesions. It is therefore important for radiologists to diagnose papillary carcinoma for proper management of the patients.

### The role of intraoperative pancreatoscopy in the surgical management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: a scoping review [^c5081e16]. Pancreas (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Most patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are diagnosed with a solitary lesion; however, the presence of skip lesions, not appreciable on imaging, has been described. Postoperatively, these missed lesions can continue to grow and potentially become cancerous. Intraoperative pancreatoscopy (IOP) may facilitate detection of such skip lesions in the remnant gland. The aim of this scoping review was to appraise the evidence on the role of IOP in the surgical management of IPMNs.

Materials and Methods

Studies reporting on the use of IOP during IPMN surgery were identified through searches of the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. Data extracted included IOP findings, surgical plan modifications, and patient outcomes. The primary outcome of interest was the utility of IOP in surgical decision making.

Results

Ten studies reporting on the use of IOP for IPMNs were identified, representing 147 patients. A total of 46 skip lesions were identified by IOP. Overall, surgical plans were altered in 37% of patients who underwent IOP. No IOP-related complications were reported.

Conclusions

The current literature suggests a potential role of integration of IOP into the management of patients with IPMNs. This tool is safe and feasible and can result in changes in surgical decision making.

### ASO author reflections: the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in invasive intraductal mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^bf8ba899]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Past

Intraductal mucinous cystic neoplasms (IPMN) of the pancreas are relatively common, and these cystic tumors have potential for progression into pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), though their prognosis is debated to be less severe than that of de novo PDAC. The management of IPMN was originally addressed by the first international consensus guidelines in 2006, which were later revised in 2012 and 2017. However, these IPMN guidelines mostly focus on risks of an invasive component and the surgical indications and their follow-up, without mentioning the possible role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in IPMNs whose invasive nature has been pathologically demonstrated preoperatively. Similarly, NCCN guidelinesfor pancreatic cancer do not differentiate between invasive IPMN and PDAC. In modern times, high-volume centers for pancreatic surgery are oriented toward a neoadjuvant chemotherapy approach, as well as in resectable PDAC, but its use in invasive IPMN has not yet been investigated.

The upgrade rate for solitary benign intraductal papilloma (without atypia) diagnosed by core biopsy varies widely among series (0–33%), so surgical excision has been the recommended treatment. However, recent studies have shown that US-guided directional vacuum-assisted removal with clinical and imaging follow-up is viable and that cases with good radio-pathologic concordance without associated risk factors could even be managed with imaging alone.

### Papilloma diagnosed on core biopsies has a low upgrade rate [^5345ad55]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Surgical excision of benign intraductal papillomas (IDP) diagnosed on core needle biopsy (CNB) remains controversial.

Objective

To examine the upgrade rate of IDPs diagnosed at core needle biopsy to carcinoma at surgical excision.

Design

We identified 188 consecutive IDPs diagnosed at CNB from 2011 to 2016 with subsequent surgical excision. Radiologic, clinical, and histologic features were evaluated and correlated with upgrade rate at surgical excision.

Results

Two of the 188 IDPs (1.1%) were upgraded to ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma at excision. Features associated with upgrade rate include patient age (P = 0.03), largest size of papilloma on a single core at CNB (P = 0.04), and the presence of additional masses noted at ultrasound (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Our study demonstrated a low 1.1% upgrade rate of surgically excised benign, concordant papillomas with no atypia or concurrent ipsilateral malignancy originally diagnosed on core biopsy. This data suggests that observation may be appropriate for radiologic-pathologic concordant benign IDPs diagnosed at CNB.

### An international multicenter review of the malignancy rate of excised papillomatous breast lesions [^627c6111]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Papillary lesions of the breast are a relatively rare, but heterogeneous group ranging from benign to atypical and malignant. Debate exists regarding the optimal management of these lesions. In the absence of more accurate risk-stratification models, traditional management guidelines recommend surgical excision, despite the majority of lesions proving benign. This study sought to determine the rate of malignancy in excised breast papillomas and to elucidate whether there exists a population in which surgical excision may be unnecessary.

Methods

A multicenter international retrospective review of core biopsy diagnosed breast papillomas and papillary lesions was performed between 2009 and 2013, following institutional ethical approval. Patient demographics, histopathological, and radiological findings were recorded. All data was tabulated, and statistical analysis performed using Stata.

Results

A total of 238 patients were included in the final analysis. The age profile of those with benign pathology was significantly younger than those with malignant pathology (p < 0.001). Atypia on core needle biopsy was significantly associated with a final pathological diagnosis of malignancy (OR = 2.73). The upgrade rate from benign core needle biopsy to malignancy on the final pathological sample was 14.4%; however, only 3.7% had invasive cancer.

Conclusions

This international dataset is one of the largest in the published literature relating to breast papillomas. The overall risk of malignancy is significantly associated with older age and the presence of atypia on core needle biopsy. It may be possible to stratify higher-risk patients according to age and core needle biopsy findings, thereby avoiding surgery on low-risk patients.

Table 2
Risk of high-grade dysplasia or malignancy according to dilatation of the main pancreatic duct in IPMN

Follow-up of BD-IPMN is required as progression of disease is expected in about 10–15% of patients during 3–5 years of follow-up. Surveillance should also include the entire pancreatic gland because of an increased risk of new-onset cancer. In patients with MD-IPMN and those with mixed-type (MT)-IPMN several factors may predict progression during surveillance (eg, diffuse MPD dilatation, serum CA 19–9, serum alkaline phosphatase, and absence of extrapancreatic cysts).

4.2 What are the clinical implications of the presence of potential risk factors, including morphological features, with regard to determining follow-up investigations, and the decision to proceed with surgical resection

For patients with an IPMN without an indication for operative intervention, routine follow-up is recommended. A 6-month follow-up in the first year, and yearly follow-up thereafter is adequate when no risk factors are present that establish an indication for surgery. Changes in clinical symptoms should trigger investigations (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

For patients with relative indication for surgery (see statement 4.12), the 'elderly', and those affected by severe comorbidity, a 6-month follow-up is recommended. (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

In young individuals, the risk of malignancy and surgery has to be balanced against the burden of lifelong follow-up. However, after partial pancreatectomy for IPMN lifelong follow-up is still indicated. Resection therefore does not eliminate the need for regular follow-up screening.

4.3 Is there a certain size cut-off point for resecting an IPMN regardless of the absence of clinical symptoms or (other) risk factors? Is age of the patient a co-factor that should be analysed to define better management strategy?

Patients with IPMNs > 40 mm have an increased risk of harbouring malignancy (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

Several studies including both surgically resected or observed IPMN have reported an increased risk of malignancy ranging from 12% to 47% in cases of a cyst ≥ 30 mm. In some of these series, the risk of malignancy produced by cyst size was stratified by the presence of other features for malignancy, indicating that cyst size alone is not an appropriate indication for surgery since the risk of malignancy is actual but low. If multiple risk factors are present the sensitivity to detect malignancy increases.

### Current guideline controversies in the management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^231076f3]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cystic lesions are a common clinical entity. The majority are neoplastic and have the potential for malignant transformation. To assist with patient management, a number of clinical guidelines have been developed over the past decade. However, controversies exist in regards to the various guidelines and treatment strategies they offer. This article will review the various clinical guidelines for management of pancreatic cysts, describe the limitations of these guidelines, and present future directions for improvement in clinical decision making for patients diagnosed with a pancreatic cystic neoplasm.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^a8391d0b]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

ASGE guideline — diagnostic and initial management for choledocholithiasis states that in patients with intermediate risk (10%-50%) of choledocholithiasis, we suggest either endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) given high specificity; consider factors including patient preference, local expertise, and availability. In patients with gallstone pancreatitis without cholangitis or biliary obstruction/choledocholithiasis, we recommend against urgent (< 48 hours) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). In patients with large choledocholithiasis, we suggest performing large-balloon dilation after sphincterotomy rather than endoscopic sphincterotomy alone. For patients with large and difficult choledocholithiasis, we suggest intraductal therapy or conventional therapy with papillary dilation. This may be impacted by local expertise, cost, and patient and physician preferences.

Intraductal therapy versus conventional therapy for large or difficult bile duct stones — across included studies there were 13,588 patients, with 2204 (16%) treated by intraductal and 11,384 (84%) by conventional approaches; overall complete stone clearance did not differ with intraductal therapy .92 [95% CI, .90-.94], I² = 60%, and conventional approaches .92 [95% CI, .90-.94], I² = 91%. In 94 studies assessing first-procedure clearance, intraductal management was less often successful at first procedure .69 [95% CI, .62-.75] versus conventional therapy .81 [95% CI, .77-.84]. Overall adverse event frequency showed no difference, with summary estimates .08 [95% CI, .06-.11] and .09 [95% CI, .08-.11]. Mechanical lithotripsy was more frequently required with conventional than intraductal therapy, .29 [95% CI, .23-.36] versus .19 [95% CI, .10-.29]. For intraductal therapy, overall clearance with laser was not significantly different from EHL, .94 [95% CI, .91-.96] versus .91 [95% CI, .86-.95]. In 74.6% of studies using papillary dilation, the minimum dilator balloon size was ≥ 12 mm and was preceded by sphincterotomy (ES-LBD).

4.10 At what MPD diameter should surgery be considered?

Recent studies demonstrate malignancy rates of 30–90% even in cases with a MPD dilatation of > 5 mm. Consequently, the threshold of MPD dilatation for surgical resection is > 5 mm in both MD-IPMN and MT-IPMN (GRADE 2C, weak agreement).

The main goal of surgery is to resect IPMNs when high-grade dysplasia is present, and before patients develop pancreatic cancer. Given the recent studies, and the goal of surgery, a cut-off point of > 5 mm is reasonable (see figure 1).

Indications for surgery. EUS, endoscopic ultrasound; IPMN, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.

4.11 What are the absolute criteria for resection of BD-IPMN?

The presence of jaundice, cytology positive for high-grade dysplasia or cancer, the presence of a contrast-enhancing mural nodule (≥ 5 mm) or solid mass should be considered as absolute indications for surgery (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

See statements 4.1–4.2, for a detailed description of the rationale for this.
