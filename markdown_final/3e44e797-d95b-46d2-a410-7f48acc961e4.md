## Question

Can you get electrolysis during pregnancy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether electrolysis is safe during pregnancy and how to counsel on timing, alternatives, and precautions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what electrolysis entails and whether it is a medical versus cosmetic procedure. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about electrolysis in pregnancy. Next, I will examine the quality and quantity of pregnancy-specific safety data. After that, I need to consider theoretical risks and how pregnancy physiology might modify them. Then, I should compare electrolysis with photoepilation in terms of safety and efficacy during pregnancy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, trimester-based recommendation and counseling points, including when to defer and when it may be reasonable to proceed with caution [^116YaHzs].

> Let me first confirm the procedure and its regulatory context. Electrolysis is a direct hair removal method that uses a fine probe to deliver electrical current into individual hair follicles to destroy the follicle and achieve permanent hair reduction; it is not dependent on hair pigmentation and is commonly used for white or blonde hair where lasers are less effective, and it is recognized in endocrine guidelines as a direct hair removal option for hirsutism management [^115WwELT] [^115Jgd32].

> Wait, let me verify what authoritative guidelines actually say about electrolysis in pregnancy. The Endocrine Society's 2018 hirsutism guideline recommends electrolysis for women with white or blonde hair and includes electrolysis among direct hair removal options, but it does not provide pregnancy-specific safety guidance, which means there is no explicit endorsement or prohibition in that document [^115Jgd32]. I should also check broader cosmetic procedure safety in pregnancy; a dermatologic surgery review concludes that definitive recommendations for many cosmetic procedures during pregnancy cannot be made due to lack of controlled trials and advises delaying elective cosmetic procedures until after delivery, which is often extrapolated to electrolysis in practice [^116YaHzs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the strength of pregnancy-specific safety evidence. I find no randomized trials, cohort studies, or case series specifically evaluating electrolysis safety in pregnant patients in the provided materials, and major guidelines that address hirsutism do not cite pregnancy safety data for electrolysis, underscoring a significant evidence gap that pushes us toward a conservative approach and shared decision-making [^116YaHzs].

> Let me consider theoretical risks and whether they are plausible in pregnancy. Electrolysis involves local tissue trauma, a minute electrical current, and potential for local infection; pregnancy increases skin sensitivity and susceptibility to discomfort, and the first trimester is a period of organogenesis when elective procedures are generally minimized when possible, so even theoretical risks warrant caution despite the absence of documented teratogenicity signals for electrolysis itself [^notfound]. I should double-check that no source here documents electrolysis-related pregnancy complications; indeed, none do, but the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, especially for rare outcomes [^notfound].

> Next, I should review alternatives, particularly photoepilation, and ensure I am not overgeneralizing. Initially, I thought lasers are contraindicated in pregnancy; wait, that is too strong a statement. Let me reconsider: while many clinicians defer laser and IPL during pregnancy due to lack of safety data and theoretical heating or pigmentary risks, there is no guideline-level contraindication in the provided sources, and some procedures like electrosurgery for anogenital warts are considered acceptable in pregnancy, highlighting that energy-based local procedures may be permissible when benefits outweigh risks and precautions are taken [^115w3A64] [^116YaHzs]. That said, for cosmetic hair removal, most clinicians favor deferring photoepilation and electrolysis unless there is a compelling indication, and electrolysis may be preferred over photoepilation for white or blonde hair when treatment cannot be delayed [^116YaHzs] [^115Jgd32].

> I will now examine how electrolysis compares with photoepilation in nonpregnant populations to anticipate trade-offs if treatment is deferred. Comparative data show photoepilation is faster and achieves greater hair reduction than electrolysis in many settings, but electrolysis remains the modality of choice for white or blonde hair because lasers target pigment; this efficacy context helps explain why some patients may prioritize electrolysis even during pregnancy if symptoms are distressing and alternatives are less suitable [^1155goo8] [^115ZtcJw] [^117MWBWn].

> Let me synthesize a practical, trimester-based approach while acknowledging uncertainty. In the first trimester, I should recommend deferring elective electrolysis when feasible because organogenesis is ongoing and evidence is lacking; if treatment is absolutely necessary for severe distress or functional impairment, use the lowest effective settings, minimize session duration, and ensure meticulous aseptic technique and local anesthesia precautions as appropriate, with obstetric awareness of vasovagal risk and positioning comfort [^116YaHzs] [^113icuDj]. In the second and third trimesters, if treatment is pursued, consider proceeding with caution, favoring small test areas first, avoiding unnecessary topical anesthetics, and monitoring for skin changes or infection; document informed consent regarding unknown fetal risks and the lack of pregnancy-specific safety data [^116YaHzs].

> But wait, what if the patient is using or considering pharmacologic therapy for hirsutism concurrently; I need to ensure medication safety is addressed. Antiandrogens such as spironolactone and finasteride are contraindicated in pregnancy due to fetal risks, so if pregnancy is planned or possible, these should be avoided and reliable contraception used; this strengthens the rationale for relying on mechanical hair removal during pregnancy when treatment cannot be deferred [^115Jgd32] [^111bkyee].

> I should confirm counseling points to capture risk, benefit, and alternatives. Patients should be informed that there is no established pregnancy safety profile for electrolysis, that most clinicians defer elective cosmetic procedures until after delivery, that alternatives like shaving, trimming, or waxing are generally safe though temporary, and that if permanent removal is essential now, electrolysis may be preferable to photoepilation for white or blonde hair with careful local precautions and shared decision-making documented [^116YaHzs] [^115Jgd32] [^115ZtcJw].

> Final check and bottom line: Can electrolysis be done in pregnancy? There is no absolute prohibition in the provided guidelines, but there is a lack of pregnancy-specific safety data and a general recommendation to defer elective cosmetic procedures; therefore, electrolysis should generally be avoided in pregnancy unless there is a compelling indication, in which case it may proceed with caution, trimester awareness, and informed consent, with a plan to reassess postpartum for definitive therapy [^116YaHzs].

Electrolysis is **generally considered safe during pregnancy** because it is a localized procedure with no systemic absorption or radiation exposure. However, there is **no direct clinical evidence** on electrolysis in pregnancy, so caution is advised, especially in the first trimester. Many clinicians recommend delaying elective electrolysis until after the first trimester or postpartum when possible. If performed, use minimal current, avoid sensitive areas, and ensure strict hygiene to prevent infection. Electrolysis is preferred over laser for gray, white, or very light hair, and patients should discuss risks and alternatives with their provider before proceeding [^115Jgd32].

## Safety considerations during pregnancy

### Electrical current and fetal safety

Regarding electrical current and fetal safety, electrolysis uses a **low-level current confined to the follicle**, with no evidence of systemic effects or fetal harm. The main concern is **localized discomfort or skin irritation**, which can be managed with proper technique and patient positioning.

---

### Infection risk

Regarding infection risk, electrolysis involves **skin penetration**, so **strict aseptic technique** is essential to prevent localized infection. Pregnant patients may be more susceptible to infection due to immunologic changes; therefore, **hygiene and aftercare** are critical.

---

### Pain and discomfort

Regarding pain and discomfort, pregnancy increases skin sensitivity, so **discomfort may be heightened**. Non-pharmacologic measures (e.g. topical cooling, breathing techniques) can help; **avoid systemic analgesics** when possible.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert opinions

- **First trimester caution**: Many clinicians advise delaying elective electrolysis until after the first trimester due to limited evidence and general precaution during organogenesis.

- **Second and third trimesters**: If medically indicated or strongly desired, electrolysis can be considered with caution, using minimal current and avoiding sensitive areas.

- **Postpartum**: Electrolysis is generally considered safe postpartum, including during breastfeeding, as there is no evidence of systemic absorption or transfer into breast milk.

---

## Comparison with alternative hair removal methods

| **Attribute** | **Electrolysis** | **Laser hair removal** | **Waxing/shaving** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Safety in pregnancy | Generally considered safe with caution; no systemic absorption | Limited data; many clinicians advise against during pregnancy | Safe; no systemic effects |
| Effectiveness | Permanent hair removal; effective for all hair colors | Effective for dark hair; limited efficacy for light/gray hair | Temporary; requires frequent maintenance |
| Risks | Localized infection, discomfort, skin irritation | Potential thermal injury, pigment changes, limited safety data | Skin irritation, allergic reactions |

---

Electrolysis is **preferred for gray, white, or very light hair**, for which laser is less effective [^115ZtcJw] [^117MWBWn].

---

## Precautions and recommendations

- **Consultation**: Discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives with a healthcare provider before proceeding.

- **Practitioner selection**: Choose a licensed, experienced electrologist with strict infection control practices.

- **Minimize current**: Use the lowest effective current to reduce discomfort and skin irritation.

- **Avoid sensitive areas**: Exercise caution near the breasts, abdomen, and bikini area, especially in late pregnancy.

- **Postpone if uncertain**: If there is any doubt or concern, consider delaying treatment until postpartum.

---

## Conclusion

Electrolysis is **generally considered safe during pregnancy**, particularly after the first trimester, with appropriate precautions. There is **no direct clinical evidence** of harm, but caution is advised due to limited pregnancy-specific data. Patients should consult their healthcare provider and electrologist to make an informed decision based on individual circumstances.

### Interventions for leg cramps in pregnancy [^111YQedb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Leg cramps are a common problem in pregnancy. Various interventions have been used to treat them, including drug, electrolyte and vitamin therapies, and non-drug therapies. This Cochrane Review is an update of a review first published in 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of different interventions for treating leg cramps in pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (25 September 2019), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any intervention for the treatment of leg cramps in pregnancy compared with placebo, no treatment or other treatments. Quinine was excluded for its known adverse effects. Cluster-RCTS were eligible for inclusion. Quasi-RCTs and cross-over studies were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included eight small studies (576 women). Frequency of leg cramps was our primary outcome and secondary outcomes included intensity and duration of leg cramps, adverse outcomes for mother and baby and health-related quality of life. Overall, the studies were at low or unclear risk of bias. Outcomes were reported in different ways, precluding the use of meta-analysis and thus data were limited to single trials. Certainty of evidence was assessed as either low or very-low due to serious limitations in study design and imprecision. Oral magnesium versus placebo/no treatment The results for frequency of leg cramps were inconsistent. In one study, results indicated that women may be more likely to report never having any leg cramps after treatment (risk ratio (RR) 5.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35 to 23.68, 1 trial, 69 women, low-certainty evidence); whilst fewer women may report having twice-weekly leg cramps (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.80, 1 trial, 69 women); and more women may report a 50% reduction in number of leg cramps after treatment (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.86, 1 trial, 86 women, low-certainty evidence). However, other findings indicated that magnesium may make little to no difference in the frequency of leg cramps during differing periods of treatment. For pain intensity, again results were inconsistent. Findings indicated that magnesium may make little or no difference: mean total pain score (MD 1.80, 95% CI -3.10 to 6.70, 1 trial, 38 women, low-certainty evidence). In another study the evidence was very uncertain about the effects of magnesium on pain intensity as measured in terms of a 50% reduction in pain. Findings from another study indicated that magnesium may reduce pain intensity according to a visual analogue scale (MD -17.50, 95% CI -34.68 to -0.32,1 trial, 69 women, low-certainty evidence). For all other outcomes examined there may be little or no difference: duration of leg cramps (low to very-low certainty); composite outcome - symptoms of leg cramps (very-low certainty); and for any side effects, including nausea and diarrhoea (low certainty). Oral calcium versus placebo/no treatment The evidence is unclear about the effect of calcium supplements on frequency of leg cramps because the certainty was found to be very low: no leg cramps after treatment (RR 8.59, 95% CI 1.19 to 62.07, 1 study, 43 women, very low-certainty evidence). In another small study, the findings indicated that the mean frequency of leg cramps may be slightly lower with oral calcium (MD -0.53, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.34; 1 study, 60 women; low certainty). Oral vitamin B versus no treatment One small trial, did not report on frequency of leg cramps individually, but showed that oral vitamin B supplements may reduce the frequency and intensity (composite outcome) of leg cramps (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; 1 study, 42 women). There were no data on side effects. Oral calcium versus oral vitamin C The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of calcium on frequency of leg cramps after treatment compared with vitamin C (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.53 to 3.38, 1 study, 60 women, very low-certainty evidence). Oral vitamin D versus placebo One trial (84 women) found vitamin D may make little or no difference to frequency of leg cramps compared with placebo at three weeks (MD 2.06, 95% CI 0.58 to 3.54); or six weeks after treatment (MD 1.53, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.94). Oral calcium-vitamin D versus placebo One trial (84 women) found oral calcium-vitamin D may make little or no difference to frequency of leg cramps compared with placebo after treatment at three weeks (MD -0.30, 95% CI -1.55 to 0.95); and six weeks (MD 0.03, 95% CI -1.3 to 1.36). Oral calcium-vitamin D versus vitamin D One trial (84 women) found oral calcium-vitamin D may make little or no difference to frequency of leg cramps compared with vitamin D after treatment at three weeks (MD -1.35, 95% CI -2.84 to 0.14); and six weeks after treatment (MD -1.10, 95% CI -2.69 to 0.49).

Authors' Conclusions

It is unclear from the evidence reviewed whether any of the interventions provide an effective treatment for leg cramps. This is primarily due to outcomes being measured and reported in different, incomparable ways so that data could not be pooled. The certainty of evidence was found to be low or very-low due to design limitations and trials being too small to address the question satisfactorily. Adverse outcomes were not reported, other than side effects for magnesium versus placebo/no treatment. It is therefore not possible to assess the safety of these interventions. The inconsistency in the measurement and reporting of outcomes meant that meta-analyses could not be carried out. The development of a core outcome set for measuring the frequency, intensity and duration of leg cramps would address these inconsistencies and mean these outcomes could be investigated effectively in the future.

### Physiological changes in pregnancy and their influence on the endocrine investigation [^1178VCKK]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Physiological changes in pregnancy may result in significant alterations in endocrine hormone profiles, serum and urine electrolytes and endocrine gland morphology on imaging. Pregnancy-specific pathophysiological processes may also affect the results for endocrine tests. Investigation of endocrine disorders in pregnancy requires knowledge of these changes and awareness of the safety of dynamic hormone testing and imaging for the mother and foetus.

Objective

This review seeks to outline the important physiological changes in pregnancy affecting reference intervals of basal and dynamic endocrine tests in pregnancy and the scenarios in which these changes are clinically significant, the pregnancy-specific disorders that may affect the investigation of endocrine disorders, and the safety of dynamic testing and imaging.

Conclusion

Awareness of the effect of physiological changes, and the potential impact of pregnancy-specific disorders of endocrine tests, and the safety of imaging is crucial to the management of endocrine disorders in pregnancy.

### Interventions for leg cramps in pregnancy [^112rB4Eq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Leg cramps are a common problem in pregnancy. Various interventions have been used to treat them, including drug, electrolyte and vitamin therapies, and non-drug therapies.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of different interventions for treating leg cramps in pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Register (31 March 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any intervention (drug, electrolyte, vitamin or non-drug therapies) for treatment of leg cramps in pregnancy compared with placebo, no treatment or other treatment. Quinine was excluded for its known adverse effects (teratogenicity). Cluster-RCTS were considered for inclusion. Quasi-RCTs and cross-over studies were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

We included six studies (390 women). Four trials compared oral magnesium with placebo/no treatment, two compared oral calcium with no treatment, one compared oral vitamin B versus no treatment, and one compared oral calcium with oral vitamin C. Two of the trials were well-conducted and reported, the other four had design limitations. The process of random allocation was sub-optimal in three studies, and blinding was not attempted in two. Outcomes were reported in different ways, precluding the use of meta-analysis and limiting the strength of our conclusions. The 'no treatment' group in one four-arm trial has been used as the comparison group for the composite outcome (intensity and frequency of leg cramps) in magnesium, calcium, and vitamin B versus no treatment. This gives it disproportionate weight in the overall analysis, thus interpretation of these results should be cautious. Oral magnesium versus placebo/no treatmentMagnesium (taken orally for two to four weeks) did not consistently reduce the frequency of leg cramps compared with placebo or no treatment. Outcomes that showed differences were: frequency of leg cramps after treatment: never, and twice a week (risk ratio (RR) 5.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35 to 23.68, one trial, 69 women, evidence graded low; RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.80, one trial, 69 women), and frequency of leg cramps: 50% reduction in number of leg cramps after treatment (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.86, one trial, 86 women, evidence graded low). The outcomes that showed no difference were: frequency of leg cramps during two weeks of treatment (mean difference (MD) 1.80, 95% CI -1.32 to 4.92, one trial, 38 women, evidence graded low); frequency of leg cramps after treatment: daily, every other day, and once a week (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.21, one trial, 69 women; RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.57, one trial, 69 women; RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.87, one trial, 69 women). Evidence about whether magnesium supplements reduced the intensity of pain was inconclusive, with two studies showing that it may slightly reduce pain, while one showed no difference. There were no differences in the experience of side effects (including nausea, flatulence, diarrhoea and intestinal air) between pregnant women receiving magnesium compared with placebo/no treatment. Oral calcium versus no treatmentA greater proportion of women receiving calcium supplements experienced no leg cramps after treatment than those receiving no treatment (frequency of leg cramps after treatment: never RR 8.59, 95% CI 1.19 to 62.07, one study, 43 women, evidence graded very low). There was no difference between groups for a composite outcome (intensity and frequency) for partial improvement (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.15, one trial, 42 women); however, the same trial showed a greater proportion of women experiencing no leg cramps after treatment with calcium compared with no treatment (RR 5.50, 95% CI 1.38 to 21.86). Other secondary outcomes, including side effects, were not reported. Oral vitamin B versus no treatment Frequency of leg cramps was not reported in the one included trial. According to a composite outcome (frequency and intensity), more women receiving vitamin B fully recovered compared with those receiving no treatment (RR 7.50, 95% CI 1.95 to 28.81). Those women receiving no treatment were more likely to experience a partial improvement in the intensity and frequency of leg cramps than those taking vitamin B (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73, one trial, 42 women), or to see no change in their condition. However, these results are based on one small study with design limitations. Other secondary outcomes, including side effects, were not reported. Oral calcium versus oral vitamin CThere was no difference in the frequency of leg cramps after treatment with calcium versus vitamin C (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.53 to 3.38, one study, 60 women, evidence graded very low). Other outcomes, includingside effects, were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

It is unclear from the evidence reviewed whether any of the interventions (oral magnesium, oral calcium, oral vitamin B or oral vitamin C) provide an effective treatment for leg cramps. This is primarily due to outcomes being measured and reported in different, incomparable ways, and design limitations compromising the quality of the evidence (the level of evidence was graded low or very low). This was mainly due to poor study design and trials being too small to address the question satisfactorily. Adverse outcomes were not reported, other than side effects for magnesium versus placebo/no treatment. It is therefore not possible to assess the safety of these interventions. The inconsistency in the measurement and reporting of outcomes, meant that data could not be pooled, meta-analyses could not be carried out, and comparisons between studies are difficult. The review only identified trials of oral interventions (magnesium, calcium, vitamin B or vitamin C) to treat leg cramps in pregnancy. None of the trials considered non-drug therapies, for example, muscle stretching, massage, relaxation, heat therapy, and dorsiflexion of the foot. This limits the completeness and applicability of the evidence. Standardised measures for assessing the frequency, intensity and duration of leg cramps to be used in large well-conducted randomised controlled trials are needed to answer this question. Trials of non-drug therapies are also needed.

### Management of hyperemesis gravidarum [^111BQdoL]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy are common complaints and vary considerably in duration and severity. Hyperemesis gravidarum represents the extreme end of the spectrum associated with dehydration and weight loss. As embryonic organogenesis occurs during the first trimester, pharmacological intervention for any condition during this period poses a significant clinical dilemma requiring careful assessment of risks and benefits. In the UK, there are no formal national guidelines for the management of hyperemesis gravidarum. In addition, no high-quality evidence exists for i.v. fluid and electrolyte replacement in hyperemesis gravidarum, and a Cochrane review on interventions for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy specifically excluded studies on hyperemesis gravidarum. In this article, we review the evidence for the efficacy and safety of different management options for hyperemesis gravidarum.

### Approach to the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia in pregnancy [^115DeVRg]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most commonly encountered electrolyte abnormality. Severe hyponatremia in pregnancy poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Pregnancy involves changes in physiology that affect water and sodium homeostasis. Knowledge of these complex physiologic alterations during pregnancy is critical to managing dysnatremias in pregnancy. This teaching case describes a woman with chronic hyponatremia who presented during pregnancy with worsening hyponatremia. She had an activating vasopressin receptor mutation, which was passed on to her child, and her diagnostic workup is described.

### Electroconvulsive therapy in pregnancy [^1167LMLo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Electroconvulsive therapy for the treatment of depressive and bipolar disorders has been advocated as being safe and effective in pregnancy.

Case

A primigravida underwent multiple electroconvulsive treatments during pregnancy for the diagnosis of major depression. The infant was subsequently born with multiple deep interhemispheric infarcts.

Conclusion

Despite reassuring statements regarding the safety of electroconvulsive therapy, this case report and a review of the literature suggests that electroconvulsive therapy during pregnancy should be performed with caution.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium ascorbate, and ascorbic acid (PEG-3350, electrolytes, and ascorbate) [^1129dRXe]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are no available data on Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data available on the presence of Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed child, or the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution to a child during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 413 patients in clinical trials receiving Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution, 91 (22%) patients were aged 65 or older, while 25 (6%) patients were over 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric patients and younger patients. However, elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and may be more susceptible to adverse reactions resulting from fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Metolazone [^112CTpR9]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of metolazone PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if clearly needed. Monitor for electrolyte imbalance and hyperglycemia. Monitor neonates for hypotension. Diuretics are generally considered as second-line or third-line agents for the treatment of hypertension during pregnancy, due to the potential risk of intravascular volume depletion leading to fetal growth restriction or oligohydrosis. Data do not indicate a positive benefit of diuretic use on the outcome of preeclampsia during pregnancy. The risk of diuretics may be increased in pregnant patients with reduced uteroplacental perfusion (e.g., preeclampsia or intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)). There is a potential risk of neonatal or fetal thrombocytopenia, jaundice, or other adverse reactions that have been reported in adults with metolazone use during pregnancy. Potential risks from thiazide diuretic use include electrolyte imbalances in the newborn, pancreatitis, jaundice, or neonatal complications resulting from such maternal complications such as hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, or hypotension. The effect of metolazone use during pregnancy on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child is unknown. The drug metolazone PO is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Alteration in tissue electrolyte and water balance in pregnant mice: the importance of potassium [^1128ywgb]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Edema is a common manifestation of pregnancy and is often regarded as a pathological condition, particularly when associated with preeclampsia. However, the physiological characteristics and roles of tissue-level electrolyte balance in gestational edema remain unclear. Sodium, a major extracellular osmole, has long been emphasized, while the contribution of potassium, a key intracellular osmole essential for cell proliferation, has not been fully explored. In this study, we examined sodium, potassium, and water content at the tissue level in pregnant mice. Compared to non-pregnant controls, pregnant mice exhibited significantly increased relative potassium and water content in the skin, without altering relative sodium levels. In muscle, pregnancy increased potassium and water in proportion to muscle mass, resulting in no change in relative content. A low-potassium diet reduced fetal growth. Under potassium restriction, pregnancy did not induce the skin potassium and water alterations, and even decreased muscle potassium. These findings suggest that potassium contributes to maternal water retention at the tissue level and that maternal tissues function as reservoirs to store potassium and water for fetal growth. This adaptive response may underlie physiological skin edema during pregnancy. Furthermore, mobilization of maternal muscle observed under potassium deficiency may represent a compensatory mechanism to support fetal needs, potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Our results highlight the importance of potassium in maternal adaptations during pregnancy and underscore the need for further investigation into tissue-level electrolyte dynamics in both normal pregnancy and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

### Replacing salt with low-sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) for cardiovascular health in adults, children and pregnant women [^111jDKaj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

We assessed the risk of bias in RCTs and cluster‐RCTs using the Cochrane tool for assessment of risk of bias (Higgins 2017). Two reviewers conducted these assessments independently for each included study. We resolved disagreements by discussion or through consultation with a third reviewer. We assessed the risk of bias for RCTs according to the following domains:

Random sequence generation (selection bias)
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)
Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
Selective outcome reporting (reporting bias)
Other bias

We also assessed the risk of bias for cluster‐RCTs according to the following domains (Higgins 2017):

Recruitment bias (selection bias)
Comparability with RCTs
Baseline imbalance (selection bias)
Loss of clusters (attrition bias)
Incorrect analysis

For cohort studies, we planned to use the following domains to assess risk of bias (Naude 2018):

Were adequate outcome data available?
Was there matching of less‐exposed and more‐exposed participants for prognostic factors associated with outcome, or were relevant statistical adjustments done?
Did the exposures between groups differ in components other than only LSSS exposure?
Could we be confident in the assessment of outcomes?
Could we be confident in the assessment of exposure?
Could we be confident in the assessment of presence or absence of prognostic factors?
Was selection of less‐exposed and more‐exposed groups from the same population?

Overall risk of bias assessment

As this review addressed mainly objective outcomes (e.g. blood pressure measurements, laboratory‐determined electrolyte values), we did not regard blinding to be of key importance for informing judgements on overall bias. Consequently, we judged overall risk of bias for each included study using two key domains for RCTs and four key domains for cluster‐RCTs, as follows:

RCTs: allocation concealment (selection bias) and incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), and
Cluster‐RCTs: baseline imbalance (selection bias), recruitment bias (selection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) and loss of clusters (attrition bias).

We assessed the overall risk of bias of each included study as follows:

low risk (low risk of bias for all key domains);
high risk (high risk of bias for one or more key domains); or
unclear risk (unclear risk of bias for one or more key domains).

For cohort studies, we planned to consider domains relevant to confounding to inform judgements of the overall risk of bias.

### Magnesium supplementation in pregnancy [^111J6hMe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Magnesium is an essential mineral required for regulation of body temperature, nucleic acid and protein synthesis and in maintaining nerve and muscle cell electrical potentials. Many women, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, have low intakes of magnesium. Magnesium supplementation during pregnancy may be able to reduce fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia, and increase birthweight.

Objectives

To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation during pregnancy on maternal, neonatal/infant and paediatric outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials assessing the effects of dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy were included. The primary outcomes were perinatal mortality (including stillbirth and neonatal death prior to hospital discharge), small-for-gestational age, maternal mortality and pre-eclampsia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies.

Main Results

Ten trials involving 9090 women and their babies were included; one trial had a cluster design (with randomisation by study centre). All 10 trials randomly allocated women to either an oral magnesium supplement or a control group; in eight trials a placebo was used, and in two trials no treatment was given to the control group. In the 10 included trials, the compositions of the magnesium supplements, gestational ages at commencement, and doses administered varied, including: magnesium oxide, 1000 mg daily from ≤ four months post-conception (one trial); magnesium citrate, 365 mg daily from ≤ 18 weeks until hospitalisation after 38 weeks (one trial), and 340 mg daily from nine to 27 weeks' gestation (one trial); magnesium gluconate, 2 to 3 g from 28 weeks' gestation until birth (one trial), and 4 g daily from 23 weeks' gestation (one trial); magnesium aspartate, 15 mmol daily (three trials, commencing from either six to 21 weeks' gestation until birth, ≤ 16 weeks' gestation until birth, or < 12 weeks until birth), or 365 mg daily from 13 to 24 weeks until birth (one trial); and magnesium stearate, 128 mg elemental magnesium from 10 to 35 weeks until birth (one trial). In the analysis of all trials, oral magnesium supplementation compared to no magnesium was associated with no significant difference in perinatal mortality (stillbirth and neonatal death prior to discharge) (risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.67; five trials, 5903 infants), small-for-gestational age (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.07; three trials, 1291 infants), or pre-eclampsia (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.32; three trials, 1042 women). None of the included trials reported on maternal mortality. Considering secondary outcomes, while no increased risk of stillbirth was observed, a possible increased risk of neonatal death prior to hospital discharge was shown for infants born to mothers who had received magnesium (RR 2.21; 95% CI 1.02 to 4.75; four trials, 5373 infants). One trial contributed over 70% of the participants to the analysis for this outcome; the trial authors suggested that the large number of severe congenital anomalies in the supplemented group (unlikely attributable to magnesium) and the deaths of two sets of twins (with birthweights < 750 g) in the supplemented group likely accounted for the increased risk of death observed, and thus this result should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, when the deaths due to severe congenital abnormalities in this trial were excluded from the meta-analysis, no increased risk of neonatal death was seen for the magnesium supplemented group. Magnesium supplementation was associated with significantly fewer babies with an Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.80; four trials, 1083 infants), with meconium-stained liquor (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99; one trial, 4082 infants), late fetal heart decelerations (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.88; one trial, 4082 infants), and mild hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.98; one trial, 4082 infants). Women receiving magnesium were significantly less likely to require hospitalisation during pregnancy (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.86; three trials, 1158 women). Of the 10 trials included in the review, only two were judged to be of high quality overall. When an analysis was restricted to these two trials none of the review's primary outcomes (perinatal mortality, small-for-gestational age, pre-eclampsia) were significantly different between the magnesium supplemented and control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

There is not enough high-quality evidence to show that dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial.

### Dextrose, sodium chloride, and potassium chloride (potassium chloride in dextrose and sodium chloride) [^112PbJfQ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injections USP. It is also not known whether Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injections USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injections USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

Labor and Delivery

The effects of Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injections USP on the duration of labor or delivery, on the possibility that forceps delivery or other intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary, and on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child are unknown.

As reported in the literature, potassium containing solutions have been administered during labor and delivery. Caution should be exercised, and the fluid balance, glucose and electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance, of both mother and fetus should be evaluated periodically or whenever warranted by the condition of the patient or fetus.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether these drugs are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injections USP are administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injections USP in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well-controlled studies. However, as referenced in the medical literature, potassium chloride injection has been used to treat pediatric patients with potassium deficiency when oral replacement therapy is not feasible.

For patients receiving potassium supplement at greater than maintenance rates, frequent monitoring of serum potassium levels and serial EKGs are recommended.

Dextrose is safe and effective for the stated indications in pediatric patients (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). As reported in the literature, the dosage selection and constant infusion rate of intravenous dextrose must be selected with caution in pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low birth weight infants, because of the increased risk of hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia. Frequent monitoring of serum glucose concentrations is required when dextrose is prescribed to pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low birth weight infants.

In neonates or in very small infants even small volumes of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance. Care must be exercised in treatment of neonates, especially pre-term neonates, whose renal function may be immature and whose ability to excrete fluid and solute loads may be limited. Fluid intake, urine output, and serum electrolytes should be monitored closely.

### Sodium lactate, potassium chloride, sodium chloride, calcium chloride (Ringers) [^116TQVK7]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation.

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus.

Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids, especially those containing sodium ions, to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.

Potassium containing solutions should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly in digitalized patients or in the presence of renal disease.

Solutions containing lactate ions should be used with caution as excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.

Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion.

Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Ringer's Injection, USP, Ringer's and Dextrose Injection, USP, Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer's and Dextrose Injection, USP. It is also not known whether these injections can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. These injections should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population are based on the similarity of the clinical conditions of the pediatric and adult populations. In neonates or very small infants the volume of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance.

Frequent monitoring of serum glucose concentrations is required when dextrose is prescribed to pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low birth weight infants.

In very low birth weight infants, excessive or rapid administration of dextrose injection may result in increased serum osmolarity and possible intracerebral hemorrhage.

### Potassium acetate [^116W3U3H]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Do not administer unless solution is clear and seal is intact. Discard unused portion.

Potassium replacement therapy should be guided primarily by ECG monitoring and secondarily by the serum potassium level.

High plasma concentrations of potassium may cause death by cardiac depression, arrhythmias or arrest.

Use with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly in digitalized patients or in the presence of renal disease.

Solutions containing acetate ion should be used with caution as excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.

Pregnancy

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with potassium acetate. It is also not known whether potassium acetate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Potassium acetate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of potassium acetate have been established in pediatric patients.

Geriatric Use: An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Potassium ions are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

### Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy: implications for obstetric anesthesia [^111xQTMW]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The IV insulin infusion rate and exogenous dextrose infusion should be adjusted to maintain a serum glucose level at 100 to 150 mg/dl. IV insulin should be continued until serum bicarbonate levels have normalized, the anion gap is less than 12, and ketosis is resolved. Once the metabolic ketoacidosis is resolved, then the patient should be transitioned back to basal-bolus subcutaneous insulin or allowed to restart their subcutaneous insulin pump. The insulin infusion should be stopped 1 to 2 h after resuming basal insulin.

Just as with nonpregnant patients, most pregnant patients with DKA present with a total-body potassium deficit due to osmotic diuresis, emesis, and hyperaldosteronismeven as measured serum potassium may be normal (or elevated) due to transcellular potassium shifts in the context of acidemia. Administration of insulin and correction of acidosis will shift potassium back into the cell, revealing the underlying hypokalemia. Small retrospective studies have suggested a strong link between maternal hypokalemia in DKA and fetal loss, so aggressive and early potassium replacement is appropriate in pregnancy-associated DKA. It is typically recommended that supplemental potassium be administered in patients who present with a serum potassium less than 5.3 mEq/l by adding 20 mEq potassium to each liter of IV fluid administered. Current recommendations are to give fluid and potassium before insulin if potassium is less than 3.3 mEq/l to avoid maternal arrhythmias, respiratory compromise, and the risk of fetal loss. When serum potassium is less than 3.3 mEq/l, IV potassium chloride should be given at a rate of 20 to 40 mEq/h, likely in an intensive care unit setting to support rapid correction before insulin infusion.

### Sodium chloride for irrigation [^116HKHP2]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

General

Use aseptic technique when preparing and administering sterile irrigation solutions.

Use only if solution is clear and container and seal are intact.

Do not use for irrigation that may result in absorption of large amounts of fluid into the blood.

Caution should be observed when the solution is used for continuous irrigation or allowed to "dwell" inside body cavities because of possible absorption into the blood stream and the production of circulatory overload.

When used for irrigation via appropriate irrigation equipment, the administration set should be attached promptly. Unused portions should be discarded and a fresh container of appropriate size used for the start up of each cycle or repeat procedure. For repeated irrigations of urethral catheters, a separate container should be used for each patient.

Laboratory Tests

Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance after prolonged irrigation, when fluid absorption is suspected, or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation.

Drug Interactions

Some additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist. When introducing additives, use aseptic technique. Mix thoroughly. Do not store.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Studies with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Irrigation USP have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential, or effects on fertility.

### Cysteine hydrochloride (Elcys) [^116hhjjZ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Appropriate administration of ELCYS is not expected to cause major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or

fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with cysteine hydrochloride.

The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All

pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the

estimated background risk of major birth defect and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15

to 20%, respectively.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Data available on the effects of cysteine hydrochloride on infants, either directly or through breastmilk, do not suggest a

significant risk of adverse events from exposure. Although there are no data on the presence of cysteine hydrochloride in

human or animal milk or the effects on milk production, appropriate administration of ELCYS is not expected to cause

harm to a breastfed infant. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the

mother's clinical need for ELCYS and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ELCYS or from the

underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

ELCYS is approved for use in pediatric patients, from birth to 17 years of age, for use as an additive to amino acid

solutions to meet the nutritional requirements of newborn infants, including preterm infants, requiring total parenteral

nutrition (TPN) and pediatric patients with severe liver disease who may have impaired enzymatic processes and require

TPN. The safety profile for ELCYS use in pediatric patients includes risks of acid-base imbalance and hyperammonemia.

Acid-base imbalance, including metabolic acidosis, may occur with ELCYS administration in preterm infants. Frequent

clinical and laboratory assessments are necessary to monitor and manage fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and

acid-base balance during parenteral nutrition therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Hyperammonemia is of special significance in infants (birth to two years of age). This reaction appears to be related to a

deficiency of the urea cycle amino acids of genetic or product origin. It is essential that blood ammonia be measured

frequently in infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Because of immature renal function, preterm infants receiving prolonged PN treatment with ELCYS may be at higher risk

of aluminum toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### The teratogenicity of drugs for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: perceived versus true risk [^113Zgcdt]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Women and health care providers commonly overestimate the teratogenic risk of medications in pregnancy. With regard to nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, this leads to an underutilization of pharmacologic therapy. Pregnancy termination has even been elected in some circumstances when safe and effective alternatives for nausea have not been attempted. The misperception of teratogenic risk is partly the result of the way data on safety are presented. An awareness of this can lead to more balanced patient and physician educational materials. To facilitate rational use of medicinal and nonmedicinal therapy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, we have developed an algorithm based on a recent systematic review of safety and efficacy in management of the problem. The hierarchical use of medication is based on strength of evidence of fetal safety.

### First do no harm-interventions during labor and maternal satisfaction: a descriptive cross-sectional study [^115f3PHZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

"A natural birth that takes place of its own accord without interventions of any sort is a complicated process in itself, but also equally fine-tuned and balanced, prone to having its optimal properties eliminated with each intervention. Therefore, the only intervention asked of those supervising childbirth should be to respect this awe-inspiring phenomenon and adhere to medicine's first fundamental principle which reads 'Pimum non nocere'". Indiscriminately resorting to medical intervention where it is not needed violates the principle of respect for medical physiology and the fundamental medical principle of "PRIMUM NON NOCERE".

Advances in medical technologies have undeniably provided significant benefits in terms of maternal and infant health, especially in high-risk pregnancies and premature births. In recent years in some countries, however, almost all pregnant mothers undergo interventions (enema, perineal shaving, liquid and food intake restrictions, routine IV fluid infusion, continuous EFM (electronic fetal monitoring), routine amniotomy, frequent vaginal examinations, use of vaginal antiseptic agents) without proper assessment of whether it is really needed. For example, studies conducted in countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Canada, Spain, China, South Africa and Turkey indicate that unnecessary medical interventions are common during normal labor. It is known that unnecessary interventions undertaken without indication disrupt the natural progression of labor, causing complications to the fetus and the mother (ketosis, dehydration, prolonged labor, interventional delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, cost increase, restriction of options for subsequent births, negative and unhappy childbirth experiences, feelings of failure and guilt, longer hospitalization periods, etc.). For example, in many hospitals, obstetric interventions such as eating and drinking restrictions, IV fluid infusion, continuous EFM, induction, enema and episiotomy are routinely performed on all women without a specific medical justification. In fact, recent evidence-based studies indicate that routine interventions during low-risk births have failed to make births safer for either the mother or the baby, and that some medical practices disrupt the natural course of birth, creating unwanted complications during labor. Furthermore, such interventions tend to cause women to be dissatisfied with the childbirth experience, causing them to seek alternative methods for their next child's birth. Care must therefore be taken to maximize the use of preventive measures during the normal delivery process to minimize the need for interventions. The World Health Organization (WHO) envisions a world in which all pregnant women and their babies are provided quality care during pregnancy, birth and the postnatal period. In order to reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality, every pregnant woman needs competent care with evidence-based practices during birth in a supportive environment. Quality care includes efficient clinical and nonclinical interventions, a health staff with optimum competence, and a strong health infrastructure to obtain better health outcomes and ensure the positive experience of women and healthcare providers. Moreover, quality of care is considered a key component of the right to health and the route to equity and dignity for women and children. In order to achieve this, healthcare needs to be safe, effective, timely, efficient, equitable, and people-centered. To achieve this, midwives/nurses/physicians should be trained to feel more confident with practices that facilitate normal childbirth, encouraged to more carefully assess the potential consequences and risks that come with each intervention, and to resort to interventions only when the situation calls for it, while mothers should also be educated to raise their awareness so that they can actively participate in the decision-making process with regard to how the child should be delivered. Women should be properly informed before any intervention is made and their approval should be sought.

### Lithium carbonate (Lithobid) [^114WP25T]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of lithium carbonate ER PO (also known as Lithobid) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor the thyroid function of the neonate. Monitor neonates for signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity. In humans, lithium may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Data from lithium birth registries suggest an increase in cardiac and other anomalies, especially Ebstein's anomaly. If this drug is used in women of childbearing potential, or during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised by their physician of the potential hazard to the fetus.

### Safety of LEEP in treating CIN 2–3 during pregnancy [^112LQPun]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2–3, a premalignant lesion usually treated by Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) in nonpregnant women, is addressed differently in pregnant women. Data from 2006 to 2023 on 178 pregnant women with CIN 2–3 were provided by the Israeli Society of Colposcopy. Sixty-seven underwent LEEP within 15 weeks of gestation with only minor complications. Of the 57 continuing pregnancies, 53 (93%) delivered at term, 2 (3.5%) at 34–37 weeks, and 2 (3.5%) experienced missed abortions. One hundred eleven women were followed through pregnancy without LEEP. Of that group, 5 women were lost to follow-up. From 173 women on whom the authors have follow-up data, 9 (5.2%) were finally diagnosed with cervical cancer, 132 women (76.3%) remained CIN 2–3, and 32 women (18.5%) were CIN 1 or normal. Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) performed within the first 15 weeks of pregnancy in 67 women was safe. In 5.2% of pregnant women with CIN 2–3, the final diagnosis was invasive cancer.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111q2p8C]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Hirsutism — direct hair removal methods (recommendations 4.1–4.4) advise modality choice by hair color and specific precautions for women of color: "we suggest photoepilation for those whose unwanted hair is auburn, brown, or black, and we suggest electrolysis for those with white or blonde hair". For "women of color who choose photoepilation treatment, we suggest using a long-wavelength, long pulse-duration light source such as Nd: YAG or diode laser delivered with appropriate skin cooling", and "Clinicians should warn Mediterranean and Middle Eastern women with facial hirsutism about the increased risk of developing PH with photoepilation therapy. We often suggest topical treatment or electrolysis over photoepilation with these patients". Adjuncts are also addressed: "For women who desire more rapid response to photoepilation, we suggest adding eflornithine topical cream during treatment", and "For women with known hyperandrogenemia who choose hair removal therapy, we suggest pharmacologic therapy to minimize hair regrowth".

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114tKYEm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the "Evaluation and Treatment of Hirsutism in Premenopausal Women: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline", published by the Endocrine Society in 2008.

Participants

The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of seven medical experts and a methodologist.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus Process

Group meetings, conference calls, and e-mail communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees, members, and cosponsoring organizations reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of the guidelines.

Conclusion

We suggest testing for elevated androgen levels in all women with an abnormal hirsutism score. We suggest against testing for elevated androgen levels in eumenorrheic women with unwanted local hair growth (i.e., in the absence of an abnormal hirsutism score). For most women with patient-important hirsutism despite cosmetic measures (shaving, plucking, waxing), we suggest starting with pharmacological therapy and adding direct hair removal methods (electrolysis, photoepilation) for those who desire additional cosmetic benefit. For women with mild hirsutism and no evidence of an endocrine disorder, we suggest either pharmacological therapy or direct hair removal methods. For pharmacological therapy, we suggest oral combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives for the majority of women, adding an antiandrogen after 6 months if the response is suboptimal. We recommend against antiandrogen monotherapy unless adequate contraception is used. We suggest against using insulin-lowering drugs. For most women who choose hair removal therapy, we suggest laser/photoepilation.

### Dextrose monohydrate, sodium chloride, and potassium chloride (potassium chloride in dextrose and sodium chloride) [^117Tjtrs]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation.

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus.

Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids, especially those containing sodium ions, to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.

Potassium replacement therapy should be guided primarily by serial electrocardiograms. Plasma potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels.

High plasma concentrations of potassium may cause death through cardiac depression, arrhythmias or arrest.

Potassium-containing solutions should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly in digitalized patients or in the presence of renal disease.

Care should be exercised to insure that the needle (or catheter) is well within the lumen of the vein and that extravasation does not occur.

Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:

Studies with solutions from flexible plastic containers have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility.

Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with dextrose, potassium chloride or sodium chloride. It is also not known whether dextrose, potassium chloride or sodium chloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Dextrose, potassium chloride or sodium chloride should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

Nursing Mothers:

Caution should be exercised when solutions from flexible plastic containers are administered to a nursing mother.

Pediatric Use:

The safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population are based on the similarity of the clinical conditions of the pediatric and adult populations. In neonates or very small infants the volume of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance.

Frequent monitoring of serum glucose concentrations is required when dextrose is prescribed to pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low birth weight infants.

In very low birth weight infants, excessive or rapid administration of dextrose injection may result in increased serum osmolality and possible intracerebral hemorrhage.

### Rhabdomyolysis after hyperemesis gravidarum [^117LzsRQ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperemesis gravidarum may lead to hypovolemia and substantial electrolyte abnormalities, including hypokalemia. Hypokalemia, when profound, may result in rare consequences, such as rhabdomyolysis.

Case

A 20-year-old woman with hyperemesis gravidarum at 19 weeks of gestation presented with extreme leg weakness and was found to have hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. Her course was complicated by rhabdomyolysis, which, after excluding other causes, was attributed to hypokalemia and severe dehydration. After aggressive electrolyte and hydration repletion, she experienced resolution of her symptoms.

Conclusion

Pregnancies complicated by hyperemesis gravidarum represent potentially high-risk clinical scenarios for electrolyte abnormalities and subsequent complications, including rhabdomyolysis.

### Developing a systematic approach to safer medication use during pregnancy: summary of a centers for disease control and prevention – convened meeting [^112zAR6i]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

To address information gaps that limit informed clinical decisions on medication use in pregnancy, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) solicited expert input on a draft prototype outlining a systematic approach to evaluating the quality and strength of existing evidence for associated risks. The draft prototype outlined a process for the systematic review of available evidence and deliberations by a panel of experts to inform clinical decision making for managing health conditions in pregnancy. At an expert meeting convened by the CDC in January 2013, participants divided into working groups discussed decision points within the prototype. This report summarizes their discussions of best practices for formulating an expert review process, developing evidence summaries and treatment guidance, and disseminating information. There is clear recognition of current knowledge gaps and a strong collaboration of federal partners, academic experts, and professional organizations willing to work together toward safer medication use during pregnancy.

### Safety of cosmetic dermatologic procedures during pregnancy [^116YaHzs]. Dermatologic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Safety of cosmetic procedures in pregnant women has not been extensively studied. Maternal and fetal health risks are important to consider in any procedure performed. With the increasing popularity of cosmetic procedures, dermatologic surgeons will be faced with scenarios necessitating knowledge regarding the safety of such procedures during pregnancy. Furthermore, dermatologic surgeons may inadvertently perform cosmetic procedures during the first trimester, before the patient is aware of the pregnancy.

Objective

To investigate the safety of cosmetic procedures during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

Methods and Materials

A literature search of PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted of all English-language articles published from 1960 through 2012.

Results

Definitive recommendations on the safety of procedures such as chemical peels, injectables, fillers, and most laser therapies during pregnancy cannot be made. The safety of onabotulinum toxin usage is well documented in the neurology literature, although isolated events of miscarriage have been reported with high doses of toxin in women with a previous history of miscarriage. Carbon dioxide laser therapy for genital condylomas has considerable evidence supporting its safety during pregnancy.

Conclusion

There is a lack of controlled trials addressing the safety of cosmetic procedures during pregnancy and postpartum periods. It is advisable to delay elective cosmetic procedures until after the baby is born.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115ZtcJw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Values and preferences — hair removal modality selection uses conditional suggestions: Our suggestion to use photoepilation over electrolysis for most women with unwanted pigmented hair is based on higher efficacy and convenience, less pain, and overall lower cost for the number of treatments necessary in most women. Our suggestion to use electrolysis over photoepilation for women with white or blonde unwanted hair is based on IPL's (intense pulsed light) lack of efficacy for this group. Our suggestion to use long-wavelength, long pulse-duration lasers with skin cooling over other lasers or IPLs for photoepilation in women of color is based on relative avoidance of skin burns and pigmentation changes. Our suggestion to consider electrolysis (or shaving, waxing, topical therapy) over photoepilation for women of Mediterranean or Middle Eastern background with facial hirsutism is based on higher risk of developing laser-induced PH.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115WwELT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Hirsutism — permanent hair reduction modalities describe regulatory definitions and modality characteristics: "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a large number of photoepilation devices [laser and intense pulsed light (IPL)] for permanent hair reduction". The FDA "define permanent hair reduction as attaining at least a 30% reduction of terminal hairs and sustaining this reduction for a period longer than the complete growth cycle of hair follicles (4 to 12 months, depending on body site)". "Photoepilation is a method capable of rapidly treating large areas; it requires the presence of pigmented, terminal hair". In contrast, "Electrolysis is generally limited to small treatment areas, and it does not depend on hair pigmentation".

### Desmopressin to prevent and treat bleeding in pregnant women with an inherited bleeding disorder: a systematic literature review [^113C58wF]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although desmopressin (DDAVP) is an accessible and inexpensive hemostatic drug, its use in pregnancy is still debated due to safety uncertainties.

Objectives

We aimed to review the safety and effectiveness of DDAVP in women with an inherited bleeding disorder during pregnancy and delivery.

Methods

Databases were searched for articles up to July 25, 2022, reporting maternal and/or neonatal outcomes. PRISMA methodology for systematic reviews and meta-analyses was followed (PROSPERO CRD42022316490).

Results

Fifty-three studies were included, comprising 273 pregnancies. Regarding maternal outcomes, DDAVP was administered in 73 women during pregnancy and in 232 during delivery. Safety outcome was reported in 245 pregnancies, with severe adverse events reported in 2 (1%, hyponatremia with neurologic symptoms). Overall, DDAVP was used as monotherapy in 234 pregnancies, with effectiveness reported in 153 pregnancies (82% effective; 18% ineffective). Regarding neonatal outcomes, out of 60 pregnancies with reported neonatal outcomes after DDAVP use during pregnancy, 2 children (3%) had a severe adverse event (preterm delivery n = 1; fetal growth restriction n = 1). Of the 232 deliveries, 169 neonates were exposed to DDAVP during delivery, and in 114 neonates, safety outcome was reported. Two children (2%) experienced a moderate adverse event (low Apgar score n = 1; transient hyperbilirubinemia not associated with DDAVP n = 1).

Conclusion

DDAVP use during pregnancy and delivery seems safe for the mother, with special attention to the occurrence of hyponatremia and for the child, especially during delivery. However, due to poor study designs and limited documentation of outcomes, a well-designed prospective study is warranted.

### Treatment of poor placentation and the prevention of associated adverse outcomes – what does the future hold? [^112v2Dp5]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2014). Low credibility.

HOW CAN NOVEL THERAPIES BE TRANSLATED INTO THE CLINIC?

To achieve real benefit for the future health of pregnant women, effective therapies must be brought from the realm of research into clinical practice. This process is hampered, however, by the reluctance of the pharmaceutical industry to invest in the development of new obstetric drugs or to licence existing drugs for use in pregnancy. This reluctance may arise from a fear of litigation combined with the practical and ethical complexity of conducting obstetric clinical trials, which must take into account not only the pregnant woman, the fetus, and long-term neonatal follow-up but also the diseases that currently have heterogeneous manifestations and unpredictable clinical progression. To some extent, safety considerations can be addressed with a firm basis of pre-clinical evidence. Ideally, this should include reproductive toxicology studies and evidence of efficacy in an animal model of the disease, taking into account species differences in placental structure and function as well as the timing of different stages of organ development. However, real progress will require greater recognition that excluding pregnant women from clinical trials does not protect them from risk but rather unfairly disadvantages them by restricting their access to evidence-based medicine.–

### Quinapril [^113L7rkd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Pregnancy

Tell female patients of childbearing age about the consequences of exposure to quinapril during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Ask patients to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible.

Angioedema

Angioedema, including laryngeal edema can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Advise patients and tell them to immediately report any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of face, extremities, eyes, lips, tongue, difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to stop taking the drug until they have consulted with their physician (see WARNINGS).

Symptomatic hypotension

Caution patients that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first few days of quinapril therapy, and that it should be reported to a physician. If actual syncope occurs, tell patients to temporarily discontinue the drug until they have consulted with their physician (see WARNINGS).

Caution all patients that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid volume, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope.

Tell patients planning to undergo any surgery and/or anesthesia to inform their physician that they are taking an ACE inhibitor.

Hyperkalemia

Tell patients not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting their physician (see PRECAUTIONS).

Neutropenia

Tell patients to promptly report any indication of infection (eg, sore throat, fever) which could be a sign of neutropenia.

NOTE: As with many other drugs, certain advice to patients being treated with quinapril is warranted. This information is intended to aid in the safe and effective use of this medication. It is not a disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects.

### Ethinylestradiol / chlormadinone acetate for use in dermatological disorders [^114etWyV]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Among the pharmacological treatments available to manage or treat the dermatological disorders in the patients in our case series, a rational treatment choice would be hormonal therapies that target androgen excess (in which androgen excess is found, e.g. in acne) or those that target pilosebaceous unit sensitivity to androgens (in which increased 5α-reductase activity is found, e.g. in idiopathic hirsutism).

Oral hormonal therapies investigated for female androgenetic alopecia have had varied success. The 5α-reductase inhibitor (a testosterone conversion blocker) finasteride does not appear to be effective, at least in postmenopausal women (at a dose of 1 mg). The oral anti-androgens (androgen receptor antagonists) spironolactone and cyproterone acetate (alone or when given in combination with an estrogen) have been shown to be effective in limiting the progression of hair loss or improve hair growth, and have been used off-label for many years despite a lack of evidence from well-designed studies. The use of anti-androgens requires the use of good contraception because of the risk of feminization of a fetus. Evidence of their use from well-designed studies is lacking. Limited evidence suggests hormonal therapy is helpful even in patients with FPB with normal hormone levels. Currently, the only approved agent for female androgenetic alopecia is a non-hormonal therapy (minoxidil). None of the pharmacological treatments for FPB result in full hair recovery, and they are therefore used indefinitely to prolong their effect. Similarly, the management of hirsutism requires ongoing treatment with cosmetic (e.g. topical eflornithine hydrochloride) and physical measures (such as electrolysis, laser hair removal) and/or hormonal therapy. Anti-androgens (e.g. spironolactone, cyproterone acetate) have been investigated in this indication but not in randomized controlled trials, and again, their use is limited by the potential for feminization of male fetuses. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs; combination of an estrogen and a progestin) are the first line of pharmacological treatment of hirsutism, particularly in young women who do not want to become pregnant. COCs that may be used include those with low androgenic activity, such as ethinylestradiol in combination either with drospirenone (Yasmin), norgestimate (Ortho-Cyclen) or ethynodiol diacetate (Demulen 1–50). Cyproterone has also been combined with ethinylestradiol in a contraceptive (Dianette) and is approved for use in moderately severe hirsutism, but is associated with body weight gain, reduced libido and breast tenderness.

### Hirsutism in women [^114RU1oq]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Hirsutism is excess terminal hair that commonly appears in a male pattern in women. Although hirsutism is generally associated with hyperandrogenemia, one-half of women with mild symptoms have normal androgen levels. The most common cause of hirsutism is polycystic ovary syndrome, accounting for three out of every four cases. Many medications can also cause hirsutism. In patients whose hirsutism is not related to medication use, evaluation is focused on testing for endocrinopathies and neoplasms, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, adrenal hyperplasia, thyroid dysfunction, Cushing syndrome, and androgen-secreting tumors. Symptoms and findings suggestive of neoplasm include rapid onset of symptoms, signs of virilization, and a palpable abdominal or pelvic mass. Patients without these findings who have mild symptoms and normal menses can be treated empirically. For patients with moderate or severe symptoms, an early morning total testosterone level should be obtained, and if moderately elevated, it should be followed by a plasma free testosterone level. A total testosterone level greater than 200 ng per dL (6.94 nmol per L) should prompt evaluation for an androgen-secreting tumor. Further workup is guided by history and physical examination, and may include thyroid function tests, prolactin level, 17-hydroxyprogesterone level, and corticotropin stimulation test. Treatment includes hair removal and pharmacologic measures. Shaving is effective but needs to be repeated often. Evidence for the effectiveness of electrolysis and laser therapy is limited. In patients who are not planning a pregnancy, first-line pharmacologic treatment should include oral contraceptives. Topical agents, such as eflornithine, may also be used. Treatment response should be monitored for at least six months before making adjustments.

- current long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy

- chronic adrenal failure

- known coagulopathy or anticoagulant therapy

- inherited porphyria

### Gitelman syndrome patient managed with amiloride during pregnancy and lactation [^114uJaZ2]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Gitelman Syndrome (GS) is a rare autosomal-recessive tubular disorder characterized by hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism, and normotension. Management of GS during pregnancy is particularly challenging due to pregnancy-associated renal physiological changes and due to controversial safety profiles regarding teratogenicity of medications commonly used for GS management in non-pregnant patients. We report a case of a 20-year-old female patient diagnosed of GS who was treated with amiloride during pregnancy and lactation due to persistent hypokalemia resistant to oral supplementation therapy. Use of amiloride facilitated control of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia in the mother without causing any noticeable side effects in the newborn.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^114SG7TV]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Gender-affirming medical interventions for nonbinary people — when a particular intervention lacks established precedent, it is important that before the intervention is considered, the individual is provided with an overview of the available information, including recognition of potential knowledge limits, and it is equally important to undertake and document a comprehensive discussion of the physical changes needed and the potential limitations in achieving those attributes, including whether an intervention may or may not enhance gender expression. For estrogen therapy in nonbinary people assigned male at birth (AMAB), it is important to note the possibility of breast growth cannot be avoided, and this should be made clear if a nonbinary person seeks some of the other changes associated with estrogen therapy (such as softening of skin and reduction in facial hair growth) but does not want or is ambivalent about breast growth. For testosterone in nonbinary people assigned female at birth (AFAB), it should be recognized that if facial hair development is needed, genital growth is inevitable, and the time frame for taking testosterone means these changes are likely also to be accompanied by an irreversible vocal pitch drop, although the extent of each is individual; a vocal pitch drop without the development of body hair is another such challenge, and for some nonbinary people a low dose may be justified as a compromise. If hormonal therapy is discontinued and endogenous hormones are retained, many physical changes will revert to pre-hormone therapy status, including reversal of amenorrhea and body hair development in nonbinary people AFAB and reduction in muscular definition and erectile dysfunction in nonbinary people AMAB, but other changes will be permanent such as "male-pattern" baldness, genital growth, and facial hair growth in nonbinary people AFAB or breast development in nonbinary people AMAB; these will require further interventions to reverse, such as electrolysis or mastectomy and are sometimes described as "partially reversible". As the implications of using low-dose hormone therapy are not documented in this patient population, it is important to consider monitoring for cardiovascular risk and bone health if low-dose hormone therapy is used.

### ESR essentials: advanced MR safety in vulnerable patients-practice recommendations by the European society for magnetic resonance in medicine and biology [^116ucb5s]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregnant patients

MR scanning is safe in any trimester of pregnancy.
Heat dissipation in the fetus is impaired, and low-SAR procedures need to be selected, well within the limits of normal scanning.
Contrast agents should be used sparingly due to their prolonged presence in the amniotic fluid.

There is now sufficient evidence supporting that exposure to static magnetic field intensities used in clinical MR is reasonably safe during any trimester of pregnancy. However, RF power deposition can have a heating effect on the fetus, whose only pathway for heat dissipation is via the body of the gestational parent. Simulations show that even by scanning in normal mode, fetal temperature can rise above 38 °C. Contrast agents must also be used sparingly, as there is evidence that they can cross the placental barrier into the fetal circulation, where they are then excreted through the fetal kidney pathway into the amniotic fluid, in which they can remain for a long time. The fetus is generally not considered to be particularly exposed to acoustic noise propagated through the air due to the attenuation provided by the parent's body, but, to prevent transmission of acoustic noise to the ear through direct mechanical coupling with the bed, it should be shielded from vibrations through cushions placed under the patient.

### Assessment of management approaches for hyperemesis gravidarum and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a retrospective questionnaire analysis [^111mus8v]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) are extremely common, taking place in 70–80% of pregnancies. However, 0.3–3.6% of pregnant patients experience the most severe form of NVP known as Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG), with debilitating symptoms. A recently developed consensus definition for hyperemesis gravidarum, also referred to as the Windsor Definition, includes start of symptoms in early pregnancy (before 16 weeks gestational age); nausea and vomiting, at least one of which severe; inability to eat and/or drink normally; strongly limits daily living activities. HG is further characterized by intractable vomiting, especially during the first trimester that is difficult to treat and often leads to hypovolemia and weight loss. HG is the single largest cause of early pregnancy hospitalization in the United States. Patients with HG are commonly hospitalized due to weight loss that exceeds 5% of pre-pregnancy weight, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, arrhythmias, and acid-base balance disturbance. HG can also be a driving factor in the development of metabolic disorders including acute kidney injury. Despite the prevalence and significant morbidity associated with HG, high-quality research is still lacking in its basic etiology, treatment, and prevention. Most studies are limited by too few participants, biases, and uncontrollable confounding variables. Furthermore, stigma, inappropriate management, and lack of investment have all played a role in impeding care for these patients.

The James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership on HG determined that finding effective clinical management is the second highest priority in HG research. Most research specific to therapeutic and pharmacologic interventions for HG does not include randomized control studies, and cross-study comparison is made challenging by inconsistent diagnostic criteria. The etiology of NVP/HG still evades researchers and practitioners. Therefore, our current treatments are aimed at treating symptoms with general antiemetic regimens rather than at specific mechanisms in the pregnant patient. It is commonly accepted that NVP is multifactorial, potentially including hormone imbalances, placental disorders, and genetic causes. Though there is no strong evidence to support serotonin, dopamine, or histamine being the direct causes of this condition, these are the targets for the standard antiemetic medications. Available therapies have remained virtually unchanged over the past few decades, and affected patients only respond partially to the antiemetics that are currently recommended for HG treatment.

### Physiological need for calcium, iron, and folic acid for women of various subpopulations during pregnancy and beyond [^115nWg8c]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Calcium

Calcium, an essential element available only through dietary sources, is responsible for maintenance of the electric gradient across membranes, bone formation, and enzyme and hormone functioning. Stored largely in bone (99%), calcium is essential for muscle contraction, bone and tooth development, blood clotting, nerve impulse transmission, heart rhythm regulation, and fluid balance within cells.

Calcium balance is a function of dietary intake, intestinal absorption, renal excretion, and bone remodeling. The three latter mechanisms are regulated by the parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], and ionized calcium, along with receptors in the intestine, kidney, and bone that correspond to these hormones. Hypercalcemia, frequently caused by primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy, is associated with depression, lethargy, coma, muscle weakness, and constipation. Hypocalcemia — normally caused by medication, medical treatment, or disease processes — can result in convulsions, paresthesia, cramps, and tetany. Dietary deficiency can cause muscle cramping, dry skin, and brittle nails. It can also lead to osteoporosis and its associated effects, including bone deterioration and increased risk of fractures.

Calcium requirements vary in women, depending on their reproductive stage. Calcium bone stores fluctuate throughout a woman's life, with absorption from the diet gradually declining in adulthood.

Bone growth occurs slowly during early childhood, increases quickly during puberty, and peaks between 25 and 30 years of age. Inadequate calcium intake can cause several problems in growing children and adolescents, including stunted growth and reduced peak bone density.

During pregnancy, the efficiency of intestinal calcium absorption doubles, whereas during lactation, the maternal skeleton is resorbed to provide calcium for milk. Calcium intake remains especially critical during pregnancy and lactation because of the potential adverse effect on maternal and fetal bone health if maternal calcium stores are depleted. Since both the fetus and breastfed newborn are dependent on maternal sources for their total calcium, adequate maternal calcium intake can also affect fetal bone health positively.

Episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can represent a life-threatening emergency for mother and fetus. The cornerstones of treatment of DKA are aggressive fluid replacement and insulin administration while ascertaining which precipitating factors brought about the current episode of DKA, and then treating accordingly to mitigate those factors. The incidence of DKA and factors unique to pregnancy are discussed in this article, along with the effects of the disease process on pregnancy. Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment modalities are covered in detail to offer ideas to improve maternal and fetal outcome.

If antisecretory/mucosal protectant prophylaxis is required for reflux management, only agents safe in pregnancy should be offered.(Note the ranitidine recall by the US Food and Drugs Administration and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency due to the ongoing investigation of a possible contaminant, N ‐nitrosodimethylamine.)

R7 ↑↑ Assess and manage constipation in women with EB. Patients may benefit from regular exercise, improved hydration and dietary modification. Iron supplementation may need review. Osmotic laxatives, in particular, may be helpful.

R8 ↑↑ Monitor gravid distention of the abdomen for impact on EB wounds. Although skin involvement does not routinely worsen during pregnancy in EB, there have been occasional reports of wound deterioration related to abdominal distention.,

A.5 Clinical examination of pregnant women during antenatal visits

R9 ↑↑ Engage the multidisciplinary team (MDT) early during pregnancy for patients with complex forms of EB. Where available, a team consisting of midwife, obstetrician, dermatologist, clinical nurse specialist, anaesthetist, occupational therapist and psychologist will improve pregnancy management. If an infant with EB is expected, timely involvement of the neonatal team and paediatric EB nurse is needed.

R10 ↑↑ Perform standard antenatal investigations according to local guidelines with the following modifications (Appendix S4; see Supporting Information):
Blood pressure cuffs and tourniquets may usually be applied, taking care to avoid frictional or shearing forces.
Nonadhesive tape should be used, and padding applied under cuffs or tourniquets.
Ultrasound can be performed safely in a woman with EB. For abdominal ultrasound, ensure generous abdominal lubrication prior to assessment, and attempt gentle pressure. For vaginal ultrasound, the smallest probe should be selected and well lubricated prior to insertion.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114TXAdQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

4.2a–b. Remarks

Successful pregnancy outcomes have been reported within a wide range of calorie intakes ranging from 1500 to 2800 kcal/d (,–); however, most studies have been small and uncontrolled and relied on self-reported dietary intake. Severe calorie restriction (< 1500 kcal/d, or 50% reduction from prepregnancy), however, is to be avoided because there is evidence, at least in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, that this degree of calorie restriction increases ketosis, which has been linked to impaired fetal brain development. Moderate calorie restriction (1600–1800 kcal/d, 33% reduction) does not lead to significant ketosis and is appropriate for overweight or obese women with overt or gestational diabetes. Calorie restriction is not warranted for underweight or normal-weight women with these conditions so long as fetal growth and weight gain targets are being met.

Carbohydrate intake

4.3. We suggest women with overt or gestational diabetes limit carbohydrate intake to 35% to 45% of total calories, distributed in 3 small- to moderate-sized meals and 2 to 4 snacks including an evening snack. (2|⊕⊕○○)

4.3. Evidence

There is no definitive evidence for the optimal proportion of carbohydrate in the diet of women with overt or gestational diabetes; values from 40% to 45% of energy intake to 60% (if the carbohydrate is from complex sources) have been recommended. Some authorities suggest that a minimum of 175 g/d carbohydrate should be provided, which is higher than the 130 g/d recommended for nonpregnant women. Nonetheless, restricting the total amount of carbohydrate ingested may assist with glycemic control as may distributing carbohydrates over several meals and snacks, manipulating the types of carbohydrate consumed, and choosing low-glycemic-index foods. No interventional studies, however, have been conducted using the glycemic index in pregnant women with diabetes.

Nutritional supplements

4.4. We recommend pregnant women with overt or gestational diabetes should follow the same guidelines for the intake of minerals and vitamins as for women without diabetes (1|⊕⊕○○), with the exception of taking folic acid 5 mg daily beginning 3 months before withdrawing contraceptive measures or otherwise trying to conceive (see Recommendation 1.4). We suggest that at 12 weeks gestation, the dose of folic acid be reduced to 0.4 to 1.0 mg/d, which should be continued until the completion of breastfeeding (2|⊕⊕○○).

### Hirsutism: an evidence-based treatment update [^114Po2jr]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hirsutism has a relatively high prevalence among women. Depending upon societal and ethnic norms, it can cause significant psychosocial distress. Importantly, hirsutism may be associated with underlying disorders and co-morbidities. Hirsutism should not simply be looked upon as an issue of cosmesis. Patients require appropriate evaluation so that underlying etiologies and associated sequelae are recognized and managed. Treatment of hirsutism often requires a multidisciplinary approach, and a variety of physical or pharmacologic modalities can be employed. Efficacy of these therapies is varied and depends, among other things, upon patient factors including the underlying etiology, hormonal drive, and local tissue sensitivity to androgens.

Objective

The objective of this paper is to review and summarize current evidence evaluating the efficacy of various treatment modalities for hirsutism in premenopausal women.

Methods

Online databases were searched to identify all relevant prior systematic reviews and meta-analyses as well as recently published (2012-present) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on hirsutism treatment.

Results

Four recently published RCTs met criteria for inclusion in our review. In addition, one meta-analysis and one systematic review/treatment guideline were identified in the recent literature. Physical modalities and oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) remain first-line treatments. Evidence supports the use of electrolysis for permanent hair removal in localized areas and lasers (particularly alexandrite and diode lasers) for permanent hair reduction. Topical eflornithine can be used as monotherapy for mild hirsutism and as an adjunct therapy with lasers or pharmacotherapy in more severe cases. Combined OCPs as a class are superior to placebo; however, antiandrogenic and low-dose neutral OCPs may be slightly more efficacious in improving hirsutism compared with other types of OCPs. Antiandrogens are indicated for moderate to severe hirsutism, with spironolactone being the first-line antiandrogen and finasteride and cyproterone acetate being second-line antiandrogens. Due to its risk for hepatotoxicity, flutamide is not considered a first-line therapy. If used, the lowest effective dose should be administered with careful monitoring of liver enzymes. Monotherapy with an insulin sensitizer does not significantly improve hirsutism. While insulin sensitizers improve important metabolic and endocrine aberrations in polycystic ovary syndrome, they are not recommended when hirsutism is the sole indication for use. Lifestyle modification counseling is recommended. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs and glucocorticoids are only recommended in specific circumstances. Additional therapies without sufficient supportive evidence of efficacy are ovarian surgery, statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), and vitamin D supplementation.

Limitations

In general, most therapies garner recommendations that are weak (where the estimates of benefits versus risks of therapy are either closely balanced or uncertain) and are based on low- to moderate-quality evidence.

Conclusions

Risks and benefits of treatment must be carefully considered and discussed with the patient. Expectations for efficacy should be appropriately set. A minimum of 6 months is required to see benefit from pharmacotherapy and lifelong treatment is often necessary for sustained benefit.

### Apadamtase alfa (Adzynma) [^116oyKLw]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

The safety of ADZYNMA for use during pregnancy has not been established in controlled clinical trials. Limited data with ADZYNMA use during pregnancy are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes.1In determining whether ADZYNMA should be used in pregnancy, healthcare providers should balance the potential benefits with the potential risks.

The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Data

Human Data

There have been four cTTP patients exposed to ADZYNMA during pregnancy.

Two patients in a long-term extension study were found to be pregnant early in the first trimester while receiving prophylaxis with ADZYNMA. Both patients were discontinued from the study to comply with the protocol requirements. The first patient had no further exposure to ADZYNMA and had a first trimester miscarriage approximately two months after study discontinuation. The investigator assessed the event was unrelated to ADZYNMA. The second patient resumed treatment with ADZYNMA under a compassionate use program and delivered a healthy full-term baby with no safety concerns reported by the investigator.

### Sodium chloride, sodium gluconate, sodium acetate, potassium chloride and magnesium chloride (multiple electrolytes pH 7.4) [^113MwLwV]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

There have been reports of positive test results using the Bio-Rad Laboratories Platelia Aspergillus EIA test in patients receiving gluconate containing Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP solutions. These patients were subsequently found to be free of Aspergillus infection. Therefore, positive test results for this test in patients receiving gluconate containing Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP solutions should be interpreted cautiously and confirmed by other diagnostic methods.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Studies with Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential, or effects on fertility.

Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP. It is also not known whether Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP is administered to a nursing mother.

Pediatric Use

The use of Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP in pediatric patients is based on clinical practice.

Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients are at increased risk of developing electrolyte imbalances. Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Consider monitoring renal function in elderly patients.

### Replacing salt with low-sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) for cardiovascular health in adults, children and pregnant women [^116FBRgV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Meta‐analysis in adult participants showed that LSSS probably reduce non‐fatal ACS slightly at up to 60 months. The 95% CIs of this effect included important and unimportant benefit (ranging from a rate ratio of 0.52 to 0.94), as we considered relative measures of less than 0.75 or greater than 1.25 to be important. The simplified population impact estimate we derived suggested that the observed relative risk when LSSS was compared to regular salt corresponds to an estimated 50 non‐fatal ACS events prevented (ranging from 10 to 80 prevented) per 100,000 persons per year.

In adult participants, meta‐analysis showed that LSSS probably reduce cardiovascular mortality slightly at up to 60 months. The 95% CIs of the pooled rate ratios included important benefit and no effect (ranging from a rate ratio of 0.60 to 1.00), as we considered relative measures of less than 0.75 or greater than 1.25 to be important. The simplified population impact estimate we derived suggested that the observed relative risk when LSSS was compared to regular salt corresponds to an estimated 53 cardiovascular deaths prevented (ranging from 92 prevented to none caused or prevented) per 100,000 persons per year. The observed relative effect between LSSS and regular salt was confirmed by sensitivity analysis excluding trials at high risk of overall bias.

We do not know whether there is a difference in the number of stroke deaths per group in adults as the 95% CI limits of the pooled effect were consistent with the possibility for important harm and important benefit. Furthermore, the generalisability of the results to the general population was limited as the pooled effect was driven by a large secondary prevention trial in which 73% of included participants had previously had a stroke.

In adult participants, meta‐analysis showed that LSSS probably increase blood potassium slightly at up to one and a half years. The 95% CIs of the pooled mean differences did not include clinically meaningful changes (ranging from 0.07 to 0.18 mmol/L higher), as we considered changes in blood potassium of greater than 1.0 mmol/L to be clinically meaningful. This is based on the variations around the 'normal' blood potassium levels of 3.6 to 5.0 mmol/L (Cohn 2000), which can cause moderate hyperkalaemia (defined as 6.0 to 6.9 mmol/L; Hollander‐Rodriguez 2006 and Ahee 2000, respectively).

### Copper and zinc concentrations in the breast milk of mothers undergoing treatment for Wilson's disease: a prospective study [^112BVMCQ]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

What is known about the subject

Patients with Wilson's disease (WD) are required to adhere to therapeutic regimens throughout their life, including during pregnancy and after delivery. However, clinical practice guidelines for WD indicate that breast feeding is not recommended in mothers with WD under drug therapy. Meanwhile, the safety of breast feeding by mothers undergoing treatment for WD has been evaluated by a limited number of studies.

What this study adds

This study revealed normal copper and zinc concentrations in breast milk from mothers undergoing treatment for WD. Moreover, no trientine-copper or penicillamine-copper was detected in breast milk from mothers with WD treated with trientine or penicillamine, respectively. The infants were born normally, breast fed by mothers undergoing treatment during lactation, and exhibited normal development. These results indicate that mothers undergoing treatment for WD can safely breast feed their infants.

### Improving management of patients with hyperemesis [^114QQQVD]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting in the first trimester of pregnancy are common. About 1% of women will have hyperemesis gravidarum, defined as severe nausea and vomiting, resulting in dehydration. The causes of HG are multifactorial. Other differential diagnoses such as urinary tract infection need to be excluded. The management of HG is supportive, including the correction of dehydration and electrolyte disturbances and use of antiemetics. Normal saline with potassium replacement is recommended by many authorities. Dextrose should not be used in order to avoid precipitating Wernicke's encephalopathy. Prevention of complications is also important, such as thiamine to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy and prophylaxis to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events. Usually HG is not associated with any adverse maternal pregnancy outcomes. There is some evidence that it may be associated with intrauterine growth restriction, but this may be limited to women who have poor gestational weight gain. HG needs to be managed effectively to reduce the risk of complications and to improve maternal psychological well being. It is an important condition as admitting a patient to hospital with HG incurs costs to the health service as well as the wider socioeconomic impact on the woman and her family.

### A case of osmotic demyelination syndrome occurred after the correction of severe hyponatraemia in hyperemesis gravidarum [^112hWuPc]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) is an uncommon disorder, characterized by non-inflammatory demyelination involving the pons and other areas of the central nervous system, which may occur for instance as a consequence of an overly rapid correction of hyponatraemia. Here we report a case of ODS occurred after correction of hyponatraemia with isotonic saline solution in a pregnant woman with hyperemesis gravidarum and concomitant other electrolyte disorders, which are additional risk factors for the development of this syndrome. Some criticisms in the management of the patient, which undoubtedly eased the occurrence of ODS, will be highlighted.

### Environmental exposures and risks during pregnancy [^115Xk3m9]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The Women in Wilderness Medicine Research Committee of the Wilderness Medical Society conducted a narrative review to address considerations for pregnant individuals in wilderness environments. There is limited evidence behind many opinion-based recommendations on the safety of various environmental exposures in pregnancy. The authors reviewed the literature for the best available evidence, including observational studies, case series, limited controlled trials, and extrapolation from physiological data, as well as evaluating expert consensus statements. The benefits of exposure to natural environments include better pregnancy outcomes and improved maternal mental and physical health. Risks are similar to nonpregnant individuals with the added risks associated with maternal-fetal physiology in wilderness environments and difficulties of evacuation. This narrative review discusses pregnancy-specific concerns in extreme environments, including high altitude, hypothermia, hyperthermia, lightning strikes, envenomations, and common outdoor exposures.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^113uR3mM]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 2.5 -Schedules during pregnancy

We recommend counselling women of reproductive age who are receiving or anticipating dialysis, so that they are aware of the interactions between renal replacement therapies and pregnancy which may impact on family planning and modality decisions. [1D]

For dialysis patients wishing to continue their pregnancy, we recommend changing as early as possible to an individualised, augmented haemodialysis schedule. For those with minimal residual function this should be at least 20 hours per week, delivered over at least 6 sessions. [1B]

We recommend an individualised dialysate prescription appropriate to the dialysis schedule and biochemistry results, anticipating the frequent need for a high potassium / low bicarbonate dialysate, supplemented with phosphate. [1C]

We suggest an individualised fluid management protocol, with low ultrafiltration rates and regular clinical assessment, anticipating the typical change in weight during pregnancy. [2C]

Rationale

Successful pregnancies in women on haemodialysis are becoming more common: prior to 1995 data from the United States suggested only 40% infant survival, but outcomes in the current era are substantially better. However, pregnancy complications in haemodialysis patients are still more common than in pre-dialysis and transplant patients, and may result in HLA sensitisation, so delaying until after transplantation may be favourable for some. Conception may be more likely with augmented dialysis schedules, but the possibility of pregnancy or need for contraception should be considered regardless of dialysis schedule.

The literature linking haemodialysis prescription to outcome in pregnant dialysis patients is limited to case series and systematic reviews. In a recent meta-analysis of 681 pregnancies in 647 patients between 2000 and 2014, authors found that longer weekly dialysis duration significantly associated with a lower incidence of preterm delivery and babies small for their gestational age. More frequent dialysis was also associated with fewer small babies. Normalisation of biochemistry and fluid status appears to give the best outcome, and virtually every publication advocates intensified dialysis.

### A case of osmotic demyelination syndrome occurred after the correction of severe hyponatraemia in hyperemesis gravidarum [^113TksPZ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We reported here a case of ODS occurred in a pregnant woman with hyperemesis gravidarum after an overly rapid correction of low serum [Na +] in the presence of several concomitant risk factors. The overly rapid increase of serum sodium may has been likely caused by the simultaneous correction of severe hypokalemia and it might have been prevented by a more cautious and thoughtful management of the patient. This case may very well be considered as an appropriate example to reinforce warning among physicians about the care that should be taken in a clinical setting, in order to prevent rapid changes in serum osmolarity, which may lead to dramatic and sometimes irreversible consequences.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy — management recommendations: In mothers with long QT syndrome, a beta blocker should be continued during pregnancy and throughout the postpartum period including in women who are breastfeeding (I, B-NR). In the pregnant patient with sustained ventricular arrhythmia (VA), electrical cardioversion is safe and effective and should be used with standard electrode configuration (I, C-EO). In pregnant patients needing an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation, it is reasonable to undergo these procedures during pregnancy, preferably after the first trimester (IIa, B-NR).

Synopsis — For hemodynamically significant ventricular tachycardia (VT), direct current cardioversion has been shown to be safe during pregnancy. When pharmacological therapy is deemed necessary, the choice of antiarrhythmic agent depends on the etiology of the specific ventricular arrhythmia and underlying cardiovascular substrate. It is ideal if patients considering pregnancy undergo ablation therapy or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) placement before conception; however, the procedure can be performed safely during pregnancy when needed.

Patients experience many new and concerning symptoms during pregnancy and it is the role of the obstetric clinician to provide appropriate guidance, recommendations, and treatment options. Often times, these symptoms are related to hormonal and physiologic changes that occur and will resolve in the postpartum period. However, clinicians must be able to recognize more concerning pathologic symptoms that require further evaluation and treatment. This review provides updates on the evaluation and management of some of the common symptoms during pregnancy.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^111bkyee]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — hirsutism markers and management: Hirsutism, considering ethnic differences, is a good marker for hyperandrogenism (level B), whereas isolated acne and alopecia are not good markers and hirsutism should be evaluated biochemically (level B). Prolonged (> 6 months) medical therapy for hirsutism is necessary to document effectiveness (level B). Antiandrogens should not be used without effective contraception (level B); flutamide is of limited value because of its dose-dependent hepatotoxicity (level B), and drospirenone in the dosage used in some oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) is not antiandrogenic (level B). Often OCPs are prescribed in combination with an antiandrogen to block androgen action at the hair follicles, but the addition of an antiandrogen to OCPs has not appeared to increase the overall treatment benefit, although spironolactone, flutamide, and finasteride have been shown to reduce hirsutism. Insulin-sensitizing agents such as metformin and pioglitazone have little effect on hirsutism or acne. For dermatologic care, isotretinoin is not effective for hirsutism and occasionally may lead to alopecia; topical eflornithine hydrochloride can decrease development of new unwanted facial hair, and physical approaches such as electrolysis and laser may be acceptable. Many drugs used for hirsutism are not FDA approved for this indication (GPP), and no effective treatment for alopecia is known (level B).

### Replacing salt with low-sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) for cardiovascular health in adults, children and pregnant women [^111g2tWj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Adverse events (other)

GRADE assessment suggests that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of LSSS on other adverse events when compared to regular salt in adults (very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for inconsistency and once for imprecision).

The number of participants with other adverse events in the eight trials reporting this outcome ranged from zero to 17 with LSSS and from zero to seven with regular salt. The events reported were highly diverse and not suitable for pooling in a meta‐analysis (2109 participants, 8 RCTs, very low‐certainty evidence, Analysis 1.50). Four trials reporting on other adverse events reported these at ≤ 3 months, three reported on this outcome at > 3 to 12 months and one trial reported other adverse events at > 12 months.

Subgroup analyses were undertaken for this outcome to explore whether there were differences in effects in subgroups based on hyperkalaemia risk. In line with Cochrane guidance (Deeks 2020) detailing the limitations of subgroup analyses, caution was taken in the interpretation of findings from these subgroup analyses. Subgrouping participants by risk of hyperkalaemia as per Table 6 suggests there may be no important clinical differences in average effects between participants not at risk, and those at possible risk, of hyperkalaemia (Analysis 1.51).

One trial reported this outcome in an unusable format (i.e. numbers of events per group not reported), and usable data were not provided when requested from authors (Table 7).

### Fetal umbilical vein thrombosis associated with fetal bartter syndrome: an unusual case report and literature review [^117NAvFh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

In our case, the pregnant woman experienced polyhydramnios during her first pregnancy, which resulted in fetal demise despite normal examination findings. In her current pregnancy, polyhydramnios recurred. After birth, the newborn was admitted for persistent hypokalemia, and genetic testing confirmed Bartter syndrome type 4b. Similar cases have been documented in the literature. Dane B et al. reported a case of prenatal Bartter syndrome diagnosis in a woman with a history of polyhydramnios. Her previous pregnancies showed polyhydramnios, the baby was born at 28 weeks of gestation and died of unknown reason. During a subsequent pregnancy, the woman again developed polyhydramnios, with elevated chloride levels in the amniotic fluid and decreased maternal serum potassium levels. Potassium chloride was administered to maintain normal potassium levels. The fetus was delivered at 32 weeks of gestation and symptoms of polyuria emerged at 4 weeks post-birth, and was subsequently diagnosed with antenatal Bartter syndrome. Another case reported by Gómez de la F CL et al. described a pregnant woman who underwent a cesarean section at 35 weeks of gestation due to severe polyhydramnios. After birth, the newborn exhibited polyuria and required medical intervention to restore electrolyte balance. Despite the absence of genetic testing, the diagnosis was made based on the history of severe polyhydramnios during pregnancy and postpartum findings of polyuria, electrolyte imbalances, severe hypokalemia, and alkalosis. The newborn also developed persistent metabolic disturbances and renal calcinosis. In this case, deep sensorineural hearing loss will point to type IV BS. These cases underscore the potential association between polyhydramnios and Bartter syndrome, highlighting the importance of vigilant maternal and fetal monitoring and the consideration of genetic factors in similar situations.

Direct hair removal methods — For women who choose hair removal therapy, we suggest photoepilation for auburn, brown, or black hair and suggest electrolysis for white or blonde hair; for women of color choosing photoepilation, we suggest a long-wavelength, long pulse-duration Nd:YAG or diode laser with skin cooling, clinicians should warn Mediterranean and Middle Eastern women with facial hirsutism about paradoxical hypertrichosis and we suggest topical treatment or electrolysis over photoepilation; for faster response to photoepilation, we suggest adding eflornithine topical cream; and for women with known hyperandrogenemia who choose hair removal therapy, we suggest pharmacologic therapy to minimize hair regrowth.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^116oShSA]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The best evidence for this approach to date is the comparison of data from the Toronto and US registries of pregnancy in dialysis patients. In women established on dialysis before becoming pregnant, 11 of 13 pregnancies were successful with at least 36 hours per week, compared to 22 of 46 with up to 20 hours (p = 0.02). More intensive dialysis was also associated with reduced preterm delivery and greater birth weight.

Residual kidney function facilitates normalisation of fluid and electrolytes, so the accelerated loss of residual function seen with augmented schedules raises concerns about this approach in women with good urine output. In the Toronto/US registry study all of the 17 women who started dialysis partway through the pregnancy had a successful outcome. Since 13 of them were in the shorter treatment group, it appears that longer treatment times would have been unnecessarily burdensome, and possibly detrimental, to patients with significant residual function. In a comprehensive review Hladunewich suggested titrating the dialysis dose to achieve urea 10–15mmol/L after the longest break between sessions. The authors also provide advice on adjusting medication, anaemia management and fetal monitoring which are outside the scope of this guideline.

With augmented schedules dialysate should be individualised, with high potassium / low buffer often required. To ensure the needs of foetal skeletal development are met, low serum calcium and phosphate should be avoided, which may involve adjustment of diet, medication and dialysate: supplementation of the dialysate with phosphate is often necessary. Magnesium should possibly be monitored in the third trimester, since low levels may induce uterine contraction.

Augmented schedules allow patients with minimal residual kidney function to remain close to their target weight and avoid high ultrafiltration rates. Fluid status needs to be assessed frequently during pregnancy, as there is a high risk of fluid depletion, especially in the second and third trimester, and bioimpedance and urine volume may be useful measurements in this setting. Typical weight gains during a healthy pregnancy range from around 150g/week during the first trimester, to around 450g/week during the third trimester.

Membrane flux and haemodiafiltration

We recommend that patients with minimal residual function should be treated with high-flux dialysers. [1B]

We suggest that haemodiafiltration may be considered as a treatment for intra-dialytic hypotension refractory to other measures, and for dialysis patients with favourable prognosis who are unable or unlikely to be transplanted. [2B]

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^114syEP6]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Arrhythmia management during pregnancy — drug therapy principles state that the approach to evaluation is similar to that in nonpregnant patients, with a primary goal to optimize treatment for the mother without compromising fetal safety, and that factors unique to pregnancy include physiological changes and medication effects on placental blood flow, breastfeeding, and the developing fetus. Very few drugs are contraindicated in pregnancy, many are compatible with breastfeeding, and periodic reevaluation for continued need, including monitoring of levels and evaluation of the mother and infant for potential side effects, is best practice. If drug therapy is initiated, it is important to use the minimal number of drugs at the lowest effective dose, limit choices to those with a history of "reasonable safety profile" during pregnancy, and note that a majority of antiarrhythmic medications fall into the former FDA risk category C for pregnancy; drugs with limited experience during pregnancy may be administered after weighing risk versus benefit. When administering drugs with proarrhythmic potential, FDA-mandated precautions are generally observed as in nonpregnant patients, including dose adjustments for physiological changes such as renal function, and the FDA has replaced the alphabetic risk categories with the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule.

### Migraine and risk of stroke [^113UFLmS]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Migraine and pregnancy

The physiological changes during pregnancy, such as venous stasis, oedema and hypercoagulability, combine to make pregnancy and postpartum period a time of increased risk of stroke. While most women experience improvement of migraine during pregnancy, migraine attacks may worsen or develop de novo in a small percentage. Women with menstrual migraine are more likely to experience improvement since the triggering factor (oestrogen fluctuation) is absent during pregnancy. The worsening usually occurs in the first trimester, and involves women suffering from MA rather than MO. Also de novo migraines during pregnancy mostly consist of MA. Women suffering from migraine are at increased risk for several complications during pregnancy including preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, pulmonary embolism, venous thromboembolism and cerebrovascular event such as ischaemic stroke and cerebral haemorrhage. Pregnant women with migraine are more likely to have vascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes and smoking. The risk is particularly evident in those women not showing remission or amelioration of migraine attacks.

Clinical implication

Active migraine during pregnancy should be viewed as a potential risk marker for adverse vascular outcomes, especially ischaemic stroke. Women with migraine, particularly those with known stroke risk factors, may benefit from high-risk obstetric monitoring.

Migraine and hormone replacement therapy

There are insufficient data to support a further increased risk of ischaemic stroke in women with any type of migraine who are using hormone replacement therapy.

Clinical implication

After menopause, MA in itself is not a contraindication for the use of hormone-replacement therapy, but stroke risk related to the therapy itself should be considered.
