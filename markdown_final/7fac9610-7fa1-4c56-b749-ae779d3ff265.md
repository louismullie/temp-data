## Question

behaviour management in dental pedantic clinic, treating a child with who lost a brother

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing a bereaved child's behavior in a pediatric dental clinic after the loss of a sibling. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the child's developmental stage and grief manifestations. Then, I should verify how trauma-informed, family-centered principles apply in dentistry. Next, I will review evidence-based behavioral strategies, including non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic options, and check their acceptability and safety. After that, I need to ensure pain assessment and management are age-appropriate and aligned with guidelines. Finally, I will consider team-based supports, follow-up planning, and documentation, while continuously checking for red flags and adjusting the plan as needed.

> Let me first confirm the child's developmental context and typical grief reactions, because a 4-year-old's understanding of death differs markedly from a 10-year-old's, and this shapes both anticipatory guidance and coping strategies. Preschoolers often exhibit magical thinking, regression, and somatic complaints, whereas school-aged children may show guilt, anger, or withdrawal; adolescents may suppress emotions or engage in risk behaviors, so I need to tailor communication and supports accordingly [^115pSWZu] [^114DHc6a]. Hold on, I should verify that sibling grief can manifest as anxiety, irritability, sleep disturbance, and concentration problems, which can directly impair dental cooperation and increase avoidance behaviors, reinforcing the need for a trauma-informed approach in the dental setting [^116hEov2] [^114DHc6a].

> Next, I should review trauma-informed principles and family-centered care, and I need to ensure I'm not conflating medical trauma with bereavement trauma even though the coping framework overlaps. Trauma-informed care emphasizes safety, trustworthiness, collaboration, choice, and cultural humility; in dentistry, that translates to predictable routines, clear explanations, parental presence, and offering choices when feasible, while screening for grief-related triggers and secondary stressors that may impair cooperation [^112Luv9Q] [^116hEov2]. Wait, let me verify that bereaved families often fear their child being forgotten; acknowledging the deceased sibling by name, if the family wishes, can build trust and align with family-centered values without overstepping boundaries [^115xTHQ5] [^113YE6Xh].

> I will now examine non-pharmacologic behavioral strategies, starting with tell-show-do, positive reinforcement, and graduated exposure, because these are foundational in pediatric dentistry and can be adapted to grief-related anxiety. But wait, what if standard tell-show-do is insufficient in a child with acute stress from loss? Puppet play therapy has emerging evidence for reducing anxiety and improving behavior in young children during local anesthesia, leveraging symbolic play consistent with preoperational development; I should consider it especially when first dental exposure coincides with grief-related distress [^112Lz2u4] [^117Fb9c5] [^116Lj5Pt]. I should double-check that modeling, distraction, and relaxation techniques remain appropriate adjuncts, and that parental presence is generally helpful when parents can support nonprocedural talk and coping, consistent with pediatric procedural support guidance [^112ChUNY] [^116Lj5Pt].

> Hold on, I should verify pharmacologic options and their evidentiary footing, because I don't want to overstate benefits. Moderate-certainty evidence supports oral midazolam (0.25–1 mg/kg) to improve cooperation compared with placebo, though heterogeneity is high and sedation should be reserved for cases where non-pharmacologic strategies are insufficient or the child's distress risks safety or treatment failure; nitrous oxide is commonly used and may be layered with benzodiazepines in select cases, but I need to ensure informed consent and airway safety planning [^117UoWgu] [^111gQLpe]. I should confirm that codeine and tramadol are contraindicated under age 12 and that topical benzocaine is avoided in infants due to methemoglobinemia risk, aligning with FDA cautions reflected in dental pain guidelines [^114Mu7rK] [^1168JVHZ].

> Next, I should review pain assessment and management, and I need to ensure I'm using age-appropriate scales consistently. For children ≥ 3 years, Faces scales are appropriate. For ≥ 8 years, numerical or visual analog scales can be used. For 1–3 years, behavioral scales are preferred. I should document baseline pain, set expectations with caregivers, and reassess after interventions, using weight-based dosing for analgesics and avoiding long-acting local anesthetics like bupivacaine in children due to self-injury risk [^111JnbwW] [^114Mu7rK] [^1168JVHZ]. Wait, let me verify that caregivers are counseled to call if pain fails to improve or definitive treatment cannot be arranged promptly, as recommended by ADA guidance for temporary pain management [^114Mu7rK].

> I need to ensure team-based supports are in place, and I should confirm whether child life services are accessible in outpatient dental settings. Child life specialists use therapeutic play, preparation, and coping rehearsal to reduce distress; if unavailable, I can adopt similar principles by providing a transitional object, rehearsing the visit, and using developmentally appropriate explanations, while coordinating with the child's pediatrician and, when indicated, a pediatric grief counselor for longitudinal support [^111VTiVA] [^115SCgSx] [^116hEov2]. Hold on, I should verify that interdisciplinary bereavement committees and community resources exist in some systems; referral pathways can be activated for families needing structured grief support beyond the dental encounter [^114BA5nK] [^113YE6Xh].

> Let me consider anticipatory guidance for families, and I should double-check that I'm not overpromising outcomes. Families benefit from knowing that grief can impair cooperation, that routines and predictability help, and that anniversary reactions or grief triggers may emerge; preparing for these in advance and offering concrete coping strategies can mitigate distress and improve dental engagement over time [^114DHc6a] [^111FULj5]. I should confirm that families are offered resources for sibling grief and that we screen for signs of complicated grief or mental health comorbidity that warrant referral, aligning with pediatric bereavement guidance [^116hEov2] [^114DHc6a].

> I will now examine follow-up planning and documentation, and I need to ensure the record captures both dental and psychosocial needs. The chart should note the sibling loss, timing, observed grief-related behaviors, strategies used, parental preferences for behavior management, and any referrals made; scheduling shorter, acclimation visits can build trust before definitive care, consistent with preventive behavioral principles in pediatric dentistry [^116Lj5Pt]. Wait, let me verify that we also document medication choices and rationales, especially when using sedation, to support continuity and safety across visits [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the child's behavior escalates despite these measures? I should confirm red flags for complicated grief or acute stress reactions, such as persistent avoidance, intrusive memories, extreme regression, or somatic symptoms, and escalate to mental health professionals promptly; similarly, if protective stabilization is contemplated, I must engage in shared decision-making, document necessity, and prioritize the least restrictive effective approach given ethical concerns and parental acceptance variability [^114DHc6a] [^115zyPgz]. Hold on, I should verify that any restraint is preceded by preparation and parental involvement when possible to reduce trauma and maintain trust [^115zyPgz].

> In summary, I need to integrate developmental grief understanding with trauma-informed, family-centered dental care, deploy evidence-based behavioral strategies with attention to grief triggers, use pharmacologic aids judiciously with informed consent, assess and treat pain using age-appropriate tools, leverage team supports, provide anticipatory guidance, and document comprehensively, while continuously reassessing and adjusting the plan based on the child's evolving needs and family preferences [^114DHc6a] [^116Lj5Pt] [^117UoWgu] [^111JnbwW].

---

For a child who has lost a sibling, dental care should be **trauma-informed and grief-sensitive** [^112Luv9Q] [^114DHc6a], with clear pre-visit communication to anticipate grief-related anxiety or avoidance. Use **tell-show-do, distraction, and positive reinforcement** [^116Lj5Pt]; consider a familiar caregiver's presence and allow a comfort item [^112ChUNY]. Schedule shorter visits, avoid triggers, and use simple, honest language about feelings and procedures. If cooperation is limited, consider nitrous oxide or conscious sedation [^117UoWgu]; reserve general anesthesia for extensive needs after discussing risks and benefits with caregivers. Coordinate with the child's pediatrician and grief counselor, document the loss and emotional status, and provide family resources to support coping and oral health maintenance [^116hEov2] [^113YE6Xh].

---

## Pre-visit preparation and communication

- **Parental communication**: Contact caregivers before the visit to understand the child's emotional state, triggers, and preferences. Ask about recent grief reactions, sleep, appetite, and behavioral changes [^notfound].

- **Scheduling considerations**: Book shorter appointments at calm times (early morning or after school) to reduce fatigue and stress.

- **Familiarization**: If possible, arrange a pre-visit tour so the child can meet staff, see the clinic, and become comfortable with the environment [^117Ufamn].

- **Comfort items**: Encourage bringing a favorite toy, blanket, or other comfort object to the appointment [^112ChUNY].

---

## Behavioral management strategies during dental visits

### Non-pharmacological techniques

- **Tell-show-do**: Explain procedures simply, show instruments, and perform steps gradually to build trust and reduce fear [^111HygCH].

- **Positive reinforcement**: Praise cooperation and effort frequently; use small rewards (stickers, tokens) to reinforce positive behavior [^116Lj5Pt].

- **Distraction techniques**: Use age-appropriate distractions such as music, videos, or storytelling to shift focus from anxiety-provoking stimuli [^116Lj5Pt].

- **Parental presence**: Allow a familiar caregiver to stay with the child during treatment to provide reassurance and support [^112ChUNY].

- **Modeling**: Show the child a video or have them observe another child successfully completing a dental procedure to build confidence [^116Lj5Pt].

---

### Pharmacological techniques

Pharmacological options include **nitrous oxide sedation**, useful for mild to moderate anxiety and to improve cooperation, with rapid onset and recovery [^111gQLpe]. Conscious sedation with oral midazolam may be considered for moderate anxiety or uncooperative behavior, with careful monitoring and adherence to safety protocols [^117UoWgu]. General anesthesia is reserved for extensive dental needs or when other techniques fail, after discussing risks, benefits, and alternatives with caregivers.

---

## Emotional support and grief-sensitive approaches

- **Acknowledge feelings**: Use simple, honest language to acknowledge the child's loss and feelings. For example, "I know you're sad about your brother. It's okay to feel that way" [^notfound].

- **Normalize emotions**: Explain that sadness, anger, or anxiety are normal grief reactions and that it's okay to express them [^111FULj5].

- **Avoid triggers**: Be mindful of language or situations that may remind the child of their sibling. If triggers arise, address them gently and provide reassurance [^114DHc6a].

- **Provide choices**: Offer age-appropriate choices to give the child a sense of control and autonomy during the visit [^115PZhMD].

---

## Collaboration with healthcare professionals

Collaboration with the child's **pediatrician** helps coordinate care, understand medical or psychological concerns, and align strategies [^114DHc6a]. Involvement of a **grief counselor** provides additional support and guidance on managing grief-related emotions and behaviors. For complex cases, a **multidisciplinary approach** coordinates care with pediatric dentists, psychologists, and social workers [^notfound].

---

## Documentation and follow-up care

Maintain detailed records of the child's **emotional status**, behavioral responses, and strategies used during visits. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor emotional and behavioral changes and adjust the care plan as needed. Provide families with resources on grief support, counseling services, and oral health maintenance during difficult times [^113YE6Xh].

Flowchart of enrolment, allocation, and analysis

The data collected from each child and methodology tools comprise the following:

General child information including age and gender.
Assessment of the child's dental anxiety was measured by three scales: [1] Heart rate, recorded after the behavior management technique was performed. The dental assistant recorded the three highest pulse scores during three periods related to the LA: before, during, and after LA administration. [2] Facial Image Scale (FIS)was measured after the treatment was completed. FIS comprises a row of five faces ranging from very happy (score = 1) to very unhappy (score = 5) selected by the child. [3] Anxiety Rating scale, ranging from 0 (the least anxious score) to 5 (the most anxious).
Assessment of child's behavior in the dental setting was reported by two scales: [1] Frankl behavior rating scale consisting of four groups: Definitely positive, Positive, Negative, and Definitely negative. [2] Venham behavior Scale ranging from 0 (extremely cooperative) to 5 (extremely uncooperative).
Assessment of pain by utilizing Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) pain assessment tool. Each item is scored from 0 to 2, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 (relaxed and comfortable), 1 to 3 (mild discomfort), 4 to 6 (moderate pain), up to 7 to 10 (severe discomfort).

### Timeline of amelogenesis imperfecta management [^11257iNg]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Dental care for amelogenesis imperfecta patients requires a comprehensive and individualized, personalized approach, with multidisciplinary collaboration being essential for optimal outcomes. Early diagnosis, regular monitoring, follow-up, frequent appointments, and the use of appropriate orthodontic appliances are critical for achieving success. Timely referral to specialized care providers and collaboration among oral biologists, pediatric dentists, orthodontists, prosthodontists, periodontists, speech therapists, caregivers, and other professionals ensure the best possible outcomes for these patients. These efforts also significantly enhance the quality of life for individuals with amelogenesis imperfecta, addressing their functional, esthetical, and psychological needs. Due to the rarity of amelogenesis imperfecta and differences in diagnostic criteria, obtaining precise prevalence figures for each European country is challenging. Further epidemiological studies are necessary to determine more accurate country-specific data. Setting up an ERN registry for amelogenesis imperfecta at the European level will allow addressing the following issues: prevalence of amelogenesis imperfecta as a whole and/or as individual separate rare diseases on the basis of their genetic etiology and isolated or syndromic nature, treatment needs and costs as well as comparison of strategic management principles, policies, and practices, including financial burden in the different participating countries. These data will be indispensable to deliver informed guidelines and ensure equity of management within European countries.

### Supporting the family after the death of a child [^115i7HTq]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The death of a child can have a devastating effect on the family. The pediatrician has an important role to play in supporting the parents and any siblings still in his or her practice after such a death. Pediatricians may be poorly prepared to provide this support. Also, because of the pain of confronting the grief of family members, they may be reluctant to become involved. This statement gives guidelines to help the pediatrician provide such support. It describes the grief reactions that can be expected in family members after the death of a child. Ways of supporting family members are suggested, and other helpful resources in the community are described. The goal of this guidance is to prevent outcomes that may impair the health and development of affected parents and children.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Appendix — certainty of the evidence assessment — this guideline used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, defined as the "extent of our confidence that the estimates of an effect are adequate to support a particular decision or recommendation". Randomized controlled trials begin at high certainty and can decrease to moderate, low, or very low; certainty can be lowered by indirectness, risk of bias, publication bias, inconsistency, or imprecision. Methodologists guided the panel through the GRADE Evidence to Decision framework, considering desirable and undesirable effects, certainty of the evidence, net balance, patient's values and preferences, acceptability, feasibility, resources required, and equity.

### Management of the impaired adult cleft patient: the last chance [^116sePUm]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Unfortunately, not all patients receive the benefits of a well-trained, experienced, multidisciplinary cleft team, and a significant number of patients reach adulthood with severe neglected cleft related problems. The vast majority of this group have made their way through several surgical procedures, usually performed by different surgeons in different centers, and still carry the original cleft stigmata aggravated by variable degrees of maxillary hypoplasia, fistulae, scarring, muscle pull, soft tissue tension, lost teeth, dental adaptation, and instability of bony fragments. Adult patients who reach this stage with their original deformities have, in most instances, lost their best opportunity to be properly treated. With this assumption in mind, an aggressive surgical plan focused mainly on the deformities that can objectively achieve functional and aesthetical improvement should be individualized for each patient. In this article, experience with 38 consecutive adult patients with cleft managed following a two-stage protocol used at our cleft clinic for the last 4 years is presented.

Conclusion

An algorithm to help definitively solve these deformities is suggested.

Box 4.
What patients need with ongoing management of their condition

Encouragement to live life to the full. There are times along the journey when life can have a feeling of normality, and it is important to enjoy all those moments while you can.
To feel 'in control' as much as possible along their journey, despite outcomes sometimes being unknown. Feeling 'in control' reduces anxiety. Reducing anxiety also reduces the risk of depression. Many papers cite the psychosocial aspects of living with an inherited rare disease whether you are the patient or a parent, for example 'parental guilt' of passing on a gene. Patients may need psychological support.
To feel treated as an equal in the patient/clinician relationship, building an open and trusting partnership, with an understanding that you are on a long-term journey together. Patients need empowering to become advocates for their own care and the care of others.
A comprehensive assessment of the patient's 'life goals' and support to achieve them. For instance, if a young adult is starting work or college and is close to needing dialysis, decide together on the timing and method of dialysis to balance these goals with establishing treatment, or consider postponing the goals if necessary.
Support in school and working environment for children and young adults to help cope with hearing loss and wearing hearing aids as well as frequent absences for medical appointments.
Smooth transition to adult services as young adults leave school, moving onto work, college, university, moving away from the family home, and potentially starting relationships while managing declining hearing and declining kidney function. Young adult patients may also need family planning and/or contraceptive advice, and additional clinical support for women during pregnancy.
Regular assessment as to whether patients or family members need psychosocial support. On a patient journey, there can be critical crunch points, as the hearing starts to decline or kidney function declines: Patients and patient families reaching dialysis and transplant need support adjusting to a different way of life. Young, transplanted patients may require additional psychosocial post-transplant. Research indicates that up to 30% of transplanted patients lose their lives to poor mental health. Extra support for siblings. These declining stages can make them feel 'very out of control' and cause mental health issues.
Financial support. There is a huge cost attending many medical appointments in terms of travel expenses and time away from work or school and medication costs. Research evidence shows that people living with rare kidney disease often face socio-economic challenges, with many unable to continue work.

### Are we together in this? Relationship experiences of parents of children with craniofacial anomalies [^1129Khne]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Some participants seemed to be somewhat compatible to their partners in their ways of approaching challenges in life, such as the need to openly share their feelings with each other: "I've always been open, and my husband is also very sensitive and open, so that felt very natural for us". Other participants felt different from their partners in this respect, yet still managed to be emotionally supportive towards one another, possibly because the participants perceived their differences as a resource:

My husband didn't worry about the things I worried about, which was nice (.) Sometimes it felt frustrating, but I also appreciated those differences. I tend to get preoccupied and worried, and in a way, he didn't allow me to, and that's been really nice. (.) I think he has such clear thoughts. I am more driven by my emotions.

The participants thus felt that they could lean on their partners for comfort and support, working as a team.

Most participants described their relationships as being on solid ground when their affected child was born. They knew their partners well, which felt reassuring when facing the crisis. Some participants explained that they had previously overcome difficult times with their partners, such as losing loved ones, which helped them believe that they could also manage this ordeal together.

Most of these participants had close family members to support them in caring for their affected child. The experience of support from close family provided the participants with a sense of belonging and protection, an opportunity to take a break from the intensity of everyday life and a chance to spend quality time with their partners. The participants spoke of these breaks as a priority in taking care of their relationships.

### Pain management after third molar extractions in adolescents: a qualitative study [^115zGcoa]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Thirty-eight households were mailed a notification letter, of which one had an inaccurate mailing address. Thirty-seven households entered phone follow-up. Of these, ten were unreachable and four guardians declined participating, five were ineligible (e.g. patient turned 18 years old, parent was dental care provider at HealthPartners). Eighteen guardians consented, but in three instances, the patient was unavailable or unreachable within the maximum number of call attempts or within 30-days post extraction. Fifteen dyads completed an interview.

The patient demographics are summarized in Table 1. The patient sample was 53% female; 53% were receiving Medicaid/subsidized state health insurance; about half were 16-years of age with one 15-year-old and the rest 17-years of age; 53% were White, with one identifying as Asian, and 40% identifying as more than one race, and two identifying as Hispanic/Latino. Ethnic/racial demographics were not collected for caregivers.

Table 1
Patient demographics (n = 15)

Key themes associated with pain management included sources of information, pain management behaviors engaged in by the adolescents and their caregivers, and the use of medication.

### Management strategies of dental anxiety and uncooperative behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorder [^115hpCD1]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

In this systematic review, although the dental anxiety and uncooperative behavior in autistic children might influence the decision and treatment methods of pediatric dentist to complete a full dental care and oral health, there was significant difference in the measures of sensory discomfort and pain intensity between the SADE and RDE groups. Therefore, it is necessary for the pediatric dentist to take appropriate management strategies to intervene in dental examination and treatment for children with ASD unless encountered great resistance from parents and children during the dental visit.

There are some limitations in the current review. First, the six studies included in this systematic review were restricted to English language searching, which would cause some important information to be lacking in other language. Second, these six studies lacked flexible data to implement a meta-analysis to support this research. Third, interventions and measurement scales in each study were inconsistent. Finally, the sample size was relatively small. Therefore, wider regional researches from more countries and randomized controlled trials verifying the relationship between dental anxiety and abnormal behavior in ASD children were required to confirm our results.

### Practice parameter for the psychiatric assessment and management of physically ill children and adolescents [^1119ZBre]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Principle 4 — General medical conditions and/or their treatments should be considered in the etiology of a child's psychological and behavioral symptoms, and mental health clinicians should be aware that emotional and behavioral symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, aggression) may be direct manifestations of a physical illness and/or its treatment. It is not uncommon for psychiatric symptoms to be attributed to the "stress" associated with a chronic physical illness, particularly when there are other notable psychosocial issues, and generally, each child has both indirect and direct physical illness effects, with the clinician facing the challenge of determining the relative importance of each to the child's current symptomatology.

### Perspectives from before and after the pediatric to adult care transition: a mixed-methods study in type 1 diabetes [^114m8aXr]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Measurement Methods

A mixed-methods approach was used to assess participants' experiences either before or after the transfer from pediatric to adult diabetes care. Participants in both groups completed quantitative questionnaires and provided qualitative responses to open-ended questions. All participants provided demographic and clinical information, including age, ethnic/racial background, diabetes duration, and method of insulin administration (i.e. continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or multiple daily injections). A1C values, an indicator of overall glycemic control, were collected as part of routine clinical care during the clinic visit and were documented by study staff for the Transitions Expectations group. For the Posttransition group, A1C was assessed via A1CNow from Metrika for 50 participants. The remainder self-reported values from their most recent clinic visit. The institutional review boards at all participating institutions approved study procedures.

Transitions Expectations Measures

Adolescent participants in the Transitions Expectations group completed the Self-Efficacy for Diabetes Self-Management measure. Respondents rated their degree of certainty in their ability to correctly execute 10 diabetes management tasks (e.g. adjust insulin when eating more/less than usual) on a 10-point Likert scale ranging from "not sure at all" to "completely sure". The Self-Efficacy for Diabetes Self-Management measure has demonstrated good psychometric properties and associations with diabetes management and control. Parent-reported transition preparation behaviors were assessed via the following questions: 1) how often do you go with your child to the regular diabetes clinic appointments? (5-point Likert scale from "never" to "all the time"), 2) have you talked with your child about what will happen when he/she leaves the pediatric diabetes clinic? (yes/no), and 3) have you talked with your child's doctor about what will happen when he/she leaves the pediatric diabetes clinic? (yes/no).

Adolescents and parents participated in semistructured interviews with their pediatric diabetes educator. Open-ended questions prompted discussion about expectations for the transition to adult diabetes care, including anticipated timing, type of care to be received (e.g. preferred characteristics of the adult care provider and how the visits would transpire), and potential shifts in youths' and parents' roles in diabetes management.

### Screening for behavioral risk factors is not enough to improve preventive services delivery [^111zXzoJ]. Academic Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Unhealthy behaviors are a major cause of chronic disease. Preappointment screening has been suggested as one way to improve preventive care delivery related to these behaviors by specifying risks to be addressed. We aimed to determine whether screening for health-related behaviors before the clinical encounter will lead to higher counseling rate and service delivery by clinicians.

Methods

We used a pre/post design in one practice with a control practice to evaluate the effects of preappointment screening for 3 behavioral risk factors (tobacco smoke exposure, no recent dental care visit, and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages). After their clinic visit, we asked English-speaking parents whose child had one or more risk factor whether they had received counseling or services from their pediatrician to address them.

Results

We recruited 264 parents in the pre phase and 242 in the post phase. Among 215 parents whose child had one or more risk factors, parents in the post phase were as likely to report receiving counseling than parents in the pre phase for each of the risk factors: smoking odds ratio 6.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.51, 88.88), dental health odds ratio 1.44 (95% confidence interval, 0.47, 4.41), and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption odds ratio 0.34 (95% confidence interval, 0.23, 5.18). Service delivery and reported behavior change were also similar in both phases.

Conclusions

Counseling rates for tobacco, dental health, or sugar-sweetened beverage consumption were low in pediatric primary care, and preappointment screening did not significantly affect clinician counseling. Future efforts will require a more robust approach to effect change in counseling, provision of service, and family behavior.

### An interdisciplinary hospital-based committee to improve pediatric bereavement care [^114BA5nK]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Although frequently overshadowed by adult mortality rates and bereavement care needs, the death of a child can significantly jeopardize the physical, psychosocial, and emotional health of surviving parents, caregivers, and family members. Unfortunately, researchers have only recently begun to explore the trajectory of pediatric bereavement care needs. As an ongoing public health concern, health care institutions and related organizations must partner with interdisciplinary care providers and bereaved families to design effective and sustainable bereavement supports in their communities. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to describe the development and accomplishments of an interdisciplinary bereavement committee at a children's hospital within an academic medical center. By relying on available empirical evidence and close collaboration with bereaved parent members, this effort has generated sizeable practice improvements and new service offerings within the organization, local community, and the individual patients and families the institution serves.

Pediatric safety cautions — local anesthetics and opioids: The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry Reference Manual states, "While the prolonged effect of a long-acting local anesthetic (ie, bupivacaine) can be beneficial for post-operative pain in adults, the concomitant increased risk of self-inflicted injury [eg, lip biting] infers that it is contraindicated for the child or the physically or intellectually disabled patient". Additionally, "The FDA stated in 2017 that is adding the following to labels of prescription medicines containing codeine and tramadol: 'FDA's strongest warning, called a Contraindication, to the drug labels of codeine and tramadol alerting that codeine should not be used to treat pain or cough and tramadol should not be used to treat pain in children younger than 12 years'. Caregivers are advised that "Parents, guardians, and caregivers should be advised to carefully follow instructions on the medication label or prescription for appropriate dosage" and "analgesic prescriptions should follow the principle of minimum effective dosage to achieve pain relief".

### Practice parameter for the psychiatric assessment and management of physically ill children and adolescents [^115kmHkw]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Developmental, medical experience, temperament, and parental influences on adaptation to physical illness in children and adolescents are described as follows: Developmental factors have a profound impact on adaptation, with preschool children limited in their ability to comprehend and recall medical information, which can exacerbate emotional reactions to medical interventions, and physical illness impinging on the adolescent's developmental challenges of individuation and emerging sense of autonomy, bodily identity, and sexuality. Difficult, painful, or unsuccessful medical procedures can fuel future expectations of similar experiences, leading the child to become more anxious. Child temperament can affect adjustment to acute medical stressors directly, avoidance may manifest itself as treatment nonadherence, and temperamental difficulties have been found to predict poorer long-term behavioral and emotional adjustment in children with physical illnesses. Parental anxiety has been associated with parental distress during procedures, which, in turn, can interfere with the parents' abilities to respond to their child's emotional needs, with their abilities to help their child generate effective coping strategies, and with both immediate and long-term outcomes, and parental psychopathology, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress reactions, has been shown to play important roles in long-term adjustment. The crisis or acute phase occurs immediately before and after the diagnosis of an illness with efforts directed at controlling the illness symptoms and progression while managing reactions to the potential loss of the healthy child, the chronic phase unfolds after the initial diagnosis of and readjustment to the illness with goals to minimize the risk of relapse while containing the impact on the child and family, and the terminal phase involves managing and processing the feelings and responses to the loss of the child.

### Small smiles dental centers… [^114RESNr]. Wikipedia (2010). Low credibility.

By 2004, The Colorado Springs Gazette reported that Small Smiles used papoose boards almost 7, 000 times in one 18-month period. According to Colorado state records, Michael and Edward DeRose said that they used papoose boards so that they could do dental work on larger numbers of children in a more rapid manner. Small Smiles dentists from other states learned the papoose board method in Colorado and began practicing the method in other states. As a result, a Colorado Board of Dental Examiners appointed committee established a new Colorado state law forbidding the usage of papoose boards for children unless a dentist has exhausted other possibilities for controlling a child's behavior, and if the dentist uses a papoose board, he or she must document why the papoose board was used in the patient's record.

In a related development, Medicaid Dental Centers came under fire in 2003 when WCNC-TV in Charlotte, North Carolina, reported on several traumatic experiences by its patients, including liberal uses of papoose boards and one child having 16 of his baby teeth capped in one sitting. A May 9, 2004 story in The Colorado Springs Gazette revealed that the children underwent large amounts of dental work at the clinics. In a 14-month period until May 20, 2004, the clinics charged over $16 million in Medicaid dental charges, and records from the Colorado state government revealed that many children each had over 10 teeth drilled and given silver caps within a single visit. The State of Colorado Medicaid office placed a daily limit on stainless steel crowns to slow the payments. In April 2004, Michael DeRose said that the children at Small Smiles had severe dental needs.

The Colorado State Dental Board also reported Edward DeRose, Michael DeRose, and Mueller to two national databases that serve as clearinghouses for information on actions filed against dentists. The DeRoses and Mueller filed a complaint asking the board to have their names removed. After the ownership change in 2006, Small Smiles and its various clinics have pledged to be compliant with standards set in state and federal healthcare guidelines, as well as guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. A Pediatric Dental Advisory Board was established in 2007 to assist Chief Dental Officer Stephen Adair in meeting quality of care standards. She filmed the lead dentist discussing production goals and stating that his clinic's dentists perform many baby root canals per day.

Interviews with several former employees who either resigned or were fired after speaking out against the company's practices revealed other abuses, including dental staff conducting X-rays on children even though they were not certified to do so. The film and the investigative report aired on television led to legal action unfolding. This sparked other stations across the United States to investigate area Small Smiles locations. In April 2008, Michael A. DeRose and Letitia L. Ballance settled with the United States and North Carolina to resolve False Claims Act allegations that their Medicaid Dental Center, previously known as Smile Starters and Carolina Dental Center, made false or fraudulent Medicaid claims. MDC agreed to pay $10, 050, 000 and to not contest that their dentists performed unwarranted pulpotomies and placed stainless steel crowns.

### WITHDRAWN: hypnosis for children undergoing dental treatment [^113sgiQg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Managing children is a challenge that many dentists face. Many non-pharmacological techniques have been developed to manage anxiety and behavioural problems in children, such us: 'tell, show & do', positive reinforcement, modelling and hypnosis. The use of hypnosis is generally an overlooked area, hence the need for this review.

Objectives

This systematic review attempted to answer the question: What is the effectiveness of hypnosis (with or without sedation) for behaviour management of children who are receiving dental care in order to allow successful completion of treatment?Null hypothesis: Hypnosis has no effect on the outcome of dental treatment of children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), and PsycINFO. Electronic and manual searches were performed using controlled vocabulary and free text terms with no language restrictions. Date of last search: 11th June 2010.

Selection Criteria

All children and adolescents aged up to 16 years of age. Children having any dental treatment, such as: simple restorative treatment with or without local anaesthetic, simple extractions or management of dental trauma.

Data Collection and Analysis

Information regarding methods, participants, interventions, outcome measures and results were independently extracted, in duplicate, by two review authors. Authors of trials were contacted for details of randomisation and withdrawals and a quality assessment was carried out. The methodological quality of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 5.0.2.

Main Results

Only three RCTs (with 69 participants) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Statistical analysis and meta-analysis were not possible due to insufficient number of studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Although there are a considerable number of anecdotal accounts indicating the benefits of using hypnosis in paediatric dentistry, on the basis of the three studies meeting the inclusion criteria for this review there is not yet enough evidence to suggest its beneficial effects.

### Child life services [^111VTiVA]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Child life programs are an important component of pediatric hospital-based care; they address the psychosocial concerns that accompany hospitalization and other health care experiences. Child life specialists focus on the optimal development and well-being of infants, children, adolescents, and young adults while promoting coping skills and minimizing the adverse effects of hospitalization, health care encounters, and/or other potentially stressful experiences. In collaboration with the entire health care team and family, child life specialists provide interventions that include therapeutic play, expressive modalities, and psychological preparation to facilitate coping and normalization at times and under circumstances that might otherwise prove overwhelming for the child. Play and developmentally appropriate communication are used to (1) promote optimal development, (2) educate children and families about health conditions, (3) prepare children and partner with families for medical events or procedures, (4) plan and rehearse useful coping and pain-management strategies with patients and families, (5) help children work through feelings about past or impending experiences, and (6) partner with families to establish therapeutic relationships between patients, siblings, and caregivers. Child life specialists collaborate with the entire interdisciplinary team to promote coping and enhance the overall health care experience for patients and families.

### Sedation of children undergoing dental treatment [^117UoWgu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Children's fear about dental treatment may lead to behaviour management problems for the dentist, which can be a barrier to the successful dental treatment of children. Sedation can be used to relieve anxiety and manage behaviour in children undergoing dental treatment. There is a need to determine from published research which agents, dosages and regimens are effective. This is the second update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2005 and previously updated in 2012.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and relative efficacy of conscious sedation agents and dosages for behaviour management in paediatric dentistry.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 22 February 2018); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 22 February 2018); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 22 February 2018); and Embase Ovid (1980 to 22 February 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Studies were selected if they met the following criteria: randomised controlled trials of conscious sedation comparing two or more drugs/techniques/placebo undertaken by the dentist or one of the dental team in children up to 16 years of age. We excluded cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted, in duplicate, information regarding methods, participants, interventions, outcome measures and results. Where information in trial reports was unclear or incomplete authors of trials were contacted. Trials were assessed for risk of bias. Cochrane statistical guidelines were followed.

Main Results

We included 50 studies with a total of 3704 participants. Forty studies (81%) were at high risk of bias, nine (18%) were at unclear risk of bias, with just one assessed as at low risk of bias. There were 34 different sedatives used with or without inhalational nitrous oxide. Dosages, mode of administration and time of administration varied widely. Studies were grouped into placebo-controlled, dosage and head-to-head comparisons. Meta-analysis of the available data for the primary outcome (behaviour) was possible for studies investigating oral midazolam versus placebo only. There is moderate-certainty evidence from six small clinically heterogeneous studies at high or unclear risk of bias, that the use of oral midazolam in doses between 0.25 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg is associated with more co-operative behaviour compared to placebo; standardized mean difference (SMD) favoured midazolam (SMD 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59 to 2.33, P < 0.0001, I² = 90%; 6 studies; 202 participants). It was not possible to draw conclusions regarding the secondary outcomes due to inconsistent or inadequate reporting or both.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some moderate-certainty evidence that oral midazolam is an effective sedative agent for children undergoing dental treatment. There is a need for further well-designed and well-reported clinical trials to evaluate other potential sedation agents. Further recommendations for future research are described and it is suggested that future trials evaluate experimental regimens in comparison with oral midazolam or inhaled nitrous oxide.

### Dental fear… [^114ECuKh]. Wikipedia (2024). Medium credibility.

This indirect pathway relates to fear acquisition through gaining information and becoming bias to the dental environment from dental phobic elders, negative connotations advertised by media, and friends with personal negative experiences. Vicarious The vicarious pathway suggests that fear is acquired through imagination of the feelings, experience or actions of another person. Whether this pathway occurs on its own or in combination with others is still unknown. It has been suggested that dental fear in the very young is passed through this pathway through observation of expressions of fear by elders/parents at the dentist. Although at a glance, the verbal threat and informative pathway are similar, in odontophobia the two pathways differ in that the verbal threat pathway occurs when a "visit to the dentist" is literally used as a form of punishment for bad behaviour. This does not occur in the informative pathway.

Parental modelling There is a significant relationship between child and parental dental fear, especially that of the mothers. it has been suggested that this relationship is strongest in children 8 years or younger. However, it is important to note the parental modelling pathway may overlap with the informative or vicarious pathways are all linked in some way.
- The index of dental anxiety and fear, used for adults and it is separated into 8 item module and then a further 10 item module. The management of people with dental fear can be done using shorter term methods such as hypnosis and general anesthetic, or longer term methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy and the development of coping skills. Short term methods have been proven to be ineffective for long-term treatment of the phobia, since many return to a pattern of treatment avoidance afterwards.

Psychological approaches are more effective at maintaining regular dental care, but demand more knowledge from the dentist and motivation from the patient. Similarly, distraction techniques can also be utilized to divert the patient's attention to allow them to avoid supposed negativity and be more comfortable. This can be achieved through television or movies, or a physical distraction such as focusing on another body part such as wiggling the toes or fingers. More recent research indicates that the use of conscious sedation combined appropriate communication techniques may relieve the anxiety in the long-term. Psychocognitive Modelling Modelling is a form of psycho-behavioural therapy used to alleviate dental fear. Commonly used in paediatric dentistry, it involves the showing of a procedure under a simulated environment.

It allows the patient to observe the behaviour of a friend, family member, or other patient when put in a similar situation, therefore, accommodating for the learning of new coping mechanisms. Modelling can be presented live using a parent or actor as well as virtually through pre-recorded films. Tell-show-do Tell-show-do is a common non-pharmacological practice used to manage behaviour such as dental fear, especially in paediatric dentistry. The purpose of this intervention is to promote a positive attitude towards dentistry and to build a relationship with the patient to improve compliance. The patient is gradually introduced to the treatment. Firstly, the dentist "tells" the patient what the dental procedure will be using words. In 'show' phase, the patient is familiarized with dental treatment using demonstrations. Lastly, in 'do' phase, the dentist proceeds with the treatment following the same procedure and demonstrations illustrated to the patient.

### Care for the caregiver: how caregiver mortality affects treatment outcomes-an observational cohort study [^116zmA6w]. AIDS and Behavior (2025). Medium credibility.

Speaking about the death of biological parents and other caregivers comes with its challenges. Dealing with death and bereavement in children and adolescents is not easy, whether the death happened long ago or recently. The death of a primary caregiver should be seen as a defining event in a child or adolescent's life and should immediately trigger a higher level of awareness and caution about potential long-term clinical and psychosocial problems. As part of routine history-taking, the health of the primary caregiver and family should be enquired about and documented at each visit. The first step, however, is to quantify the problem and create more awareness.

The health of a child is dependent on the support and stability of a healthy caregiver. More stringent screening tools need to be put in place to intervene and help caregivers who are ill, and to create a stronger system of documenting deaths. In the event of a death, support networks and structures need to be put into place to help the children or adolescents grieve and cope with the loss. We see that the effects of a caregiver's death are not short-lived but rather translate to chronic issues such as stunting and wasting. A small section in the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) booklet asks about maternal health when the child visits the clinic. According to the WHO, IMCI is an integrated approach that focuses on the health and well-being of children, aiming to reduce preventable mortality, decrease illness and disability, and promote healthy growth and development of children under five years of age.

### Dental and dentoalveolar injuries in the pediatric patient [^116szbLG]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Dental and dentoalveolar injuries are common in the pediatric population. Management is predicated on the type of tooth injured (primary or permanent), extent of injury, the dental and behavioral age of the patient, and ability of the patient to tolerate treatment. Although many dental injuries occur in isolation, a systematic evaluation of the patient is mandatory to confirm the absence of basal bone fractures of the maxilla or mandible, traumatic brain injury, cervical spine injury, and/or facial soft tissue injury. Long-term follow-up is paramount to achieving a functional occlusion and optimal dental health following injury.

### Dental fear… [^115aiEoY]. Wikipedia (2007). Low credibility.

Several theories have been proposed; however, a 2014 review describes five pathways which relate specifically to development dental fear and anxiety: Cognitive Conditioning, Vicarious, Verbal Threat, Informative, and Parental. However, there may be a variety of background factors common to all general fear and anxiety conditions that may be at play and affect these more specific pathways. Informative This indirect pathway relates to fear acquisition through gaining information and becoming bias to the dental environment from dental phobic elders, negative connotations advertised by media, and friends with personal negative experiences. Vicarious The vicarious pathway suggests that fear is acquired through imagination of the feelings, experience or actions of another person. Whether this pathway occurs on its own or in combination with others is still unknown.

It has been suggested that dental fear in the very young is passed through this pathway through observation of expressions of fear by elders/parents at the dentist.

- The index of dental anxiety and fear, used for adults and it is separated into 8 item module and then a further 10 item module.

Management Dental fear varies across a continuum, from very mild fear to severe. Therefore, in a dental setting, it is also the case where the technique and management that works for one patient might not work for another. Some individuals may require a tailored management and treatment approach. The management of people with dental fear can be done using shorter term methods such as hypnosis and general anesthetic, or longer term methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy and the development of coping skills. Short term methods have been proven to be ineffective for long-term treatment of the phobia, since many return to a pattern of treatment avoidance afterwards.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Acute dental pain in children — use of guideline recommendations is intended as assistance rather than directives, as these evidence-based recommendations and good practice statements should not replace clinical judgment nor cover all potential clinical scenarios when managing acute dental pain in children, they serve as assistance for patients, parents, guardians, caregivers, clinicians, administrators, and policy makers when making management decisions, and practitioners should remain alert to patient-specific nuance and unusual situations that may warrant a deviation from these recommendations.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic management of acute dental pain: temporary management of toothache in children with No immediate access to definitive dental treatment [^114Mu7rK]. ADA (2024). High credibility.

Acute dental pain in children — assessment, counseling, applicability, and safety are specified as follows: The guideline panel advises clinicians to assess children's pain using age-appropriate tools, for example a behavioral scale (1–3 years), a Faces scale (≥ 3 years), a numerical rating scale (≥ 8 years) or a visual analog scale (≥ 8 years). The guideline panel advises clinicians to counsel patients and their caregivers that they should expect some pain and the analgesics should make their pain manageable. The guideline panel reminds users that these recommendations only apply to settings where definitive dental treatment is not immediately available and that these pharmacological strategies will alleviate dental pain temporarily until a referral for definitive dental treatment is in place. The guideline panel recommends clinicians thoroughly review the patient's medical and social histories and medications and supplements to avoid overdose and adverse drug–drug interactions. According to FDA, codeine and tramadol are contraindicated in children younger than 12 years, and topical benzocaine should not be used in infants or young children due to the high risk of methemoglobinemia.

### Pediatric dentists' perspectives of children with special health care needs in Japan: developmental disabilities, phobia, maltreatment, and multidisciplinary collaboration [^117VEo3Q]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Children with severe rampant caries possibly derived from maltreatment

The majority of participants were very wary of children with severe rampant caries. For example, there were not a few severe cases who lost almost all child teeth decayed from the root. Most participants considered the children's rampant severe caries unusual, and therefore they became concerned about the children. In their perception, children's rampant severe caries and frequent recurrence of those interrelate the possibilities of their parents' abuse or neglect.

The condition of the cavity is not normal. When that happens, I wonder what I should do as the child is not cared for by their parents (Participant ID No. 5).

One-third of participants mentioned that they were concerned about the children with possible child abuse, for example, when a young child had a bruise on his or her eyes. A participant with the least years of clinical experience said that everyone at the studied clinic was shocked to see a mother yell at her boy and did not give his slacks and even threw them opposite him. Although most participants cared for the possible abuse or neglect, they were circumspect of calling the child consultation centre for child protection.

Nearly half of the participants mentioned the possibilities of neglect by their mothers: physical neglect, emotional neglect, and dental neglect. As for physical neglect, participants minded unsanitary conditions in that a mother did not change a diaper timely so that a child developed diaper rash. They also mentioned concern for children who exhibited an unbalanced diet, such as a 3-year-old patient who prepared his or her meal independently and, in fact, drank cola only for breakfast. In a participant's remark, another 3–4-year-old patient said he or she ate a steak for breakfast, which was an unusual breakfast menu in the Japanese context. Therefore, a participant (Participant ID No. 8), who had a credential of the Board Certified Trainer, interpreted that this patient had not eaten anything for breakfast. Moreover, the dirtiness of faces, smell, and clothes' conditions were the objects that participants watched out for.

### Pediatric prevention: oral health care [^116Lj5Pt]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Children who have a dental home are more likely to receive preventative care, require fewer dental treatments, and are less likely to have dental disease. Many children demonstrate behavior management concerns that may impede families from establishing a dental home for their children. Conceptually, behavior concerns develop through a process of conditioning. Prevention of such problems should focus on providing positive experiences related to dental care. Treatment components to address behavior management concerns include graduated exposure, contingent reinforcement, modeling and prompting, distraction/relaxation, and cognitive behavior therapy. Further support, training, and reimbursement for time required to administer such treatment is needed.

The death of a child is a devastating event. Families experience profound grief and loss immediately following the death, and this remains and evolves as time progresses. In this, the second in a series, we discuss the importance of longer term bereavement care and how continuing contact with healthcare can be navigated. As bereaved parents who are also doctors, we again share our experiences. The complex nature of parenting, supporting siblings or managing a pregnancy after loss are explored, and we look at the involvement of bereaved parents in developing bereavement services.

### Parent's acceptance of advanced behavior management techniques on children during dental treatment [^112qt1av]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

The questionnaire was opened by 476 subjects, 23 parents did not sign the informed consent (4.83%), 7 (1.47%) did not complete the questionnaire, and 6 (1.26%) did not answer the questionnaire properly (inconsistent sentinel questions). Therefore, questionnaires filled out by 440 parents were included and analyzed. Due to the study design and questionnaire distribution, no response rate was evaluated. The study sample included 236 parents of neurotypical children (53.64%) and 204 parents of children with ASDs (53.64%). The mean age of children was 7.61 95 CI [7.34; 7.88], with no difference in the two groups (p = 0.58). Most responders were mothers (77.59%) born in Europe (88.18%). Different distribution of parents' birthplace was observed in the two groups (p < 0.01). Almost half of the sample of parents (41.36%) have brought their child to a private dentist, with significant differences in the two groups (60.17% vs. 19.61%), while 32.05% have never brought their children to the dentist (22.46% vs. 43.14%). No differences were found between the two groups regarding parents' educational level (p = 0.73) (Table 1). Parents of children with ASDs judged worse their children's cooperation during dental treatment (1.71 ± 1.75 vs 3.3 ± 1.92; p < 0.01).

### Dentoalveolar trauma in the pediatric population [^1133gECd]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Dental alveolar trauma in pediatric patients is a challenge to health care professionals. It can lead to early tooth loss that can compromise oral function, aesthetics, and self-esteem and alter the long-term plan of care for the pediatric patient.

Methods

The authors reviewed the literature pertaining to pediatric dental and alveolar traumas. The current etiology, incidence, classifications of injury, and methods to diagnose and treat these patients were reviewed and outlined.

Conclusions

Management of dental trauma is complex and requires a comprehensive and accurate diagnostic and treatment plan. It is also important to consider the biologic, functional, aesthetic, and economic aspects, as well as the patient's desire. Physicians who provide primary care for children have a unique position to provide diagnostic, triage, educational, and preventive dental care for patients. Several articles have been published regarding primary pediatricians' participation in the preventive dental health care of their patients. One publication, a survey of physicians in Alabama focusing on physicians' overall awareness of dental issues, concluded that most physicians believe they have a role in the oral health of their patients. Most were not aware of many of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's recommendations.

In case amelogenesis imperfecta can be recognized in the primary dentition, initial diagnosis and follow-up should begin at the moment of emergence of the first tooth, typically around 6 months of age, with a clinical examination conducted by a general dental practitioner or specialized dentist. This approach aims to prevent issues and preserve tooth structure as much as possible from the earliest stages. Even when restorative care for primary teeth is not required, early visits are essential, familiarizing the child with the practitioner, dental environment, and procedures.

Diagnosis can be confirmed by a specialist in rare diseases and/or a geneticist from the age of 2. Genetic testing should be considered especially in cases where AI is suspected to be associated with a syndrome.

An assessment of caries risk is recommended to establish suitable preventive measures. Educating families on oral hygiene and dietary habits is vital. Even without restorative needs, application of high-fluoride varnish is recommended for caries prevention and enamel remineralization facilitation. Fluorides are also beneficial for desensitization purposes.

Treatment solutions should consider the child's age, cooperation level, and specific dental conditions. Glass ionomer cement can be used as a provisional treatment, particularly for very young children and/or those with poor cooperation. However, when more definitive care is feasible, composite resin restorations are preferred for their durability. Given the delayed transition from primary to permanent dentition and the prevalence of dental anomalies, an orthopantomogram is crucial for the early identification of these conditions. In this phase, the pediatric dentist plays an essential role in identifying potential anomalies, that may require referral for an orthodontic consultation. In addition, some patients may exhibit abnormal oral habits, requiring evaluation and treatment by a speech therapist to address functional concerns.

Guiding the child and implementing behavior management is key for these children in need, sometimes of extensive treatments.

### Children's reactions to parental and sibling death [^115pSWZu]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

A significant population of children will experience bereavement because of the death of a parent or a sibling. This grief is different from the bereavement seen in adults and needs to be understood in a developmental context. Cognitive and emotional understanding of death and dying in children gradually evolves with age. This report provides clinicians with information regarding the unique developmental elements in children that relate to the process of bereavement secondary to parental and sibling loss, risk factors for complicated grief, the warning signs of depression and anxiety beyond normal grief reaction, and the guidelines for intervention in children.

### Management strategies of dental anxiety and uncooperative behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorder [^115g8SJD]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

According to the existing studies, due to the widespread development of general anesthesia for children's dental treatment, there was still controversy regarding whether it was necessary to induce to relieve dental anxiety and uncooperative behavior of autistic children, and what kind of behavior management was used for dental care and oral health. Therefore, we summarized and assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of this systematic review in managing dental anxiety and uncooperative behavior in autistic children who underwent oral health care and dental treatment.

### Practice parameter for the psychiatric assessment and management of physically ill children and adolescents [^111WSrWL]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Coping style and adaptation — Coping styles, defined as sets of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to stressors, have been categorized in a number of ways. Approach-oriented coping refers to thoughts or behaviors directed at managing the stressor or feelings it elicits, whereas avoidance-oriented coping describes efforts by a person to avoid the stressor. Problem-focused strategies are directed at altering the stressor, whereas emotion-focused strategies are aimed at regulating emotional responses to the stressor. For a child facing an acute medical stressor, an important factor is whether the child is allowed to use his or her preferred coping style, and there is some evidence that problem-focused coping may be more adaptive for children with chronic physical illness. The variety, flexibility, and frequency of adaptive coping increase with age, giving older children access to a wider range of effective coping strategies.

### Common behavioral dilemmas of the school-aged child [^114HtMKU]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

PCPs are typically the first professionals to come into contact with children who have behavioral or developmental problems. The most common behavioral concerns that PCPs encounter in the pediatric primary care setting include noncompliance, temper tantrums, and problems with eating and sleeping routines. To adequately detect these types of problems, it essential that PCPs incorporate behavioral assessment procedures (eg, clinical interviews, behavior rating scales, ABC recording form) into the consultation process. Behavioral assessment procedures are useful in identifying the environmental events (ie, antecedents and consequences) that may be maintaining the problem behavior. Data that are collected from behavioral assessment can be used to develop a tentative hypothesis on functions of the behavioral problem. By identifying the potential function of the behavior, more effective behavioral management strategies can be developed. An existing model of behavioral consultation can be used by PCPs during office visits to more effectively identify and manage many of the common and less severe behavioral problems.

Methods

The current studies were conducted on the basis of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The registration ID on PROSPERO is CRD42023473698, and the link of the PROSPERO isprospero/display_ record.php?ID = CRD42023473698.

The project of research

The main question of the current research was carried out to determine in this systematic review through which the literature was investigated: How to alleviate dental phobia of autistic children, how to evaluate their degree of cooperation and how to take effective oral treatment?

The PICO strategy

Answering the above-mentioned research questions through PICOs method which the clinical questions can be correctly formulated and derives from the Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) approach, was used to write systematic reviews. In this strategy, the study of following aspects should be considered:
P: Population of interest (autistic children between 3 and 19 years old)
I: Interventions (management techniques in the dental treatment and the cooperation rate of children)
C: Control (TD children and ASD group in different dental environment)
O: Outcome (the improvement of dental anxiety in the behavior scale)

Literature search

The literature search strategy was performed in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library (all from inception to January 2023). The search items were as follows: ("Autistic Disorder" OR "autism" OR "Asperger syndrome" OR "Autism Spectrum Disorder" OR "ASD") AND ("dental fear" OR "dental anxiety" OR "dental anxieties" OR "dental phobia" OR "Dentophobia" OR "Odontophobia").

### Special needs dentistryen.wikipedia.org › wiki › special_needs_dentistry… [^1172fnXQ]. Wikipedia (2008). Low credibility.

Special needs dentistry, also known as special care dentistry, is a dental specialty that deals with the oral health problems of geriatric patients, patients with intellectual disabilities, and patients with other medical, physical, or psychiatric issues. Special needs dentists typically have additional postgraduate training after attaining their dental degree. These requirements are dependent on the dentist's country or other jurisdiction. Some countries offer Board Certification in special needs dentistry, such as the American Board of Special Care Dentistry or the Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons, Fellowship). Oral health therapists have incorporated studies to allow for their scope of practice to cover working with people with special needs. They may accompany a dentist within clinic or domiciliary environments to aid in education, disease control and maintenance of patients with special needs.

Patients who require special needs dentistry may live at home, in hospital, in secure units, in residential or nursing homes, or they may be homeless or vulnerably housed. Their additional needs may be due directly to their impairment or disability, or to some aspect of their medical history that affects their oral health, or because their social, environmental or cultural context disables them with reference to their oral health. Developmental Disabilities Autism Autistic patients have a higher risk of:

- caries
- bruxism
- tongue thrusting
- self-injurious behaviour such as picking at the gingiva or biting the lips
- delayed tooth eruption can be seen in Autistic patients. Cerebral Palsy Patients with cerebral palsy not only struggle accessing dental services and performing oral care. As a result, these patients are often faced with higher levels of untreated disease and tooth loss.
- Poor oral hygiene
- Periodontitis
- Xerostomia resulting from mouth breathing and medications
- Enamel hypoplasia
- Caries
- Drooling
- Dysphagia
- Bruxism
- Fractured teeth. Down's Syndrome The majority of patients with Down's Syndrome can be seen in primary dental care with appropriate behavioural management techniques, the degree to which this is successful is entirely dependent on the extent of the learning disability and the cooperation of the patient. Many procedures can be successfully carried out under local anaesthesia but attention should be paid to any pre-existing cardiovascular or neurological conditions. Should the patient be uncooperative or require sedation or general anaesthesia, care can be shared with specialist services. The following oral features are common:

- Delayed dental development and eruption
- Hypodontia
- Microdontia
- Hypocalcification
- High incidence of severe early onset of periodontal disease
- Protruded tongue
- Strong gag reflex.

Mental Health Conditions This area of special care dentistry is more common in young adults and adolescents. Schizophrenia
- Poor self care including diet and oral hygiene
- Xerostomia as a result of antipsychotic medication
- Caries
- Periodontal disease
- Tardive dyskinesias characterised by involuntary muscle movements. Bipolar Disorder
- Poor oral hygiene
- Increased levels of plaque and calculus
- Increased risk of periodontal disease
- Increased caries
- Xerostomia Depression
- Xerostomia
- Poor self-care including diet and oral hygiene
- Caries
- Periodontal disease
- Oral dysaesthesia.

### Are we together in this? Relationship experiences of parents of children with craniofacial anomalies [^116dKN7a]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Facing an Unexpected and Uncertain Situation

This theme included all participants' experiences during the initial time period after their children were born, which was marked by intense worry and uncertainty about the future. The participants described this period as having the most significant impact on their relationships. Most participants needed to spend time in hospitals separated from the rest of their family, deliver home-based interventions, monitor their child's health and symptoms and maintain vigilance despite experiencing fatigue. For some participants, the experience of living with uncertainty became prolonged, as it took time before they received a diagnosis providing them with answers. As some participants had children with extremely rare conditions, health professionals could offer little knowledge about the prognosis, which intensified the participants' experiences of uncertainty. Some participants feared for their children's lives and were unsure if their babies were going to survive. Moreover, caring for children had to be balanced with domestic responsibilities and caring for siblings. All participants described the children's first years as life altering. Their worlds became unpredictable, as positive expectations regarding postnatal time were transformed into an uncertain reality. Most participants described going into survival mode and had no capacity other than attempting to go from one day to the next.

### Are we together in this? Relationship experiences of parents of children with craniofacial anomalies [^114B5Ko1]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The participants described being proud of managing to get through the most vulnerable time in their lives while gaining new knowledge about each other and their relationships. They learned to set boundaries for themselves and respect their partners' boundaries. As the participants and their partners were committed, they found the courage to let their guard down and share feelings that felt shameful and difficult while working on unresolved issues from the initial period after their child arrived.

We're really proud that we managed to resolve our issues and work together. We have learned each other's weaknesses and strengths, which gave us the courage to ask each other questions and to talk and share, which we didn't dare to before. So, we became very good at knowing what went wrong, what I had to change, what he had to change… and to build on the good stuff, to be more aware of our typical ways of reacting.

These participants experienced their relationships growing stronger as a result of overcoming difficulties together.

### List of the dumping ground characters… [^114XkXgs]. Wikipedia (2025). Medium credibility.

Faith is disgusted and tells Elektra that she was put in care because she told a teacher that she lived alone, which resulted in them calling social services. The police tell her that the body was not a match; she hides in the garden and finds Floss who helps her gain some composure. The next day she completes her charity run with everyone supporting her. She becomes mean and aggressive towards the younger kids mainly, making Harry and Floss to clean her room for a "prize" and ordering them about. She ends up teasing Harry, treating him like a baby. When Faith wants to watch a movie, but Mo, Floss and Harry were already watching something, she tells them to get lost and Mo tells her that she's become really mean, and that he's going to tell Mike. That causes Faith to call Mo a grass. Frank witnesses this and when Faith starts to order Frank about, Frank gives her a piece of his mind by telling her that she's not useless, she's in a wheelchair and she will get better.

He then goes on to tell her that he has to talk really slow every day of his life so people can understand him. This changes Faith's recent behaviour and she reverts to her caring and friendly self, but she does have a few snappy and mean moments in later episodes. Floss is in care because she was abandoned by her mother in a nail salon, when she was 18 months old. She was still young when she had Floss and couldn't cope. Floss Guppy is good friends with Finn McLaine and Toni and Billie Trent and although initially wary of Harry, even stealing his toy giraffe Jeff, after he unintentionally scares her with stories of the bad things that happened at Elm Tree House, she becomes good friends with him as well. In "Be My Girl", Floss meets some prospective parents. She starts to think about her Mother and when a little boy in the park questions her 'Where is your Mum, haven't you got one. ' in an evil way, Floss goes over the tipping point and pushes him and his ice cream to the ground.

Floss' potential foster parents shout at Floss, upsetting her. May-Li reveals that Floss is in care because she was abandoned by her mother in a nail salon, when she was 18 months old; this is why she is so attached to nail varnish. At the foster parents' house they ask her to remove her nail varnish causing Floss to throw food around. Floss tells all the people at the 'Dumping Ground' that whilst there is a chance her mother might return, she will wait. In Series 8, it's revealed via a DNA test that Ross is her twin brother and her mother's name is Jane Sadler, making her real last name Sadler. They go in search of their mother on their own, following an address but it is the wrong house. In Series 9, Floss is given the chance to meet her real mother and ask her the questions she has always wanted to know answers to. However, when she realizes that her mother is not coming to take her out of care, she becomes upset and decides to cut contact with her.

Mo is a kind, eccentric kid in the 'Dumping Ground'. He first appeared in "Oh, Mo. " His age is 10, as of series 3 of The Dumping Ground. In series 4, Mo is annoyed by younger residents like Joseph. Tee succeeded in knocking the scarecrow down, which unfortunately landed on top of Mo, who had followed Tee. Mo was taken to hospital and Mike intended for him to be moved into emergency foster care as Mo was clearly not settling down at Elm Tree House. However, the other kids realised that Mo was no different to them in that they all had a complicated start in life, so they rebuilt his scarecrow as a welcome home present, saying that they wanted Mo to stay. On the day the older residents went out to look for Frank, Mo was due to have a dentist appointment. Mo, fearing the dentist, hid in the garden, but was found by Floss and Harry. Mo was coaxed out, only for a bird to poo on him. Harry cheered up Mo, saying that when a bird pooed on you, it was lucky.

### Dental health-a challenging problem for a patient with autism spectrum disorder [^112PY7pv]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are at an increased risk for many diseases. However, little has been published about the dental health of patients with ASDs. Here, we describe the clinical presentations in a 28-year-old woman with autistic disorder. The most striking finding was the severe dental problems which had been neglected for several years. Our patient exhibited a combination of several factors that may have increased the risk of development of severe dental problem. The early recognition is still challenging to managing this unusual condition in patients with ASDs. From the experience of caring for this patient, a team of parents or caregivers, psychiatrist and dentist should be involved in maintaining oral health care of such patients with early intervention and long-term follow-up. Evidence-based behavioral management approaches for patients with ASD need to be developed to improve compliance with oral care procedures.

### Parent's acceptance of advanced behavior management techniques on children during dental treatment [^111gQLpe]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Protective stabilization involves immobilizing or restricting the patient's movements to ensure safety during treatment. It can be active, involving qualified personnel or parents, or passive, using stabilization devices. This procedure is particularly effective in young or uncooperative children, allowing the completion of short-duration treatments.

Conscious sedation mainly consists of administering a mixture of gases (nitrous oxide and oxygen) through a nasal mask or drugs (e.g. benzodiazepines), which reduce anxiety while keeping the patient conscious. Sedation with nitrous oxide requires good cooperation for both the positioning of the mask and the necessary open-mouth nasal breathing. Inhalation sedation can be combined with the administration of benzodiazepines and/or protective stabilization.

Deep sedation and general anesthesia, on the other hand, do not require patient cooperation, inducing a state of partial or total unconsciousness, respectively. While conscious sedation can be performed by a specially trained dentist, deep sedation and general anesthesia must be administered exclusively by a specialized anesthetist, requiring, in the majority of cases, hospitalization with pre-operative exams. In the case of deep sedation and general anesthesia, practitioners often opt for faster and more successful treatments, such as extractions instead of endodontic treatments, due to operational time constraints and the difficulty of scheduling closer sessions.

Parents tend to be less accepting of ABMTs than BMTs. The evidence is limited, and parents, particularly those of uncooperating children, may have divergent perspectives on the indication, possible risks, and appropriateness of advanced treatments such as protective stabilization. An important goal in providing appropriate dental care is to establish a two-way dialogue with the child's parents regarding the potential risks and benefits of ABMTs that can be employed. Parents' opinions should be taken into account by dentists, while respecting guideline recommendations, in order to choose the most appropriate ABMTs to be used in each individual patient and situation.

Given the importance of parents' thoughts on behavior management usage in the treatment plan, investigating their point of view is vital when determining behavior guidance application priorities. Their willingness to accept children's behavior management strategies may be determined by how they are informed and their personal experience with these methods. Based on these premises, the present study aims to investigate the degree of acceptance of advanced behavior management techniques by parents of children with autism spectrum disorders and to compare it with that of parents of neurotypical children.

### Hypnosis for children undergoing dental treatment [^115cWthB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Managing children is a challenge that many dentists face. Many non-pharmacological techniques have been developed to manage anxiety and behavioural problems in children, such us: 'tell, show & do', positive reinforcement, modelling and hypnosis. The use of hypnosis is generally an overlooked area, hence the need for this review.

Objectives

This systematic review attempted to answer the question: What is the effectiveness of hypnosis (with or without sedation) for behaviour management of children who are receiving dental care in order to allow successful completion of treatment?

Null Hypothesis

Hypnosis has no effect on the outcome of dental treatment of children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), and PsycINFO. Electronic and manual searches were performed using controlled vocabulary and free text terms with no language restrictions. Date of last search: 11th June 2010.

Selection Criteria

All children and adolescents aged up to 16 years of age. Children having any dental treatment, such as: simple restorative treatment with or without local anaesthetic, simple extractions or management of dental trauma.

Data Collection and Analysis

Information regarding methods, participants, interventions, outcome measures and results were independently extracted, in duplicate, by two review authors. Authors of trials were contacted for details of randomisation and withdrawals and a quality assessment was carried out. The methodological quality of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 5.0.2.

Main Results

Only three RCTs (with 69 participants) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Statistical analysis and meta-analysis were not possible due to insufficient number of studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Although there are a considerable number of anecdotal accounts indicating the benefits of using hypnosis in paediatric dentistry, on the basis of the three studies meeting the inclusion criteria for this review there is not yet enough evidence to suggest its beneficial effects.

### Puppet play therapy in emergency pediatric dental clinic. A randomized clinical trial [^1111JnA3]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This research suggests a behavior management technique that reduces anxiety in young children attending dental clinics, particularly when a preparatory visit is not feasible, and the child requires anesthesia in his first dental visit; which could often occur in emergency dental clinics. The puppet play therapy had decreased child's dental anxiety and heart rate both before and after LA administration compared to TSD, proposing an excellent option for resulting a challenge that pediatric dentist is routinely facing in the clinic.

The study included children aged 3 to 6 years, a range suggested to be optimal for the use of puppet play based on Piaget's theory of pre-operational thought, during which symbolic thinking emerges, but cognitive operations are not yet fully developed. This developmental stage is characterized by symbolic thinking emerging, though cognitive operations are not fully developed, and frequent engagement in pretend play, as children use symbols to represent words, images, and ideas. Additionally, according to Erikson's stages of Psychosocial Development, this age range corresponds to Stage 3, where children assert control over their environment through directed play and social interactions, with play and imagination playing crucial roles. The use of play therapy with puppets aligns with pretend and imaginative play, with the child envisioning the puppet as a real dentist to interact with.

In this study, multiple approaches (subjective and objective) and tools (FIS, Frankl, FLACC and Venham) were utilized to assess the level of anxiety and the child's behavior in the dental clinics, enhancing the ascertainment and sensitivity of the study findings.

The reported anxiety scores for the control group using TSD in our study were higher than anxiety scores reported in other studies, but these other studies typically involved visits that did not require anesthesia or involve painful procedures. Moreover, patients included in these studies were not presented with pain. They reported mean FIS score of 3.16 ± 1.77 and heart rate of 111.48 ± 25.07 compared to our study which reported FIS score of 2.36 ± 0.91 and heart rate of 97.2 ± 11.9.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: dental evaluation and management prior to treatment for hematologic malignancies and CAR T-cell therapy [^116myDU2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). High credibility.

MASCC/ISOO pediatric dental preparation prior to chemotherapy or HCT highlights age-appropriate hygiene, selective extraction of highly mobile primary teeth, and use of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) with informed consent and supportive care strategies. Oral hygiene aids should be adjusted to the patient's age and parents should be actively involved; for younger or critically ill patients unable to brush or rinse, plaque can be removed by gently massaging the gumline with gauze soaked with saline or CHX. Primary teeth should be allowed to exfoliate naturally, but extremely mobile teeth should be removed as part of dental clearance. Given behavioral and time constraints, SDF may be considered to arrest superficial caries on primary teeth, and families should be informed about side effects, the need for future restoration, or possible periodic repetition. Treatment delivery should be adjusted to pediatric needs, using behavioral-cognitive techniques, sedation, or supporting services, with general anesthesia possibly required when dental needs are abundant, and pediatric dental specialists are equipped to manage this population.

### Puppet play therapy in emergency pediatric dental clinic. A randomized clinical trial [^1131eQqU]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

To warrant ascertainment, one pediatric dentist conducted the study methodology, including child examination for eligibility, behavior management technique and LA administration. The scenarios performed using both behavior management techniques were customized, and the dentist underwent training with 10 children not included in the sample. Additionally, collaboration and ascertainment were established for the evaluators. Two evaluators who were not the dentist conducting the study, blinded to the experimented techniques, independently reviewed recorded videos of both groups and provided their anxiety and behavior assessment (Frankl, Venham and FLACC scales). The Kappa score was 0.8.

The statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) ver. 22 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive analysis was conducted using percentage and Chi-square test for categorical variables, mean, median, t-test and 95% confidence level for continuous and ordinal variable. Independent-Samples Mann-Whitney was used for non-parametric data. Statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05.

### Management of an infant having natal teeth [^113RySpJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Eruption of teeth at or immediately after birth is a relatively rare phenomenon. These teeth are known as 'natal' teeth if present at birth and 'neonatal' teeth if they erupt during the first 30 days of life. Natal teeth might resemble normal primary dentition in size and shape; however, the teeth are often smaller, conical and yellowish and have hypoplastic enamel and dentin with poor or absent root formation. Complications include difficulty and discomfort during suckling, sublingual ulceration, laceration of the mother's breasts and aspiration of the teeth. These situations would warrant extraction. If the tooth does not interfere with breast feeding and is otherwise asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary. Negative cultural attitudes towards natal teeth demand good parental counselling and vigilant management in relation to child protection. Both general practice dentists and paediatric dental specialists may be involved in the supervision or treatment of patients with natal and neonatal teeth.

### Parent's acceptance of advanced behavior management techniques on children during dental treatment [^114UXYTZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The preference of parents of children with ASDs for public dental facilities over private dentists reflects the need to find affordable solutions, considering the challenges that families with children with ASDs may face. Although the supply of public dentistry is very limited in Italy, and most citizens of all ages turn to private dentists for treatment, these latter are generally neither trained nor organized to treat children with special needs who require a well-trained team to manage the specific behaviors that the spectrum entails. The fact that more than a third of the sample of children with ASDs have never been to a dentist is in line with previous research, highlighting inequalities in access to health services. Families face significant obstacles in obtaining appropriate dental care for their children with ASD, not only because of the scarcity of specialized centers but also because of limited knowledge of advanced behavior management techniques that can facilitate care. In a context where many families are unaware of the options available to manage anxiety and behavior during dental care, it is essential to inform and support families to make their approach to the dental environment easier.

### Guidelines for assessment of and intervention with persons with disabilities [^115i9Pdh]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Guideline 9 — families of individuals with disabilities: Psychologists strive to recognize the strengths and challenges of families of individuals with disabilities, noting that families have varied reactions when learning their loved one has a disability. Many family members serve caregiving roles, with Almost 18 million people in the U.S. serve as caregivers for older adults with health or functional limitations, and caregiving tasks can include addressing self-care needs; providing transportation; keeping medical and therapy appointments that often result in lost work hours; researching a family member's disability; advocating for health, school, vocational, and community services; and serving as surrogate decision makers. Family functioning, caregiving demands, and everyday (non-clinical) behavioral challenges in individuals with atypical developmental and acquired disabilities have been shown to directly affect overall family caregiver stress and health, and in some cases these family dynamics and stressors may rise to the level of disability-related abuse. Self-esteem and time spent providing care have been shown to be inversely linked to well-being. Despite the challenges families face, they also experience many positive changes as the result of having a family member with a disability, especially as they learn more about disability over time and adjust to new roles, with examples including strengthening family bonds, achieving new social networks, gaining confidence, and increasing sensitivity to difference and discrimination. Generally, family members experience quality family life by realigning their priorities, balancing the needs of all family members, accessing resources, and deciding what is important in life, and they recognize their own personal strengths, such as patience, humor, and problem-solving skills, while experiencing greater empathy for and understanding of others. The limited research on siblings of individuals with disabilities is somewhat mixed, suggesting that most siblings adapt well, although some are at risk of emotional and behavioral issues.

### Dissemination of evidence-based behavioral advice via video in pediatric primary care: an acceptance and utilization study [^11547Bea]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Research suggests that multimedia-based interventions possess advantages for disseminating safe and effective methods of behavior management to parents in pediatric primary care; however, little is known about their utilization in real-life settings. In order to maximize the impact of multimedia resources, more knowledge regarding dissemination and implementation is needed.

Objective

To examine provider and parental perception and utilization of videos designed to communicate evidence-based parenting strategies for disruptive behavior. Videos were available in clinic and online.

Results

Both provider and parent perceptions of the videos were largely positive. However, of 240 parents surveyed, only 33% were aware of the availability of videos subsequent to a well-child visit. Parents were unlikely to view the videos if they did not do so as part of their child's health care visit.

Conclusion

Multimedia interventions for behavior management are likely to be well received, but systematic methods of implementation are needed. Further study of dissemination of multimedia interventions is merited.

### Parent's acceptance of advanced behavior management techniques on children during dental treatment [^112EZCpN]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated the degree of acceptance by parents of children with or without ASDs of advanced BMTs, which can be used to carry out dental treatments in uncooperative children. The survey has involved 440 parents with equal representation from parents of neurotypical children and those with ASD. A significant portion of parents of children with ASDs opted for the public dental facility for their children, unlike parents of neurotypical children who opted for a private dentist. Additionally, a significant number of children with ASDs has never been visited by the dentist, indicating potential gaps in access to dental care. Parents of children with ASDs reported poorer cooperation during dental treatment compared to parents of neurotypical peers, highlighting the challenges faced in managing dental anxiety and behavior in this population. Moreover, only a minority of all parents knew ABMTs before the survey, indicating the need to increase awareness about the available techniques. Differences in parental acceptance of different ABMTs was noted among the two groups of parents. Passive stabilization was considered more acceptable in both routine and emergency settings by parents of children with ASDs compared to those of neurotypical peers. The percentage of parents in both groups willing to accept active and passive restraint both in routine and emergency setting was higher than that described in a similar study conducted in Germany. Moreover, conscious sedation and deep sedation/general anesthesia in routine settings were judged more acceptable by parents of children with ASD. A small percentage of parents were allowed to use ABMTs on their children, with a clear prevalence among children with ASDs for all ABMTs.

In both groups, factors such as place of birth, level of education, previous knowledge, and experience of ABMTs tended to cluster together. Interestingly, children's age appeared clearly separated from the other variables, suggesting a potential lack of influence on parental acceptance of ABMTs. This finding is surprising, as younger children are typically less cooperative and more anxious in the dental environment. However, this result agrees with previous literature. In parents of children with ASDs, it could be hypothesized that the specific challenges associated with the spectrum may overshadow the impact of age, making it a less significant factor in parental decision-making. Parents might probably base their acceptance of ABMTs more on their child's overall behavioral tendencies than their age, reflecting a more individualized approach to decision-making. Furthermore, the correlation matrix showed that parents who accepted one ABMT tended to accept the others, suggesting consistency in their attitudes toward the different techniques.

### Sensory adaptations to improve physiological and behavioral distress during dental visits in autistic children: a randomized crossover trial [^115ZbQvn]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The SADE approach is highly scalable, as it requires minimal training to implement, is easily portable, does not involve renovations, requires only 5 to 10 minutes to set up or remove, and incurs a 1-time cost of less than $6000. In practice settings, this equipment could remain set up indefinitely, with clinicians able to use (or not use) SADE adaptations for any given patient. One of the greatest challenges with implementation of newly developed interventions is the translation of research into practice. Due to the simplicity and high scalability of SADE, it has outstanding potential to be readily implemented into dental clinics nationwide. In fact, SADE has recently been added to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's best practices for behavioral guidance as a potential technique for dental patients with anxiety or special health care needs. Future research should investigate the effectiveness of SADE to improve behavioral and physiological distress in autistic children in a multisite effectiveness trial, disentangle whether the individual components of SADE separately improve outcomes or whether SADE's success is due to its application as a whole package; examine the possible long-term effects of SADE, determine the impact of SADE on the dental team, consider further tailoring of treatment based on child characteristics and interests, and identify other populations and medical procedures that may benefit from this approach.

### Community-based interventions for the prevention or management of dental caries in children [^115FwaK2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We will follow the guidance in the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) standards when conducting the review, and the PRISMA extension statement for reporting of systematic reviews that incorporate network meta‐analyses of healthcare interventions for reporting the review.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐randomised controlled trials (cRCTs) in which participants or clusters of participants are randomly allocated to receive interventions that are delivered at community level. We will not limit the size of a community in a study (which may include a centre, or a local, regional, or larger geographic area).

We will exclude cross‐over study designs because of the potential for carry‐over or learned effects from the interventions, and because these study designs are problematic for the long‐term nature of caries incidence.

We will not restrict studies based on language or publication dates. As well as reports of published studies, we will also include unpublished studies. We will include abstracts and contact authors to locate full study reports where necessary. If we are unable to obtain sufficient information, we will list these studies as 'awaiting classification'.

We will include references to protocols (or trial registration reports) of ongoing studies in the review, and will report details of these ongoing studies to illustrate the emerging research landscape. We will also include references of studies that have insufficient detail for inclusion in our review but may be eligible for inclusion in future review updates. For example, we may identify a recently completed study that has yet to publish results; we will include such studies in the list of studies 'awaiting classification'.

As there are many published RCTs globally, we will exclude from this review non‐randomised and quasi‐randomised studies of interventions (in which participants or clusters are allocated to interventions using a non‐random method, such as participants' date of birth). However, we will note in supplementary materials any such studies identified from the electronic searches that would otherwise meet the eligibility criteria.

### Community-based interventions for the prevention or management of dental caries in children [^113meeDC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Important outcomes

Uptake of the intervention, measured as the proportion of eligible children (or their parents/guardians) who consented to be randomised to the intervention or control group, and received at least one dose or session.
Compliance with the intervention, measured as the proportion of children who continued to engage with the intervention throughout the duration of the study.

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

Using tailored search strategies, we will search the following electronic databases for relevant trials.

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (from inception to present).
MEDLINE PubMed (from 1946 to present).
Embase Ovid (from 1980 to present).
CINAHL Plus (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) (from 1937 to present).
APA PsycExtra (from 1989 to present).
APA PsycInfo (from 1806 to present).
SSCI (Social Sciences Citation Index) (from 1985 to present).

We will impose no limitations based on language or publication type. In MEDLINE, we will combine subject‐specific terms with the sensitivity‐maximising version of the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials. We will adapt the search strategy for MEDLINE for use in the other listed electronic databases (Supplementary material 1).

We will search the following trials registries.

World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.
US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov.

Searching other resources

We will search for further studies in the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews identified in the results of electronic database searches. In addition, we will check that none of the included studies have been retracted due to error or fraud using Retraction Watch (retractionwatch.com/). Should serious concerns be raised about the trustworthiness of any included study, we will apply the Cochrane policy for managing potentially problematic studies; we will use the associated implementation guidance to apply this policy.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic management of acute dental pain in children: a report from the American dental association science and research institute, the university of Pittsburgh school of dental medicine, and the center for integrative global oral health at the university of Pennsylvania [^116fHoVZ]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Acute dental pain in children — evidence limitations and gaps include lack of implementation of allocation concealment, issues of missing participant data, and selective outcome reporting; most studies reported adverse events like nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness but failed to provide per-arm event rates and measures of variability for continuous outcomes, preventing the calculation of effect measures. Serious issues of imprecision due to the small number of participants per study (median, 85 participants) affected outcomes; there was a lack of studies elucidating children's parents', guardians', and caregivers' values and preferences, and the panel did not identify any study informing the effect of naproxen in children with acute dental pain.

### Practice parameter for the psychiatric assessment and management of physically ill children and adolescents [^111orswj]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Practice parameter for the psychiatric assessment and management of physically ill children and adolescents states that it describes psychiatric assessment and management and reviews the epidemiology, clinical presentation, assessment, and treatment of psychiatric symptoms in children and adolescents with physical illnesses, as well as environmental and social influences that can affect patient outcome. It emphasizes that children and adolescents face a wide variety of physical illnesses that may impinge on their development and their emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and social functioning, that illnesses can range from acute acquired conditions to chronic congenital disorders, and that the ramifications affect not only the child or adolescent but also parents, significant caregivers, siblings, relatives, friends, and teachers.

### Parent's acceptance of advanced behavior management techniques on children during dental treatment [^116hRUkX]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Differences in the acceptance of ABMTs between parents of children with ASDs and their neurotypical peers emphasize the importance of understanding individual preferences and needs when implementing behavior management strategies. These findings can inform clinical practices and guide the development of personalized protocols that consider patients' preferences and needs. Moreover, they can be used to inform the development of targeted interventions that specifically address the determinants of parents' decision-making about dental care for their children, thereby improving access and quality of care. In addition, the consistency observed in parental attitudes towards different ABMTs suggests a coherent framework in parental decision-making. Communication strategies and clinical approaches that take into account shared preferences and trends among parents may facilitate the planning and implementation of dental care for uncooperative children, both with and without ASDs.

The present findings should be interpreted cautiously due to limitations, particularly sampling and response bias. The sample was recruited in two geographically restricted areas of Italy using a recruitment method that reached only parents attending a limited number of pediatric outpatient clinics and autism centers without randomization of the sample. Although efforts were made to ensure a fair representation of parents of neurotypical children and those with ASD, the sample may not be fully representative of a broader population of parents. Furthermore, response bias may have influenced the results, as parents who chose to participate in the survey may have stronger opinions on ABMTs or more experience with dental care than those who did not, thus influencing the results. Reliance on self-reported data is another possible limitation, as it may introduce recall or social desirability biases.

### International consensus statement on the diagnosis, multidisciplinary management and lifelong care of individuals with achondroplasia [^114FkNg5]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Achondroplasia — psychosocial issues, family perspectives and support — more than 80% of individuals born with achondroplasia are part of average height families, and meetings with other families and support and advocacy groups can provide additional support. The diagnosis of achondroplasia is associated with varying degrees of psychosocial impact on the individual, the parents and the whole family, and cultural diversity and family dynamics should be taken into consideration to tailor appropriate support for those affected directly or indirectly by achondroplasia. Individuals with achondroplasia can face physical and emotional hurdles across their lifespan and so should be offered or signposted to psychosocial support when needed, which can help to develop coping strategies and improve quality of life. Facing social stigmatization can have a negative emotional impact on the lives of individuals with achondroplasia and on their families, and they all should be offered psychosocial support with open and effective communication. Young individuals with achondroplasia should be offered specific follow-up appointments at the time of transition from paediatric to adult health care to facilitate this change and discuss long-term health-care management. Practical, psychosocial and personal needs should be considered and assessed before any changing situation in the educational and professional life of an individual with achondroplasia. Siblings of a child with achondroplasia should be offered informative, psychological and emotional support, and starting from diagnosis health-care professionals should provide the family with prompt communication, comprehensive guidance and support throughout life. Understanding the needs and assessing the quality of life of individuals with achondroplasia should be key actions of health-care professionals, and the medical care of children and adults with achondroplasia should be multidisciplinary, with social and psychological support offered to families.

### Timeline of amelogenesis imperfecta management [^111JgSWC]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Dental care for AI patients is challenging and requires a thorough, multidisciplinary approach based on an accurate diagnosis. Genetic diagnosis may exclude or confirm a syndromic condition such as Enamel Renal Syndrome or Jalili syndrome, among many others. Early diagnosis and substantial, intensive treatment over several sessions are required, particularly for individuals diagnosed at a young age. In addition, patients require psychological support, especially during puberty, to help them develop a coping mechanism for managing their condition. Several variables, including clinical complaints, psychological issues, and restorative difficulties, influence the diagnosis and therapy of AI. Parents also recognize the need for ongoing care and the unpredictability of upcoming therapies. They are aware that untreated dental appearance can make the child more vulnerable to social stigmatization, complicating the management of the condition.

The patient's age will also affect the course of treatment and follow-up. Early diagnosis is crucial for preserving tooth structures and occlusal relationships. The therapy involves restorative procedures and preventive care, including stainless-steel crowns on the posterior teeth during the primary dentition. Long-term temporary treatment is necessary for the mixed dentition to address hypersensitivity, tooth structure loss, preservation of OVD and esthetics preservation. The treatment plan typically focuses on orthodontic and prosthetic rehabilitation. Early dental treatment provides optimal conditions for the eruption of permanent teeth and normal growth of facial bones.

The treatment goals in the permanent dentition are to restore OVD, function, and esthetics while also reducing tooth sensitivity. At this point, a multidisciplinary strategy including orthodontic, periodontal, restorative, endodontic, and prosthodontic therapy is recommended. Placing definitive prosthetic restorations such as veneers or crowns is the advised long-term treatment strategy for individuals with AI since early adolescence. In addition, adolescent prosthetic rehabilitation has shown to be more economical than delaying final treatment. Optimal periodontal health and proper oral hygiene should also be considered to avoid the destruction of erupted teeth in both dentitions by carious lesions and periodontal disease.

### Providing psychosocial support to children and families in the aftermath of disasters and crises [^116NNmsh]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Disasters have the potential to cause short- and long-term effects on the psychological functioning, emotional adjustment, health, and developmental trajectory of children. This clinical report provides practical suggestions on how to identify common adjustment difficulties in children in the aftermath of a disaster and to promote effective coping strategies to mitigate the impact of the disaster as well as any associated bereavement and secondary stressors. This information can serve as a guide to pediatricians as they offer anticipatory guidance to families or consultation to schools, child care centers, and other child congregate care sites. Knowledge of risk factors for adjustment difficulties can serve as the basis for mental health triage. The importance of basic supportive services, psychological first aid, and professional self-care are discussed. Stress is intrinsic to many major life events that children and families face, including the experience of significant illness and its treatment. The information provided in this clinical report may, therefore, be relevant for a broad range of patient encounters, even outside the context of a disaster. Most pediatricians enter the profession because of a heartfelt desire to help children and families most in need. If adequately prepared and supported, pediatricians who are able to draw on their skills to assist children, families, and communities to recover after a disaster will find the work to be particularly rewarding.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic management of acute dental pain in children: a report from the American dental association science and research institute, the university of Pittsburgh school of dental medicine, and the center for integrative global oral health at the university of Pennsylvania [^114j9huQ]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Good practice statements for managing postoperative dental pain in children: The guideline panel advises clinicians to assess children's pain with age-appropriate tools, for example a faces scale (≥ 3 years), a numerical rating scale (≥ 8 years), a visual analog scale (≥ 8 years), or a behavioral scale (1–3 years). The guideline panel advises clinicians to counsel patients and their caregivers about expected pain and to discuss prior experiences, preferences, and values before prescribing. The guideline panel recommends clinicians thoroughly review medical and social histories and medications and supplements to avoid overdose and adverse drug-drug interactions. According to the FDA, codeine and tramadol are contraindicated in children younger than 12 years. When defining dosages, weight should be the primary directive as opposed to age.

### Supporting the family after the death of a child or adolescent [^116hEov2]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Whether death occurs in the context of a chronic illness or as the sudden loss of a previously healthy infant, child, or adolescent, the death of a child is a highly stressful and traumatic event. Psychosocial support for families after the death of a child embodies core medical values of professional fidelity, compassion, respect for human dignity, and promotion of the best interests of a grieving family. The pediatrician has an important role in supporting the family unit after the death of a child through a family-centered, culturally humble, trauma-informed approach. This clinical report aims to provide the pediatrician with a review of the current evidence on grief, bereavement, and mourning after the loss of a child and with practical guidance to support family caregivers, siblings, and the child's community. Pediatricians have an important role in helping siblings and helping families understand sibling needs during grief. Ways for pediatricians to support family members with cultural sensitivity are suggested and other helpful resources in the community are described.

### Palliative care best practices guidelines [^115XAeww]. ACS (2017). Medium credibility.

Special considerations for pediatric patients — palliative care for the pediatric patient differs from care for adult patients, yet in spite of these differences, the goals of care and palliative care needs of children are similar to those of adults. In general, decision-making falls to the legal guardian of the child unless legal documentation (court orders) or the legal guardian states otherwise, and decision-making for older children and adolescents must include, as much as possible, the assent of the patient as well as the participation of the parents and the physician; of note, the age of minor consent for medical treatment varies by state. Additionally, bereavement care for the family, including siblings, poses unique challenges, and some specific differences include a clear and definite need for outside referrals for child life services and pediatric palliative care specialists. Hospice agencies are valuable resources to children, families, and care providers because they can provide 24-hour availability for in-home assessment and management; psychosocial, spiritual, and decision-making support for the child and family; and grief and bereavement care for the family after the child dies.

### Puppet play therapy in emergency pediatric dental clinic. A randomized clinical trial [^117Fb9c5]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Dental fear and anxiety can significantly hinder the treatment of children. The aim of this research is to compare the effect of puppet play therapy (PPT) and tell-show-do (TSD) behavior guidance technique on child's behavior and anxiety in emergency dental clinics during local anesthesia (LA) administration.

Methods

This randomized clinical trial included 50 children aged 3–6 years in need of emergency dental treatment under LA. The subjects were randomized into 2 equal groups: the PPT group, where behavior management was provided using PPT, and the TSD group where TSD was used as the behavior guidance technique. Dental anxiety levels were evaluated using the Facial Index Scale (FIS) and Venham Anxiety Rating Scale. Pulse rates were measured before, during and after anesthesia administration. Patient behavior was also scored using the Frankl Behavior Rating Scale and Venham Behavior Rating Scale. The Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale was used to assess pain.

Results

The mean heart rates were lower for patients who received PPT (94.12 ± 15.71; 106.88 ± 12.67 and 103.16 ± 13.6) compared to TSD (103.4 ± 20.94, 112.5 ± 23.17 and 111.48 ± 25.07) before, during and after the LA, respectively. Anxiety levels measured by FIS were significantly reduced using PPT (p < 0.001) compared to TSD.

Conclusions

This study presents a behavior modification method demonstrating efficacy in reducing anxiety among young children who had no previous dental exposure and underwent immediate invasive dental procedures, utilizing puppet play therapy.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Good practice statements for pain assessment and counseling — The guideline panel advises clinicians to assess children's pain using suitable tools for their ages, for example a Faces scale (≥ 3 years), a numerical rating scale (≥ 8 years), a visual analog scale (≥ 8 years), or a behavioral scale (aged 1–3 years), and advises clinicians to counsel patients and their caregivers that they should expect some pain and the analgesics should make their pain manageable while discussing past experiences, preferences, and values before prescribing. The guideline panel reminds users that these recommendations only apply when definitive dental treatment is not immediately available and that these pharmacologic strategies will alleviate dental pain temporarily until a referral for definitive dental treatment is in place, recommends clinicians thoroughly review the patient medical and social history and medications and supplements to avoid overdose and adverse drug-drug interactions, and notes that when determining dosage, weight should be the primary directive as opposed to age; patients or their caregivers should be instructed to call if their pain fails to lessen over time or if referral to definitive dental treatment within 2 through 3 days is not possible.

### Community-based interventions for the prevention or management of dental caries in children [^116R4wNY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

We will include any intervention that aims to prevent or manage dental caries in children and is delivered in a community setting (i.e. not in a traditional dental clinic). We will not restrict eligibility by delivery, dose, duration, or intensity of the intervention. Interventions included in this review are likely to be diverse; Table 1 categorises the intervention types and details their components by mechanism of action. Studies will be eligible if they compare at least one of the intervention components with the comparator 'no intervention/placebo', or with another intervention component. For multi‐component interventions, we will assume that each child received all components given to the group to which they were randomised.

1
Intervention types, components, and mechanisms of action

For the purposes of this review, we define community‐based interventions as those that aim to improve or maintain the oral health of children living within the specified community. Communities may be defined by any shared characteristics that tie them together, including but not limited to area of residence, membership of a community asset (e.g. school), socioeconomic status, ethnicity, or religious status. We will include interventions delivered in a community setting; for example, schools, nurseries, residential facilities, or in people's homes. Community settings can be broadly defined as any non‐traditional medical or dental setting, and may include mobile clinics. The interventions may be delivered to an individual participant or to a group of participants, in a single session or multiple sessions. The intervention may be delivered by a dental health professional, a general health professional, an education professional, or any other person that has been charged to deliver the intervention. We will include complex interventions (i.e. including more than one component) as well as single component interventions. We consider complex interventions to comprise multiple components or target more than one behaviour, or both. These components may aim to address the prevention or management of caries in different but complementary ways.

### How I approach expressing condolences and longitudinal remembering to a family after the death of a child [^115xTHQ5]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Bereaved families fear their child being forgotten by those who knew their loved child, including their child's oncology team. Thoughtfully timed, family-centric condolences shared by pediatric oncology team members have the potential to extend our compassion and kindness toward a family during the darkness of grief. Well-intended medical teams sometimes feel "at a loss" in terms of what to say to a grieving family and how or when to say it. This paper provides a tangible overview of written or verbal condolence communication in a format that can be personalized to the provider and the patient's family.

Acute dental pain in children — values and preferences show that the panel did not identify direct evidence addressing children's or caregivers' values and preferences when managing acute dental pain, and indirect evidence suggests that parents or guardians may have a relatively high threshold for preferring an opioid (threshold in the Faces pain scale of 7.5 of 10); it is the panel's opinion that there may be some variability in the perceived pain threshold at which parents or guardians would decide that an opioid (or intervention with high risk of adverse effects) is acceptable.

### Attachment theory… [^112XvsAc]. Wikipedia (2025). Medium credibility.

Pivotal aspects of attachment theory include the observation that infants seek proximity to attachment figures, especially during stressful situations. Secure attachments are formed when caregivers are sensitive and responsive in social interactions, and consistently present, particularly between the ages of six months and two years. As children grow, they use these attachment figures as a secure base from which to explore the world and return to for comfort. The interactions with caregivers form patterns of attachment, which in turn create internal working models that influence future relationships. Separation anxiety or grief following the loss of an attachment figure is considered to be a normal and adaptive response for an attached infant. The presence of a supportive attachment figure is especially important in a child's developmental years. In addition to support, attunement is crucial in a caregiver-child relationship.

If the caregiver is poorly attuned to the child, the child may grow to feel misunderstood and anxious. Infants form attachments to. Some infants direct attachment behaviour towards more than one attachment figure almost as soon as they start to show discrimination between caregivers; most come to do so during their second year. These figures are arranged hierarchically, with the principal attachment figure at the top. The set-goal of the attachment behavioural system is to maintain a bond with an accessible and available attachment figure. Behaviours The attachment behavioural system serves to achieve or maintain proximity to the attachment figure. Pre-attachment behaviours occur in the first six months of life. During the first phase, infants smile, babble, and cry to attract the attention of potential caregivers. Although infants of this age learn to discriminate between caregivers, these behaviours are directed at anyone in the vicinity.

During the second phase, the infant discriminates between familiar and unfamiliar adults, becoming more responsive toward the caregiver; following and clinging are added to the range of behaviours. The infant's behaviour toward the caregiver becomes organized on a goal-directed basis to achieve the conditions that make it feel secure. By the end of the first year, the infant is able to display a range of attachment behaviours designed to maintain proximity. These manifest as protesting the caregiver's departure, greeting the caregiver's return, clinging when frightened, and following when able. After the second year, as the child begins to see the caregiver as an independent person, a more complex and goal-corrected partnership is formed. Children begin to notice others' goals and feelings and plan their actions accordingly.

Building on this foundation, Main and Solomon extended the original attachment classification to identify a disorganized/disoriented attachment style. They observed infants displaying contradictory or confused behaviors when reunited with a caregiver. This further complicated the understanding of attachment patterning and has informed both clinical practice and developmental research. The child is generally ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy is a response to unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger or helplessness towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction. Perhaps the most conspicuous characteristic of C2 infants is their passivity.

### Management of dental trauma in a primary care setting [^111Q97K9]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and its Section on Oral Health have developed this clinical report for pediatricians and primary care physicians regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of dental trauma in children aged 1 to 21 years. This report was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical and dental literature and expert consensus. Guidelines published and updated by the International Association of Dental Traumatology (www.dentaltraumaguide.com) are an excellent resource for both dental and nondental health care providers.

### Coping with death [^116sURDN]. Pediatrics in Review (2009). Low credibility.

Children's concept of death is influenced by experience, culture, and developmental stage. Dying children benefit from open communication about death, based on research findings and clinical experience (summarized in Hurwitz, 2004). Everyone in the family is affected by the loss of a loved one, even the youngest family members. Pediatricians can help families by listening and supporting them during the processes of loss and bereavement.

### The impact of losing a child on the clinical presentation of complicated grief [^112d47LD]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether bereaved parents with Complicated Grief (CG) struggle with their grief differently than others with CG. This study addressed this question by comparing CG severity, CG-related symptoms, thoughts and behaviors, and comorbid psychiatric diagnoses of bereaved parents with CG to the diagnoses and symptoms of others with CG.

Methods

Baseline data from 345 participants enrolled in the Healing Emotions After Loss (HEAL) study, a multi-site CG treatment study, were used to compare parents with CG (n = 75) to others with CG (n = 275). Data from the parent group was then used to compare parents with CG who had lost a younger child (n = 24) to parents with CG who had lost an older child (n = 34). Demographic and loss-related data were also gathered and used to control for confounders between groups.

Results

Parents with CG demonstrated slightly higher levels of CG (p = 0.025), caregiver self-blame (p = 0.007), and suicidality (p = 0.025) than non-parents with CG. Parents who had lost younger children were more likely to have had a wish to be dead since the loss than parents who had lost older children (p = 0.041).

Limitations

All data were gathered from a treatment research study, limiting the generalizability of these results. No corrections were made for multiple comparisons. The comparison of parents who lost younger children to parents who lost older children was limited by a small sample size.

Conclusions

Even in the context of CG, the relationship to the deceased may have a bearing on the degree and severity of grief symptoms and associated features. Bereaved parents with CG reported more intense CG, self-blame, and suicidality than other bereaved groups with CG, though this finding requires confirmation. The heightened levels of suicidal ideation experienced by parents with CG, especially after losing a younger child, suggest the value of routinely screening for suicidal thoughts and behaviors in this group.

### Practice parameter for the psychiatric assessment and management of physically ill children and adolescents [^112ChUNY]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Procedural support and play interventions for physically ill children — Local anesthesia (e.g., lidocaine-prilocaine cream; EMLA) should be used for needle procedures, and parental presence is generally helpful when they are able to assist with nonprocedural talk, humor, distraction, and encouragement. Play can provide a medium to address reactions related to medical procedures, treatments, or hospitalization, and the clinician's tools might include toy replicas or the actual medical equipment. When a child is hospitalized, the common responses of anxiety, fear, and pain are superseded upon home separation from the family and loss of the familiar daily routine, and the comfort of transitional objects, parents staying overnight, and sibling visits can mitigate some of a child's distress.

### Supporting the grieving child and family [^111FULj5]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The death of someone close to a child often has a profound and lifelong effect on the child and results in a range of both short- and long-term reactions. Pediatricians, within a patient-centered medical home, are in an excellent position to provide anticipatory guidance to caregivers and to offer assistance and support to children and families who are grieving. This clinical report offers practical suggestions on how to talk with grieving children to help them better understand what has happened and its implications and to address any misinformation, misinterpretations, or misconceptions. An understanding of guilt, shame, and other common reactions, as well an appreciation of the role of secondary losses and the unique challenges facing children in communities characterized by chronic trauma and cumulative loss, will help the pediatrician to address factors that may impair grieving and children's adjustment and to identify complicated mourning and situations when professional counseling is indicated. Advice on how to support children's participation in funerals and other memorial services and to anticipate and address grief triggers and anniversary reactions is provided so that pediatricians are in a better position to advise caregivers and to offer consultation to schools, early education and child care facilities, and other child congregate care sites. Pediatricians often enter their profession out of a profound desire to minimize the suffering of children and may find it personally challenging when they find themselves in situations in which they are asked to bear witness to the distress of children who are acutely grieving. The importance of professional preparation and self-care is therefore emphasized, and resources are recommended.

### Child bereavement-what matters to the families. part 1: immediate and short-term communication and care [^113YE6Xh]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2024). Medium credibility.

The death of a child is a complex and hugely significant time for a family and community. Sophisticated but sensitive management by clinicians can have both short-term and long-term impacts on how families process the death. There is a paucity of guidance for optimal child bereavement care. A description of the child death review process including key legalities is provided here, and other essential aspects such as memory making, cultural aspects and sibling involvement are explored. Useful agencies and resources are also detailed. We, as both clinicians and bereaved parents, can uniquely provide an overview of the logistics of managing such a challenging event and highlight important subtleties in communication. We attempt, using our own experiences, to provide a framework and best inform future practice.

### Supporting the grieving child and family: clinical report [^114DHc6a]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The death of someone close to a child often has a profound and lifelong effect on the child and results in a range of both short- and long-term reactions. Pediatricians, within a patient-centered medical home, are in an excellent position to provide guidance to caregivers and to offer assistance and support to grieving children of all ages and their families. This clinical report offers practical suggestions on how to talk with grieving children to help them better understand what has happened and its implications. An understanding of guilt, shame, and other common reactions as well as an appreciation of the role of secondary losses and the unique challenges facing children in communities characterized by chronic trauma and cumulative loss will help the pediatrician to address factors that may impair children's adjustment and to identify complicated mourning and situations when professional counseling is indicated.

### Parent's acceptance of advanced behavior management techniques on children during dental treatment [^115zyPgz]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Although protective stabilization is an effective technique to carry out noninvasive and minimally invasive treatments in uncooperative children, its ethical implications continue to be scrutinized. In the present survey, protective stabilization resulted in a less acceptable technique, especially among parents of neurotypical children. On the one hand, protective stabilization helps minimize the risk of injury to the child and dental staff, ensuring that necessary dental procedures can be completed effectively. Still, on the other side, some parents may express concerns about its potential psychological impact and violation of the child's autonomy. Parents may fear that restraining their children could exacerbate their anxiety and lead to negative associations with dental care, ultimately hindering their long-term oral health outcomes. Dentists must communicate effectively with parents, explaining the rationale behind the use of protective stabilization, its potential benefits, and any available alternatives. In addition, dentists should strive to create a supportive and compassionate environment in which parents feel empowered to express their concerns and actively participate not only in the decision-making process but, if available, in the act of restraint itself to reassure the child with their presence. Moreover, restraint should occur whenever possible after the child has been prepared to familiarize them with the dental environment's people, instruments, noises, and smells. This preparation makes children less anxious and parents more likely to accept a restraint strategy. Nevertheless, research is needed to evaluate protective stabilization's long-term outcomes and ethical implications.

The results of this study provide dentists with helpful information to improve their clinical practice when treating uncooperative children, especially those with ASD. Improving parents' knowledge and understanding of ABMTs enables them to choose the most accepted method under the practitioner's guidance and thus to face more awareness of their children's dental care. This goal can be achieved with educational materials, pre-visit consultations, and clear and effective communication. Training dental staff is also essential; to improve the quality of care and meet the needs of each child and family, the dental team should receive specific training on managing uncooperative children and children with ASDs, including in-depth knowledge of all ABMTs.

Only by addressing the concerns of parents and dental professionals and by promoting open communication and shared decision-making can the dental community work towards providing safe, effective, and patient-centered care for uncooperative children needing dental treatment.

Data extraction and management

Two review authors, independently and in duplicate, will extract study characteristics and quantitative data from each included study using a data extraction form in Covidence, which we will initially pilot on a small sample of studies (10% of the included studies). We will contact study authors by email for clarification or to request missing data where necessary and feasible. If translation is required, we will first use Google Translate, or otherwise seek advice from a native speaker. We will resolve any disagreements through discussion, consulting a third review author to achieve consensus when necessary.

We will record the following information for each included study.

Study characteristics: study design, study dates, comparison group.
Participants: inclusion/exclusion criteria, recruitment centre and country, number randomised to groups, number of losses and number analysed at follow‐up, baseline characteristics of clusters and participants in each group (to include PROGRESS‐Plus characteristics, and caries using decayed, missing, or filled teeth (d(m)ft or D(M)FT for primary or permanent dentition, respectively)). For cluster‐RCTs, we will also extract the number of clusters allocated to each trial arm, the mean cluster size, and intra‐cluster correlation coefficient (ICC).
Interventions: details of intervention (to include intervention components, location of delivery, personnel involved in delivery, and person(s) to whom intervention is delivered, mode of delivery, number of sessions/doses or duration of delivery); details of comparator intervention (as applicable).
Outcomes: review outcomes (to include measurement tool and time point of measurement), quantitative outcome data for outcomes listed in Outcome measures (e.g. mean d(m)ft/D(M)FT per trial arm, and total number analysed per trial arm); other outcomes reported by study authors.
Other: funding sources and study author declarations of interest; study registration details; and other relevant study information.

### Puppet play therapy in emergency pediatric dental clinic. A randomized clinical trial [^112Lz2u4]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A child's emotions and reactions to the dental clinic significantly affect their treatment outcomes and future oral health care, especially in emergency dental conditions requiring local anesthesia (LA) without previous dental management. These challenges may be addressed through various interventions, including psychotherapeutic or pharmacological approaches. Psychotherapeutic interventions are often suitable for children with mild to moderate anxiety and fear, providing cost-effective and easily implementable solutions directly within the dental clinic.

Among the gold standard techniques for behavioral guidance in dental settings is the tell-show-do (TSD). However, its effectiveness may diminish, particularly if patient had dental pain or during procedures involving local anesthesia. Thus, there is a need to introduce a method that allows communication, improves understanding, and overcomes the limitations of conventional TSD.

Puppets have been applied in the medical field to engage and support pediatric patients, drawing from developmental theories such as Erikson's Theory of Psychosocial Development and Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development. Puppet play therapy (PPT) draws from Erikson's Theory of Psychosocial Development (1963). Studies done on puppet modeling in the medical field include Shapiro in 1995 for use in settling a child experiencing insomnia caused by fear due to treatment. Moore in 2015 used puppet modeling on young children who attended the burn clinic to prepare for their first dressing change.

Although puppet play therapy in the medical field is well established, its use in pediatric dentistry is absent in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this research was to assess PPT as a behavior management technique for children receiving emergency dental treatment compared to TSD.

### Management of the uncooperative child [^114cQvzC]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The management of a child who requires a medical procedure is a challenging issue for the oral and maxillofacial surgeon (OMS) and practitioners in the dental specialties. The office of the OMS is traditionally one in which short outpatient procedures are performed within brief appointment times often using only local anesthesia. For typical children, this brief procedure may be difficult, and for children with behavioral challenges, it may be impossible without the use of behavioral management techniques or pharmacologic modalities. Practitioners must be aware of current trends in pediatric mental health and should develop treatment protocols to avoid complications.

Conversely, in the TSD group, the dentist directly interacted with the child, explaining the treatment using simple language and demonstrating how to cooperate with the dentist.

After the behavior technique was conducted, The Gibson heart rate monitor (MEDTECH ® USA) was placed on the child's index finger, and the dental assistant commenced video recording the session from a fixed spot in the clinic that clearly shows the child. Topical anesthesia was applied after drying the mucosa with a cotton roll, using 20% Benzocaine gel for 2 min. Subsequently, Cook-Waite Lidocaine 2% Lidocaine with 1: 100,000 epinephrine LA was administered at the injection site using a short-gauge needle. For the upper arch, buccal infiltration was performed, and for the lower arch, inferior alveolar nerve block technique was employed. Immediately after anesthesia administration, the subject was placed in an upright position, and the child's self-reported anxiety was measured using the Facial Index Scale (FIS). The videos were sent to two blinded collaborated evaluators for assessing the child's behavior and anxiety during the procedure. Figure 2 lists the study methodology steps.
