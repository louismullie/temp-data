## Question

Extra pyramidal reactions

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about extrapyramidal reactions (EPRs), including their definitions, mechanisms, risk factors, clinical phenotypes, differential diagnosis, management, prevention, and considerations for special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining EPRs and their core pathophysiology. Then, I should classify the clinical syndromes and their time course. Next, I will examine dose–response and receptor occupancy data, followed by patient-specific and drug-specific risk factors. After that, I should review differential diagnoses and monitoring tools. Then, I will outline acute and chronic management strategies, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options. Finally, I will consider special populations and prevention, and close with a concise clinical takeaway that integrates the evidence hierarchy and practical steps for care.

> Let me first confirm the definition and core mechanism. Extrapyramidal reactions are drug-induced movement disorders caused predominantly by dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway, disrupting motor control circuits and producing parkinsonism, dystonia, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. This mechanism explains why antipsychotics and dopamine-blocking antiemetics are frequent culprits, and why the risk rises with higher D2 occupancy beyond roughly 75–85% in many agents, though partial agonists behave differently due to retained intrinsic activity [^111EaoTy] [^116JCpm3] [^111ubBSy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "class effects" without distinguishing syndromes and time course. I should classify EPRs into acute (hours to days: dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism), subacute/chronic (weeks to months: persistent parkinsonism, akathisia), and tardive (months to years: tardive dyskinesia/dystonia), because this classification guides urgency, treatment, and prognosis. Dystonia and parkinsonism often respond to anticholinergics or dose reduction, akathisia typically does not respond to anticholinergics, and tardive syndromes may persist despite drug withdrawal and require specific therapies [^111XS5dZ] [^115hVpvs].

> I need to check dose–response and receptor occupancy thresholds carefully. Systematic dose–response meta-analyses show that EPS risk increases with antipsychotic dose across most agents, with notable exceptions such as quetiapine and sertindole showing negligible EPS even at higher doses; for haloperidol, the risk escalates substantially with higher daily doses, whereas aripiprazole shows a relatively flat EPS curve despite high D2 occupancy due to partial agonism, underscoring that pharmacologic class and intrinsic activity modulate risk beyond raw occupancy [^111KdxvU] [^115fAgYP] [^111ubBSy] [^116uEjLf].

> Next, I should review patient-specific risk factors. Younger age and male sex increase risk for acute dystonia. Older age and longer illness duration elevate risk for parkinsonism and tardive phenomena. Prior antipsychotic exposure and poor premorbid functioning also correlate with EPS in first-episode cohorts. Genetic susceptibility contributes meaningfully, with heritability estimates around 0.60–0.80, though no single pharmacogenetic marker is definitive for clinical use yet [^1128jzpJ] [^1128AuPu] [^114yvm2d] [^115hVpvs] [^115muzmx].

> Let me consider drug-specific factors next. High-potency first-generation antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine) carry higher EPS liability than lower-potency agents, and second-generation antipsychotics generally reduce but do not eliminate risk; among SGAs, quetiapine and clozapine have the lowest EPS propensity, while risperidone, paliperidone, and ziprasidone have intermediate risk, and partial agonists like aripiprazole have low EPS risk but a meaningful akathisia signal; rapid titration and high D2 antagonism increase risk, and drug interactions that raise antipsychotic levels (e.g. CYP2D6/3A4 inhibition) can precipitate EPS [^116Z5PSn] [^111KdxvU] [^111ubBSy] [^116DwPkn].

> Wait, let me verify the differential diagnosis so I don't anchor on medication effects alone. I should distinguish EPRs from primary movement disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease, Wilson's disease), seizure-related movements, serotonin syndrome, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and withdrawal-emergent dyskinesias. Standardized scales such as ESRS, SAS, BARS, and AIMS improve detection and longitudinal monitoring, and I should remember that EPS can be misattributed to psychiatric symptoms, so structured assessments are essential [^116kmHsX] [^111XS5dZ] [^113gLxW3].

> I will now examine acute management principles. For acute dystonia, immediate parenteral anticholinergics (benztropine 1–2 mg IV/IM or diphenhydramine 25–50 mg IV/IM) are standard, with oral continuation for 2–3 days to prevent recurrence. For drug-induced parkinsonism, dose reduction, switching to a lower-EPS agent, and short-term anticholinergics are reasonable. For akathisia, dose reduction, switching, and adjuncts such as beta-blockers or benzodiazepines are preferred since anticholinergics are typically ineffective. For tardive dyskinesia, first-line options include VMAT2 inhibitors (valbenazine, deutetrabenazine) and switching to clozapine when feasible, with anticholinergics avoided for TD except in select tardive dystonia cases [^111br1kg] [^117LaAjs].

> Hold on, I should verify supportive and preventive strategies too. Patient education about early signs, scheduled monitoring with standardized scales, minimizing antipsychotic dose to the lowest effective level, and avoiding anticholinergic polypharmacy when possible reduce burden; when EPS emerge, consider switching to lower-EPS agents (quetiapine, clozapine, or aripiprazole with close monitoring for akathisia), and in high-risk patients (young males, prior dystonia), consider short-term prophylactic anticholinergics at initiation with prompt taper, reassessing need within 1–2 weeks [^112LstVa] [^1123h3D1].

> Let me think about special populations because risk and thresholds differ. In children and adolescents, EPS risk is higher and prophylactic anticholinergics may be justified in selected cases. In older adults, especially those with dementia or Lewy body pathology, antipsychotics can provoke severe EPS, parkinsonism, and even NMS, so use the lowest effective dose, prefer quetiapine or clozapine, and plan time-limited trials with discontinuation if no clear benefit. In pregnancy, limited data suggest increased dystonia risk with dopamine blockers, warranting cautious use and close monitoring [^112LstVa] [^113kLvMe] [^113QKVfc] [^111561ds].

> But wait, what if the culprit is not an antipsychotic? I should double-check for non-antipsychotic dopamine blockers such as metoclopramide and prochlorperazine, which can cause acute dystonia, parkinsonism, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia; risk is higher in younger patients, with higher doses, and with rapid IV administration, and management mirrors antipsychotic-induced EPS with anticholinergics for dystonia and dose reduction or discontinuation for persistent symptoms [^116JCpm3] [^1114Z5XL] [^113QFbgw].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy to ensure my recommendations align with the best data. High-quality evidence supports the EPS advantage of SGAs over haloperidol at conventional doses, with dose of the comparator FGA explaining much heterogeneity; large meta-analyses and dose–response studies corroborate dose-related EPS risk across agents, while real-world cohorts highlight persistent prevalence and the need for routine screening; mechanistic work links association kinetics at D2 to EPS liability, though exceptions exist due to polypharmacology and partial agonism [^113Xu5ho] [^116Z5PSn] [^111KdxvU] [^113gLxW3] [^111y3Gp1].

> In summary, I need to ensure a practical clinical takeaway. EPRs are common, dose-related, and mechanistically tied to D2 blockade, but risk is modulated by drug choice, pharmacologic class, and patient factors. Screen systematically, treat acute dystonia and parkinsonism promptly with anticholinergics and dose optimization, manage akathisia with dose changes and non-anticholinergic adjuncts, and address tardive syndromes with VMAT2 inhibitors and agent switching. Prevention hinges on using the lowest effective dose, preferring lower-EPS agents in high-risk patients, and reassessing anticholinergic use early to minimize cumulative burden [^111EaoTy] [^1123h3D1] [^1138CNru] [^111KdxvU].

Extrapyramidal reactions are **drug-induced movement disorders** caused by dopamine D2 blockade in the basal ganglia [^111y3Gp1], most often with antipsychotics and antiemetics [^111EaoTy] [^116JCpm3]. They present as acute dystonia, parkinsonism, akathisia, or tardive dyskinesia [^111XS5dZ], with risk rising with higher D2 occupancy and higher doses [^111KdxvU] [^115jidZz]. Management is **dose reduction or switching** to lower-EPS agents [^1138CNru], plus **anticholinergics or benzodiazepines** for acute symptoms [^1123h3D1]; **preventive strategies** include using the lowest effective dose, avoiding polypharmacy, and monitoring with standardized scales [^116kmHsX] [^113gLxW3].

## Clinical manifestations

Extrapyramidal reactions are **classified by onset and features**:

| **Type** | **Onset** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute dystonia | Hours to days | - Sustained muscle contractions <br/> - Spasms <br/> - Oculogyric crisis <br/> - Torticollis <br/> - Laryngospasm [^1157F9EF] [^116JCpm3] |
| Parkinsonism | Days to weeks | - Bradykinesia <br/> - Rigidity <br/> - Tremor <br/> - Masked facies <br/> - Shuffling gait [^116JCpm3] |
| Akathisia | Days to weeks | - Subjective restlessness <br/> - Inability to sit still <br/> - Anxiety <br/> - Insomnia [^116JCpm3] |
| Tardive dyskinesia | Months to years | - Involuntary choreoathetoid movements <br/> - Facial grimacing <br/> - Tongue protrusion <br/> - Lip smacking [^notfound] |

---

## Pathophysiology

The **primary mechanism** is dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway [^111y3Gp1], disrupting motor control and causing EPS [^111EaoTy]. Additional contributions come from serotonergic, cholinergic, and noradrenergic modulation [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors **increase EPS risk**:

- **Medication-related factors**: High-potency first-generation antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, fluphenazine) [^1157F9EF], higher doses [^111KdxvU], rapid titration, and polypharmacy [^112bqY6P].
- **Patient-related factors**: Younger age, male sex, genetic predisposition, and pre-existing neurological disorders [^111ktEDW] [^115hVpvs].
- **Clinical factors**: Longer treatment duration, previous EPS, and comorbid psychiatric conditions [^117K4upv].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management **requires a multifaceted approach**:

- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce dose or switch to lower-EPS agents (e.g. quetiapine, clozapine, aripiprazole) [^1138CNru] [^111KdxvU].
- **Pharmacological interventions**: Anticholinergics (benztropine, diphenhydramine) for acute dystonia/parkinsonism [^1123h3D1]; benzodiazepines or beta-blockers for akathisia [^notfound]; VMAT2 inhibitors for tardive dyskinesia [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Regular use of standardized scales (ESRS, SAS, BARS, AIMS) to detect and track EPS [^116kmHsX] [^113gLxW3].
- **Preventive measures**: Use the lowest effective dose, avoid polypharmacy, and monitor closely, especially in high-risk patients [^111561ds] [^113gLxW3].

---

## Clinical implications

EPS **significantly affect patient care**, causing discomfort, functional impairment, and reduced adherence, which can worsen psychiatric outcomes [^111EaoTy] [^112bqY6P]. Persistent EPS can cause lasting disability and lower quality of life [^114JivbZ].

---

Extrapyramidal reactions are **preventable and manageable** with careful dosing, monitoring, and targeted therapy; **early recognition and intervention** are essential to minimize morbidity and maintain adherence.

### Study on risk factors of extrapyramidal symptoms induced by antipsychotics and its correlation with symptoms of schizophrenia [^112bqY6P]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are a serious adverse effect caused by excessive antagonism of D2 receptor of antipsychotics in the substantia nigra and striatum areas. EPS have great impact on the drug efficacy, drug compliance and social ability of patients with schizophrenia. Despite the lower incidence of EPS associated with the widespread of the usage of second generation antipsychotics (SGAs), EPS remain a clinically significant issue as its incidence rate remains substantial.

The risk factors for EPS are complicated and related to a lot of factors including demographics, antipsychotics use, and so forth. Previous studies have shown that gender (female), age (elder), high D2 receptor antagonism effect of antipsychotics, usage of first-generation antipsychotics, polytherapy of antipsychotics, longer duration of drug treatment, illness such as brain atrophy, diabetes and substance addiction, and genetic diversity are related to higher incidence of EPS. However, most of the research uses samples from foreign populations, and therefore the exploration of risk factors of EPS in Chinese patients with schizophrenia is warranted.

The relationships between symptoms of schizophrenia and EPS are complicated and remain to be explored. The study has shown that patients with schizophrenia with EPS often have more severe psychiatric symptoms (positive symptoms, negative symptoms, general psychopathology symptoms) and mood symptoms. These psychiatric symptoms along with mood symptoms are positively correlated with EPS symptoms. The outcomes of previous research indicate that patients with EPS may have worse treatment outcomes compared with those without EPS, which highlights the necessity of early detection of EPS. Whether this phenomenon exists in Chinese patients with schizophrenia remains unknown.

The aim of this study is to explore the risk factors of antipsychotic-induced EPS and their correlation with psychiatric symptoms and mood symptoms of Chinese patients with schizophrenia in the real world. We hypothesised that some demographical and drug-related risk factors of EPS will be found in this study, and the correlation between EPS and symptoms of schizophrenia exists in Chinese patients.

### Metoclopramide hydrochloride (Gimoti) [^1169x1ds]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

5.2 Other Extrapyramidal Symptoms

In addition to TD, metoclopramide may cause other extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), parkinsonian symptoms, and motor restlessness. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if such symptoms occur and to discontinue GIMOTI.

Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), such as acute dystonic reactions, occurred in patients treated with oral metoclopramide dosages of 30 mg to 40 mg daily. Such reactions occurred more frequently in adults less than 30 years of age and at higher than recommended dosages. EPS occurred more frequently in pediatric patients compared to adults (GIMOTI is not approved for use in pediatric patients). Symptoms can occur in the first 24 to 48 hours after starting metoclopramide. Symptoms included involuntary movements of limbs and facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, or dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Rarely, dystonic reactions were present as stridor and dyspnea, possibly due to laryngospasm. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride or benztropine mesylate may be used to treat these adverse reactions. Avoid GIMOTI in patients receiving other drugs that can cause EPS (e.g., antipsychotics).
Parkinsonian symptoms (bradykinesia, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, mask-like facies) have occurred after starting metoclopramide, more commonly within the first 6 months, but also after longer periods. Symptoms generally have subsided within 2 to 3 months after discontinuation of metoclopramide. Avoid GIMOTI in patients with Parkinson's disease and other patients being treated with antiparkinsonian drugs due to potential exacerbation of symptoms. Avoid treatment with metoclopramide (all dosage forms and routes of administration) for more than 12 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Motor restlessness (akathisia) has developed and consisted of feelings of anxiety, agitation, jitteriness, and insomnia, as well as inability to sit still, pacing, and foot tapping. Discontinue GIMOTI if these symptoms develop.

### Improving pharmacogenetic prediction of extrapyramidal symptoms induced by antipsychotics [^115hVpvs]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Antipsychotic (AP) medication is the gold standard in schizophrenia treatment. Although APs have demonstrated overall efficacy and safety there are large inter-individual differences in their efficacy and side effects between patients. Nowadays, treatment selection remains a "trial and error" process, with multiple failed trials required before an acceptable balance between response to therapy and side effects is reached. Finding this balance is especially important considering there is an estimated noncompliance rate of 40% to AP treatment. One of the strongest predictors of noncompliance is the experience of harmful side effects. Therefore, the identification of robust predictors of AP-induced side effects holds the potential to provide a rational basis for treatment selection.

Taking into account that much of the inter-individual variability in AP-induced side effects is due to genetic factors (estimated heritability, h², 0.60–0.80), a number of pharmacogenetic markers have been associated with AP side effects, although none is yet a definitive predictor of response.

Acute extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) induced by AP treatment, which may develop within a few days of initiating the treatment (in contrast to tardive dyskinesia, the late-onset EPS), are frequent and serious adverse reactions to AP drugs. Acute EPS constitutes a complex phenotype including several syndromes: akathisia; acute dystonia; and parkinsonism. Acute dystonia and parkinsonism respond to AP dose reduction and anticholinergic agents, whereas, akathisia does not respond to anticholinergic medication. Even though the exact mechanism underlying each of these different syndromes is not clear, excessive striatal dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) blockade is believed to be the common cause. Our understanding of the mechanism and the genetic factors accounting for AP-induced EPS is still evolving. In previous studies, our group developed a convergent functional genomics (CFG) approach to identify candidate genes for pharmacogenetic studies of EPS –. That strategy resulted in the identification of the mTOR pathway as a source of new candidate genes.

### Antipsychotic dose, dopamine D2 receptor occupancy and extrapyramidal side-effects: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^115fAgYP]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Last, it is suggested that long-acting injections may have a lower risk of EPS, yet there were no clear differences in our analyses, which was however based on sparse data for the different formulations.

Conclusion

This dose-response meta-analysis quantified the relationship between antipsychotic doses and the risk of EPS in schizophrenia. The risk of EPS increased with higher doses of antipsychotics, albeit with varying degrees across medications. Notably, quetiapine and sertindole exhibited no association with EPS even at high doses, and there were no usable data for clozapine.

The dose-response curves for antipsychotic-induced EPS, along with those for efficacy and other side-effects, can inform the decision-making about antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia. Nevertheless, participant characteristics that could influence dose-response relationships should be considered in the interpretation of the findings and their impact should be further elucidated in future research.

Furthermore, our analysis used clinical trial data to quantify the relationship between D 2 R occupancy and the risk of EPS, and provided additional insights into the current therapeutic window for EPS.

### Metoclopramide hydrochloride (Reglan) [^116JCpm3]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.2 Other Extrapyramidal Symptoms

In addition to TD, metoclopramide may cause other extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), parkinsonian symptoms, and motor restlessness. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if such symptoms occur and to discontinue Reglan.

Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), such as acute dystonic reactions, occurred in patients treated with metoclopramide dosages of 30 mg to 40 mg daily. Such reactions occurred more frequently in adults less than 30 years of age and at higher than recommended dosages. EPS occurred more frequently in pediatric patients compared to adults (Reglan is not approved for use in pediatric patients). Symptoms can occur in the first 24 to 48 hours after starting metoclopramide. Symptoms included involuntary movements of limbs and facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, or dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Rarely, dystonic reactions were present as stridor and dyspnea, possibly due to laryngospasm. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride or benztropine mesylate may be used to treat these adverse reactions. Avoid Reglan in patients receiving other drugs that can cause EPS (e.g., antipsychotics).
Parkinsonian symptoms (bradykinesia, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, mask-like facies) have occurred after starting metoclopramide, more commonly within the first 6 months, but also after longer periods. Symptoms generally have subsided within 2 to 3 months after discontinuation of Reglan. Avoid Reglan in patients with Parkinson's disease and other patients being treated with antiparkinsonian drugs due to potential exacerbation of symptoms. Avoid treatment with Reglan for more than 12 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Motor restlessness (akathisia) has developed and consisted of feelings of anxiety, agitation, jitteriness, and insomnia, as well as inability to sit still, pacing, and foot tapping. If symptoms resolve, consider restarting at a lower dosage.

### Study on risk factors of extrapyramidal symptoms induced by antipsychotics and its correlation with symptoms of schizophrenia [^115muzmx]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are one of the most common and neglected side effects during the treatment of schizophrenia. The risk factors of EPS in Chinese patients with schizophrenia and its relationship with psychiatric symptoms and mood symptoms of schizophrenia remain unknown.

Aims

The main objective of this study is to explore the risk factors of EPS caused by antipsychotics and the relationship between EPS and psychotic symptoms and mood symptoms of schizophrenia.

Method

This study included 679 patients with schizophrenia who have met the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition. Patients were divided into the EPS group and the non-EPS group according to the scale rating criteria and whether the anticholinergics have been used. The differences between demographic data and characters of drug intake were compared between the two groups, and the risk factors of EPS were selected between those factors. Correlation analysis was performed on the severity of schizophrenia (Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) score) and EPS scale (Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS), Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) score) in 679 patients. The differences between the PANSS subscale score and the CDSS score between the EPS group and the non-EPS group were compared.

Result

Compared with the non-EPS group, the EPS group patients are older, and they have a longer duration since first prescribed antipsychotics. The EPS group patients have higher frequency of atypical antipsychotics polytherapy and typical and atypical antipsychotics polytherapy or combined treatments with mood stabilisers. Logistic regression analysis shows that antipsychotics with high D2 receptor antagonistic effect and illness duration are the risk factors of EPS. The SAS score was significantly correlated with PANSS negative score, PANSS general psychopathological score and PANSS total score. The BARS scale score was significantly correlated with PANSS positive score, PANSS general psychopathological score, PANSS total score and CDSS total score. The AIMS scale score was significantly correlated with PANSS negative score. Compared with the non-EPS group, the EPS group patients have significantly higher PANSS negative score, PANSS general psychopathological score, PANSS total score and CDSS total score.

Conclusion

Antipsychotic drugs with high D2 receptor antagonism and disease duration are risk factors of EPS in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. The severity of various types of EPS is significantly correlated with the psychiatric and mood symptoms of schizophrenia, and psychiatric symptoms and mood symptoms were significantly more severe in the EPS group. The occurrence of EPS is associated with poor treatment outcome of schizophrenia.

### Extrapyramidal reactions to ondansetron: cross-reactivity between ondansetron and prochlorperazine? [^116TUNPt]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

Implications

Ondansetron can rarely induce extrapyramidal reactions in susceptible individuals. Our patient had a history of drug-induced dystonic reaction; therefore, these patients may be susceptible to extrapyramidal adverse reactions after ondansetron.

### Extrapyramidal symptoms following administration of oral perphenazine 4 or 8 mg: an 11-year retrospective analysis [^11775Ma9]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Perphenazine is a treatment option in postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis. Chronic administration and high dose are known to cause extrapyramidal system (EPS) dysfunction at a frequency of 8%, but the incidence of acute EPS after a single 4 or 8mg dose is unknown.

Objective

A retrospective analysis of patient medication billing data and departmental quality records was performed (January 2001 to 10 July 2012) to identify patients who experienced EPS dysfunction after oral perphenazine.

Design

A retrospective analysis.

Setting

Surgical outpatients presenting to any one of 10 hospitals in the area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.

Patients

Overall, 45766 patients received 4 or 8mg of perphenazine before same-day surgery.

Main Outcome Measures

EPS dysfunction was defined as acute dystonia, akathisia or pseudoparkinsonism. Records were reviewed to determine the likely number of reactions to perphenazine, the nature of these reactions and impact on patient care.

Results

There were four 'likely' cases of EPS dysfunction, and two 'possible' cases. Five reported events were consistent with akathisia, with the sixth being a dystonic reaction. All six patients had resolution of symptoms, with five receiving intravenous diphenhydramine for treatment. The incidence of EPS dysfunction was 1.3 events per 10000 patients (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4 to 3.0, based on six events). All patients who experienced reactions pre-operatively were able to proceed to surgery without complications or delay. One patient required unplanned admission and 3-h observation owing to sedation from diphenhydramine. The incidence of EPS dysfunction after oral perphenazine is low. Reactions that did occur were mild and easily treated.

Conclusion

Given the infrequent side effects, this single, low dose of perphenazine should be encouraged as a low-risk adjunct to any multimodal PONV prophylaxis regimen, based on the selection criteria described.

### Drug-induced extrapyramidal syndromes: implications for contemporary practice [^112pfgNx]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The development of drugs to treat psychosis is a fascinating nexus for understanding mechanisms underlying disorders of mind and movement. Although the risk of drug-induced extrapyramidal syndromes has been mitigated by the acceptance of less potent dopamine antagonists, expansive marketing and off-label use has increased the number of susceptible people who may be at risk for these neurologic effects. Clinicians need to be familiar with advances in diagnosis and management, which are reviewed herein. A better understanding of drug-induced effects on the motor circuit may improve patient safety, enhance antipsychotic effectiveness, and provide insights into mechanisms underlying antipsychotic activity in parallel brain circuits.

### Risperidone (Risperdal) [^111ktEDW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dose Dependency of Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials

Extrapyramidal Symptoms

Data from two fixed-dose trials in adults with schizophrenia provided evidence of dose-relatedness for extrapyramidal symptoms associated with RISPERDAL treatment.

Two methods were used to measure extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in an 8-week trial comparing 4 fixed doses of RISPERDAL (2, 6, 10, and 16 mg/day), including (1) a Parkinsonism score (mean change from baseline) from the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, and (2) incidence of spontaneous complaints of EPS:

Similar methods were used to measure extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in an 8-week trial comparing 5 fixed doses of RISPERDAL (1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg/day):

Dystonia

Class Effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

Other Adverse Reactions

Adverse event data elicited by a checklist for side effects from a large study comparing 5 fixed doses of RISPERDAL (1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg/day) were explored for dose-relatedness of adverse events. A Cochran-Armitage Test for trend in these data revealed a positive trend (p < 0.05) for the following adverse reactions: somnolence, vision abnormal, dizziness, palpitations, weight increase, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, sexual function abnormal, fatigue, and skin discoloration.

Changes in Body Weight

Weight gain was observed in short-term, controlled trials and longer-term uncontrolled studies in adult and pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Adverse Reactions (6), and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Genome-wide association study identified six loci associated with adverse drug reactions to aripiprazole in schizophrenia patients [^112w6cD5]. Schizophrenia (2023). Medium credibility.

Compared with first-generation antipsychotics, atypical/second-generation antipsychotics have fewer extrapyramidal and asthenia-related adverse reactions. Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic and is also known as a third-generation antipsychotic. The pharmacological mechanism of aripiprazole is mainly due to partial agonist activity at D 2 and 5-HT 1A receptors and the potent antagonism of the 5HT 2A receptor. Its metabolism is mainly through the dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes. The possible adverse reactions caused by aripiprazole include headache, insomnia, dizziness, and restlessness. Aripiprazole has less effect on weight change. Compared with olanzapine and risperidone, aripiprazole is less likely to cause metabolic adverse drug reactions. However, genome-wide pharmacogenomics studies on the adverse drug reactions of aripiprazole are very limited. Previous studies mainly focused on the pharmacodynamics of DRD2 and 5-HTR2A and the response to negative symptoms and cognitive performance –. Movement-related adverse events, including extrapyramidal side effects, motor restlessness and other abnormal movements, show individual differences. The genetic basis underlying the individual difference needs to be discovered.

Investigating the genetic mechanism of the movement-related adverse drug response to aripiprazole is an urgent research direction. Therefore, we conducted a genome-wide association analysis in schizophrenia patients treated with aripiprazole monotherapy to explore the genetic loci related to the severity of movement-related antipsychotic effects.

### Which atypical antipsychotic for schizophrenia? [^113GkMYB]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

Until the early 1990s, first-line drug therapy for patients with acute schizophrenia was usually a traditional antipsychotic, such as haloperidol. As recently as 1997, we recommended that newer, so-called 'atypical' antipsychotic drugs, such as olanzapine and risperidone, should be reserved for patients unable to tolerate traditional drugs. Now, atypical antipsychotics are widely regarded as better than traditional drugs, being generally less likely to cause troublesome extrapyramidal effects or hyperprolactinaemia. Current atypical antipsychotics differ from one another in important respects. Here we consider how important differences in their unwanted-effect profiles may influence the choice between these drugs for patients with schizophrenia.

Children and adolescents are at a greater risk than adults for antipsychotic-induced adverse effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms, prolactin elevation, sedation, weight gain, and metabolic effects, which can have long-term health consequences for young patients. Clinicians should complete careful baseline assessments and perform dietary and lifestyle counseling when initiating antipsychotic treatment and then proactively monitor for adverse effects to optimize physical as well as psychiatric outcomes. Strategies to manage adverse effects that occur or worsen during treatment include switching medications, lowering the dosage of medications, and initiating targeted treatments to address clinically relevant changes.

### Antipsychotic dose, dopamine D2 receptor occupancy and extrapyramidal side-effects: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^111ubBSy]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Additionally, partial D 2 R agonists, i.e. aripiprazole, brexpiprazole and cariprazine, do not conform to the conventional D 2 R therapeutic window due to their unique pharmacological properties. Compared to D 2 R antagonists, these compounds have a low intrinsic activity on D 2 R, which may vary depending on the brain region, receptor sensitivity and cell systems. At clinical effective doses, partial agonists exhibit higher D 2 R occupancies beyond 80% exerting their antipsychotic effect, while still retaining some dopaminergic signalling resulting in a reduced risk of EPS.

Accordingly, we found that aripiprazole did not cause EPS at D 2 R occupancy of 80% (OR = 1.05 at 3 mg/d), and the risk remained low even at higher occupancies (up to OR = 1.57 at 30 mg/d). The other partial agonists had a higher risk compared with aripiprazole even at doses with D 2 R occupancy of about 80%, i.e. brexpiprazole (OR = 1.42 at 4 mg/d) and cariprazine (OR = 1.69 at 3 mg/d). Their higher risk of EPS can be potentially explained by their lower intrinsic activity compared with aripiprazole.

### Drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions… [^116pLWYe]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A common form of Parkinsonism today is that induced by certain ataractic drugs, particularly phenothiazines containing a piperazine moiety. Mild to severe extrapyramidal symptoms can appear and disappear within hours or days of commencing or withdrawing the drugs. With rare exceptions the syndrome is completely reversible. This study was based on the postulate that the syndrome is due to interference with the normal functioning of central catecholamines, particularly dopamine, and of central histamine. Extrapyramidal reactions caused by reserpine or 1 of 3 phenothiazines were treated with from 4 to 32 gm. per day of dihydroxyphenylalanine, with 0. 4 to
0. 6 gm. per day of diphenhydramine, or with each in turn. Dopa was mildly beneficial in 4 out of 22 patients, whereas diphenhydramine was completely effective in each of 11. McGeer PL, Boulding JE, Gibson WC, Foulkes RG.

### Receptor mechanisms in the treatment of schizophrenia [^115ghKiA]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2004). Low credibility.

There remain many limitations to the treatment of schizophrenia. In addition to the poor response of negative and cognitive symptoms to antipsychotics, and the substantial proportion of poor- or non-responders, there are a variety of unpleasant and restricting side-effects of these drugs. The introduction of several 'atypical' drugs, with diminished propensity to cause extrapyramidal motor effects (EPS), has greatly improved the tolerability of antipsychotic treatments. The pharmacology of atypical antipsychotics is varied and, although dopamine D2 receptor antagonism is common to all antipsychotics, the mechanisms of a typicality are complex and not fully understood. Thus, antagonism at 5-HT2 and/or other receptors, weak dopamine receptor affinity and, most recently, partial agonism at dopamine D2 receptors, have been variously implicated. However, because EPS have diminished with improvements in drug treatment, drug-induced weight gain has emerged as a major concern, and the pharmacological basis of this problem, involving effects at 5-HT2c and perhaps other receptors, is yielding to investigation. Some drugs, notably the D2 partial agonists, can provide antipsychotic effects without the emergence of several of the seproblematic side-effects, which bodes well for future treatment.

### Addressing side effects from antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia [^114vdAfT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia is associated with an array of adverse events, many of which are difficult for patients to tolerate and promote nonadherence to treatment. Serious adverse events include extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), hyperprolactinemia, weight gain leading to metabolic syndrome, sedation, cognitive deficits, and hypotension. Clinicians need to be aware of each antipsychotic's propensity to cause these adverse events as well as strategies for avoiding or minimizing the occurrence of adverse events.

### Reply to' antipsychotics with similar association kinetics at dopamine dreceptors differ in extrapyramidal side-effects' [^111n75mL]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The final comment raised by Zeberg and Sahlholm relates to the antipsychotic thioridazine, which they state has a favourable EPS profile despite its rapid association rate. Note that this drug was not included in the meta-analysis of Leucht et al. so could not be included in our correlation. As discussed in our paper, it was not our intension to present the rebinding hypothesis as the only mechanism that might predict EPS. Rather, many antipsychotics display complex poly-pharmacology that may also contribute to their relative efficacy and side-effect profiles. For example the superior EPS profile of thioridazine may relate to off-target activity at the muscarinic M 1 receptor. Our study revealed a compelling correlation between EPS and association rate, and we propose a mechanism of drug-rebinding that can explain this correlation. Given the complex action of antipsychotic drugs it would, however, be naive to expect that all drugs would fall within this correlation. Those that do not may act via distinct mechanisms. Indeed, in our study we observed that aripiprazole, a drug that acts as a D 2 R partial agonist rather than an antagonist, was an outlier. We proposed that this was because of its distinct action at the D 2 R. As such, we feel that one should not discount the potential importance of drug rebinding at the D 2 R due to a small number of drugs that do not fit this correlation. Instead, just as the work of Seeman and colleaguesstimulated our study, we hope that our work will inspire future studies aimed at carefully testing our hypothesis and unraveling the complex mechanisms that determine antipsychotic drug efficacy.

This article reviews three poorly recognized yet relatively common presentations of hyperactive orofacial movement disorders: oromandibular dystonia, orofacial dyskinesia, and drug-induced extrapyramidal syndrome reactions. Orofacial movement disorders are often misdiagnosed as temporomandibular disorders, hence understanding these conditions is pertinent for the practitioner treating orofacial pain. Aspects of epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis are discussed along with treatment considerations for these orofacial movement disorders.

### An integrated analysis of acute treatment-emergent extrapyramidal syndrome in patients with schizophrenia during olanzapine clinical trials: comparisons with placebo, haloperidol, risperidone, or clozapine [^112oAyRv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The frequency and severity of extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) were evaluated in patients with DSM-III or DSM-IV schizophrenia in the acute phase (- 8 weeks) of randomized, double-blind, controlled trials from the integrated olanzapine clinical trial database.

Method

This retrospective analysis included 23 clinical trials and 4611 patients from November 11, 1991, through July 31, 2001. Incidences of dystonic, parkinsonian, and akathisia events were compared using treatment-emergent adverse-event data. Categorical analyses of Simpson-Angus Scale and Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) scores, use of anticholinergic medications, and baseline-to-endpoint changes in Simpson-Angus Scale and BAS scores were compared.

Results

A significantly smaller percentage of olanzapine-treated patients experienced dystonic events than did haloperidol- (p < .001) or risperidone-treated patients (p = .047). A significantly greater percentage of haloperidol-treated patients experienced parkinsonian (p < .001) and akathisia (p < .001) events than did olanzapine-treated patients. Categorical analysis of Simpson-Angus Scale scores showed significantly more haloperidol- (p < .001) or risperidone-treated patients (p = .004) developed parkinsonism than did olanzapine-treated patients. Olanzapine-treated patients experienced significantly greater reductions in Simpson-Angus Scale scores than did haloperidol- (p < .001), risperidone- (p < .001), or clozapine-treated (p = .032) patients. Categorical analysis of BAS scores showed significantly more haloperidol-treated patients experienced treatment-emergent akathisia versus olanzapine-treated patients (p < .001). Significantly greater reductions in BAS scores were experienced during olanzapine treatment versus placebo (p = .007), haloperidol (p < .001), and risperidone (p = .004) treatments. A significantly smaller percentage of olanzapine-treated patients received anticholinergic medications compared with that of haloperidol- (p < .001) or risperidone-treated patients (p = .018). Compared with that in olanzapine-treated patients, the duration of anticholinergic cotreatment was significantly longer among haloperidol- (p < .001) or risperidone-treated patients (p = .040) and significantly shorter among clozapine-treated patients (p = .021).

Conclusion

This analysis of available data from olanzapine clinical trials lends additional support to olanzapine's favorable EPS profile.

### Extrapyramidal symptoms and signs in first-episode, antipsychotic exposed and non-exposed patients with schizophrenia or related psychotic illness [^114yvm2d]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

Movement disorders in first-episode psychosis are increasingly recognized; however, the prevalence and clinical correlates are uncertain. We compared antipsychotic exposed (< 12 weeks) with nonexposed first-episode patients, and report prevalence as well as clinical and demographic variables associated with extrapyramidal dysfunction. Data are baseline assessments from a multicentre, international drug trial of first-episode psychosis (n = 535). Analysis included the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, Premorbid Adjustment Scale, and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Of non-exposed patients, 28.1% (n = 47/167) had at least one mild sign of extrapyramidal dysfunction, as did 46.3% (n = 169/365) of previously exposed patients. Hypokinetic Parkinsonism was the most prevalent disorder. The severity of movement disorders and negative symptoms were correlated; however, the effect sizes were small. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the salient risk factors for all patients were: previous antipsychotic exposure [odds ratio (OR) = 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6–3.6] and poor premorbid functioning (OR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.2–2.6). For the non-exposed group (n = 167), the significant risk factors were: having severe mental illness in the family (OR = 2.9; 95% CI 1.2–7.2) and poor premorbid functioning (OR = 2.3; 95% CI 1.0–5.3). For the previously exposed group (n = 368), the significant variables were: poor premorbid functioning (OR = 1.8; 95%CI 1.2–2.8) and shorter duration of untreated psychosis (OR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.64–0.94). Although antipsychotic exposure was associated with extrapyramidal signs, the results indicate that many first-episode patients with no exposure to antipsychotics also had extrapyramidal dysfunction. In this group, family history and poor premorbid functioning appear to be associated with increased risk for movement disorders.

Discussion

Main findings

Based on the demographic data and drug intake character, this study found that patients in the EPS group were older combined with a longer duration of illness and drug treatment. More typical and atypical antipsychotics polytherapy, atypical antipsychotics polytherapy and mood stabilisers combined treatment can be found in the EPS group. There was a trend difference in gender and antipsychotic D2 receptor antagonism in the EPS group. When variables with statistical and trend differences were included in the logistic regression analysis, the study found that antipsychotics with high D2 receptor antagonism and illness duration were risk factors of EPS, and the relationship between gender, age, monotherapy or polytherapy of antipsychotics (no matter if it is typical or atypical antipsychotics) and EPS did not reach statistical difference. The relative high incidence of EPS in patients taking typical antipsychotics was consistent with the results of some clinical studies. However, in recent years, some high-grade clinical trials with large sample including Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of InterventionEffectiveness (CATIE)、 The Cost Utility of the Latest Antipsychotics in SchizophreniaStudy Band 1（CUTLASS) and systematic reviews failed to reach the same conclusion. These studies demonstrated that atypical antipsychotic drugs might not have a significant advantage in reducing the incidence of EPS. Hugenholtz and colleauges' study showed that some randomised controlled trials demonstrated the conclusion that atypical antipsychotic drugs caused less EPS because the dose of typical antipsychotics group was usually higher than the recommended dose while not combined with anticholinergics. A systematic review of 31 clinical studies (2320 samples) by Leucht and colleagues found that only clozapine in the second-generation antipsychotics had less EPS than typical low D2 receptor antagonistic typical antipsychotics. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of EPS between other atypical antipsychotics (such as risperidone, ziprasidone, and so on) and typical antipsychotic drugs with low D2 receptor antagonism. The outcomes of study in Chinese populations also indicate that those who are taking high D2 receptor antagonistic effect atypical antipsychotic risperidone induce more EPS than those with low and moderate D2 receptor antagonistic effect. In summary, the D2 receptor antagonism effect of antipsychotic drugs may be related to the occurrence of EPS, and the impact of monotherapy or polytherapy of antipsychotics and classification of atypical or typical antipsychotics on incidence of EPS needs to be verified by larger sample trials.

### Extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics are linked to their association kinetics at dopamine dreceptors [^111y3Gp1]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Imbalances in dopamine signaling are believed to play an integral part in the symptoms of schizophrenia. The efficacy of all currently marketed antipsychotic drugs (APDs) is thought to be mediated by attenuation of dopamine transmission through their actions as antagonists or low efficacy partial agonists at the dopamine D 2 receptor (D 2 R). However, the therapeutic window, i.e. the margin between the therapeutic dose and the dose that produces adverse side effects, varies considerably across these drugs –.

Extrapyramidal motor symptoms (e.g. acute dystonia and parkinsonian symptoms such as bradykinesia and tremor) and excess prolactin release are major adverse side effects of APDs mediated by blockade of D 2 R signaling in the nigrostriatal dopamine system and the tuberoinfundibular pathway, respectively –. Many "typical" or first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) exhibit a relatively narrow therapeutic window with respect to these "on-target" side effects. The term "atypical" was first applied to clozapine, an efficacious APD with markedly lower "on-target" side effects when compared to FGAs, but that carries the risk for agranulocytosis, a potentially life-threatening off-target toxicity. From the study of clozapine and FGAs emerged second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) designed to exhibit wider therapeutic windows. However, certain SGAs first introduced as atypical have in subsequent studies been shown to have therapeutic indices more consistent with typical APDs with the converse also true for FGA/typical APDs, such as melperone. What is apparent is that despite more than 50 years of pharmacological research into APDs, on-target side effects remain a significant problem, often resulting in poor drug compliance. Thus, understanding their cause is a critical step toward the design of better therapeutics.

### Amantadine [^112t4nQk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The following points should be considered before initiating treatment or prophylaxis with amantadine hydrochloride tablets:

Amantadine hydrochloride tablets are not a substitute for early vaccination on an annual basis as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
Influenza viruses change over time. Emergence of resistance mutations could decrease drug effectiveness. Other factors (for example, changes in viral virulence) might also diminish clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Prescribers should consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use amantadine hydrochloride tablets.

Parkinson's Disease/Syndrome

Amantadine hydrochloride tablets are indicated in the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (Paralysis Agitans), postencephalitic parkinsonism, and symptomatic parkinsonism which may follow injury to the nervous system by carbon monoxide intoxication. It is indicated in those elderly patients believed to develop parkinsonism in association with cerebral arteriosclerosis. In the treatment of Parkinson's disease, amantadine hydrochloride tablets are less effective than levodopa, (-)-3-(3,4- dihydroxyphenyl)-L-alanine, and its efficacy in comparison with the anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs has not yet been established.

Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Reactions

Amantadine hydrochloride tablets are indicated in the treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions. Although anticholinergic-type side effects have been noted with amantadine hydrochloride tablets when used in patients with drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions, there is a lower incidence of these side effects than that observed with the anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs.

### Movement disorders associated with atypical antipsychotic drugs [^1133GxDo]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Data from clinical trials reviewed in this article fulfill predictions based on preclinical findings that atypical antipsychotic drugs are associated with a reduced potential for inducing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and other movement disorders. Atypical drugs have been shown to reduce all subtypes of acute EPS, the frequency of EPS-related patient dropouts, and the need for concomitant antiparkinsonian drug use. Clozapine remains superior to other atypicals in treating psychosis without worsening motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. Atypicals may be selectively advantageous in treating schizophrenic patients with a predisposition to catatonia. Although the risk of developing lethal neuroleptic malignant syndrome may be diminished with atypical drugs, clinicians must remain alert to the signs of this disorder. Atypicals have reduced liability for inducing tardive dyskinesia (TD) and show antidyskinetic properties in patients with preexisting TD. Passive resolution of TD may be facilitated in some patients by the use of these agents. Thus, the risk of movement disorders has become only one of several considerations in choosing among antipsychotic drugs.

### Antipsychotic dose, dopamine D2 receptor occupancy and extrapyramidal side-effects: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^111KdxvU]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Antipsychotic drugs differ in their propensity to cause extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS), but their dose-effects are unclear. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis. We searched multiple electronic databases up to 20.02.2023 for fixed-dose studies investigating 16 second-generation antipsychotics and haloperidol (all formulations and administration routes) in adults with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. The primary outcome was the number of participants receiving antiparkinsonian medication, and if not available, the number of participants with extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS) and the mean scores of EPS rating scales were used as proxies. The effect-size was odds ratio (ORs) compared with placebo. One-stage random-effects dose-response meta-analyses with restricted cubic splines were conducted to estimate the dose-response curves. We also examined the relationship between dopamine D 2 receptor (D 2 R) occupancy and ORs by estimating occupancies from administrated doses. We included data from 110 studies with 382 dose arms (37193 participants). Most studies were short-term with median duration of 6 weeks (range 3–26 weeks). Almost all antipsychotics were associated with dose-dependent EPS with varied degrees and the maximum ORs ranged from OR = 1.57 95%CI [0.97, 2.56] for aripiprazole to OR = 7.56 95%CI [3.16, 18.08] for haloperidol at 30 mg/d. Exceptions were quetiapine and sertindole with negligible risks across all doses. There was very low quality of findings for cariprazine, iloperidone, and zotepine, and no data for clozapine. The D 2 R occupancy curves showed that the risk increased substantially when D 2 R occupancy exceeded 75–85%, except for D 2 R partial agonists that had smaller ORs albeit high D 2 R occupancies. In conclusion, we found that the risk of EPS increases with rising doses and differs substantially in magnitude among antipsychotics, yet exceptions were quetiapine and sertindole with negligible risks. Our data provided additional insights into the current D 2 R therapeutic window for EPS.

Methods

Inclusion criteria

The sample was derived from a real-world multicentre clinical trial, called the Multi-center Real World Clinical Study of Long-term Outcomes for Schizophrenia by Atypical Antipsychotic Treatment (in China). All enrolled patients were adult patients with schizophrenia who had been admitted to seven psychiatric hospitals or general hospitals from 2011 to 2016. All patients must have met the following inclusion criteria: (1) patients who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia by two psychiatrists independently based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition or the International Classification of Diseases-10th Edition; (2) 18 years old or above; and (3) patients who had taken or intended to take one of the eight atypical antipsychotics allowed by this study (quetiapine/olanzapine/risperidone/aripiprazole/ziprasidone/paliperidone/amisulpride/clozapine). Patients who were participating in other clinical studies and who were considered unfit for this study were excluded. A total of 1027 subjects were enrolled in baseline data. A total of 348 cases were excluded due to the lack of demographic data (gender, age, and so on), EPS ratings and symptoms ratings. Finally, a total of 679 subjects were included in the analysis (figure 1). All patients and their guardians have signed a written informed consent form, and all the assessments were made by trained psychiatrists who have underwent scale consistency training before the first patients were enrolled.

Figure 1
Flowchart of the study.

Diagnostic criteria for EPS

EPS is mainly divided into three types: drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia and tardive dyskinesia. Patients were considered to have met criteria for drug-induced parkinsonism if they scored 1 (mild) on at least two of the six Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) items or 2 (moderate) on one of the items. Patients were considered to have met criteria for akathisia if they scored at least 2 (mild) on the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) global item. When they scored 2 (mild) on at least two Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) items or 3 (moderate) on one AIMS item, they were diagnosed with suspected tarive dyskesia (TD) (the diagnosis of TD requires more than two consecutive AIMS assessments). Since anticholinergic drugs could relieve or mask EPS symptoms, all patients who took diphenhydramine hydrochloride were assigned to the EPS group.

### Manual for the extrapyramidal symptom rating scale (ESRS) [^116kmHsX]. Schizophrenia Research (2005). Low credibility.

The Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) was developed to assess four types of drug-induced movement disorders (DIMD): Parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia (TD). Comprehensive ESRS definitions and basic instructions are given. Factor analysis provided six ESRS factors: 1) hypokinetic Parkinsonism; 2) orofacial dyskinesia; 3) trunk/limb dyskinesia; 4) akathisia; 5) tremor; and 6) tardive dystonia. Two pivotal studies found high inter-rater reliability correlations in both antipsychotic-induced movement disorders and idiopathic Parkinson disease. For inter-rater reliability and certification of raters, ≥ 80% of item ratings of the complete scale should be ± 1 point of expert ratings and ≥ 70% of ratings on individual items of each ESRS subscale should be ± 1 point of expert ratings. During a cross-scale comparison, AIMS and ESRS were found to have a 96% (359/374) agreement between TD-defined cases by DSM-IV TD criteria. Two recent international studies using the ESRS included over 3000 patients worldwide and showed an incidence of TD ranging from 10.2% (2000) to 12% (1998). ESRS specificity was investigated through two different approaches, path analyses and ANCOVA PANSS factors changes, which found that ESRS measurement of drug-induced EPS is valid and discriminative from psychiatric symptoms.

### Extrapyramidal reactions associated with serotonergic antidepressants [^112S8pLW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Extrapyramidal reactions (EPRs) associated with serotonergic antidepressant treatments have been reported since 1958. These reactions can be distressing for patients and complicate treatment. Our objective was to complete a follow-up review of published EPR cases reported for serotonergic antidepressants.

Data Sources

Published cases between January 1998 and May 2015 were collected through a medical literature search. Citation reference lists were also searched manually.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Identified cases were reviewed for patient age, gender, psychiatric diagnosis, dosage, time to reaction onset, concurrent medications, and EPR description. Cases were excluded when there was not a clear description, if descriptions were not consistent with accepted deﬁnitions, or if the written English was poor. We included cases of akathisia, dystonia, dyskinesia, parkinsonism, or mixed EPRs. Authors scored each case using the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale.

Data Synthesis

We identified 86 published reports involving 91 patients; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were implicated in 80.2% of cases. All EPR types were reported: 17 akathisia cases, 18 dyskinesia cases, 27 dystonia cases, 19 parkinsonism cases, and 10 mixed EPR cases. EPRs typically occurred within 30 days of either treatment initiation or dose increase. Age, gender, antidepressant dosing, or concurrent antipsychotic treatment did not appear to broadly contribute to EPR risk. Naranjo scores ranged from 2 to 8.

Conclusions

Case reports associating serotonergic antidepressants with EPRs continue to be published. Practitioners are advised that monitoring for such is important. Rigorous research efforts are needed to better understand the clinical risk factors for these adverse drug reactions.

### Neurobiological mechanisms associated with antipsychotic drug-induced dystonia [^116s7Xho]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Dystonia is by far the most intrusive and invalidating extrapyramidal side effect of potent classical antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotic drug-induced dystonia is classified in both acute and tardive forms. The incidence of drug-induced dystonia is associated with the affinity to inhibitory dopamine D2 receptors. Particularly acute dystonia can be treated with anticholinergic drugs, but the tardive form may also respond to such antimuscarinic treatment, which contrasts their effects in tardive dyskinesia. Combining knowledge of the pathophysiology of primary focal dystonia with the anatomical and pharmacological organization of the extrapyramidal system may shed some light on the mechanism of antipsychotic drug-induced dystonia. A suitable hypothesis is derived from the understanding that focal dystonia may be due to a faulty processing of somatosensory input, so leading to inappropriate execution of well-trained motor programmes. Neuroplastic alterations of the sensitivity of extrapyramidal medium-sized spiny projection neurons to stimulation, which are induced by the training of specific complex movements, lead to the sophisticated execution of these motor plans. The sudden and non-selective disinhibition of indirect pathway medium-sized spiny projection neurons by blocking dopamine D2 receptors may distort this process. Shutting down the widespread influence of tonically active giant cholinergic interneurons on all medium-sized spiny projection neurons by blocking muscarinic receptors may result in a reduction of the influence of extrapyramidal cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical regulation. Furthermore, striatal cholinergic interneurons have an important role to play in integrating cerebellar input with the output of cerebral cortex, and are also targeted by dopaminergic nigrostriatal fibres affecting dopamine D2 receptors.

### Antipsychotic dose, dopamine D2 receptor occupancy and extrapyramidal side-effects: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^115BDzW9]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis

The effect sizes for continuous outcomes were standardized mean differences (SMDs) because different EPS scales were expected, and for dichotomous were odds ratios (ORs) because of their preferred mathematical properties. We also transformed SMDs to ORs using the Hasselblad and Hedges' method, in order to allow the combination of continuous and dichotomous data for the primary outcome, as well as comparability of the findings in a sensitivity analysis. Placebo or 0 mg was used as reference in the calculation of effect-sizes. ORs were interpreted as small (OR = 1.52), medium (OR = 2.74) and large (OR = 4.72), assuming a risk of 5% in the placebo group (eAppendix 2).

We estimated dose-response curves for each antipsychotic separately with a one-stage random-effects dose-response meta-analysis in a frequentist framework. We used restricted cubic splines with three knots, which were set at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of the doses, except for asenapine, at 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles, because the former percentiles could not form three knot points. We estimated the maximum risk for EPS and the corresponding dose. Dose-response curves were evaluated descriptively, as well as with a Wald test and the coefficients of the model. Heterogeneity was quantified with the variance partition coefficient (VPC), which is a multivariate extension of the I 2 statistic.

### Activating and sedating properties of medications used for the treatment of major depressive disorder and their effect on patient functioning [^1147uUuo]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Although the sedative and extrapyramidal side effects associated with first-generation antipsychotics are well known, some second-generation antipsychotics are also associated with substantial sedation and activation effects. In this Academic Highlights article, 4 experts on depression from the fields of psychiatry and primary care take a closer look at activation and sedation effects of atypical antipsychotics in patients with MDD. They examine the likelihood of each agent to cause these effects; the impact of these effects on patient functioning, quality of life, and treatment adherence; and the question of whether leveraging activation and sedation to address acute symptoms is ever advisable.

### Motor worsening and tardive dyskinesia with aripiprazole in lewy body dementia [^115BSoZH]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Aripiprazole (APZ) is a novel antipsychotic agent which does not block dopamine (DA) receptors but is rather a partial DA agonist. Thus, it has been proposed that APZ may not induce tardive dyskinesia (TD), a disfiguring and sometimes disabling and irreversible side effect of neuroleptics. Our patient had Lewy body dementia (LBD) and developed severe worsening of parkinsonism over 1 month of APZ treatment. Within days of discontinuation of APZ dramatic orobuccal dyskinesias emerged. Treatment emergent worsening of parkinsonism improved but orobuccal dyskinesias persisted unchanged until his death 8 months later. Others have reported severe extrapyramidal reactions including neuroleptic malignant syndrome and TD with APZ. APZ has been suggested as a treatment for TD but treatment benefit may reflect "masked" dyskinesia. We conclude that, despite an attractive in vitro profile and promising animal data, APZ can induce serious extrapyramidal side effects, including TD.

### Antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia: an overview [^113xpgNK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia is characterized by positive, negative, cognitive, disorganization, and mood symptoms. Antipsychotics are the mainstay in the pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia. Findings concerning efficacy for positive symptoms and disorganization suggest no consistent differences among available antipsychotics, with the exception of clozapine's superior efficacy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Efficacy for negative, depressive, and cognitive symptoms appears to be determined by (1) the extent to which reduction in positive symptoms brings about improvement in these other domains and (2) the extent to which extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) and anticholinergic effects (of the antipsychotic and of agents used to treat EPS) exacerbate them. Thus, the ability of antipsychotics to produce a potent antipsychotic effect without EPS and need for concomitant anticholinergic therapy yields multiple therapeutic benefits. In contrast to their broadly similar efficacy, antipsychotics differ markedly in their propensity to cause various adverse effects. Although second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have generally been believed to be associated with a lower risk of EPS but a higher risk of metabolic adverse effects than first-generation agents (FGAs), the substantial variation in these and other side effects among agents within both classes indicates that it is not clinically useful to make a categorical distinction between FGAs and SGAs. Choice of antipsychotic medication should be based on individual preference, prior treatment response and side effect experience, medical history and risk factors, and adherence history, with side effect profile a major determinant of antipsychotic choice.

### Understanding the new and evolving profile of adverse drug effects in schizophrenia [^111MH8VZ]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

This article has reviewed the emerging side-effect profiles of second-generation antipsychotic medications. Although these medications have favorable extrapyramidal side-effect profiles, clinicians must be aware of their propensity to cause weight gain, glucose and lipid abnormalities, and cardiac and sexual side effects. If clinicians are proactive about warning patients about these side effects and appropriately monitoring them, further morbidity and mortality may be prevented in this patient population. Initial choices of medication should be made based on the relative side-effect profiles in light of a particular patient's medical status. In the future, new treatments may be developed, with even fewer side effects.

Akathisia is a side-effect that continues to affect a large percentage of psychiatric patients though the focus over recent years has moved away from extrapyramidal side-effects to metabolic problems. As cognitive behavioural therapy has become an integrated part of the management plan for psychotic patients an increased understanding of patients' interpretation of their symptoms and side-effects are encouraged. This case series illustrates different views that patients take on medication induced side-effects.

### Pimozide [^115ARNfu]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

In general, the signs and symptoms of overdosage with pimozide would be an exaggeration of known pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions, the most prominent of which would be: 1) electrocardiographic abnormalities, 2) severe extrapyramidal reactions, 3) hypotension, 4) a comatose state with respiratory depression.

In the event of overdosage, gastric lavage, establishment of a patent airway and, if necessary, mechanically-assisted respiration are advised. Electrocardiographic monitoring should commence immediately and continue until the ECG parameters are within the normal range. Hypotension and circulatory collapse may be counteracted by use of intravenous fluids, plasma, or concentrated albumin, and vasopressor agents such as metaraminol, phenylephrine and norepinephrine.

Epinephrine should not be used. In case of severe extrapyramidal reactions, antiparkinson medication should be administered. Because of the long half-life of pimozide, patients who take an overdose should be observed for at least 4 days. As with all drugs, the physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of overdose.

### A meta-analysis of the risk of acute extrapyramidal symptoms with intramuscular antipsychotics for the treatment of agitation [^111XhgwP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

We examined the evidence for a decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) with intramuscular second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) versus intramuscular haloperidol alone or in combination with an anticholinergic agent.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE (1950 to the present), and EMBASE and the Cochrane Database through January 16, 2008, for studies published in English of intramuscular SGAs and intramuscular haloperidol alone or in combination with an anticholinergic agent using the following drug names: ziprasidone, Geodon, olanzapine, Zyprexa, aripiprazole, Abilify, haloperidol, and Haldol. We then searched this pool of studies for trials with the terms intramuscular, IM, or injectable. Initially, we included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs). To obtain more data comparing SGAs to the combination of haloperidol and an anticholinergic, we conducted a second analysis including studies of any methodology.

Study Selection

Seven RCTs that compared intramuscular SGAs to intramuscular haloperidol alone were identified. However, we found only one RCT of haloperidol plus an anticholinergic. In the second analysis, we identified 18 studies, including 4 using haloperidol combined with promethazine (an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties).

Data Extraction

The primary outcome measure was acute dystonia; secondary outcome measures included akathisia, parkinsonism, or the need for additional anticholinergic medication. For RCTs, risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each outcome. When all studies were included in the second analysis, we calculated the risk of acute dystonia.

Data Synthesis

Among RCTs (N = 2032), SGAs were associated with a significantly lower risk of acute dystonia (RR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.39), akathisia (RR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.14 to 0.44), and anticholinergic use (RR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.09 to 0.43) compared with haloperidol alone. When all trials were considered (N = 3425), rates of acute dystonia were higher for haloperidol alone (4.7%) than for SGAs (0.6%) or for haloperidol plus promethazine (0.0%).

Conclusions

Intramuscular SGAs have a significantly lower risk of acute EPS compared to haloperidol alone. However, intramuscular haloperidol plus promethazine has a risk of acute dystonia comparable to intramuscular SGAs. The decision to use SGAs should consider other factors in addition to the reduction of EPS, which can be prevented by the use of an anticholinergic agent.

### Extrapyramidal symptom profiles in Japanese patients with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine or haloperidol [^111XCY9B]. Schizophrenia Research (2002). Low credibility.

Previous clinical trials have clearly shown the superiority of olanzapine to haloperidol in the improvement of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in schizophrenic patients. The primary purpose of this study was to compare EPS profiles in Japanese schizophrenic patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, or a typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, as measured by the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS). The DIEPSS, which consists of eight individual parameters and one global assessment (overall severity), was used to evaluate 182 patients enrolled in this 8-week study. The primary safety analysis was maximum change (that could be either a decrease or increase) from baseline in DIEPSS total score. Secondary analyses included change from baseline to maximum in DIEPSS total score, change from baseline to endpoint (LOCF) in DIEPSS total score, and the rank sum of the maximum change (that could be either a decrease or increase) from baseline in the DIEPSS individual items. Incidence of treatment-emergent EPS adverse events using the DIEPSS scale was also analyzed. The olanzapine group showed statistically significant superiority to the haloperidol group on the primary analysis (p < 0.001). Secondary analyses also demonstrated olanzapine's superiority in DIEPSS total, parkinsonism, akathisia and overall severity scores (all p ≤ 0.014). Categorical analysis of treatment-emergent akathisia and parkinsonism syndromes at endpoint showed improvement in the olanzapine group but worsening in the haloperidol group. The results from this study suggest that olanzapine, as in Caucasian populations, is a safe treatment in Japanese patients chronically ill with schizophrenia.

### Extrapyramidal stiffness in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^112AmBvY]. Movement Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

There is accumulating evidence that ALS is a multisystem degenerative disease, raising the question of whether some symptoms are of extrapyramidal origin. The objective was to better characterize the type of stiffness in a series of ALS patients and to study correlations with balance and postural impairment. We studied ALS patients who exhibited stiffness without noticeable motor deficit in the lower limbs. We analyzed the response to manual stretch velocity to differentiate between extrapyramidal (rigidity) or pyramidal (spasticity) stiffness, shortening reaction in the tibialis anterior muscles (abolished in pyramidal diseases and exaggerated in extrapyramidal diseases) and balance and posture impairment (UPDRS and Berg's scale). After a preliminary inter-rater reliability study, 39 consecutive ALS patients were prospectively recruited. Each patient was randomly assigned to one or other of two investigators who evaluated either stiffness or balance impairment. In the lower limbs, rigidity was observed in at least one muscle in 27/39 patients (69%), and shortening reaction was exaggerated in 20/39 patients (51%). Both were correlated with balance and posture impairment (UPDRS and Berg's scale, P < 0.001). This study suggests that extrapyramidal involvement plays a role in stiffness and balance impairment in a subset of ALS patients.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^1128AuPu]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Antipsychotic side effects in dementia — first-generation agents — include a broad range of common adverse effects that vary with medication potency, with high-potency agents (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine) most strongly associated with akathisia and parkinsonism symptoms and low-potency agents (e.g., thioridazine, chlorpromazine) associated with sedation, central and peripheral anticholinergic effects, and postural hypotension; in older populations after longer-term treatment, rates of tardive dyskinesia are five- to sixfold greater than in younger populations, and individuals with dementia with co-occurring extrapyramidal disorders (as in dementia with Lewy bodies) may show extraordinary sensitivity to first-generation antipsychotic agents.

### Pimozide [^111JJzdf]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

General

Extrapyramidal Reactions: Neuromuscular (extrapyramidal) reactions during the administration of pimozide have been reported frequently, often during the first few days of treatment. In most patients, these reactions involved Parkinson-like symptoms which, when first observed, were usually mild to moderately severe and usually reversible.

Other types of neuromuscular reactions (motor restlessness, dystonia, akathisia, hyperreflexia, opisthotonos, oculogyric crises) have been reported far less frequently. Severe extrapyramidal reactions have been reported to occur at relatively low doses. Generally the occurrence and severity of most extrapyramidal symptoms are dose-related since they occur at relatively high doses and have been shown to disappear or become less severe when the dose is reduced. Administration of antiparkinson drugs such as benztropine mesylate or trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride may be required for control of such reactions. It should be noted that persistent extrapyramidal reactions have been reported and that the drug may have to be discontinued in such cases.

Withdrawal Emergent Neurological Signs: Generally, patients receiving short term therapy experience no problems with abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs.

However, some patients on maintenance treatment experience transient dyskinetic signs after abrupt withdrawal. In certain of these cases the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from the syndrome described below under "Tardive Dyskinesia" except for duration. It is not known whether gradual withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs will reduce the rate of occurrence of withdrawal emergent neurological signs, but until further evidence becomes available, it seems reasonable to gradually withdraw use of pimozide.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia [^112LstVa]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Children and adolescents with schizophrenia — extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSs) and adverse-effect monitoring are emphasized: EPSs, including dystonia, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, may occur with traditional or atypical agents and need to be periodically assessed throughout treatment, with standardized measurements such as the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale and the Neurological Rating Scale helpful for monitoring. To avoid acute EPSs, the use of prophylactic antiparkinsonian agents may be considered, especially in those at risk for acute dystonias or have a history of dystonic reactions, and the need should be re-evaluated after the acute phase of treatment or if doses are lowered. Other potential adverse events include sedation, orthostatic hypotension, sexual dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, electrocardiographic changes (including prolongation of the corrected QT interval), elevated liver transaminases, and steatohepatitis; in adults, traditional and atypical antipsychotic agents are associated with an increased risk of sudden death, sudden death is very rare in pediatric populations, and clinicians should be aware of the potential impact on cardiac functioning, including corrected QT interval prolongation, and monitor appropriately.

### Oculogyric crisis in a patient taking metoclopramide [^114m9LQz]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Acute dystonic reactions are extrapyramidal side effects due to alteration of the dopaminergic–cholinergic balance in the nigrostriatum. Medication-induced acute dystonia can be a side effect of treatment with antiemetics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiepileptics, antimalarials, and other drugs. Such drugs produce acute dystonic reactions through a nigrostriatal dopamine D2 receptor blockade, which results in an excess of striatal cholinergic output. These drug-induced side effects are dose independent. Metoclopramide, the most commonly prescribed antiemetic, may cause acute dystonic reactions at any age even if it is used at therapeutic dosages. The incidence of these reactions secondary to metoclopramide is 0.2%, but in old and young patients this incidence increases to as high as 25%. Metoclopramide-induced side effects are also known to appear more frequently in female patients, at high drug doses, in patients with a family history of neurological disease, in those who are treated with neuroleptics, and in patients whose family members have developed acute dystonic reactions due to metoclopramide.

### Risk of extrapyramidal syndromes with haloperidol, risperidone, or olanzapine [^114ptQUQ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the risk of extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) between risperidone, olanzapine, and haloperidol, taking into account patients' past antipsychotic drug use and past EPS.

Methods

Data were obtained from the PHARMO-database, containing filled prescriptions of 450,000 community-dwelling people in the Netherlands from 1986 through 1999. We defined cohorts of first-time users of haloperidol, risperidone, or olanzapine aged 15 to 54 years. In the first 90 days of treatment, we assessed the occurrence of EPS, defined as first use of any antiparkinsonian agent. We estimated relative risks of EPS for risperidone and olanzapine versus haloperidol using a Cox proportional hazards model. Patients were subdivided according to prior use of antipsychotic and antiparkinsonian drugs.

Results

We identified 424 patients starting treatment with haloperidol, 243 with risperidone, and 181 with olanzapine. Prior use of antipsychotic plus antiparkinsonian medication was significantly more frequent among users of risperidone and olanzapine than in those using haloperidol (36.2%, 40.3%, and 4.5%, respectively; p < 0.001). Within most subgroups of comparable treatment history, patients using risperidone and olanzapine showed reduced risks of EPS compared with haloperidol, although some of these findings did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.03–0.22). However, this was not observed for patients using risperidone who had experienced EPS in the past (RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.24 to 7.18).

Conclusions

In general, we observed reduced risks of EPS for risperidone and olanzapine compared with haloperidol within subgroups of patients with a similar treatment history. However, the added value of risperidone in patients who have experienced EPS in the past needs further study.

### Risperidone (Risperdal CONSTA) [^1128jzpJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dose Dependency of Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials

Extrapyramidal Symptoms

Two methods were used to measure extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in the 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing three doses of RISPERDAL CONSTA (25 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg) with placebo in patients with schizophrenia, including: (1) the incidence of spontaneous reports of EPS symptoms; and (2) the change from baseline to endpoint on the total score (sum of the subscale scores for parkinsonism, dystonia, and dyskinesia) of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS).

As shown in Table 1, the overall incidence of EPS-related adverse reactions (akathisia, dystonia, parkinsonism, and tremor) in patients treated with 25 mg RISPERDAL CONSTA was comparable to that of patients treated with placebo; the incidence of EPS-related adverse reactions was higher in patients treated with 50 mg RISPERDAL CONSTA.

The median change from baseline to endpoint in total ESRS score showed no worsening in patients treated with RISPERDAL CONSTA compared with patients treated with placebo: 0 (placebo group); -1 (25-mg group, significantly less than the placebo group); and 0 (50-mg group).

Dystonia

Class Effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

### Should we stop prescribing metoclopramide as a prokinetic drug in critically ill patients? [^113QFbgw]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Why is there a safety issue with metoclopramide?

The EMA recommendations are based on the following reported side effects in non-ICU patients.

First, neurological adverse reactions, including extrapyramidal disorders, dyskinesia, dystonia, convulsion, hypertonia and tremor, can occur. However, the absolute risk of neurological adverse reactions is poorly quantified. The reported occurrence of tardive dyskinesia ranges from < 0.01 to 23%. High occurrence is attributed to chronic use (months to years) of approximately 30 ± 10 mg metoclopramide/day and concerns mostly older (60 ± 22 years) women. Of an estimated 15.9 million metoclopramide prescriptions in the UK in the period 1967 to 1982, extrapyramidal symptoms were reported 479 times, representing an incidence of 0.003%. Of these reactions, 455 were dystonia–dyskinesia, 20 were parkinsonism and four were tardive dyskinesia. Occurrence of akathisia is related to the rate of intravenous metoclopramide administration. After a bolus injection over 2 minutes, 24.7% of patients experienced akathisia, which was reduced to 5.8% in patients receiving the same dose in a 15-minute infusion. Acute neurological adverse reactions in the ICU setting due to single use or short-term use of metoclopramide have not been reported in the literature to our knowledge, except for an anecdotal report on increased intracranial pressure for a short period after intravenous metoclopramide administration.

Cardiac adverse reactions, including shock, hypotension, cardiac arrest, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypertension, cardiorespiratory arrest and circulatory collapse, can also occur. Evidence is solely based on case reports. The available case reports and case series (a total of 56 patients over a 44-year period) were recently summarised and discussed. Of those, only three are critically ill patients. Moreover, the EMA assessment mentions 'reports', but does not refer to any specific publications in its references.

### Orofacial movement disorders [^114JivbZ]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Orofacial movement disorders (OMDs) include dystonia, dyskinesia, drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions, and bruxism. The definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, and management are detailed. OMDs are often disabling and affect patients' overall quality of life with pain, difficulty chewing food, speech difficulty, drooling, and social embarrassment. Management involves medications, botulinum toxin injections, and peripheral or central surgery. Botulinum toxin injections are the most effective management, often used in conjunction with medications. Surgery is the last resort for patients who fail to respond to medications or develop resistance to botulinum toxin type A.

### Study on risk factors of extrapyramidal symptoms induced by antipsychotics and its correlation with symptoms of schizophrenia [^115sevLz]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study is based on cross-sectional data in real-world research, so it is impossible to demonstrate a trend and correlation between the changes of psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia and the severity of EPS in long-term research. Future studies can concentrate on the long-term alternation of EPS severity and psychiatric and mood symptoms of schizophrenia which can further reveal the relationship between EPS and schizophrenia. In thist study, those who didn't fit in the dignositic criteria for EPS but were currently taking anticholinergics are included in EPS group. This may result in the inclusion of someone who without EPS considering the fact that some anticholinergics are given in advance to avoid risk of developing EPS especially when they are taking first generation antipsychotics (FGAs), which lead to a bias to the results. The risk factors of EPS may not be comprehensive in this study. Future research could investigate whether factors such as drug dose, blood drug concentration and substance dependence have an impact on the occurrence of EPS in Chinese patients with schizophrenia.

Implications

In summary, this study has found that taking high D2 receptor antagonistic effect antipsychotics and illness duration of schizophrenia may be risk factors of EPS. The impact of polytherapy or monotherapy and classification of antipsychotics on the occurrence of EPS remains to be further explored. The psychiatric and mood symptoms of schizophrenia were positively correlated with the severity of diverse types of EPS, and psychiatric and mood symptoms were more severe in the EPS group compared with the non-EPS group. The occurrence of EPS was related to poor treatment outcomes and poor prognosis in Chinese patients with schizophrenia.

CONCLUSIONS

The search for the best, cost-effective approach to PONV is far from complete. We recommend that anesthesiology/surgery departments and hospital clinicians on Pharmacy & Therapeutics committees consider in earnest the value of routine preoperative, single-dose OP8, as part of the described P-D-O technique, for patients who have (1) no history of extrapyramidal reactions to similar drugs, (2) no concomitant current long-term prescriptions for antidopaminergic psychiatric drugs, including aripiprazole, and (3) no coexisting Parkinson Disease or cerebral palsy. Our threshold age for dose reduction (0–4 mg instead of 8 mg) is 70 years, if there is no plan for concomitant ketamine use.

### Benztropine mesylate [^1123h3D1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In acute dystonic reactions, 1 to 2 mL of the injection usually relieves the condition quickly. After that, the tablets, 1 to 2 mg twice a day, usually prevents recurrence.

When extrapyramidal disorders develop soon after initiation of treatment with neuroleptic drugs (e.g., phenothiazines), they are likely to be transient. One to 2 mg of benztropine mesylate tablets two or three times a day usually provides relief within one or two days. After one or two weeks, the drug should be withdrawn to determine the continued need for it. If such disorders recur, benztropine mesylate can be reinstituted.

Certain drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders that develop slowly may not respond to benztropine mesylate.

### New generation antipsychotics versus low-potency conventional antipsychotics: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Z5PSn]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

The clearest advantage of new generation, atypical antipsychotics is a reduced risk of extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS), compared with conventional compounds. These findings might have been biased by the use of the high-potency antipsychotic haloperidol as a comparator in most of the trials. We aimed to establish whether the new drugs induce fewer EPS than low-potency conventional antipsychotics.

Methods

We did a meta-analysis of all randomised controlled trials in which new generation antipsychotics had been compared with low-potency (equivalent or less potent than chlorpromazine) conventional drugs. We included studies that met quality criteria A or B in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook, and assessed quality with the Jadad scale. The primary outcome of interest was the number of patients who had at least one EPS. We used risk differences and 95% CIs as measures of effect size.

Findings

We identified 31 studies with a total of 2320 participants. Of the new generation drugs, only clozapine was associated with significantly fewer EPS (RD = -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.4, p = 0.008) and higher efficacy than low-potency conventional drugs. Reduced frequency of EPS seen with olanzapine was of borderline significance (-0.15, -0.31 to -0.01, p = 0.07). Only one inconclusive trial of amisulpride, quetiapine, and risperidone and no investigations of ziprasidone and sertindole were identified, but some evidence indicates that zotepine and remoxipride do not lead to fewer EPS than low-potency antipsychotics. Mean doses less than 600 mg/day of chlorpromazine or its equivalent had no higher risk of EPS than new generation drugs. As a group, new generation drugs were moderately more efficacious than low-potency antipsychotics, largely irrespective of the comparator doses used.

Interpretation

Optimum doses of low-potency conventional antipsychotics might not induce more EPS than new generation drugs. Potential advantages in efficacy of the new generation drugs should be a factor in clinical treatment decisions to use these rather than conventional drugs.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders [^111Cgbjc]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

AACAP practice parameter — antipsychotic medications for tics: Several conventional antipsychotic medications have been shown to be effective for decreasing severity, although these studies enrolled primarily adults. Haloperidol has been shown to be effective in several randomized controlled trials, but up to 84% of patients have experienced adverse events with roughly one-third having extrapyramidal side effects. In a placebo-controlled crossover trial of haloperidol and pimozide, pimozide was more effective at reducing total number of tics and was better tolerated than haloperidol. Although much lower doses are needed for CTD than for bipolar or psychotic disorders, a careful risk/benefit assessment and adverse effect monitoring are recommended. The only 2 FDA–approved medications to treat TD are haloperidol and pimozide, though most clinicians use atypical antipsychotics before these agents.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Central Nervous System:

The side effects most frequently reported with phenothiazine compounds are extrapyramidal symptoms including pseudoparkinsonism, dystonia, dyskinesia, akathisia, oculogyric crises, opisthotonos, and hyperreflexia. Most often these extrapyramidal symptoms are reversible; however, they may be persistent (see below). With any given phenothiazine derivative, the incidence and severity of such reactions depend more on individual patient sensitivity than on other factors, but dosage level and patient age are also determinants.

Extrapyramidal reactions may be alarming, and the patient should be forewarned and reassured. These reactions can usually be controlled by administration of antiparkinsonian drugs such as benztropine mesylate or intravenous caffeine and sodium benzoate injection, and by subsequent reduction in dosage.

Extrapyramidal Symptoms:

Dystonia: Class Effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

### Atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia: systematic overview and meta-regression analysis [^113Xu5ho]. BMJ (2000). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To develop an evidence base for recommendations on the use of atypical antipsychotics for patients with schizophrenia.

Design

Systematic overview and meta-regression analyses of randomised controlled trials, as a basis for formal development of guidelines.

Subjects

12 649 patients in 52 randomised trials comparing atypical antipsychotics (amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and sertindole) with conventional antipsychotics (usually haloperidol or chlorpromazine) or alternative atypical antipsychotics.

Main Outcome Measures

Overall symptom scores. Rate of drop out (as a proxy for tolerability) and of side effects, notably extrapyramidal side effects.

Results

For both symptom reduction and drop out, there was substantial heterogeneity between the results of trials, including those evaluating the same atypical antipsychotic and comparator drugs. Meta-regression suggested that dose of conventional antipsychotic explained the heterogeneity. When the dose was ≤ 12 mg/day of haloperidol (or equivalent), atypical antipsychotics had no benefits in terms of efficacy or overall tolerability, but they still caused fewer extrapyramidal side effects.

Conclusions

There is no clear evidence that atypical antipsychotics are more effective or are better tolerated than conventional antipsychotics. Conventional antipsychotics should usually be used in the initial treatment of an episode of schizophrenia unless the patient has previously not responded to these drugs or has unacceptable extrapyramidal side effects.

### Treating movement disorders and akathisia as side effects of antipsychotic pharmacotherapy [^1138CNru]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

One of the most common reasons for switching antipsychotic medication is to reduce the burden of side effects, particularly movement disorders and akathisia associated with typical antipsychotics. Adjusting the antipsychotic dose and, if necessary, switching treatment to an antipsychotic with a low extrapyramidal symptom liability may help to optimize the clinical management of schizophrenia. Switching from a typical to an atypical antipsychotic or between atypical antipsychotics involves considering a variety of factors relating to the patient, illness, medication, and the patient's environment.

### Extrapyramidal symptoms with ritonavir / indinavir plus risperidone [^116DwPkn]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of suspected extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in a patient initiated on ritonavir and indinavir while taking risperidone for a tic disorder.

Case Summary

A 35-year-old white man with AIDS received risperidone 2 mg twice daily for treatment of a Tourette's-like tic disorder. Ritonavir and indinavir were initiated, and 1 week later, he experienced significantly impaired swallowing, speaking, and breathing, and worsening of his existing tremors. Ritonavir and indinavir were discontinued. On the same day, the patient increased the risperidone dosage to 3 mg twice daily. Symptoms continued to worsen over the next 3 days. All investigations and laboratory parameters were unremarkable, and vital signs were stable. Risperidone was discontinued and clonazepam initiated. Three days later, the patient's symptoms were significantly improved.

Discussion

The symptoms described herein are consistent with neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia and potentially neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism. We believe this adverse effect occurred as a result of a drug interaction between ritonavir/indinavir and risperidone. Based on the pharmacokinetics of these medications, we hypothesize that inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 by ritonavir and indinavir may have resulted in an accumulation of the active moiety of risperidone, which may explain the occurrence of EPS in this patient.

Conclusions

This is the second published case report describing a suspected drug interaction with ritonavir, indinavir, and risperidone. Caution is warranted when risperidone is prescribed with ritonavir/indinavir, and possibly with other antiretrovirals that inhibit the same pathways.

### Extrapyramidal symptoms predict cognitive performance after first-episode psychosis [^113tPGoo]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Mild EP symptoms were common among young adults with FEP, and not merely as side-effects of antipsychotic medication, but also as a psychosis symptom dimension. Even mild EP symptoms predicted poorer neurocognitive performance at illness onset, and independently from symptom severity or antipsychotic dose. EP symptoms may slow the person down and cause motor coordination difficulties in cognitive testing, but they might also reflect a more ubiquitous state of dopaminergic modulation affecting subcortical cognitive processing. Studying cognitive domains unaffected by psychomotor slowing could further elucidate the nature of these associations.

The associations between EP symptoms at illness onset and poorer neurocognitive performance a year later also cannot be explained by the effect of EP symptoms during the testing situation. Some earlier FEP studies have found that EP symptoms at illness onset may be markers of later neurocognitive impairmentor clinical outcome, irrespective for antipsychotic treatment. This is possibly related to dopamine system dysregulation, or a disturbance in the cortical-striatal-thalamocortical neuronal network. Further studies are needed to verify whether EP symptoms at treatment onset predict impaired neurocognitive outcome.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Central Nervous System

The side effects most frequently reported with phenothiazine compounds are extrapyramidal symptoms including pseudoparkinsonism, dystonia, dyskinesia, akathisia, oculogyric crises, opisthotonos, and hyperreflexia. Most often these extrapyramidal symptoms are reversible; however, they may be persistent (see below). With any given phenothiazine derivative, the incidence and severity of such reactions depend more on individual patient sensitivity than on other factors, but dosage level and patient age are also determinants.

Extrapyramidal reactions may be alarming, and the patient should be forewarned and reassured. These reactions can usually be controlled by administration of antiparkinsonian drugs such as benztropine mesylate or intravenous caffeine and sodium benzoate injection, and by subsequent reduction in dosage.

### Antipsychotic treatment of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (ATLAS): a randomised, controlled, double-blind trial [^115Qng7X]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Although we chose to use amisulpride, a limbic-selective D 2 and D 3 antagonist, in ATLAS because it is relatively non-sedating (which helps to maintain compliance and blinding of treatment allocation), we would expect similar results with other antipsychotics. The recommended daily dose of amisulpride for patients with early onset schizophrenia is 400–800 mg, but our data show that a much lower dose (100 mg/day) can improve symptoms in patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis.

We tested 100 mg/day of amisulpride because we believed that it would be unlikely to induce important extrapyramidal side-effects, since an open-label trialhad already shown that this daily dose of amisulpride is probably effective and well tolerated in our study population. Although our data suggest a moderate increase in extrapyramidal side-effects even at this low dose, these side-effects are not of sufficient frequency or severity to affect compliance or the benefits of amisulpride, even with up to 36 weeks of treatment. This finding is consistent with results from a PET studyshowing that people with Alzheimer's disease receiving 50 mg/day amisulpride to treat psychosis symptoms had a higher occupancy of striatal dopamine receptors (40–80%) than was anticipated, which increases risk of extrapyramidal side-effects. The mean age of ATLAS participants was around 80 years, therefore exposure to high-dose antipsychotics would be expected to produce a substantially increased risk of such side-effects. These effects can be distressing and disfiguring, lead to reduced mobility and increased falls, and represent an important disincentive to both prescription and treatment adherence in this patient group. Differences between schizophrenia, psychosis in Alzheimer's disease, and very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis in antipsychotic efficacy, and the dose at which extrapyramidal side-effects appear are further evidence that these are distinct illnesses with specific treatment requirements.

On the other hand, the curve of the partial D 2 R agonist aripiprazole was relatively flat and the risk of EPS was small even at D 2 R occupancies above 85% (Fig. 3). As mentioned above, we could not estimate curves of the other partial D 2 R agonists, i.e. brexpiprazole and cariprazine, due to the lack of available formulas for these antipsychotics.

### Evolution of antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms in patients with schizophrenia in the real-life: a 4-year follow-up naturalistic study [^117K4upv]. Schizophrenia Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have shown, although not consistently, that first generation antipsychotics (FGA) are associated with a prevalence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) higher than second generation antipsychotics (SGA). We assessed the prevalence and the incidence of antipsychotic-induced EPS in a large sample of community-dwelling Italian persons with schizophrenia before and after a 4-year naturalistic treatment, to shed light on their natural evolution and to identify possible predicting factors. EPS and psychopathology were assessed in 571 subjects with schizophrenia before (baseline) and after 4-year follow-up. Patients underwent treatment with SGA and/or FGA according to the referring clinicians' judgment. Relationships between EPS and psychopathology were assessed by network analysis, while a linear multiple regression investigated factors correlated to the presence of EPS at follow-up. EPS were significantly more frequent in the FGA- than in the SGA-treated group, and patients with EPS presented a more severe psychopathology. Parkinsonism was directly and positively connected with poor emotional expression at baseline and with poor emotional expression and disorganization at follow-up. Over the 4-year follow-up, emergent EPS were more frequent in FGA-treated patients, while relieved EPS occurred more frequently in SGA-treated persons. The presence of EPS at follow-up was significantly associated with EPS at baseline, illness duration, antipsychotic generation and the daily dose of antipsychotic medications. After a 4-year naturalistic treatment, EPS disappeared more frequently in SGA-treated patients, while they emerged more frequently in FGA-treated individuals. Therefore, although SGA did not eliminate the risk of EPS, these drugs seem to be associated to a more favorable EPS natural evolution.

OVERDOSAGE

Manifestations

In general, the symptoms of overdosage would be an exaggeration of known pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions, the most prominent of which would be: 1) severe extrapyramidal reactions, 2) hypotension, or 3) sedation. The patient would appear comatose with respiratory depression and hypotension which could be severe enough to produce a shock-like state. The extrapyramidal reactions would be manifested by muscular weakness or rigidity and a generalized or localized tremor as demonstrated by the akinetic or agitans types respectively. With accidental overdosage, hypertension rather than hypotension occurred in a two-year old child. The risk of ECG changes associated with torsade de pointes should be considered. (For further information regarding torsade de pointes, please refer to ADVERSE REACTIONS .)

Treatment

Since there is no specific antidote, treatment is primarily supportive. Dialysis is not recommended in the treatment of overdose because it removes only very small amounts of haloperidol. A patent airway must be established by use of an oropharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube or, in prolonged cases of coma, by tracheostomy. Respiratory depression may be counteracted by artificial respiration and mechanical respirators. Hypotension and circulatory collapse may be counteracted by use of intravenous fluids, plasma, or concentrated albumin, and vasopressor agents such as metaraminol, phenylephrine and norepinephrine. Epinephrine must not be used. In case of severe extrapyramidal reactions, antiparkinson medication should be administered. ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for signs of QTc- interval prolongation or dysrhythmias and monitoring should continue until the ECG is normal. Severe arrhythmias should be treated with appropriate anti-arrhythmic measures.

In case of an overdose, consult a Certified Poison Control Center (1–800–222–1222).

### A European Academy of Neurology guideline on medical management issues in dementia [^111561ds]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendation

The authors conclude that there should be a weak recommendation for discontinuation in patients currently treated with antipsychotics. Discontinuation of antipsychotics may be considered in patients for whom there is no obvious indication and in patients in whom there is suspicion of side effects, such as rapid cognitive decline, sedation, falls, or extrapyramidal symptoms.

Justification for recommendations

The identified studies did not show a significant positive or detrimental effect of discontinuation of antipsychotics. Observational studies have clearly demonstrated that treatment is associated with increased mortality in patients with dementia [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59].

Supplemental considerations for treatment of agitation/aggression with antipsychotics in dementia

We believe that treatment with antipsychotics may be relevant in selected patients with agitation and/or aggression. With the recommendations in this guideline, we wish to indicate that in those patients where antipsychotics are indicated, atypical antipsychotics will often be the first‐line treatment. Most medical specialties may get involved in the decision to start or stop antipsychotic treatment. A detailed neuropsychiatric assessment including medical and drug history must be performed before initiating antipsychotic treatment.

In particular factors such as infection, dehydration, pain, pulmonary or cardiac disease, environmental factors such as changes in living conditions, and other stressors should be identified and treated adequately by non‐pharmacological approaches. We believe that a principle of watchful waiting should be adopted before initiating treatment with antipsychotics. Anti‐dementia medication (cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine) should be instituted as indicated. Communication and interaction with professional and family caregivers should be optimized. It is the opinion of the authors that antipsychotic treatment may be necessary in patients with severe agitation and/or aggression causing harm to themselves or to other people. Shared decision‐making must be emphasized, and the patient as well as a legal guardian in instances where one has been appointed must be informed about the individual risk–benefit ratio. In instances where treatment with antipsychotics is initiated, starting low with slow uptitration to the minimally effective dose or until unacceptable side effects occur is, in the opinion of the authors, paramount. Follow‐up for all patients should be planned and a preplanned stop date should be considered since symptoms may remit spontaneously. Long‐term treatment (more than 3 months) may be necessary in a minority of patients and must be monitored carefully (e.g. effects on symptoms, body weight, cognition, extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation and ECG).

### Extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics are linked to their association kinetics at dopamine dreceptors [^111YocXS]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) have been hypothesized to show reduced extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) due to their rapid dissociation from the dopamine D 2 receptor. However, support for this hypothesis is limited to a relatively small number of observations made across several decades and under different experimental conditions. Here we show that association rates, but not dissociation rates, correlate with EPS. We measured the kinetic binding properties of a series of typical and atypical APDs in a novel time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, and correlated these properties with their EPS and prolactin-elevating liabilities at therapeutic doses. EPS are robustly predicted by a rebinding model that considers the microenvironment of postsynaptic D 2 receptors and integrates association and dissociation rates to calculate the net rate of reversal of receptor blockade. Thus, optimizing binding kinetics at the D 2 receptor may result in APDs with improved therapeutic profile. Atypical antipsychotics show reduced extrapyramidal side effects compared to first generation drugs. Here the authors use time-resolved FRET to measure binding kinetics, and show that side effects correlate with drug association rates to the D 2 receptor, while dissociation rates correlate with prolactin elevation.

### Antipsychotic dose, dopamine D2 receptor occupancy and extrapyramidal side-effects: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^111EaoTy]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS) or drug-induced movement disorders, such as parkinsonism, dystonia, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia, are among the most common side-effects of antipsychotic medications that can be present in up to a third of people with schizophrenia. They can be stigmatizing and unpleasant, leading to nonadherence to treatment and the subsequent negative impacts. Moreover, they often require the use of adjunctive medications, such as anticholinergic medications, which could further increase the side-effect burden, e.g. cognitive impairment and constipation. Therefore, proper information about the risk of EPS associated with antipsychotic treatment is necessary.

The principal pathogenetic mechanism of antipsychotic-induced EPS is the blockade of the dopamine D 2 receptor (D 2 R) signalling in the nigrostriatal pathway. All current antipsychotics bind to the D 2 R, albeit with different affinities and receptor-binding profiles. According to the receptor occupancy theory, the D 2 R occupancy of an antipsychotic depends on its affinity to the D 2 R and the plasma concentration, which is associated with the administrated dose. Antipsychotic drugs typically reach maximum efficacy at doses corresponding to approximately 80% D 2 R occupancy, with higher doses beyond this threshold increasing the risk of EPS. However, the exact mechanism is more complex, and other receptors, including serotonin 5-HT 1A, 5-HT 2A, 5-HT 2c and muscarinic M 1 receptors, also play a role. Therefore, the risk of EPS varies among antipsychotics, with newer or "second-generation" antipsychotics generally having a lower risk.

While EPS may be dose-dependent, the dose-response curves remain unclear and can differ across medications. Additionally, while the above-mentioned D 2 R therapeutic window has been documented in molecular imaging studies, it has not yet been comprehensively evaluated in systematic reviews of clinical trials. To further elucidate these issues, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis on antipsychotic-induced EPS.

CNS Effects

Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)

EPS during the administration of haloperidol have been reported frequently, often during the first few days of treatment. EPS can be categorized generally as Parkinson-like symptoms, akathisia, or dystonia (including opisthotonos and oculogyric crisis). While all can occur at relatively low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity at higher doses. The symptoms may be controlled with dose reductions or administration of antiparkinson drugs such as benztropine mesylate, USP or trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride, USP. It should be noted that persistent EPS have been reported; the drug may have to be discontinued in such cases.

Dystonia

Class Effect

Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

Withdrawal Emergent Neurological Signs

Generally, patients receiving short-term therapy experience no problems with abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs. However, some patients on maintenance treatment experience transient dyskinetic signs after abrupt withdrawal. In certain of these cases the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from the syndrome described below under "Tardive Dyskinesia" except for duration. It is not known whether gradual withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs will reduce the rate of occurrence of withdrawal emergent neurological signs but until further evidence becomes available, it seems reasonable to gradually withdraw use of haloperidol.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials in adult subjects with schizophrenia (reported in 5% or more of subjects treated with paliperidone and at least twice the placebo rate in any of the dose groups) were extrapyramidal symptoms, tachycardia, and akathisia. The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials in adult patients with schizoaffective disorder (reported in 5% or more of subjects treated with paliperidone and at least twice the placebo rate) were extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, dyspepsia, constipation, weight increased, and nasopharyngitis.

The most common adverse reactions that were associated with discontinuation from clinical trials in adult subjects with schizophrenia (causing discontinuation in 2% of paliperidone-treated subjects) were nervous system disorders. The most common adverse reactions that were associated with discontinuation from clinical trials in adult subjects with schizoaffective disorder were gastrointestinal disorders, which resulted in discontinuation in 1% of paliperidone-treated subjects. [See Adverse Reactions (6.4)].

The safety of paliperidone was evaluated in 1205 adult subjects with schizophrenia who participated in three placebo-controlled, 6-week, double-blind trials, of whom 850 subjects received paliperidone at fixed doses ranging from 3 mg to 12 mg once daily. The information presented in this section was derived from pooled data from these three trials. Additional safety information from the placebo-controlled phase of the long-term maintenance study, in which subjects received paliperidone at daily doses within the range of 3 mg to 15 mg (n = 104), is also included.

### Antipsychotic drugs and extrapyramidal side effects in first episode psychosis: a systematic review of head-head comparisons [^11522qag]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

This systematic review aimed to determine whether the risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) differed between antipsychotic drugs used in first episode psychosis (FEP). We identified 11 RCTs comparing two or more antipsychotics in FEP and reporting on EPS. All trials assessed one or more second generation antipsychotics (SGAs), one assessed chlorpromazine, one zuclopenthixol and seven trials assessed haloperidol. Assessment and reporting of EPS varied. Compared with one or more SGA comparators, haloperidol was associated with significantly higher rates/severity of parkinsonism (seven trials) and akathisia (six trials) and greater use of anticholinergics (five trials) and beta-blockers (two trials). Two trials with low-dose haloperidol (≤ 4 mg) showed significantly worse EPS outcomes versus a SGA. Two of four long-term haloperidol trials (≥ 1 year) found a higher dyskinesia-risk with haloperidol versus olanzapine and risperidone respectively; the remaining two trials found no difference (various SGA comparators). There was an EPS advantage for clozapine versus chlorpromazine (one trial) and risperidone versus zuclopenthixol (one trial). There was little evidence of EPS-differences between SGAs, possibly reflecting use of low doses. We conclude that SGAs offer an EPS advantage over FGAs in FEP though the evidence largely relates to comparisons with haloperidol. Standardized assessment and reporting of EPS would assist future research.

### Risperidone versus haloperidol in psychotic patients with disturbing neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms: a double-blind, multi-center trial [^112dXtY4]. Schizophrenia Research (2000). Low credibility.

Background

A randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial was started to compare the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) during risperidone and haloperidol treatment in schizophrenic patients who had disturbing EPS during their previous neuroleptic treatment. Additional objectives of this trial were comparing the antipsychotic effectiveness of the two treatments and the use of antiparkinsonian medication.

Methods

Effects of flexible doses of risperidone and haloperidol were compared in 77 psychotic patients (83% with chronic schizophrenia) with disturbing neuroleptic-induced EPS (risperidone 40 patients, haloperidol 37). The trial was completed by 47 patients: 25 in the risperidone group (12 women, 13 men), and 22 in the haloperidol group (10 women, 12 men).

Results

An adequate antipsychotic effect was obtained in most patients by both treatments. The primary aim of this trial was comparing parkinsonism measured with the extrapyramidal syndrome rating scale (ESRS) during treatment with risperidone and haloperidol. Two primary parameters were selected: the change from baseline to the worst score during treatment of ESRS II (parkinsonism) and ESRS VI (clinical global impression of severity of parkinsonism). The CGI of severity of parkinsonism was better with risperidone (P = 0.025), while the parkinsonism total score tended to be better with risperidone (P < 0. 10). Before the double-blind treatment, 34 (of the 77) had used antiparkinson medication (risperidone 18, haloperidol 16). During the double-blind treatment phase, 21 patients had used antiparkinson medication (risperidone 11, haloperidol 10). The larger reduction of parkinsonism in the risperidone group was not due to a difference in the use of anti-parkinsonian medication.

Conclusions

In this group of schizophrenic patients with disturbing EPS during previous neuroleptic treatment, a stronger reduction of parkinsonism was observed with risperidone than with haloperidol.

Acute dystonic reactions occur in approximately 1 in 500 patients treated with the usual adult dosages of 30 to 40 mg/day of metoclopramide. These usually are seen during the first 24 to 48 hours of treatment with metoclopramide, occur more frequently in pediatric patients and adult patients less than 30 years of age and are even more frequent at the higher doses used in prophylaxis of vomiting due to cancer chemotherapy. These symptoms may include involuntary movements of limbs and facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, or dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Rarely, dystonic reactions may present as stridor and dyspnea, possibly due to laryngospasm. If these symptoms should occur, inject 50 mg Benadryl®(diphenhydramine hydrochloride) intramuscularly, and they usually will subside. Cogentin®(benztropine mesylate), 1 to 2 mg intramuscularly, may also be used to reverse these reactions.

Tardive Dyskinesia (see Boxed Warnings)

Treatment with metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), a potentially irreversible and disfiguring disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, or extremities. The risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose. An analysis of utilization patterns showed that about 20% of patients who used metoclopramide took it longer than 12 weeks. Treatment with metoclopramide for longer than the recommended 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases where therapeutic benefit is thought to outweigh the risk of developing TD.

### World psychiatric association pharmacopsychiatry section statement on comparative effectiveness of antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia [^111isK6d]. Schizophrenia Research (2008). Low credibility.

Data from two major government-funded studies of comparative antipsychotic effectiveness in schizophrenia contradict the widely prevalent belief that the newer second-generation medications are vastly superior to the older first-generation drugs. This has caused uncertainty among patients, clinicians and policy-makers about the relative utility of first- and second- generation antipsychotic agents in its treatment. To reduce confusion and provide a contextual understanding of the new data, the World Psychiatry Association Section on Pharmacopsychiatry comprehensively reviewed the literature on the comparative effectiveness of different antipsychotic treatments for schizophrenia and developed this update. Utilizing data from the approximately 1,600 randomized controlled trials of antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia, we applied the two indirect and one direct method to comparing the effectiveness of 62 currently-available antipsychotic agents. The subclasses of 51 first-generation and 11 second-generation antipsychotics were both found to be very heterogeneous, with substantial differences in side-effect profiles among members. Second-generation antipsychotic agents were found to be inconsistently more effective than first-generation agents in alleviating negative, cognitive, and depressive symptoms and had a lower liability to cause tardive dyskinesia; these modest benefits were principally driven by the ability of second-generation antipsychotics to provide equivalent improvement in positive symptoms along with a lower risk of causing extrapyramidal side-effects. Clozapine was found to be more efficacious than other agents in treatment-refractory schizophrenia. There were no consistent differences in efficacy among other second-generation antipsychotic agents; if such differences exist, they are likely small in magnitude. Dosing was found to be a key variable in optimizing effectiveness of both first- and second- generation antipsychotic agents. There was enormous individual variability in antipsychotic response and vulnerability to various adverse effects. In contrast to their relatively similar efficacy in treating positive symptoms, there were substantial differences among both first- and second- generation antipsychotic agents with regard to their propensity to cause extrapyramidal, metabolic and other adverse effects; second-generation agents have a lower liability to cause acute extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia along with a tendency to cause greater metabolic side-effects than first-generation agents. Based on these data about the comparative effectiveness of different antipsychotic treatment options, we summarize elements of current best antipsychotic practice for the treatment of schizophrenia and discuss the role of government and the pharmaceutical industry in obtaining and disseminating information which can facilitate best practice.

### Precise treatments for schizophrenia: where is the way forward? [^1139hCUr]. General Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Comparing the characteristics of the first-generation and second-generation antipsychotic drugs, one can conclude that the biggest difference between them is in their adverse reactions. Based on the features of receptors, the pharmacological mechanism of the first-generation antipsychotic drugs is the antagonism of D2 dopamine receptor. Its common adverse reactions are extrapyramidal side effects, increasing prolactin and so on. The pharmacological mechanism of the second-generation antipsychotic drugs is the antagonism of 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor/D2 dopamine receptor. Its common adverse reaction is metabolic disturbance, such as weight gain, blood sugar increase, hyperlipoidaemia and so forth. The effectiveness of the first-generation and second-generation antipsychotic drugs is equivalent, but their adverse reactions are revealed in different aspects. Therefore, the precise prediction of antipsychotic drugs' adverse reaction is probably a feasible option for the current precise treatments for schizophrenia. For instance, a recent genome-wide association study that employs the research sample of CATIE points out that the weight gain caused by the second-generation antipsychotic drugs is associated with the OGFRL1 gene. According to a series of studies on patients with schizophrenia who take clozapine for a long term, we have found that the metabolism syndrome led by clozapine is related to the COMT gene, that the effect which BDNF gene has on this kind of adverse reaction has a sex difference, and that the C3 gene can effectively predict whether patients who take clozapine are suffering from hyperlipoidaemia or not.

In conclusion, precise medicine combines the knowledge and technical system of modern medicine technology, and has revealed trends in the development of modern medicine: from simplicity to complexity and from complexity to precision. Due to the complexity of schizophrenia, patients need long-term medication treatments. Evidence-based medicine indicates that the effectiveness of different types of antipsychotic drugs is equivalent, and that the current technical methods cannot achieve precise treatments based on effective prediction at the moment. However, the adverse reactions of different types of antipsychotic drugs are clear. If we employ the current precise detection methods, we can choose medication for treatments based on patients' susceptibility to certain adverse reactions. This may offer new thinking about precise treatments for schizophrenia. There are a lot of efforts needed in researching precise treatments for schizophrenia, and these efforts need to be made by clinical doctors and researchers together. Only after we overcome all those difficulties can precise medicine have a bright future in the psychiatric field.

For subjects with schizoaffective disorder, there was no dose-related increase in EPS observed for parkinsonism with the Simpson-Angus scale or akathisia with the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale. There was a dose-related increase observed with spontaneous EPS reports of hyperkinesia and dystonia and in the use of anticholinergic medications.

### Antipsychotic dose, dopamine D2 receptor occupancy and extrapyramidal side-effects: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^1167y5C4]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The analysis has certain limitations. First, we defined our primary outcome post-hoc as the number of participants receiving antiparkinsonian medications and used other proxies when data were not available. This decision was made in order to provide a comprehensive analysis and increase the power to estimate dose-response relationships. We gave preference to the use of antiparkinsonian medications as a measure of global EPS, as it was often used in previous analyses. We also prioritised dichotomous outcomes over scale-derived data due to skewness. In a sensitivity analysis comparing dichotomous to scale-derived data (by estimating ORs from SMDs), we found that effect sizes were generally smaller for the latter (eAppendix 7). This could be potentially attributed to skewness (e.g. large SDs may dilute SMDs) and/or the transient nature of EPS during the study, resulting in small mean changes from baseline to endpoint. A previous dose-response meta-analysis analysed only scale-derived data, which could also explain some of the differences in the findings with the current analysis.

Second, the term "EPS" is an umbrella term of heterogenous treatment-emergent movement disorders that could have different etiopathogeneses and require different treatments. Our study primarily focused on parkinsonism and other movement disorders that could be treated with anticholinergic medications. Thus, the findings cannot be directly extrapolated to akathisia and tardive dyskinesia that have different pathogenetic mechanisms and need for distinct interventions. For this reason, we conducted a separate dose-response meta-analysis on antipsychotic-induced akathisia, which revealed often but not always differing shapes of dose-response curves between akathisia and EPS. This may also be relevant for antipsychotics like aripiprazole that have a clinically-important risk of akathisia, albeit a generally small risk of EPS. In particular, we found that the risk of akathisia reached a plateau of OR = 1.8–2.0 at approximately 10–15 mg/d of aripiprazole, whereas the risk of EPS was trivial OR = 1.2–1.3 at these doses, but slightly increased up to OR = 1.57 at 30 mg/d (Fig. 2).

### Serotonin syndrome caused by selective serotonin reuptake-inhibitors-metoclopramide interaction [^113PJKAn]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To report 2 cases of serotonin syndrome with serious extrapyramidal movement disorders occurring when metoclopramide was coadministered with sertraline or venlafaxine.

Case Summary

A 72-year-old white woman was treated with sertraline for depression for 18 months and was then admitted to the hospital with a fractured tibia. She was administered metoclopramide because of nausea and, within 2 hours, developed agitation, dysarthria, diaphoresis, and a movement disorder. These symptoms recurred following 2 subsequent administrations of metoclopramide. Treatment with diazepam led to resolution of symptoms within 6 hours, and there was no recurrence at 6 weeks' follow-up. A 32-year-old white woman with major depression was treated with venlafaxine for 3 years. She was admitted following a fall and, after being given metoclopramide, developed movement disorder and a period of unresponsiveness. After a second dose of metoclopramide, these symptoms recurred and were associated with confusion, agitation, fever, diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypertension. She improved with administration of diazepam, but needed repetition of this treatment over the next 16 hours. Symptoms resolved within 2 days, and she continued venlafaxine with no further adverse effects.

Discussion

Both cases met Stembach's criteria for serotonin syndrome and had serious extrapyramidal movement disorders. The possible pathophysiologic mechanisms for the adverse reactions include a single-drug effect, a pharmacodynamic interaction, and a pharmacokinetic interaction. We believe that a pharmacodynamic interaction is most likely.

Conclusions

Clinicians should be aware of a risk of serotonin syndrome with serious extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving sertraline or venlafaxine when metoclopramide is coadministered even in a single, conventional dose.

### Atypical laryngeal dystonia caused by an antiemetic… [^111br1kg]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

to the editor: Antiemetics that block dopamine receptors are known to potentially cause all of the side effects associated with antipsychotic medications: akathisia, extra-pyramidal side effects, and acute dystonic reactions. 1 Acute dystonic reactions are often dramatic and are potentially life threatening if the closing of the larynx causes asphyxia. Reports of milder or atypical variants of this reaction are rare. 2 This case report describes a patient who has throat discomfort and aphonia as atypical observations of laryngeal dystonia. These subtle manifestations often may be overlooked. A 36-year-old woman with no history of psychiatric problems and no previous exposure to antipsychotic drugs was prescribed prochlorperazine, 10 mg four times daily, for residual nausea following aborted treatment with erythromycin for upper respiratory symptoms.

She had taken three doses of prochlorperazine over 24 hours when she had to stop lecturing her college class because her voice gave out and became a mere whisper. She described no other symptoms such as muscle stiffness, neck stiffness, difficulty breathing, or problems with her eyes. Several hours later, the throat discomfort had completely resolved, and she had no further difficulties with her voice. She continued taking 50 mg of diphenhydramine twice daily for another three days. The time-course and treatment-response of this patient's symptoms are highly suggestive of acute dystonia. As opposed to the treatment given in her case, the optimal treatment of an acute dystonic reaction involves administering parenteral benztropine or parenteral diphenhydramine. 3 Once successfully begun, the anticholinergic or antihistaminergic treatment should be continued orally for another two or three days to prevent recurrence.

I proffer the term "Hot Cup-Of-Tea Sign" for subtle laryngeal dystonia experienced merely as throat discomfort. Use of this term might help to increase the recognition of manifestations other than oculogyric crisis and opisthotonus for acute dystonic reactions. The small but definite risk of the serious reaction of laryngeal dystonia with antidopaminergic antiemetics should be considered before using these agents. Most nonpsychiatric patients are by default neuroleptic-naïve and, thus, potentially sensitive to dopamine blockers.

### Prevalence of and risk factors for extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics: results from the national FACE-SZ cohort [^113gLxW3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) have been identified as a complication of antipsychotic treatment. Previous meta-analyses have investigated EPS prevalence and risk factors in randomized clinical trials with highly selected patients, but studies in real-world schizophrenia are missing.

Objective

To examine the prevalence and clinical correlates associated with EPS in a nonselected national multicenter sample of stabilized patients with schizophrenia.

Methods

Between 2010 and 2016, patients suffering from schizophrenia (DSM-IV-TR criteria) were recruited through the FondaMental Academic Centers of Expertise for Schizophrenia (FACE-SZ) network and data were collected during a comprehensive 1-day-long standardized evaluation. The Simpson-Angus Scale and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale were used to assess drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) and tardive dyskinesia, respectively.

Results

The overall prevalence of DIP and tardive dyskinesia was 13.2% and 8.3%, respectively, in this community-dwelling sample of 674 patients. DIP was associated with negative symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] subscore) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.102, P < .001), first-generation antipsychotic prescription (aOR = 2.038, P = 0.047), and anticholinergic drug administration (aOR = 2.103, P = 0.017) independently of sex, age, disorganization (PANSS disorganized factor), and antipsychotic polytherapy. Tardive dyskinesia was associated with PANSS disorganized factor (aOR = 1.103, P = 0.049) independently of sex, age, negative symptoms, excitation, first-generation antipsychotic prescription, and benzodiazepine and anticholinergic drug administration.

Conclusions

Our results indicate the high prevalence of EPS in a nonselected community-dwelling clinically stable sample of outpatients with schizophrenia. In the monitoring of antipsychotic treatment, EPS should be systematically evaluated, especially when negative symptoms and disorganization or cognitive alteration are present. Monotherapy with a second-generation antipsychotic should be preferentially initiated for patients with these side effects.

### Genome-wide association study identified six loci associated with adverse drug reactions to aripiprazole in schizophrenia patients [^115WSVPC]. Schizophrenia (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder with high inheritability. It mainly manifests in clinical emotion, thinking, cognition, behavior and social functions. Epidemiological investigation shows that the prevalence rate of schizophrenia in the general population is approximately 1%, and it usually starts slowly or onset at a young age and lasts for one's lifetime. The process of schizophrenia is prolonged and repeated, which can lead to mental disability and bring a heavy burden to patients, family members and society. Due to the heterogeneity of the disease, the exact pathological mechanism of schizophrenia has not been clearly elucidated. It is generally believed that both genetic susceptibility and environmental factors play roles in the occurrence and development of the disease. Antipsychotic drugs can relieve patients' clinical symptoms, but approximately 75% of patients have given up treatment due to poor efficacy or side effects of drugs. Common adverse drug reactions to antipsychotics include extrapyramidal effects, headache, weight gain, and QTc prolongation. Environmental factors, biological factors and therapeutic strategies may be the fickle factors behind the difference in adverse drug effects. Serious adverse effects bring inconvenience and psychological pain to patients. Studying pharmacogenetics and identifying the genetic factors within adverse drug reactions can help us develop personalized medication guidance and cope with serious adverse symptoms. Among different adverse drug reactions, the symptoms derived from the motor and nervous systems are particularly complex. Therefore, a clear and standardized monotherapy design can help us analyze the underlying mechanisms of movement-related adverse reactions.

Comparison of symptoms between EPS group and non-EPS group

After adjusting for covariates including age, duration since first prescribed antipsychotics and illness duration, the EPS group had higher scores of the PANSS negative total score (17.4 (7.4) vs 20.8 (7.9), F = 21.75, p < 0.001), PANSS general psychopathological total score (32.3 (10.7) vs 35.3 (10.3), F = 13.67, p = 0.001), PANSS total score (65.7 (21.2) vs 71.7 (20.1), F = 13.671, p = 0.001) and CDSS total score (2.3 (3.7) vs 2 (3.8), F = 5.953, p = 0.015) than the non-EPS group, and there was no significant difference in the scores of the positive scales between the two groups. The results are shown in table 5.

### Assessing and maximizing the safety and tolerability of antipsychotics used in the treatment of children and adolescents [^113kLvMe]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

When taking antipsychotic medications, children and adolescents seem to have a higher risk than adults for experiencing adverse events such as extrapyramidal symptoms, prolactin elevation, sedation, weight gain, and metabolic effects. Side effects may be predicted by the pharmacologic binding profiles of antipsychotics to certain neuroreceptors. Data from 7 recently completed randomized placebo-controlled trials in adolescent schizophrenia and pediatric bipolar disorder that included a total of 1480 patients extend prior results and provide numbers-needed-to-harm as a clinically useful measure of risk. Results from these pediatric studies indicate that adverse effect profiles differ among commonly used antipsychotics. However, more detailed data are needed, as information is lacking regarding carryover or withdrawal effects from prior medications and regarding the masking of effects by adjunctive treatments used to treat agitation, insomnia, or extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia in these studies. Moreover, randomized head-to-head trials and large-scale studies that investigate predictors of adverse effects as well as the safety and efficacy of interventions aimed at preventing and reversing negative effects of antipsychotics with relevant impact on psychological, psychiatric, and physical functioning are lacking. When choosing an antipsychotic treatment, patients and their families should be included in a careful risk-benefit assessment. Consideration of adverse effects, as well as dietary and lifestyle counseling, should be part of any antipsychotic treatment initiation and continuation. Routine, proactive monitoring of side effects is essential to optimize patient outcomes. In all treatment decisions, the benefits of improving often severe and debilitating manic, psychotic, and aggressive symptomatology must be balanced against the varying risks of adverse effects associated with specific antipsychotic agents in child and adolescent patients.

### Detecting and managing adverse effects of antipsychotic medications: current state of play [^116G44Vj]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Antipsychotics are some of the most frequently prescribed medications not only for psychotic disorders and symptoms but also for a wide range of on-label and off-label indications. Because second-generation antipsychotics have largely replaced first-generation antipsychotics as first-line options due to their substantially decreased risk of extrapyramidal side effects, attention has shifted to other clinically concerning adverse events associated with antipsychotic therapy. The focus of this article is to update the nonextrapyramidal side effects associated with second-generation antipsychotics. Issues surrounding diagnosis and monitoring as well as clinical management are addressed.

OVERDOSAGE

(See also under ADVERSE REACTIONS)

Primarily involvement of the extrapyramidal mechanism producing
some of the dystonic reactions described above. Symptoms of central nervous
system depression to the point of somnolence or coma. Agitation and restlessness
may also occur. Other possible manifestations include convulsions, EKG changes
and cardiac arrhythmias, fever, and autonomic reactions such as hypotension, dry
mouth and ileus.

It is important to determine other medications taken by the
patient since multiple dose therapy is common in overdosage situations.
Treatment is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Early gastric lavage is
helpful. Keep patient under observation and maintain an open airway, since
involvement of the extrapyramidal mechanism may produce dysphagia and
respiratory difficulty in severe overdosage. Do not attempt to
induce emesis because a dystonic reaction of the head or neck may develop that
could result in aspiration of vomitus. Extrapyramidal symptoms may be
treated with anti-parkinsonism drugs, barbiturates, or diphenhydramine
hydrochloride. See prescribing information for these products. Care should be
taken to avoid increasing respiratory depression. If administration of a
stimulant is desirable, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, or caffeine with sodium
benzoate is recommended. Stimulants that may cause convulsions (e.g., picrotoxin
or pentylenetetrazol) should be avoided.

If hypotension occurs, the standard measures for managing circulatory shock
should be initiated. If it is desirable to administer a vasoconstrictor,
norepinephrine bitartrate and phenylephrine HCl are most suitable. Other pressor
agents, including epinephrine, are not recommended because phenothiazine
derivatives may reverse the usual elevating action of these agents and cause a
further lowering of blood pressure.

Limited experience indicates that phenothiazines are not dialyzable.

### Movement disorders associated with neuroleptic treatment [^111XS5dZ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Neuroleptic-induced movement disorders, or extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), can be classified into acute and tardive syndromes. Among the former are parkinsonism, dystonia, and akathisia. Conventional neuroleptics that have traditionally been used to treat psychiatric disorders are often associated with EPS. The newer atypical antipsychotics provide a more promising treatment strategy for psychiatric disorders and have a lower potential for producing EPS than conventional neuroleptics.

Sensitivity analyses

We only conducted sensitivity analyses in chronically-ill patients with schizophrenia, since we had sparse data in predominant negative symptoms and first-episode schizophrenia. The results did not materially change in sensitivity analyses, yet some analyses had limited power, i.e. comparisons between different formulations. A more detailed discussion is provided in eAppendix 7. Notably, there were some differences in the magnitude of odds ratios (ORs) across the different outcome measures for extrapyramidal side-effects, and particularly, ORs derived from scale-derived data tended to be smaller than from the number of patients receiving antiparkinsonian medication or those with at least one EPS (eAppendix 7). Nevertheless, their dose-response curves had generally similar shapes.

### Risperidone (Rykindo) [^112iS5jS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dose Dependency of Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials

Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)

Two methods were used to measure EPS in the 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing three doses of risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) (25 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg) with placebo in patients with schizophrenia: (1) the incidence of spontaneous reports of EPS symptoms; and (2) the change from baseline to endpoint on the total score (sum of the subscale scores for parkinsonism, dystonia, and dyskinesia) of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS).

The overall incidence of EPS-related adverse reactions (akathisia, dystonia, parkinsonism, and tremor) in patients treated with 25 mg risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular)was comparable to that of patients treated with placebo; the incidence of EPS-related adverse reactions was higher in patients treated with 50 mg risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) (Table 4).

The median change from baseline to endpoint in total ESRS score showed no worsening in patients treated with risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) compared with patients treated with placebo: 0 (placebo group); -1 (25-mg group, significantly less than the placebo group); and 0 (50-mg group).

Dystonia

Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include neck muscle spasms, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

### Clinical predictors of extrapyramidal symptoms associated with aripiprazole augmentation for the treatment of late-life depression in a randomized controlled trial [^1113zazL]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Augmentation with aripiprazole is an effective pharmacotherapy for treatment-resistant late-life depression (LLD). However, aripiprazole can cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as akathisia and parkinsonism; these symptoms are distressing and can contribute to treatment discontinuation. We investigated the clinical trajectories and predictors of akathisia and parkinsonism in older patients receiving aripiprazole augmentation for treatment-resistant LLD.

Methods

Between 2009 and 2013, depressed older adults who did not remit with venlafaxine were randomized to aripiprazole or placebo in a 12-week trial. Participants were 60 years or older and met DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depressive episode with at least moderate symptoms. The presence of akathisia and parkinsonism was measured at each visit using the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) and Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS), respectively. In an exploratory analysis, we examined a broad set of potential clinical predictors and correlates: age, sex, ethnicity, weight, medical comorbidity, baseline anxiety severity, depression severity, concomitant medications including rescue medications, and aripiprazole dosage.

Results

Twenty-four (26.7%) of 90 participants randomized to aripiprazole and who had akathisia scores available developed akathisia compared to 11 (12.2%) of 90 randomized to placebo. Greater depression severity was the main predictor of treatment-emergent akathisia. Most participants who developed akathisia improved over time, especially with reductions in dosage. Fifteen (16.5%) of 91 participants taking aripiprazole and who had parkinsonism scores available developed parkinsonism, but no clinical predictors or correlates were identified.

Conclusions

Akathisia is a common side effect of aripiprazole, but it is typically mild and responds to dose reduction. Patients with greater baseline depression may warrant closer monitoring for akathisia. More research is needed to understand the course and predictors of treatment-emergent EPS with antipsychotic augmentation for treatment-resistant LLD.
