## Question

What is the spectrum of activity of piperacillin-tazobactam against Gram-negative bacteria?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the spectrum of activity of piperacillin-tazobactam against Gram-negative bacteria, with clear distinctions between in vitro coverage, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic constraints, resistance mechanisms, and guideline-directed clinical use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic mechanism of action and labeled spectrum. Then, I should verify current susceptibility breakpoints and what changed in 2022–2023 and why. Next, I will examine resistance mechanisms that limit activity, especially ESBLs and AmpC. After that, I should review organism-specific coverage and key exclusions. Finally, I will align this with IDSA and CLSI guidance on when piperacillin-tazobactam is appropriate versus when to avoid it, including dosing and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacology and labeled Gram-negative spectrum so I don't miss the basics: piperacillin inhibits cell wall synthesis and provides broad Gram-negative coverage, while tazobactam is a reversible inhibitor of class A β-lactamases but has minimal direct antibacterial activity. Together, activity is generally broad against Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and some nonfermenters, with additional activity against anaerobes like Bacteroides spp, though I should confirm organism-level nuances shortly [^113TLro1] [^112HtcYz].

> Wait, let me verify the exact labeled organisms so I don't overstate coverage: FDA labeling lists Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (often in combination with an aminoglycoside when clinically indicated), Acinetobacter baumannii, and Haemophilus influenzae among Gram-negatives, and the anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis group; I should also remember that "most isolates" is a key qualifier, so exceptions exist in real-world resistance landscapes [^113TLro1] [^112HtcYz].

> Hold on, I should verify current susceptibility breakpoints because these drive whether an isolate that tests "susceptible" is truly treatable with standard or extended-infusion regimens: in 2022, CLSI revised Enterobacterales breakpoints to ≤ 8/4 µg/mL susceptible, 16/4 µg/mL susceptible-dose dependent, and ≥ 32/4 µg/mL resistant, with SDD contingent on extended-infusion strategies. This change was driven by PK/PD modeling and clinical failure signals in the MERINO trial and aligns with FDA's endorsement of the lower breakpoints [^115wwDiV] [^117E5oK5] [^115WD9fe].

> I need to check Pseudomonas breakpoints too, because the wild-type MIC distribution differs: CLSI updated P. aeruginosa breakpoints in 2023, keeping susceptible at ≤ 16/4 µg/mL and narrowing the intermediate to 32/4 µg/mL, reflecting the higher wild-type ECV of ~16 µg/mL and the fact that MICs above 16/4 µg/mL are not reliably overcome by any infusion strategy. This matters for empiric choices and source-control infections where PK/PD is harder to achieve [^112HnVN5] [^117E5oK5].

> Let me consider the ESBL issue carefully, since that is the crux of many decisions: piperacillin-tazobactam can appear active in vitro against many ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, especially CTX-M–type producers, but clinical outcomes lag behind in vitro susceptibility. The MERINO randomized trial showed significantly higher 30-day mortality with piperacillin-tazobactam versus meropenem for ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible E. coli/Klebsiella bacteremia, and IDSA 2023–2024 guidance recommends carbapenems over piperacillin-tazobactam for ESBL bloodstream infections and for most non-urinary ESBL infections, even when in vitro testing shows susceptibility [^112BoJV8] [^115rp3Xo] [^113tN5kt].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said piperacillin-tazobactam should never be used for ESBL infections — let me correct that nuance: IDSA allows that if piperacillin-tazobactam was started empirically for uncomplicated cystitis and the patient is improving, it may be continued. For pyelonephritis or complicated UTIs, some data suggest noninferiority to carbapenems, but IDSA still prefers carbapenems given concerns about PK/PD and clinical failure in higher-inoculum or more invasive disease, so any decision to continue piperacillin-tazobactam in cUTI should weigh MIC, patient stability, and local epidemiology [^112qCGNZ] [^113u3k1t].

> Next, I should review AmpC producers because tazobactam is less reliable against inducible chromosomal AmpC: for Enterobacter spp, Citrobacter freundii, and Klebsiella aerogenes with moderate-to-high inducible AmpC risk, piperacillin-tazobactam is not recommended for serious infections. Tazobactam's inhibition of AmpC is inconsistent, and both IDSA and USCAST advise avoiding piperacillin-tazobactam in these settings in favor of carbapenems or cefepime when appropriate [^112d2hpi] [^116fZSqa] [^116eM4dX].

> I should double-check organism-specific coverage so I don't overgeneralize: piperacillin-tazobactam remains a reasonable empiric option for broad Gram-negative coverage including Pseudomonas in abdominal, skin/soft tissue, and pneumonia syndromes, with strong activity against most E. coli and Klebsiella and adequate activity against many Proteus, Morganella, Serratia, and Citrobacter, while recognizing local resistance patterns. However, for severe infections where Pseudomonas is suspected, combination with an aminoglycoside is often used initially, and activity against Acinetobacter is variable, so definitive therapy should be guided by susceptibilities and clinical response [^113TLro1] [^1124zX7H] [^115aJDVG].

> Let me verify dosing strategies because breakpoints alone are not enough: for Enterobacterales with MICs up to 8/4 µg/mL, standard intermittent dosing is usually sufficient. For MIC 16/4 µg/mL, extended-infusion strategies are required to achieve PK/PD targets. For P. aeruginosa, the wild-type MIC distribution means many isolates require extended infusion even at the susceptible breakpoint, and critically ill patients with augmented renal clearance often need higher frequencies or therapeutic drug monitoring to avoid subtherapeutic exposures [^117E5oK5] [^113CiDae] [^113Gh86D].

> Hold on, I should verify testing pitfalls that can mislead clinical decisions: susceptibility testing for piperacillin-tazobactam is prone to error, especially around MIC 16 µg/mL, with substantial very major and minor error rates in disk diffusion and even automated systems. Discordance between local AST and reference broth microdilution was evident in MERINO and has been repeatedly flagged, so clinicians should confirm MICs when results are borderline or the clinical stakes are high [^115ViPVh] [^112mtfbS].

> But wait, what if I'm relying on older breakpoints — do they still apply? I need to ensure laboratories are using the 2022 CLSI Enterobacterales breakpoints and the 2023 P. aeruginosa breakpoints, because failure to update can falsely categorize 10–20% of resistant isolates as susceptible, leading to undertreatment and worse outcomes; coordination with the microbiology lab is essential [^113vGrA3] [^117E5oK5].

> Let me reconsider carbapenem-sparing narratives: while stewardship often seeks to avoid carbapenems, the balance of evidence and guidance supports carbapenems as first-line for ESBL bloodstream infections and for serious non-urinary ESBL infections. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be considered for low-severity UTIs with low MICs, but that is a nuanced, patient-specific decision rather than a generalizable carbapenem-sparing rule [^115rp3Xo] [^113tN5kt] [^112qCGNZ].

> I will now examine the bottom line and ensure internal consistency: piperacillin-tazobactam provides broad in vitro Gram-negative coverage and remains a staple for empiric therapy in abdominal, skin/soft tissue, and pneumonia syndromes where Pseudomonas and anaerobes are concerns, but its reliability wanes against ESBL and AmpC producers and against higher-MIC P. aeruginosa. Contemporary breakpoints, organism-specific risk, infection severity, source control, and optimized dosing with TDM are the pillars of safe and effective use, and carbapenems or newer β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations should be favored when resistance risk is high or clinical stakes are high [^113TLro1] [^112qCGNZ] [^112HnVN5] [^113Gh86D].

---

Piperacillin-tazobactam provides **broad coverage** against Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacterales (e.g. E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Enterobacter, Serratia) and antipseudomonal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^113TLro1] [^113cwk5C]. It is **active against many ESBL-producing Enterobacterales**, though susceptibility varies and clinical outcomes may be inferior to carbapenems in severe infections [^113L9Jv2] [^112BoJV8]. Activity against AmpC producers is limited; **tazobactam poorly inhibits AmpC**, so piperacillin-tazobactam is not recommended for serious infections caused by Enterobacter, Citrobacter, or Serratia [^114sctJP] [^112d2hpi]. It lacks reliable activity against carbapenemase producers (e.g. KPC, NDM, OXA-48) and is inactive against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia complex [^notfound]. For severe ESBL or AmpC infections, carbapenems are preferred; piperacillin-tazobactam may be considered for susceptible urinary infections or as part of combination therapy for P. aeruginosa [^112qCGNZ] [^115rp3Xo].

---

## Spectrum of activity against Gram-negative bacteria

Piperacillin-tazobactam exhibits **broad-spectrum activity** against many Gram-negative bacteria, including:

- **Enterobacterales**: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter species, Serratia marcescens, and others [^113TLro1] [^113cwk5C].
- **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**: Active, often used with an aminoglycoside for severe infections [^113TLro1] [^114ENcgQ].
- **Acinetobacter species**: Limited activity; susceptibility varies [^1124jfZV].
- **Haemophilus influenzae**: Active, excluding β-lactamase negative, ampicillin-resistant isolates [^113TLro1] [^1119eYuQ].

---

## Activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms

Piperacillin-tazobactam has **variable activity** against ESBL-producing Enterobacterales [^115GceKr]. While tazobactam inhibits many ESBLs, clinical outcomes may be inferior to carbapenems in severe infections. The MERINO trial found higher 30-day mortality with piperacillin-tazobactam than meropenem for ESBL bloodstream infections, particularly when MICs were ≥ 32/4 µg/mL [^112BoJV8] [^115ViPVh]. Current guidance recommends **carbapenems as first-line therapy** for severe ESBL infections, with piperacillin-tazobactam reserved for susceptible urinary tract infections or low-risk scenarios [^112qCGNZ] [^115rp3Xo].

---

## Activity against AmpC beta-lactamase producing organisms

Piperacillin-tazobactam has **limited activity** against AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (e.g. Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Serratia) because tazobactam poorly inhibits AmpC enzymes [^112d2hpi]. Clinical studies show higher failure rates with piperacillin-tazobactam for serious AmpC infections; carbapenems or cefepime are preferred alternatives [^114sctJP] [^113XuxMz].

---

## Activity against carbapenemase-producing organisms

Piperacillin-tazobactam is **inactive against carbapenemase producers** (e.g. KPC, NDM, OXA-48) because tazobactam does not inhibit these enzymes [^113TLro1]. Alternative agents such as ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, or cefiderocol are recommended for these infections [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines provide the following recommendations for piperacillin-tazobactam use in Gram-negative infections:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (severe infections) | Carbapenems preferred; piperacillin-tazobactam not recommended [^112qCGNZ] [^115rp3Xo] |
| ESBL-producing urinary tract infections | Piperacillin-tazobactam may be considered if susceptible [^112NYRSw] |
| AmpC-producing Enterobacterales | Carbapenems or cefepime preferred; piperacillin-tazobactam not recommended [^114sctJP] [^112d2hpi] |
| Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections | Piperacillin-tazobactam active; consider combination with aminoglycoside for severe infections [^113TLro1] [^115aJDVG] |
| Carbapenemase-producing organisms | Piperacillin-tazobactam inactive; use alternative agents [^notfound] |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Susceptibility testing**: Accurate MIC determination is critical; automated systems may misclassify susceptibility, particularly for ESBL and AmpC producers [^113vGrA3] [^114Wuq3Z].
- **Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic considerations**: Extended or continuous infusion strategies may improve PK/PD target attainment in severe infections [^113CiDae] [^113Gh86D].
- **Resistance emergence**: On-therapy resistance can occur, particularly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa; close monitoring is essential [^114ENcgQ] [^113BNbwR].

---

Piperacillin-tazobactam provides broad coverage against many Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^113TLro1]. Its activity against ESBL and AmpC producers is limited, and **carbapenems are preferred for severe infections** caused by these organisms [^112qCGNZ]. Piperacillin-tazobactam is inactive against carbapenemase producers, and susceptibility testing should guide therapy [^1149FNTp].

Ceftolozane–tazobactam for AmpC-producing Enterobacterales — limited activity and recommendation against routine use. The text notes less is known about ceftolozane-tazobactam's activity against AmpC-E and reports at least 1 investigation where the agent was active against only 19% of Escherichia cloacae isolates producing moderate levels of AmpC enzymes. Based on the limited available data, the panel suggests against the use of ceftolozane-tazobactam as a treatment option for AmpC-E infections. In polymicrobial infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and AmpC-E, the use of ceftolozane-tazobactam can be considered, with close monitoring for an appropriate clinical response.

The findings from this study suggest that an even more sophisticated method of optimization may be necessary in selected patients - patient-tailored antibiotic therapy - which is the adaptation of antibiotic therapy to the need of the individual patient in order to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity through therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adaptation. Unfortunately, TDM of β-lactam antibiotics is currently challenging with long turnaround times, expensive equipment, logistical problems related to the instability of the antibiotics in the samples and the need for well-trained personnel. Efforts to overcome these limitations, and clinical studies to assess utility in the clinical setting are urgently needed.

The USCAST recommendation was also informed by the MERINO trial, which compared definitive treatment with meropenem 1 g every 8 hours (0.5-hour infusion) or TZP 4.5 g every 6 hours (0.5-hour infusion) in adult patients with TZP-S, ceftriaxone-R (CRO-R) E. coli, or K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections. In this international, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial, 30-day mortality was higher in the TZP arm relative to the meropenem arm (12.3% vs 3.7%, respectively; risk difference, 8.6%; 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval [CI] −α to 14.5%; p = 0.90 for noninferiority). Similar trends in favor of meropenem were demonstrated in the secondary outcomes of clinical cure, microbiological cure, and the development of resistance.

To investigate the potential reason(s) for the observed 30-day mortality differences between treatments in MERINO-1, post hoc analyses were performed, and an unexpectedly high rate of nonsusceptibility to TZP was demonstrated using broth microdilution at the central laboratory compared to Vitek or disk diffusion at the local site. When the analysis was limited to patients with TZP-susceptible isolates via broth microdilution by the current FDA, CLSI, and EUCAST TZP susceptible breakpoint of ≤ 8/4 mg/L, 30-day mortality was still higher with TZP but no longer reached statistical significance (9% vs 5%, respectively; 95% CI, −2% to 11%). In the multivariate regression analyses, TZP MIC > 16/4 mg/L was identified as the TZP MIC threshold best associated with 30-day mortality (30-day mortality was 50% [5 of 10] in patients with isolates that had TZP MIC values > 16/4 mg/L vs 9% [13 of 147] in patients with isolates that had TZP MIC values ≤ 16/4 mg/L).

### Efficacy and tolerability of piperacillin / tazobactam versus ceftazidime in association with amikacin for treating nosocomial pneumonia in intensive care patients: a prospective randomized multicenter trial [^116rvxfG]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare clinical and bacteriological efficacy as well as tolerability of two regimens of broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftazidime versus piperacillin/tazobactam) combined with amikacin in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in intensive care patients.

Design

Open label, prospective, multicenter, and randomized phase III clinical trial.

Setting

Medical or surgical intensive care units (ICUs) of nine acute-care teaching hospitals in Spain.

Patients and Participants

One hundred and twenty-four ICU patients with nosocomial pneumonia and requiring mechanical ventilation were included. They were randomized to receive amikacin (15 mg/day divided into two doses) combined with either piperacillin (4 g every 6 h) and tazobactam (0.5 g every 6 h) (n = 88) or ceftazidime (2 g every 8 h) (n = 36).

Measurements and Results

The causative pathogen was determined in 60.2% of patients in the group of amikacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam and in 76.9% in the group of amikacin plus ceftazidime. A total of 94 bacterial organisms were isolated among which gram-negative bacilli predominated, Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most frequent. Clinical response at the end of antibiotic therapy was considered satisfactory (cure and/or improvement) in 63.9% of patients in the amikacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam group and in 61.5% in the amikacin plus ceftazidime (odds ratio 1.1; 95% confidence interval 0.44–2.75). Eradication or presumptive eradication rates for each pathogen and for either gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria were similar in both antibiotic combinations (odds ratio 1.2; 95% confidence interval 0.39–3.66). A total of 21 adverse effects (23.9%) occurred in the amikacin plus piperacillin and tazobactam group and six (16.7%) in the amikacin plus ceftazidime group, thrombocytosis, renal dysfunction, and hepatic cytolysis being the most common. The efficacy and tolerability of the two therapeutic regimens were similar not only in the whole study population, but also in the subset of P. aeruginosa-related pneumonia (odds ratio 1; 95% confidence interval 0.08–13.37).

Conclusions

Amikacin associated with either ceftazidime or piperacillin and tazobactam has shown comparable efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of ICU patients with nosocomial pneumonia.

### Piperacillin and tazobactam and sodium chloride [^113NsKVX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4	Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Piperacillin sodium exerts bactericidal activity by inhibiting septum formation and cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. In vitro, piperacillin is active against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Tazobactam sodium has little clinically relevant in vitro activity against bacteria due to its reduced affinity to penicillin-binding proteins. It is, however, a beta-lactamase inhibitor of the Molecular class A enzymes, including Richmond-Sykes class III (Bush class 2b & 2b') penicillinases and cephalosporinases. It varies in its ability to inhibit class II and IV (2a & 4) penicillinases. Tazobactam does not induce chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases at tazobactam concentrations achieved with the recommended dosage regimen.

Antimicrobial Activity

Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)]:

Aerobic bacteria

Gram-positive bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible isolates only)

Gram-negative bacteria

Acinetobacter baumannii

Escherichia coli

Haemophilus influenzae (excluding beta-lactamase negative, ampicillin-resistant isolates)

Klebsiella pneumoniae

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (given in combination with an aminoglycoside to which the isolate is susceptible)

Anaerobic bacteria

Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, and B. vulgatus)

### A multicenter study on optimizing piperacillin-tazobactam use: lessons on why interventions fail [^111gdruY]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

We examined interventions to optimize piperacillin-tazobactam use at 4 hospitals. Interventions for rotating house staff did not affect use. We could target empiric therapy in only 35% of cases. Because prescribing practices seemed to be institution specific, interventions should address attitudes of local prescribers. Interventions should target empiric therapy and ordering of appropriate cultures.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114sctJP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

### Prospective evaluating the appropriate use of piperacillin / tazobactam in cardiac center of a tertiary care hospital [^111xUUUk]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as Pip/Taz, play an essential role in the empirical therapy of serious infections.

Pip /taz is a combination of β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor and has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity including most Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria and is effective for many polymicrobial infections.

Pip/Taz is useful against a variety of respiratory infection, intra-abdominal, skin and soft tissue infections, febrile neutropenia, and bloodstream infections (BSI) which are among the most frequent complications in neutropenic cancer patients caused by Gram-negative rods which associated with high mortality.

Improper use of these antibiotics is common and costly, as physicians often use broad-spectrum antibiotics when a narrower-spectrum agent would work. Overuse of broad-spectrum agents also has an important role in growing worldwide bacterial resistance which has become a serious problem and adds to the overall costs of medical care with increased side effects.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has published stewardship guidelines to optimize antibiotic use, using cost-effective interventions, to minimize antibiotic resistance, minimize side effects and control Clostridium difficile infections.

Various strategies have offered for antimicrobial stewardship programs. Like staff education, formulary restrictions and substitutions, early de-escalating, early converting parenteral to oral, and practice guidelines that consider local microbiology and resistance.

One useful strategy is to decrease inappropriate use of broad spectrum antibiotics by restricting its use to infectious diseases consultant to get approval for dispensing.

By identifying the inappropriate use of pip /taz, further regulations can be implemented to optimize the use of this medication and thus decreasing the antimicrobial drug resistance which contribute to better patient outcomes. In addition, if appropriate use of Pip/Taz is established, unnecessary hospital costs can be reduced. Hence, we conducted this study to estimate the appropriate use of Pip/Taz utilization in the surgical cardiac unit using Antibiotic stewardship guidelines as a reference.

### Strategies for updating piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoints [^113vGrA3]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, C. Manuel, R. Maynard, A. Abbott, K. Adams, et al. (J Clin Microbiol 61:e01617–22, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1128/JCM.01617-22) describe a multisite study evaluation of piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) MIC testing on three U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) devices compared to the reference broth microdilution method for organisms belonging to Enterobacterales. Although overall performance of each of the three devices was comparable when applying either FDA or Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) TZP breakpoints, failure to update to the current CLSI breakpoints may result in falsely categorizing as many as 20% of the TZP-resistant isolates as susceptible. The impact of not updating clinical breakpoints and strategies for implementation of updated breakpoints are discussed.

### Evaluation of piperacillin-tazobactam disks using contemporary enterobacterales isolates suggests the need for disk potency optimization [^115ViPVh]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) is the most frequently utilized empiric antimicrobial agent for broad-spectrum coverage of Gram-negative bacteria and is often used as a carbapenem-sparing regimen to help mitigate the rapidly rising incidence of carbapenem resistance. In 2022, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) revised TZP clinical breakpoints for Enterobacterales, to ≤ 8/4 µg/mL for susceptible, 16/4 µg/mL for susceptible dose-dependent (SDD), and ≥ 32/4 µg/mL for resistant (R). The breakpoints were revised largely due to the findings of a large randomized controlled trial (MERINO) where TZP did not meet non-inferiority criteria compared to meropenem for the treatment of bloodstream infections caused by ceftriaxone nonsusceptible Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Notably, the MERINO trial demonstrated a significantly increased risk of mortality for patients treated with TZP when the isolates yielded TZP MICs ≥ 32/4 µg/mL. Additionally, over the last decade, several studies have demonstrated a poor probability of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment (greater than 50% time above the MIC) for TZP in isolates with an MIC of 16/4 µg/mL or above. Thus, the revised CLSI SDD breakpoint for TZP is based on extended-infusion dosing (4.5 g every 6 h as a 3-h infusion or 4.5 g every 8 h as a 4-h infusion) that is predicted to achieve the PK/PD target of 50% time above MIC. Due to the lack of contemporary data on disk-to-MIC correlates, CLSI revised the TZP disk diffusion (DD) breakpoints for Enterobacterales based on historical data sets from 1992 and 2004. Disk-to-MIC correlates for these revised DD breakpoints did not meet CLSI M23 error-rate acceptance criteria, yielding high rates of minor errors (MIs) and very major errors (VMEs, false susceptibility). The VME rate for isolates with MICs ≥ 64/4 µg/mL (≥ I + 2 MIC range category) was 2.2%, above the 2% acceptable rate. The MI rate was 13.4% for isolates with MICs ≥ 64/4 µg/mL and 12.4% for isolates with MICs ≤ 2/4 µg/mL, above the 5% acceptable rate, demonstrating both overcalling and undercalling of susceptible results. Despite these limitations, CLSI published the breakpoints in the absence of other data, as many laboratories utilize disk diffusion.

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases (ESCMID) guidelines for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (endorsed by European Society of Intensive Care Medicine) [^111bPmDu]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections (third-generation cephalosporin-resistant), ESCMID 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering piperacillin/tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or quinolones for the treatment of low-risk, non-severe infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship.
Consider administering TMP/SMX for the treatment of non-severe complicated UTIs.

### Evolution and clinical importance of extended-spectrum β-lactamases [^117S3Eg3]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

In the process of evolution, bacteria have acquired well-developed mechanisms of resistance to an extensive array of hostile substances. This time-tempered system of defense is so intricate and adaptable that contemporary medicine has been hard-pressed to maintain an advantage. In this article, the processes responsible for bacterial resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins are reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases that have emerged to provide bacteria with formidable resistance to modern drugs. Avoidance of this problem requires limitations on extended-spectrum cephalosporin usage. While carbapenems are clearly the treatment of choice for infections caused by these pathogens, empirical use of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors such as piperacillin/tazobactam has been associated with reduction in the prevalence of cephalosporin resistance.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^117NaStw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The role of piperacillin/tazobactam in treating patients with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales has been debated. Gram-negative bacteria may express multiple ESBLs as well as AmpC beta-lactamases concomitantly, and can manifest other mechanisms of resistance, limiting the activity of piperacillin/tazobactam. On the other hand, the activity of beta-lactam agents, including piperacillin/tazobactam, is influenced by the "inoculum effect", an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic when the inoculum size is larger. A RCT conducted in patients with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales blood stream infections showed inferior results of piperacillin/tazobactam compared to carbapenems. Although piperacillin/tazobactam is not considered the first-choice antibiotic to treat ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, it may be an option for IAIs with adequate source control when bacteria are susceptible (MIC ≤ 4 mg/L). A high dose or prolonged/continuous infusion should be prescribed to optimise pharmacokinetics (PK) targeting in critically ill patients.

### Integrating forecast probabilities in antibiograms: a way to guide antimicrobial prescriptions more reliably? [^114Wuq3Z]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) assigns pathogens to "susceptible" or "resistant" clinical categories based on clinical breakpoints (CBPs) derived from MICs or inhibition zone diameters and indicates the likelihood for therapeutic success. AST reports do not provide quantitative measures for the reliability of such categorization. Thus, it is currently impossible for clinicians to estimate the technical forecast uncertainty of an AST result regarding clinical categorization. AST error rates depend on the localization of pathogen populations in relation to CBPs. Bacterial species are, however, not homogeneous, and subpopulations behave differently with respect to AST results. We addressed how AST reporting errors differ between isolates with and without acquired drug resistance determinants. Using as an example the beta-lactams and their most important resistance mechanisms, we analyzed different pathogen populations for their individual reporting error probabilities. Categorization error rates were significantly higher for bacterial populations harboring resistance mechanisms than for the wild-type population. Reporting errors for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin-tazobactam in Escherichia coli infection cases were almost exclusively due to the presence of broad-spectrum- and extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing microorganisms (79% and 20% of all errors, respectively). Clinicians should be aware of the significantly increased risk of erroneous AST reports for isolates producing beta-lactamases, particularly ESBL and AmpC. Including probability indicators for interpretation would improve AST reports.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114ENcgQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa multidrug-resistant infections — suggested treatment and rationale — When isolates test susceptible to both traditional non-carbapenem β-lactam agents and carbapenems, the former are preferred over carbapenem therapy; for infections caused by isolates not susceptible to any carbapenem but susceptible to traditional β-lactams, administration of a traditional non-carbapenem β-lactam as high-dose extended-infusion therapy is suggested, and for critically ill patients or those with poor source control in this scenario, use of newer β-lactam agents to which P. aeruginosa test susceptible is also a reasonable treatment approach. Phenotypically, isolates not susceptible to a carbapenem agent (eg, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin MICs ≥ 4 µg/mL) but susceptible to other traditional β-lactams constitute approximately 20% to 60% of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates, and the panel's preferred approach is high-dose extended-infusion therapy (eg, cefepime 2 g IV every 8 hours, infused over at least 3 hours). Patients infected with P. aeruginosa should be closely monitored to ensure clinical improvement given on-therapy resistance risks, exemplified by an analysis of 767 episodes of P. aeruginosa bacteremia showing emergence of resistance within 30 days with the following likelihood: piperacillin-tazobactam (8%), ceftazidime (12%), meropenem (14%), and imipenem (27%).

### Piperacillin / tazobactam susceptibility test interpretive criteria for enterobacterales: recommendations from the United States committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing [^113XuxMz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The USCAST recommendation was also informed by the negative signals observed in the pilot (n = 72), multicentered, randomized, open-label trial that compared TZP with meropenem for definitive treatment of bloodstream infections caused by AmpC β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (MERINO-2). Overall, no significant difference in the primary composite failure outcome (30-day mortality, clinical failure, microbiological failure, or microbiological relapse) was observed between treatment groups. However, 53% of patients in the trial were infected with Enterobacterales that are unlikely to develop clinically significant AmpC expression (ie, Citrobacter braakii, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Providencia spp. or Serratia spp.). Among the subgroup of 32 patients with infections due to Enterobacterales with a moderate to high likelihood of clinically significant AmpC production (ie, Enterobacter spp.), a nonsignificantly higher proportion of patients in the TZP arm met the primary composite failure outcome (28% vs 7%, respectively; p = 0.14). These findings were consistent with those from a recent observational study that demonstrated significantly higher treatment failure rates among patients who received piperacillin ± tazobactam relative to those who received a carbapenem or cefepime for definitive treatment of wild-type AmpC β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales bloodstream infections or pneumonia. In this study, > 75% of patients in the piperacillin group were infected with an Enterobacterales with a moderate to high likelihood of clinically significant AmpC production.

### Evaluation of piperacillin-tazobactam disks using contemporary enterobacterales isolates suggests the need for disk potency optimization [^114WKnuY]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) is a commonly used broad-spectrum agent. OXA-1 β-lactamases drive global Enterobacterales TZP resistance and raise MICs to the clinical breakpoints (8/4–16/4 µg/mL), making susceptibility testing challenging. Two TZP disks are used globally. The first with 100 µg piperacillin and 10 µg tazobactam, established in 1992, is used by laboratories following U.S. FDA and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standards. The second, with 30 µg piperacillin and 6 µg tazobactam, was developed by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). When CLSI updated Enterobacterales TZP MIC breakpoints in 2022, it became apparent that the 100/10 µg disk may not accurately predict TZP resistance or susceptibility. In this study, we performed a disk mass titration study using 100 contemporary Enterobacterales isolates, including 40 harboring bla OXA-1. Relative to reference broth microdilution with CLSI breakpoints, categorical agreement (CA) for the 100/10 µg disk was 68% with 0.6% major errors (MEs) and 32% minor errors. The CA for the 30/6 µg disk against EUCAST breakpoints was 88% with 15% very major errors and 10% ME. A third disk developed in this study, 20/5 µg, yielded 81% CA with CLSI MIC breakpoints and disk breakpoints generated using the error-rate-bounded method. CA was 62.4%, 63.2%, and 70.9% for isolates with bla OXA-1 using the 100/10, 30/6, and 20/5 µg disks, respectively, whereas it was 71.6%, 86.9%, and 83.1% for isolates without bla OXA-1. Decreasing TZP disk potency improved the overall performance of disk diffusion and improved separation between susceptible and non-susceptible isolates, particularly those harboring OXA-1, but no disk yielded optimal results.

IMPORTANCE

In this article, we address major gaps in contemporary data for piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) susceptibility testing and evaluate the performance of disk diffusion. TZP is the most common empiric broad-spectrum agent against Gram-negative pathogens and is used as a carbapenem-sparing regimen. OXA-1 β-lactamases drive global Enterobacterales TZP resistance and raise MICs to the clinical breakpoints, making susceptibility testing challenging. In 2022, CLSI revised the Enterobacterales TZP MIC breakpoints. Due to the lack of contemporary correlates, disk diffusion breakpoints were revised using outdated historical data from 1991 and 2003 and yielded unacceptable error rates. Additionally, there is a lack of global consensus on disk potency. The EUCAST TZP disks contain 30 μg piperacillin and 6 μg tazobactam. The CLSI disks, established after TZP approval in 1979 and prior to the widespread prevalence of ESBLs, contain 100 μg piperacillin and 10 μg tazobactam. Here, we evaluate disk diffusion using the 100/10 and 30/6 μg TZP disks with 100 contemporary Enterobacterales isolates, including 40 harboring bla OXA-1. We conducted a disk development study to determine if an alternative potency might address accuracy issues with TZP susceptibility testing. We demonstrate that decreasing TZP potency improves the performance of disk diffusion and improves separation between susceptible and non-susceptible isolates, particularly those harboring OXA-1, but no disk yielded optimal results. The alternative 20/5 μg disk yielded the lowest errors using CLSI MIC breakpoints and the best separation between susceptible isolates and isolates harboring bla OXA-1. Our study addresses an unmet need, shows that further optimization of the TZP disk potency is possible, and provides clinical laboratories with a better understanding of the performance of TZP disks using contemporary, challenging isolates. A larger, multicenter study is needed for further optimization but has been limited by a lack of funding for an off-patent antimicrobial. Our struggles in accessing funding underscore the frequent challenge with AST for older but heavily used antimicrobials.

### Tazobactam selects for multidrug resistance [^117QCRjr]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Piperacillin-Tazobactam is a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination that is amongst the most prescribed antimicrobials in hospital medicine. Piperacillin is inactivated by many common beta-lactamases, but tazobactam inhibits these, allowing successful treatment. The effect of piperacillin on Gram-negative bacteria has been widely studied, but less attention has been paid to the effects of tazobactam. We used a massive transposon mutagenesis approach (TraDIS-Xpress) to identify genes in Escherichia coli that affect survival when exposed to piperacillin and tazobactam, separately and together. We found significant differences between the two drugs: a striking finding was that multiple efflux pump families and regulators were essential for survival in the presence of tazobactam, but only one efflux system was beneficial for piperacillin. Exposure of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae to piperacillin and/or tazobactam selected for mutants with reduced susceptibility, and tazobactam selected for efflux and cell envelope mutants associated with multidrug resistance. We identified other pathways involved in tazobactam susceptibility, including the shikimate kinase AroK. Genes involved in DNA replication and repair reduced E. coli susceptibility to a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam but were not identified after exposure to either drug alone. Tazobactam can select for mutants with increased efflux activity, and the development of future β-lactamase inhibitors should consider potential selective impacts of both inhibitor and antibiotic.

### We need to optimize piperacillin-tazobactam dosing in critically ill patients-but how? [^113HnPjo]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

To this end, a major challenge in determining optimal PIP-TAZ dosing for individual critically ill patients is the high inter-patient variability in serum PIP trough concentrations. Zander and investigators noted a 123-fold to > 1785-fold range of PIP trough concentrations among their study patients, which was more pronounced in patients with higher creatinine clearances than those with severely impaired renal function. Other investigators have also shown high inter-patient variability with PIP-TAZ dosing, albeit in studies with smaller sample sizes of more homogeneous groups of critically ill patients. From these PK data, as well as due to pathogen-related factors such as decreasing antibiotic susceptibilities, as reflected by higher MICs, it is becoming evident that an individualized dosing approach needs to be adopted in order to maximize PIP-TAZ efficacy. Given this, there is significant scope for TDM of PIP-TAZ as well as other beta-lactam antibiotics in the ICU. Monitoring of trough concentrations at a steady state (usually after 3 to 4 doses) is generally recommended to see whether PK/PD targets are being met. Earlier measurement should be preferred where dosing can be optimized using Bayesian dosing software. Additionally, measurement of the 'free' or unbound PIP concentrations, rather than 'total' concentrations as described by Zander et al. is advised. Although PIP is not highly protein bound (typically 30%), differences in protein binding among patients, particularly those in hypoalbuminemic states, as well as alterations in protein binding during assay preparation, means there is much guess work determining PK/PD targets when using 'total' rather than 'unbound' antibiotic concentrations.

### Antibiotic policy and prescribing strategies for therapy of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae: the role of piperacillin-tazobactam [^112Nbivm]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Therapy of infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria with an antimicrobial to which they are resistant results in treatment failure, higher cost and increased mortality. The CLSI recommends reporting ESBL-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. as resistant to all penicillin, true cephalosporin and monobactam antimicrobials, but as susceptible to beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, including piperacillin-tazobactam, when they test as such. Current literature supports the action of piperacillin-tazobactam against susceptible strains of ESBL-producing bacteria based on the structure-activity relationship between inhibitors and the ESBLs, as well as on recent clinical outcome studies.

### Co-administration of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam is associated with increased renal dysfunction in adult and pediatric burn patients [^111UUtKk]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Renal failure is a common complication in critically ill patients, particularly in burn patients. Acute kidney injury (AKI) that is sustained alongside thermal injury significantly worsens morbidity and mortality in pediatric and adult patients. Over recent decades, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms has been steadily increasing, limiting antibiotic treatment options for affected patients and necessitating greater use of aggressive therapeutic antimicrobial combinations. Burn patients are particularly susceptible to infection with multidrug-resistant organisms owing to substantial loss of skin barrier function, wound contamination, nosocomial exposure to pathogens, and impaired post-burn immune function. Bacterial infection is a leading cause of death among burn patients and is treated with various combinations of antimicrobials. Vancomycin (V) is a glycopeptide that inhibits cell wall synthesis in gram-positive bacteria; its spectrum of effectivity includes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Nephrotoxicity is a side effect of intravenous vancomycin therapy. Imipenem combined with its co-effector cilastin (IC) is a broad-spectrum carbapenem that is commonly used to treat burn-related local and systemic infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella, or Acinetobacter species. Piperacillin, an extended-spectrum penicillin, combined with the β-lactamase tazobactam (PT) has activity against various gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas and Enterobacteria. Imipenem-cilastin and piperacillin-tazobactam share a similar profile of broad coverage, which enables a degree of interchangeability in burn care. Recently, other groups have reported that the combination of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam induces greater renal damage in non-critically ill patients than vancomycin alone or the combination of vancomycin and cefepime. Here, AKI associated with exposure to vancomycin alone (V), vancomycin plus imipenem-cilastin (V/IC), or vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam (V/PT) was quantified based on Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria to determine whether any of these treatment combinations is indicated to be favored regarding nephrotoxicity in adult and pediatric burn patients.

### Overview of changes in the clinical and laboratory standards institute performance standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing: M100 32nd and 33rd editions [^112HnVN5]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Several features differentiate the activity of TZP against P. aeruginosa compared to the Enterobacterales. First, unlike the Enterobacterales, the tazobactam component does not enhance piperacillin activity in P. aeruginosa, as class A beta-lactamases inhibited by tazobactam for Enterobacterales are rarely expressed in P. aeruginosa. However, P. aeruginosa has a higher wild-type piperacillin MIC compared to the majority of Enterobacterales: the P. aeruginosa ECV is 16 µg/mL, while the Enterobacterales ECV is 8 µg/mL. The PK-PD target for piperacillin against P. aeruginosa is also 50% time above the MIC, and PK-PD endpoints are the same as those described above for the Enterobacterales (i.e. MIC of 8 µg/mL is achievable using 30-minute infusions, whereas MIC of 16 µg/mL requires extended infusion strategies). As such, a susceptible breakpoint of ≤ 8/4 µg/mL was considered by CLSI but ultimately rejected as this would bisect the wild-type population. Rather, the susceptible breakpoint of ≤ 16/4 µg/mL was left untouched, but the intermediate category was updated from 32/4–64/4 µg/mL to 32/4 µg/mL, as no data suggested that TZP MICs > 16/4 µg/mL could be treated, regardless of the dosing regimen used (Table 1). The revised P. aeruginosa TZP intermediate category (32/4 µg/mL) accounts for technical variability and the ability of the agent to concentrate in the urine (as indicated by an I^ in M100).

### Is It time to rethink the notion of carbapenem-sparing therapy against extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infections? A critical review [^1112gfwx]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To present systematic recommendations for carbapenem-sparing therapy against extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infections (BSIs) derived from a critical review of clinical data.

Data Sources

A systematic literature search using PubMed and MEDLINE databases (January 1, 2012, to June 30, 2017) was performed using key MESH terms: ESBL or extended-spectrum β-lactamases and bacteremia or bloodstream infection with piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, cefepime, cephamycins, carbapenem, doripenem, meropenem, and ertapenem. References within articles of interest were also evaluated.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English language trials were considered, and results were limited to clinical efficacy trials. Articles were screened by title and abstract for inclusion.

Data Synthesis

Studies comparing noncarbapenem versus carbapenem therapy for ESBL BSIs were critically analyzed to identify heterogeneity among studies. Data abstracted included empirical or definitive therapy, patient population, dosing, source of infection and severity, infectious etiology, and outcome.

Conclusions

Completely sparing carbapenem therapy cannot be justified among patients with ESBL BSIs. Determining the source of infection is critical to identify patients for whom carbapenem-sparing therapy is appropriate.

### Piperacillin / tazobactam susceptibility test interpretive criteria for enterobacterales: recommendations from the United States committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing [^112xr5cx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The USCAST recommendation was not unanimous, and 1 dissenting voter was concerned the available data were predominately related to patients with bloodstream infections and did not rule out the potential role of TZP for the treatment of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) due to 3GC-NS Enterobacterales as there is some evidence that supports TZP usage in this setting. However, there are significant limitations to the observational studies that have addressed the role of TZP for cUTIs, most notably confounding by indication, and the lone cUTI randomized clinical trial had a small sample size, limiting interpretation. Additionally, the tazobactam PK/PD concerns previously described remain relevant to cUTIs. While USCAST acknowledges that the role of TZP for 3GC-NS Enterobacterales in cUTIs remains unresolved, USCAST believed the most prudent recommendation at this time was not to have a TZP susceptibility breakpoint for 3GC-NS Enterobacterales given the uncertainties regarding the effectiveness of TZP in these patients.

The USCAST members were in full agreement that additional preclinical PK/PD studies with a more diverse group of 3GC-NS Enterobacterales isolates are needed to better understand the PK/PD of TZP against 3GC-NS Enterobacterales. If TZP use is supported by additional preclinical evidence, further randomized clinical trials would then be warranted to better quantify the efficacy of TZP for patients with 3GC-NS Enterobacterales infections. As part of these proposed studies, TZP should be evaluated in patients with less invasive 3GC-NS Enterobacterales infections, such as cUTIs, given the commonality of these infections and uncertainty of TZP's role for these patients. Of note, PETERPEN is an ongoing, open-label, randomized clinical trial comparing extended-infusion TZP and meropenem for ESBL Enterobacterales bloodstream infections, and results of this study will help inform this conversation.

Recommendation 3

USCAST recommends that the STIC for TZP against 3GC-S Enterobacterales that do not have a moderate to high likelihood of clinically significant AmpC production due to an inducible chromosomal AmpC gene are susceptible at MIC values ≤ 16/4 mg/L and resistant at MIC values > 16/4 mg/L. This recommendation is based on TZP dosing regimens administered as an extended infusion (4.5 g infused over 3 hours every 6 hours or 4.5 g infused over 4 hours every 8 hours).

### We need to optimize piperacillin-tazobactam dosing in critically ill patients-but how? [^113snNGb]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Zander et al. have recently conducted a prospective observational study to describe the variability of piperacillin (PIP) concentrations and target attainment in a heterogeneous cohort of 60 critically ill patients. An intermittent bolus dosing regimen of piperacillin-tazobactam (PIP-TAZ) was used 4.5 g three times daily (TID) or twice daily (BID), depending on renal function.

As PIP-TAZ is largely renally excreted, it was unsurprising that the investigators found that no patient within the highest quartile of creatinine clearance (CrCl) attained specified pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets (trough concentrations ≥ 22.5 mg/L) on days 1 or 4. These results are consistent with previous data showing that 'augmented renal clearance' (ARC), defined as a CrCl ≥ 130 mL/min, is frequently being associated with subtherapeutic PIP concentrations, even when dosing PIP-TAZ four times daily (QID). Of more interest, however, was that the investigators found that 0% and 55% of patients with a CrCl > 65 mL/min and 30–65 mL/min, respectively, attained the target PIP trough concentrations. This is a very important finding as it highlights that initiating TID PIP-TAZ dosing as a blanket strategy in critically ill patients with 'normal' renal function or even mild to moderate renal impairment will not reliably attain PK/PD targets. In line with these findings, and perhaps reflective of the ongoing challenges with dose optimization in this group of patients, previous work has shown QID dosing of PIP-TAZ to be insufficient in achieving free PIP concentrations that are four times the target minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 50% of the dosing interval (50% f T > 4xMIC), even in patients not displaying ARC. Solutions for target non-attainment of PIP-TAZ in intensive care unit (ICU) patients include use of prolonged infusions and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).

### Comparative in vitro activity of piperacillin, piperacillin-sulbactam and piperacillin-tazobactam against nosocomial pathogens isolated from intensive care patients [^1124jfZV]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

We investigated the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin-tazobactam versus piperacillin-sulbactam against common nosocomial pathogens (n = 565) isolated from intensive care patients. For Gram-positive bacteria, antimicrobial susceptibilities to the two piperacillin-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations were almost identical. For Gram-negative bacteria, piperacillin-tazobactam exhibited greater activity against Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris than piperacillin-sulbactam. Both combinations, however, were equally effective against the other Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Piperacillin-sulbactam exhibited better antimicrobial activity against Acinetobacter baumannii. Our findings might prove important for the appropriate choice of antibiotic therapy with beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

Antibiotic armamentarium

The choice of empiric antibiotics in patients with IAI should be based on the severity of the infection, the individual risk for infection by resistant pathogens, and the local resistance epidemiology. Amoxicillin/clavulanate or cephalosporins in combination with metronidazole, are still good options for the treatment of non-severe IAIs, with piperacillin/tazobactam being a better choice if P. aeruginosa coverage is needed. The use of carbapenems should be limited so as to preserve activity of this class of antibiotics because of the concern of emerging carbapenem-resistance. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are no longer appropriate first-line choices for empiric treatment in many regions because of the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance. Other options include aminoglycosides, particularly for suspected infections by Gram negative bacteria, and tigecycline especially when MDRO are suspected, though caution is advised for the latter, in the situation of a bacteremia.

Recent challenges in the management of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative infections, especially in critically ill patients, have reviewed the use of "old" antibiotics, such as polymyxins and fosfomycin.

Ceftolozone/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam are new antibiotics that have been approved for treatment of cIAI infections (in combination with metronidazole) including infection by ESBLs and P. aeruginosa, though their role for the empirical therapy remains to be defined.

IAI may be managed by either single or multiple antimicrobial regimens. Table 1 presents the spectrum of activity of antimicrobial agents for common IAI pathogens, Table 2 presents recommended intravenous antimicrobial doses for patients with IAI and preserved renal function. These doses may not be adequate for patients with morbid obesity as there are currently no specific dosing recommendations for antibiotics in obese patients.

### Evaluation of piperacillin-tazobactam disks using contemporary enterobacterales isolates suggests the need for disk potency optimization [^116gzgD1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The 100 µg piperacillin CLSI disk potency was established shortly after the introduction of the antimicrobial in a 1979 study, where 100, 150, and 200 µg disk potencies were evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus isolates. At the time, a 100 µg carbenicillin disk was standard for testing Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas, which prompted studies to assess susceptibility testing methods for novel, extended-spectrum penicillins in the same potency range. The subsequent TZP disk optimized the tazobactam content relative to a fixed potency of 100 µg piperacillin. Both piperacillin and TZP disk potencies were optimized prior to the widespread prevalence of ESBLs. Given today's drastically different epidemiological landscape of resistance mechanisms, there is a dire need for the piperacillin and TZP disk potency to be re-evaluated against a diverse, contemporary collection of clinical isolates.

Monte Carlo simulations and probability of target attainment for efficacy and toxicity

Monte Carlo initial and steady-state dosing simulations were performed with the final covariate models using the Simulx 204R1 (Lixoft SAS) simulation software. For meropenem and piperacillin, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target was set taking into account (1) a standard efficacy target against Gram-negative bacilli (i.e.g.lobal 100% fT > MIC and 4 × MIC for Enterobacterales); and a higher efficacy target (4 × MIC for global empirical treatment and for directed treatment of P. aeruginosa) and (2) toxicity thresholds described in the literature, i.e. unbound trough concentrations or in the case of continuous infusion, unbound average steady-state concentrations of ≥ 45 mg/L and ≥ 160 mg/L for meropenem and piperacillin, respectively. Therefore, for each dosing regimen, we calculated the probability of target attainment for a range of unbound trough/average steady-state concentrations considering that the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) clinical breakpoints and epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFF) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa are 2 mg/L for meropenem and 16 mg/L for piperacillin in combination with tazobactam. For tazobactam, the efficacy PK/PD target was defined as maintaining unbound concentrations above a concentration threshold for a percentage of time during the dosing interval, that has been described to be ≥ 85% fT > 2mg/L in combination with piperacillin in in vitro models with Gram-negative bacteria producers of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. A toxic concentration threshold has not been described for tazobactam; instead, we chose the most conservative toxicity concentration for piperacillin that has been reported with the two drugs in co-administration. The minimum desired probability of target attainment was defined as ≥ 90%.

### Piperacillin / tazobactam susceptibility test interpretive criteria for enterobacterales: recommendations from the United States committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing [^116eM4dX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The in vitro susceptibility testing interpretive criteria (STIC) for piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) against Enterobacterales were recently updated by the US Food and Drug Administration, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. The United States Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (USCAST) also recently reviewed TZP STIC for Enterobacterales and arrived at different STIC for Enterobacterales. Here, we explain our recommendations and rationale behind them. Based on our review of the available data, USCAST does not recommend TZP STIC for certain Enterobacterales species that have a moderate to high likelihood of clinically significant AmpC production (Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Klebsiella aerogenes only) or for third-generation cephalosporin-nonsusceptible Enterobacterales. USCAST recommends a TZP susceptibility breakpoint of ≤ 16/4 mg/L for third-generation cephalosporin-susceptible Enterobacterales and only endorses the use of extended infusion TZP regimens for patients with infections due to these pathogens.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114xJzrh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 2.2 — Selecting antibiotics for organisms at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production: The suggested approach states that several β-lactam antibiotics are at moderate risk of inducing ampC genes and that both induction potential and stability to AmpC β-lactamase hydrolysis should be considered when selecting therapy. The rationale notes a spectrum of induction among β-lactams; aminopenicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin), narrow-spectrum first-generation cephalosporins, and cephamycins are potent ampC inducers, and both low-risk (S. marcescens) and moderate-risk (E. cloacae) organisms hydrolyze these drugs even at basal ampC expression levels, so such AmpC-E isolates will generally test as resistant. Imipenem is also a potent ampC inducer but generally remains stable to AmpC-E hydrolysis; the induction potential of ertapenem and meropenem has not been formally investigated but, similar to imipenem, they are generally stable to AmpC hydrolysis. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and aztreonam are relatively weak ampC inducers, yet available evidence indicates that their susceptibility to hydrolysis makes them less likely to be effective for infections by organisms at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production.

Higher-risk CA-IAI — empiric gram-negative coverage: The agents that have been included in this category are piperacillin-tazobactam, the broad-spectrum carbapenems, imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, and doripenem, and cefepime plus metronidazole; the use of ceftazidime plus metronidazole is an option, and the use of aztreonam plus metronidazole plus vancomycin can be considered, particularly for patients with severe β-lactam reactions, although it has not been evaluated in recent publications; the task force does not believe that the combination gram-negative therapy is necessary for empiric treatment of higher-risk patients with CA-IAI.

### A novel framework to compare the effectiveness of β-lactamase inhibitors against extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae [^111hvy23]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) present a serious challenge in the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections. ESBLs mediate resistance to most β-lactams, which may be reversed with the addition of an active β-lactamase inhibitor (such as tazobactam, relebactam and avibactam). However, various ESBLs may exhibit different susceptibilities to these inhibitors, which could impact efficacy. We proposed a framework for comparing the efficacy of these inhibitors when combined with the same β-lactam.

Methods

Three clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae harbouring CTX-M-15 and one Escherichia coli isolate with SHV-12 were examined. Piperacillin MICs were determined by broth dilution using escalating concentrations of tazobactam, relebactam and avibactam. The resulting MICs were characterized as response to inhibitor concentrations using an inhibitory sigmoid E max model. Using the best-fit parameter values, the model was conditioned with fluctuating inhibitor concentrations to simulate instantaneous MIC i profiles for each isolate-inhibitor pair. Using a simulated exposure of 4 g piperacillin every 8 h, %fT > MIC i was estimated for each piperacillin/inhibitor combination. A hollowfibre infection model was subsequently used to validate the predicted effectiveness of selected combinations.

Results

In all scenarios, piperacillin MIC reductions were well characterized with increasing inhibitor concentrations. As predicted by %fT > MIC i, combining piperacillin with avibactam (61.4%-73.6%) was found to be superior to tazobactam (13.5%-44.5%) for suppressing bacterial growth over time.

Conclusion

We illustrated a practical approach to compare the performance of different inhibitors. This platform may be used clinically to identify the optimal pairing of various β-lactams and β-lactamase inhibitors for individual isolates producing ESBLs.

### Treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamases infections: what is the current role of new β-lactams / β-lactamase inhibitors? [^111cEhug]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The widespread diffusion of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing Enterobacteriales currently represents a major threat for public health worldwide. Carbapenems are currently considered the first-line choice for serious ESBL infections. However, the dramatic global increase in ESBL prevalence has led to a significant overuse of carbapenems that has promoted the selection and spread of carbapenemases, which might further prejudicated our ability to treat infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, strategies to limit the use of carbapenems should be implemented.

Recent Findings

Although piperacillin-tazobactam should no longer be considered an alternative to carbapenems for definitive treatment of bloodstream infections due to ESBL-producing strains, it might still represent an alternative for step-down therapy or for low-to-moderate severity infection originating from urinary or biliary sources and when piperacillin-tazobactam minimum inhibitory concentration of 4mg/l or less. Ceftazidime-avibactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam are both carbapenem sparing agents that appear interesting alternatives for treatment of serious ESBL infections. New β-lactams/β-lactamase inhibitors (BL/BLI), including cefepime-enmetazobactam, ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam, aztreonam-avibactam and cefepime-zidebactam, are also promising agents for treatment of ESBL infections, but further clinical data are needed to establish their efficacy relative to carbapenems. The role of carbapenems/β-lactamase inhibitors remain to be clarified.

Summary

New BL/BLI have distinctive specificities and limitations that require further investigations. Future randomized clinical trials are required to define the best strategy for their administering for ESBL infections.

### A national retrospective cohort study comparing the effects of cefepime versus piperacillin-tazobactam on the development of severe acute kidney injury in patients with septic shock [^113pB7ti]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

International practice guidelines formulated by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and published in 2021 recommend that adults with sepsis or septic shock at low risk for multiple drug-resistant organisms receive a single antimicrobial agent with gram-negative bacterial coverage, albeit based on a very low quality of evidence. This usually includes the use of a antipseudomonal β-lactam. The choice of antipseudomonal β-lactam for broad-spectrum gram-negative coverage varies by provider and institution, but the most prescribed agents include cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam.

Observational studies involving diverse populations of hospitalized patients with infections of varying etiologies suggest possible differences in the adverse effect profiles of these 2 agents, particularly with respect to a higher incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) with piperacillin-tazobactam, although the findings between studies were inconsistent. The largest randomized controlled trial that compared cefepime with piperacillin-tazobactam in 2511 adults at a single academic medical center in the United States found no difference between groups for the primary outcome of the highest stage of AKI or death by day 14. Similarly, for secondary outcomes there was no significant difference between groups for major adverse kidney events (MAKEs) at 14 days, although therapy with cefepime resulted in a higher incidence of neurological dysfunction, as noted by fewer days alive and free of delirium and coma within 14 days (odds ratio [OR], 0.79 [95% confidence interval (CI),.65–.95]). It is important to note that 77.6% received concomitant vancomycin. Approximately 54% of patients in each group had sepsis at baseline, as defined by Sepsis-3 criteria, and only 13% had septic shock.

No large study to our knowledge has compared cefepime to piperacillin-tazobactam in patients with septic shock for clinically important outcomes such as severe AKI. Patients in septic shock may be more vulnerable to developing AKI, and the difference in nephrotoxicity between these antibiotics may be more apparent. Therefore, the purpose of this multicenter retrospective cohort study was to determine if there is a difference between cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam in the outcome of severe AKI in patients with septic shock.

### Comparative pharmacodynamics of intermittent and prolonged infusions of piperacillin / tazobactam using monte carlo simulation and steady-state pharmacokinetic data from hospitalized patients [^113CiDae]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

With increasing antibiotic resistance in gram-negative pathogens, dosing strategies that optimize pharmacodynamic parameters of currently available antibiotics play an important role in treatment. The likelihood of success with piperacillin/tazobactam, a widely used broad-spectrum antibiotic, can be manipulated by increasing the amount of time that unbound drug concentrations remain above the pathogen's minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). However, this success depends greatly on knowing the MIC value as well as accurately estimating the individual's pharmacokinetic parameters. Clinicians should carefully factor these variables into their decision-making process when considering prolonged infusion strategies with piperacillin/tazobactam.

Susceptibility Testing Methods

As is recommended with all antimicrobials, the results of in vitro susceptibility tests, when available, should be provided to the physician as periodic reports, which describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial.

Dilution Techniques:

Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam powders.1,2MIC values should be determined using serial dilutions of piperacillin combined with a fixed concentration of 4 mcg/mL tazobactam. The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to criteria provided in Table 7.

Diffusion Technique:

Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size should be determined using a standardized test method1,3and requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 100 mcg of piperacillin and 10 mcg of tazobactam to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to piperacillin/tazobactam. The disk diffusion interpreted criteria are provided in Table 7.

Statement 14

Antibiotic regimens with activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria should be used for selected patients with IAIs who are strongly suspected or proved to be harbouring a resistant pathogen (Moderate-quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

Initial antibiotic therapy for cIAIs is typically empiric in nature because standard microbiologic data and susceptibility results generally require 24–72 h after peritoneal fluid specimen collection. Blood cultures are seldom positive in cIAI (< 10%) and therefore largely unreliable. Typical bacterial pathogens in IAIs reflect endogenous gut flora including Enterobacterales such as E. coli and Klebsiella spp. viridans group Streptococcus, and anaerobes (especially Bacteroides spp.). Historically, cIAI pathogens tended to have greater susceptibility in community- as opposed to hospital-acquired infections.

IAIs caused by susceptible bacteria may be managed by beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (e.g. ticarcillin/clavulanic acid or piperacillin/tazobactam), or a non-pseudomonal carbapenem (e.g. ertapenem). Increasing AMR to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid among E. coli and other Enterobacterales worldwide has compromised its clinical utility for empiric therapy; it should only be prescribed as targeted therapy based on demonstrated susceptibility. The comparably broad-spectrum activity of piperacillin/tazobactam makes it still useful in managing severe IAIs. However, the anti-pseudomonal activity of piperacillin/tazobactam is unnecessary for most community-acquired cIAIs, and its use in hospital-acquired infections should be determined based on local microbiologic epidemiology.

Many isolates of E. coli and other Enterobacterales are susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins that, in combination with metronidazole, may be options for empiric therapy of non-severe IAIs. Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin with a broader spectrum of activity than third-generation cephalosporins. Compared to ceftriaxone, cefepime is poorly hydrolysed by AmpC beta-lactamase, allowing it to be effective against AmpC-producing organisms. For empiric therapy, cefepime must also be given with metronidazole. Fluoroquinolones have been prescribed widely for the treatment of IAIs because of their putative activity against aerobic gram-negative bacteria, tissue penetration, and high oral bioavailability. However, resistance of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. to fluoroquinolones has increased substantially over time, limiting their use for empiric treatment of IAIs.

### Piperacillin and tazobactam [^1124zX7H]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Piperacillin sodium exerts bactericidal activity by inhibiting septum formation and cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. In vitro, piperacillin is active against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Tazobactam sodium has little clinically relevant in vitroactivity against bacteria due to its reduced affinity to penicillin-binding proteins. It is, however, a beta-lactamase inhibitor of the Molecular class A enzymes, including Richmond-Sykes class III (Bush class 2b & 2b') penicillinases and cephalosporinases. It varies in its ability to inhibit class II and IV (2a & 4) penicillinases. Tazobactam does not induce chromosomally‑mediated beta-lactamases at tazobactam concentrations achieved with the recommended dosage regimen.

Antimicrobial Activity

Piperacillin/tazobactam has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)]:

Aerobic bacteria

Gram-positive bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible isolates only)

Gram-negative bacteria

Acinetobacter baumannii

Escherichia coli

Haemophilus influenzae (excluding beta-lactamase negative, ampicillin-resistant isolates)

Klebsiella pneumoniae

### Point-counterpoint: piperacillin-tazobactam should be used to treat infections with extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-positive organisms [^116uAx7D]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTIONBeta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination antimicrobials (BLBLIs) are among the most controversial classes of antibiotic agents available for the treatment of infections caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria (ESBL-GNR). Piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ) is one of the most frequently utilized antibiotic agents for empirical Gram-negative bacterial coverage and remains active against a large proportion of ESBL-GNR strains. Furthermore, good antimicrobial stewardship practices encourage the use of carbapenem-sparing treatment regimens for infections due to ESBL-GNR. As rapid diagnostics are increasingly used in the clinical microbiology laboratory and have the capability of detecting CTX-M type or other ESBL resistance mechanisms, this issue continues to be pertinent. Some data imply reduced efficacy of PTZ against ESBLs. Several factors may affect a clinician's choice to use BLBLIs, including the isolate's MIC, the site and severity of infection, and the type of resistance mechanism. These factors are explored in this review of the pros and cons of BLBLI treatment of invasive infections due to ESBL-producing bacteria, as well as how laboratories should report results for BLBLIs for these organisms as they relate to antimicrobial stewardship. In this Point-Counterpoint, Audrey Schuetz provides the pro point of view and Sergio Reyes and Pranita Tamma provide the con, counterpoint view.

### Evaluation of the efficacy of piperacillin / tazobactam in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producingUrinary tract infections: a systematic review of the literature [^112NYRSw]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of piperacillin/tazobactam (PTZ) for the treatment of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Data Sources

A systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards on PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Central through July 2024.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies providing efficacy data associated with PTZ in patients ≥ 18 years old experiencing an ESBL-PE UTI that documented clinical and microbiological cure data were included.

Data Synthesis

A total of 577 articles were obtained for screening. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 7 studies comparing PTZ with carbapenems comprised of 1156 patient cases were analyzed. Piperacillin/tazobactam was found to be noninferior to carbapenems in the treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTI's caused by ESBL-PE. The observed noninferiority encompassed clinical response, clinical cure, and microbiological cure outcome metrics. Although not specifically evaluated in this systematic review, adverse effects associated with PTZ were found to be minimal and lesser in incidence than with the carbapenem comparators in aggregate.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

While a definitive dosing strategy remains elusive, a PTZ total daily dose of 13.5 g infused over 3 to 4 hours may be appropriate for this indication.

Conclusion

Piperacillin/tazobactam may be an effective carbapenem-sparing agent for the treatment of ESBL-PE UTIs that show in-vitro susceptibility to PTZ. However, additional robust randomized clinical trials are still needed to validate the findings of this review and determine the best dosage regimen of PTZ for ESBL-PE UTIs.

### Ceftazidime-avibactam antimicrobial activity and spectrum when tested against Gram-negative organisms from pediatric patients: results from the INFORM surveillance program (United States, 2011–2015) [^114gAXxy]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Ceftazidime-avibactam was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2015 to treat complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections in adults and is under clinical development for treating pediatric patients.

Methods

Among 53,381 Gram-negative organisms (1 per patient) collected in 2011–2015, 8461 (15.9%) were from pediatric (≤ 17 years old) patients. The isolates were collected from 82 US medical centers and susceptibility tested against ceftazidime-avibactam (avibactam at fixed 4 μg/mL) and comparators by reference broth microdilution methods. Susceptibility results were stratified by patient age: ≤ 1 (3671 isolates); 2–5 (1900); 6–12 (1644) and 13–17 years old (1246). Enterobacteriaceae with an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) screening-positive phenotype were evaluated by microarray-based assay for genes encoding ESBLs, KPC, NDM and transferable AmpC enzymes.

Results

Ceftazidime-avibactam inhibited > 99.9% of all Enterobacteriaceae at the ≤ 8 μg/mL susceptible break point and was highly active against ESBL screening-positive phenotype Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Overall, 83.6% of ESBL screening-positive phenotype K. pneumoniae were susceptible to meropenem. Only 1 of 4724 Enterobacteriaceae (0.02%) isolates was nonsusceptible to ceftazidime-avibactam, an Enterobacter aerogenes with a ceftazidime-avibactam minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 16 μg/mL and negative results for all β-lactamase tested. Ceftazidime-avibactam was very active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50/90, 1/4 μg/mL; 99.1% susceptible), including isolates nonsusceptible to meropenem (94.0% susceptible to ceftazidime-avibactam) or piperacillin-tazobactam (91.7% susceptible) or ceftazidime (89.6% susceptible). Ceftazidime-avibactam activity against P. aeruginosa did not vary substantially among age groups (98.8%-99.3% susceptible) or year of isolation (98.5%-100.0% susceptible).

Conclusions

Ceftazidime-avibactam was very active against a large collection of Gram-negative bacilli isolated from pediatric patients, including P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae with an ESBL screening-positive phenotype and resistant to carbapenems.

### Building a better test for piperacillin-tazobactam susceptibility testing: would that It were so simple (It's complicated) [^117CwDTS]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, S. García-Fernandez, Y. Bala, T. Armstrong, M. Garcia-Castillo, et al.

The analytical performance data are excellent, but in the face of recent emerging data on the inefficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam for certain organisms that test susceptible, the value of piperacillin-tazobactam MICs is controversial. Evaluation of MICs in the context of the modal MIC for Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the variability of MIC tests, and, possibly, resistance mechanisms is important to the optimum use of this antimicrobial.

### Evidence for low risk of Clostridium difficile infection associated with tigecycline [^116qMPB1]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics are often associated with a relatively high risk of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). However, exceptions to this rule, e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam, show that marked inhibition of gut flora is not synonymous with CDI risk. Tigecycline has marked broad-spectrum activity that includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative facultative and obligate anaerobes. Antibiotic susceptibility, gut model and clinical trial data suggest that tigecycline is associated with a relatively low risk of CDI. Further clinical data should be obtained to confirm the results of these initial studies.

### Is piperacillin-tazobactam effective for the treatment of pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms? [^112wumTy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data exist regarding the efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) for the management of nonbacteremic pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter observational study comparing clinical outcomes of adults hospitalized with ESBL-producing pyelonephritis who were receiving TZP versus carbapenems, using an inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis. Patients were eligible for inclusion if all of the following criteria were met: (1) urine cultures growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, or Proteus mirabilis at ≥ 50 000 colony-forming units/mL; (2) identification of an ESBL gene; (3) pyuria (≥ 10 white blood cells per high powered field in the urine); and (4) dysuria and fever plus at least 1 of the following symptoms: emesis, rigors, hypotension, or flank pain.

Results

There were 186 patients included in the propensity score-weighted cohort; 45 (24%) received TZP and 141 (76%) received a carbapenem. Of these 186 patients, 27% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 48% were immunocompromised, and 45% had underlying urologic abnormalities. There were no differences between the 2 groups in the proportion of patients (20% vs 25%) with recurrent cystitis or pyelonephritis with the same ESBL-producing organism within 30 days (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, .31–1.81; p = 0.52). There were no differences in the resolution of clinical symptoms by Day 7 or in 30-day mortality. There was 1 (2%) patient in the TZP arm and 11 (8%) patients in the carbapenem arm who had incident carbapenem-resistant organisms isolated within 30 days (P = 0.09).

Conclusions

TZP may be a reasonable alternative to carbapenems for the management of ESBL-producing pyelonephritis and may mitigate the risk of emergence of carbapenem-resistant organisms, compared with carbapenem therapy.

### Effect of cefepime / enmetazobactam vs piperacillin / tazobactam on clinical cure and microbiological eradication in patients with complicated urinary tract infection or acute pyelonephritis: a randomized clinical trial [^113ozfZZ]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cefepime/enmetazobactam is a novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination and a potential empirical therapy for resistant gram-negative infections.

Objective

To evaluate whether cefepime/enmetazobactam was noninferior to piperacillin/tazobactam for the primary outcome of treatment efficacy in patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) or acute pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, noninferiority clinical trial conducted at 90 sites in Europe, North and Central America, South America, and South Africa. Recruitment occurred between September 24, 2018, and November 2, 2019. Final follow-up occurred November 26, 2019. Participants were adult patients aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis caused by gram-negative urinary pathogens.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomized to receive either cefepime, 2 g/enmetazobactam, 0.5 g (n = 520), or piperacillin, 4 g/tazobactam, 0.5 g (n = 521), by 2-hour infusion every 8 hours for 7 days (up to 14 days in patients with a positive blood culture at baseline).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in the primary analysis set (patients who received any amount of study drug with a baseline gram-negative pathogen not resistant to either treatment and ≥ 105 colony-forming units [CFU]/mL in urine culture or the same pathogen present in concurrent blood and urine cultures) who achieved overall treatment success (defined as clinical cure combined with microbiological eradication [< 103 CFU/mL in urine] of infection). Two-sided 95% CIs were computed using the stratified Newcombe method. The prespecified noninferiority margin was -10%. If noninferiority was established, a superiority comparison was also prespecified.

Results

Among 1041 patients randomized (mean age, 54.7 years; 573 women [55.0%]), 1034 (99.3%) received study drug and 995 (95.6%) completed the trial. Among the primary analysis set, the primary outcome occurred in 79.1% (273/345) of patients receiving cefepime/enmetazobactam compared with 58.9% (196/333) receiving piperacillin/tazobactam (between-group difference, 21.2% [95% CI, 14.3% to 27.9%]). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 50.0% (258/516) of patients treated with cefepime/enmetazobactam and 44.0% (228/518) with piperacillin/tazobactam; most were mild to moderate in severity (89.9% vs 88.6%, respectively). A total of 1.7% (9/516) of participants who received cefepime/enmetazobactam and 0.8% (4/518) of those who received piperacillin/tazobactam did not complete the assigned therapy due to adverse events.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis caused by gram-negative pathogens, cefepime/enmetazobactam, compared with piperacillin/tazobactam, met criteria for noninferiority as well as superiority with respect to the primary outcome of clinical cure and microbiological eradication. Further research is needed to determine the potential role for cefepime/enmetazobactam in the treatment of complicated UTI and pyelonephritis.

### The use of noncarbapenem β-lactams for the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase infections [^111dXfjN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The continued rise in infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens is recognized globally as one of the most pressing concerns facing the healthcare community. Carbapenems are widely regarded as the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of ESBL-producing infections, even when in vitro activity to other β-lactams has been demonstrated. However, indiscriminant carbapenem use is not without consequence, and carbapenem overuse has contributed to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The use of non-carbapenem β-lactams for the treatment of ESBL infections has yielded conflicting results. In this review, we discuss the available data for the use of cephamycins, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, and ceftazidime-avibactam for the treatment of ESBL infections.

### Effect of meropenem-vaborbactam vs piperacillin-tazobactam on clinical cure or improvement and microbial eradication in complicated urinary tract infection: the TANGO I randomized clinical trial [^114umekd]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Meropenem-vaborbactam is a combination carbapenem/beta-lactamase inhibitor and a potential treatment for severe drug-resistant gram-negative infections.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy and adverse events of meropenem-vaborbactam in complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), including acute pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomized clinical trial (TANGO I) conducted November 2014 to April 2016 and enrolling patients (≥ 18 years) with complicated UTI, stratified by infection type and geographic region.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive meropenem-vaborbactam (2g/2g over 3 hours; n = 274) or piperacillin-tazobactam (4g/0.5g over 30 minutes; n = 276) every 8 hours. After 15 or more doses, patients could be switched to oral levofloxacin if they met prespecified criteria for improvement, to complete 10 days of total treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end point for FDA criteria was overall success (clinical cure or improvement and microbial eradication composite) at end of intravenous treatment in the microbiologic modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Primary end point for European Medicines Agency (EMA) criteria was microbial eradication at test-of-cure visit in the microbiologic modified ITT and microbiologic evaluable populations. Prespecified noninferiority margin was -15%. Because the protocol prespecified superiority testing in the event of noninferiority, 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated.

Results

Among 550 patients randomized, 545 received study drug (mean age, 52.8 years; 361 [66.2%] women; 374 [68.6%] in the microbiologic modified ITT population; 347 [63.7%] in the microbiologic evaluable population; 508 [93.2%] completed the trial). For the FDA primary end point, overall success occurred in 189 of 192 (98.4%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 171 of 182 (94.0%) with piperacillin-tazobactam (difference, 4.5% [95% CI, 0.7% to 9.1%]; P < .001 for noninferiority). For the EMA primary end point, microbial eradication in the microbiologic modified ITT population occurred in 128 of 192 (66.7%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 105 of 182 (57.7%) with piperacillin-tazobactam (difference, 9.0% [95% CI, -0.9% to 18.7%]; P < .001 for noninferiority); microbial eradication in the microbiologic evaluable population occurred in 118 of 178 (66.3%) vs 102 of 169 (60.4%) (difference, 5.9% [95% CI, -4.2% to 16.0%]; P < .001 for noninferiority). Adverse events were reported in 106 of 272 (39.0%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 97 of 273 (35.5%) with piperacillin-tazobactam.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with complicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis and growth of a baseline pathogen, meropenem-vaborbactam vs piperacillin-tazobactam resulted in a composite outcome of complete resolution or improvement of symptoms along with microbial eradication that met the noninferiority criterion. Further research is needed to understand the spectrum of patients in whom meropenem-vaborbactam offers a clinical advantage.

Community-acquired intra-abdominal infection (CA-IAI) — higher-risk patients: Treat higher-risk patients with broader-spectrum empiric antimicrobial agents to ensure coverage of less common gram-negative pathogens potentially involved in these infections (Grade 2-C). Use piperacillin-tazobactam, doripenem, imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, or cefepime plus metronidazole as the preferred agents for initial empiric therapy of higher-risk patients (Grade 2-A), and consider use of ceftazidime plus metronidazole as an alternative regimen (Grade 2-B) or aztreonam plus metronidazole plus vancomycin for those with a severe reaction to β-lactam agents (Grade 2-B). Do not add an adjunctive aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone to a β-lactam agent for empiric treatment of higher-risk patients (Grade 1-B), consider use of added ampicillin or vancomycin for empiric anti-enterococcal treatment if the patient is not being treated with piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-cilastatin (Grade 2-B), and do not use antifungal agents routinely for empiric therapy of higher-risk patients (Grade 1-B) but consider use for critically ill patients with an upper gastrointestinal source (Grade 2-B).

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

### Breaking down the breakpoints: rationale for the 2022 clinical and laboratory standards institute revised piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoints against enterobacterales [^115wwDiV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ) is one of the most common antibiotics administered to hospitalized patients. Its broad activity against gram-negative, gram-positive, and anaerobic pathogens; efficacy in clinical trials across diverse infection types and patient populations; and generally favorable toxicity profile make it a particularly appealing antibiotic agent. PTZ susceptibility interpretive criteria (ie, breakpoints) for the Enterobacterales were initially established in 1992, as the drug was undergoing approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. In the ensuing 30 years, changes in the molecular epidemiology of the Enterobacterales and its impact on PTZ susceptibility testing, mounting pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data generated from sophisticated techniques such as population pharmacokinetic modeling and Monte Carlo simulation, and disturbing safety signals in a large clinical trial prompted the Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (CLSI) to review available evidence to determine the need for revision of the PTZ breakpoints for Enterobacterales. After an extensive literature review and formal voting process, the susceptibility criteria were revised in the 2022 CLSI M100 document to the following: ≤ 8/4 µg/mL (susceptible), 16/4 µg/mL (susceptible dose-dependent), and ≥ 32/4 µg/mL (resistant). Herein, we provide a brief overview of the CLSI process of antibiotic breakpoint revisions and elaborate on the available data that ultimately led to the decision to revise the PTZ breakpoints.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of P. aeruginosa infections, with difficult-to-treat resistance, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer traditional non-carbapenem β-lactam agents (such as piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, aztreonam) over carbapenems if P. aeruginosa isolates test susceptible to both traditional non-carbapenem β-lactam agents and carbapenems. Consider administering a traditional agent as high-dose extended-infusion therapy for the treatment of infections caused by P. aeruginosa isolates not susceptible to any carbapenem agent but susceptible to traditional β-lactams. Consider administering a newer β-lactam agent to which the organism tests susceptible (such as ceftolozane/tazobactam, ceftazidime/avibactam, imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam) in critically ill patients or patients with poor source control with P. aeruginosa isolates resistant to carbapenems but susceptible to traditional β-lactams.

Beta-lactam TDM randomized trials — Adults (n = 41) receiving meropenem or piperacillin–tazobactam were randomized to daily TDM or standard of care; the primary outcome was the proportion achieving the PK/PD target of 100% fT > MIC at 72 h, with baseline attainment in only 21% for piperacillin–tazobactam and 0% for meropenem, and at 72 h 58% in TDM versus 16% in standard-of-care achieved 100% fT > 4 times the MIC (p = 0.007), with no difference in mortality, treatment failure, or bacterial persistence. In febrile neutropenia, patients (n = 32) initially received piperacillin–tazobactam by SI and were randomized to TDM or standard of care; EIs could be used in TDM, and the primary outcome was 100% fT > MIC on day 3 with only 22% at baseline, then 69% in TDM versus 19% in standard-of-care achieving 100% fT > MIC (p = 0.012), with no difference in the duration of fever or time to recovery from neutropenia. In critically ill burn patients (n = 38), all β-lactams were administered by SI during the first 3 years and by EI during the final 2 years, and less than 60% of patients achieved the targets at baseline.

In this study, we aim to address the gap in contemporary TZP disk-to-MIC correlation data by evaluating the performance of the disk diffusion method, using the 100/10 µg CLSI and 30/6 µg EUCAST recommended TZP disk potencies, relative to the modal MICs from the reference BMD method against a contemporary cohort of clinical E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates enriched for strains harboring bla OXA-1. Performance was evaluated against CLSI or EUCAST breakpoints (Table 1). Additionally, we performed a preliminary disk development study according to the CLSI M23S guidelines to determine if an alternative disk potency might address some of the accuracy issues with TZP susceptibility testing described thus far, using the same set of contemporary clinical Enterobacterales isolates.

### Β-lactam and β-lactamase inhibitor combinations in the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae: time for a reappraisal in the era of few antibiotic options? [^116vNZeZ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

The spread of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes in Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp is a major challenge to modern medical practice. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections caused by ESBL producers; however, carbapenem resistance has increased globally. ESBL producers might be susceptible to β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combination antibiotics such piperacillin-tazobactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate. These drugs are frequently avoided in serious infections caused by ESBL producers because of the inoculum effect in-vitro (especially for piperacillin-tazobactam), animal data suggesting inferior efficacy when compared with carbapenems, concerns about pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic drug target attainment with standard doses, and poor outcomes shown in some observational studies. Prospective cohort data and a meta-analysis suggest that BLBLIs are non-inferior to carbapenems in the treatment of bloodstream infections caused by ESBL producers. We examine why BLBLIs are perceived as inferior in the treatment of infection with ESBL producers, and discuss data that suggest these concerns might not be strongly supported by clinical evidence.

### Piperacillin sodium and tazobactam sodium (piperacillin and tazobactam) [^113cwk5C]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Piperacillin sodium exerts bactericidal activity by inhibiting septum formation and cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. In vitro, piperacillin is active against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Tazobactam sodium has little clinically relevant in vitro activity against bacteria due to its reduced affinity to penicillin-binding proteins. It is, however, a beta-lactamase inhibitor of the Molecular class A enzymes, including Richmond-Sykes class III (Bush class 2b & 2b') penicillinases and cephalosporinases. It varies in its ability to inhibit class II and IV (2a & 4) penicillinases. Tazobactam does not induce chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases at tazobactam concentrations achieved with the recommended dosage regimen.

Antimicrobial Activity

Piperacillin and tazobactam has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)]:

Aerobic bacteria

Gram-positive bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible isolates only)

Gram-negative bacteria

Acinetobacter baumannii

Escherichia coli

Haemophilus influenzae (excluding beta-lactamase negative, ampicillin-resistant isolates)

Klebsiella pneumoniae

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (given in combination with an aminoglycoside to which the isolate is susceptible)

Anaerobic bacteria

### Piperacillin / tazobactam susceptibility test interpretive criteria for enterobacterales: recommendations from the United States committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing [^117XW44D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Available preclinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data suggest that currently approved TZP dosing schemes are inadequate against the range of MIC values currently considered susceptible for 3GC-NS Enterobacterales. Using a piperacillin 50% free time above the MIC (piperacillin 50% f T > MIC) as the PK/PD target associated with efficacy for TZP, most studies demonstrate that the probability of achieving this PK/PD target with TZP administered as a 0.5-hour intermittent infusion or ≥ 3-hour extended infusion is > 90% for pathogens with MIC values ≤ 8/4 mg/L and ≤ 16/4 mg/L, respectively. Although organizations have used this as part of their STIC justifications, there are 2 main issues with limiting the PK/PD assessment to this target. First, while generally accepted, data to support this f T > MIC target for piperacillin are lacking. Second, in addition to the piperacillin probabilty of target attainment profile, tazobactam exposures are a critical determinant in defining the PK/PD profile of TZP against 3GC-NS Enterobacterales as piperacillin is readily hydrolyzed by ESBLs. Data from hollow fiber infection models of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections indicate tazobactam exposures associated with intermittent-infusion or extended-infusion TZP regimens are insufficient for restoring the activity of piperacillin against 3GC-NS E. coli and Klebsiella spp. within the range of TZP MIC values currently considered susceptible by the FDA, CLSI, and EUCAST.

### Patterns, predictors, and intercenter variability in empiric Gram-Negative antibiotic use across 928 United States hospitals [^113AKinD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

During the 2019 study period, there were 8 017 740 admissions across 928 US hospitals. Overall, 37% (2 928 657) of admissions received gram-negative antibiotics within the first 2 days of hospitalization (ie, empiric gram-negative therapy). Patient and hospital characteristics by spectrum of therapy are displayed in Table 1. A total of 1 781 306 admissions (22% of all admissions and 61% of admissions that received empiric gram-negative therapy) received broad-spectrum gram-negative antibiotics (Figure 2). Piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime were the most frequently used broad-spectrum agents, representing 43% and 22% of all broad-spectrum empiric days of therapy (DOTs), respectively (Table 2). Of admissions that received empiric gram-negative therapy, 0.12% received extremely broad-spectrum gram-negative antibiotics, with tigecycline being the most common (Table 2). A further 1 147 351 admissions (39% of admissions that received empiric gram-negative therapy) only received narrow-spectrum agents (Figure 2). Table 2 reflects the empiric usage distribution for all gram-negative antibiotics. Figure 3 delineates the characteristics of patients who received broad-spectrum therapy by infectious syndrome, surgery, and ICU status.

### Piperacillin / tazobactam susceptibility test interpretive criteria for enterobacterales: recommendations from the United States committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing [^115GceKr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

(See the Editorial Commentary by Humphries on pages 1363–5.)

Piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) is recommended as a first-line treatment for Enterobacterales infections. Despite its wide-scale use, there has been considerable debate on its role for infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC-producing Enterobacterales. Data indicate that 15%–20% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. in the United States are third-generation cephalosporin-nonsusceptible (3GC-NS), a phenotypic marker of ESBL expression, and that a majority of these isolates harbor CTX-M enzymes. Although tazobactam is a potent inhibitor of most CTX-M enzymes, TZP has variable in vitro activity against ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. The reduced TZP susceptibility against ESBL-producing Enterobacterales is multifactorial but driven in large part by the copresence of other β-lactamases. Concerns have also been raised regarding the use of TZP for Enterobacterales (eg, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Klebsiella aerogenes) that have a moderate to high likelihood of clinically significant AmpC production, given that tazobactam does not efficiently inhibit these enzymes.

The in vitro susceptibility testing interpretive criteria (STIC) for TZP against Enterobacterales were recently updated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) (Tables 1 and 2). The United States Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (USCAST) also recently convened to review TZP STIC for Enterobacterales. While USCAST appreciates the expertise of these organizations, USCAST arrived at different TZP STIC for Enterobacterales. Here, we explain our recommendations (Table 1), the rationale behind them, and the future research that is needed to further inform these STIC. Of note, USCAST did not discuss the optimal method for incorporating their proposed TZP STIC across clinical microbiologic laboratories in their deliberations. USCAST recognizes that many laboratories use obsolete breakpoints for a variety of reasons and recommends that clinicians work with their microbiologic departments to ensure the most clinically appropriate STIC are used for interpreting TZP susceptibility results.

### Evaluation of piperacillin-tazobactam disks using contemporary enterobacterales isolates suggests the need for disk potency optimization [^114dL8Cj]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

We compared relative overall agreement between the three disk potencies for isolates with and without bla OXA-1 (Tables 3 and 4) and noted improvements with decreasing TZP potency independent of acceptability criteria. This study demonstrates that further optimization of the TZP disk potency is possible and provides better understanding of the performance of EUCAST and CLSI TZP disks, for clinical laboratories using challenging isolates. A larger, multicenter study is needed between CLSI and EUCAST to further optimize TZP disk diffusion but has been limited by no available funding opportunities for this work on an off-patent antimicrobial. The struggles in obtaining funding for this important work underscore the frequent challenge with AST for older but heavily used antimicrobials, which are largely driven by volunteer efforts and institutional funds.

### Comparative assessment of inoculum effects on the antimicrobial activity of amoxycillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam with extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-non-producing Escherichia coli isolates [^114Zapdx]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

A significant inoculum-size effect has been observed with piperacillin-tazobactam, and has been associated with beta-lactamase production in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers. This association has not been previously studied in the case of amoxycillin-clavulanate. Piperacillin-tazobactam and amoxycillin-clavulanate were compared, using high inocula of susceptible strains either harbouring ESBLs or not. Two non-ESBL-producing and 15 amoxycillin-clavulanate-susceptible and piperacillin-tazobactam-susceptible ESBL-producing Escherichia coli isolates, and their respective transconjugants, were tested in dilution susceptibility tests using standard and 100-fold higher inocula. Three ESBL-producing strains and E. coli ATCC 25922 were selected for time-kill studies using standard and high initial inocula. At high inocula, MICs of piperacillin increased > eight-fold for non-ESBL-producing strains, and MICs of piperacillin-tazobactam (8:1 ratio or with tazobactam fixed at 4 mg/L) increased > eight-fold for all ESBL-producing strains. However, amoxycillin MICs were not affected by a high inoculum with non-ESBL-producing strains, whereas the MICs of amoxycillin-clavulanate (2:1 and 4:1) increased ≤ four-fold for ESBL producers, using the broth and agar dilution methods. In kinetic studies at a high inoculum, amoxycillin and amoxycillin-clavulanate were bactericidal against E. coli ATCC 25922, whereas piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam yielded decreases of < 1 log(10) CFU/mL. Similarly, at a high inoculum, only amoxycillin-clavulanate was able to maintain bactericidal rates of killing over 24 h against the ESBL-positive E. coli isolates. The stability of amoxycillin-clavulanate and the contrasting results obtained with piperacillin-tazobactam against high inocula of ESBL-non-producing and ESBL-producing E. coli strains appear to be related to aspects other than the amount of beta-lactamase production.

### The management of multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae [^114vyj9X]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae are often related to the production of extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and represent an increasing global threat. Recommendations for the therapeutic management of MDR-related infections, however, are mainly derived from retrospective and nonrandomized prospective studies. The aim of this review is to discuss the challenges in the treatment of patients with infections because of MDR Enterobacteriaceae and provide an expert opinion while awaiting for more definitive data.

Recent Findings

To avoid the selection of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-sparing strategies should be considered. B-lactams/b-lactamase inhibitors, mainly piperacillin-tazobactam, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 16/4mg/ml or less represents the best alternative to carbapenems for the treatment of ESBL-producing strains. Overall, combination therapy may be preferred over monotherapy for CRE. The combination of a carbapenem-containing regimen with colistin or high-dose tigecycline or aminoglycoside can be administered at high-dose prolonged infusion with therapeutic drug monitoring for the treatment of CRE with MIC for meropenem 8–16 mg/l or less. For MIC higher than 8–16 mg/l, the use of meropenem should be avoided and various combination therapies based on the in-vitro susceptibility of antimicrobials (e.g., colistin, high-dose tigecycline, fosfomycin, and aminoglycosides) should be selected.

Summary

Carbapenem-sparing strategies should be used, when feasible, for ESBL infections. The majority of available nonrandomized studies highlight that combination for CRE seem to offer some therapeutic advantage over monotherapy. Strict infection control measures toward MDR Gram-negative pathogens remain necessary while awaiting for new treatment options.

Piperacillin-tazobactam for Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production: Piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for the treatment of invasive infections caused by Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant inducible AmpC production. Tazobactam is less effective at protecting β-lactams from AmpC hydrolysis than newer β-lactamase inhibitors such as avibactam, relebactam, and vaborbactam, and the role of piperacillin-tazobactam in treating Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production remains uncertain. A 2019 meta-analysis of observational studies did not identify a difference in mortality between patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for bacteremia caused by Enterobacter spp. Citrobacter spp., or Serratia spp., though significant heterogeneity and confounding by indication likely existed. A pilot unblinded clinical trial randomized 72 patients with bloodstream infections to piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 grams IV every 6 hours as a standard infusion) or meropenem (1 gram IV every 8 hours as a standard infusion) and found no significant differences in the primary composite outcome, with notable and seemingly conflicting findings among individual components.

Piperacillin-tazobactam is a combination of piperacillin, a penicillin-class antibacterial and tazobactam, a β-lactamase inhibitor, indicated for the treatment of:

- Intra-abdominal infections in adult and pediatric patients 2 months of age and older
- Nosocomial pneumonia in adult and pediatric patients 2 months of age and older
- Skin and skin structure infections in adults
- Female pelvic infections in adults
- Community-acquired pneumonia in adults. CLSI notes that since the approval of piperacillin-tazobactam in 1993, the spectrum of β-lactamases found in Enterobacterales expanded to include those that are poorly inhibited by tazobactam. This shift in epidemiology, coupled with new pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic and clinical outcome data, led to the current revision of the breakpoints by CLSI. The FDA breakpoints and the revised CLSI breakpoints are presented in Table 1.

1 FDA reviewed the submitted microbiology, PK-PD, and clinical information and agrees with lowering the piperacillin-tazobactam susceptible and resistant breakpoints for Enterobacterales as proposed by CLSI. The selection of a susceptible breakpoint of 8 mcg/mL for piperacillin-tazobactam for Enterobacterales is supported by an epidemiological cutoff value of 8 mcg/mL for both. Therefore, a footnote to the breakpoint table on the FDA piperacillin-tazobactam STIC webpage to state, "Clinical efficacy was shown for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, " will be added. Additional support for lowering the susceptible breakpoint is provided given a concern regarding the precision of the piperacillin-tazobactam susceptibility testing at an MIC of 16 mcg/mL. FDA notes that several observational clinical trials in patients with gram-negative infections suggest a piperacillin fT C > MIC/τ greater than 50% is more optimal in clinical efficacy response 4, 5, 6.

Other published PK-PD investigations have suggested maximal bacterial killing when drug concentrations were maintained above 4 times the MIC for a prolonged period of time 7, 8.

Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations

Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (BLBLI), including ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ticarcillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, have an in vitro activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobe organisms. However, increasing antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate among E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae including community-acquired isolates, during the last decade, has compromised clinical utility of these agents for empirical therapy of serious Gram-negative infections. This is likely due to excessive use of amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate in both children and adults, particularly in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection. The combination of over use of these oral antibiotics in the community and potential for household transmission of resistant E. coli strains among family members make ampicillin/sulbactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate resistance unpredictable. Fortunately, most isolates remain susceptible to other beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors such as piperacillin/tazobactam. Broad-spectrum activity of piperacillin/tazobactam, including anti-pseudomonal and anaerobic coverage, still make it an attractive option in the management of severe IAIs.

A meta-analysis of PubMed and Scopus databases providing data for mortality among patients treated with carbapenems, BLBLI or non- BLBLI (mainly cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones), preferably as monotherapy was published in 2013. The study reported no statistically significant difference in mortality between carbapenems and BLBLI administered as either empiric or definitive therapy. The authors concluded that the role of BLBLI should be further evaluated for definitive treatment. In a recent study of 331 unique patients with ESBL bacteremia, piperacillin/tazobactam appeared inferior to carbapenems in the treatment of ESBL bacteremia; the use of piperacillin/tazobactam in ESBLs infections is still controversial.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections, ESBL-producing, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to do not change or extend antibiotic therapy if clinical improvement occurs with piperacillin/tazobactam initiated as empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis caused by an organism later identified as an extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Consider administering TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems rather than piperacillin/tazobactam for the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs, recognizing that the risk of clinical failure with piperacillin/tazobactam may be low. Avoid using piperacillin/tazobactam for the treatment of infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, even if susceptibility to piperacillin/tazobactam is demonstrated.

### Evaluation of piperacillin-tazobactam disks using contemporary enterobacterales isolates suggests the need for disk potency optimization [^117SgxVn]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) is a commonly used broad-spectrum agent. OXA-1 β-lactamases drive global Enterobacterales TZP resistance and raise MICs to the clinical breakpoints (8/4–16/4 µg/mL), making susceptibility testing challenging. Two TZP disks are used globally. The first with 100 µg piperacillin and 10 µg tazobactam, established in 1992, is used by laboratories following U.S. FDA and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standards. The second, with 30 µg piperacillin and 6 µg tazobactam, was developed by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). When CLSI updated Enterobacterales TZP MIC breakpoints in 2022, it became apparent that the 100/10 µg disk may not accurately predict TZP resistance or susceptibility. In this study, we performed a disk mass titration study using 100 contemporary Enterobacterales isolates, including 40 harboring bla OXA-1. Relative to reference broth microdilution with CLSI breakpoints, categorical agreement (CA) for the 100/10 µg disk was 68% with 0.6% major errors (MEs) and 32% minor errors. The CA for the 30/6 µg disk against EUCAST breakpoints was 88% with 15% very major errors and 10% ME. A third disk developed in this study, 20/5 µg, yielded 81% CA with CLSI MIC breakpoints and disk breakpoints generated using the error-rate-bounded method. CA was 62.4%, 63.2%, and 70.9% for isolates with bla OXA-1 using the 100/10, 30/6, and 20/5 µg disks, respectively, whereas it was 71.6%, 86.9%, and 83.1% for isolates without bla OXA-1. Decreasing TZP disk potency improved the overall performance of disk diffusion and improved separation between susceptible and non-susceptible isolates, particularly those harboring OXA-1, but no disk yielded optimal results.

Importance

In this article, we address major gaps in contemporary data for piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) susceptibility testing and evaluate the performance of disk diffusion. TZP is the most common empiric broad-spectrum agent against Gram-negative pathogens and is used as a carbapenem-sparing regimen. OXA-1 β-lactamases drive global Enterobacterales TZP resistance and raise MICs to the clinical breakpoints, making susceptibility testing challenging. In 2022, CLSI revised the Enterobacterales TZP MIC breakpoints. Due to the lack of contemporary correlates, disk diffusion breakpoints were revised using outdated historical data from 1991 and 2003 and yielded unacceptable error rates. Additionally, there is a lack of global consensus on disk potency. The EUCAST TZP disks contain 30 μg piperacillin and 6 μg tazobactam. The CLSI disks, established after TZP approval in 1979 and prior to the widespread prevalence of ESBLs, contain 100 μg piperacillin and 10 μg tazobactam. Here, we evaluate disk diffusion using the 100/10 and 30/6 μg TZP disks with 100 contemporary Enterobacterales isolates, including 40 harboring bla OXA-1. We conducted a disk development study to determine if an alternative potency might address accuracy issues with TZP susceptibility testing. We demonstrate that decreasing TZP potency improves the performance of disk diffusion and improves separation between susceptible and non-susceptible isolates, particularly those harboring OXA-1, but no disk yielded optimal results. The alternative 20/5 μg disk yielded the lowest errors using CLSI MIC breakpoints and the best separation between susceptible isolates and isolates harboring bla OXA-1. Our study addresses an unmet need, shows that further optimization of the TZP disk potency is possible, and provides clinical laboratories with a better understanding of the performance of TZP disks using contemporary, challenging isolates. A larger, multicenter study is needed for further optimization but has been limited by a lack of funding for an off-patent antimicrobial. Our struggles in accessing funding underscore the frequent challenge with AST for older but heavily used antimicrobials.

ESBL-E pyelonephritis/cUTI clinical evidence and panel preference — A randomized, open-label clinical trial included 66 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli pyelonephritis or cUTI randomized to either piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours or ertapenem 1 g IV every 24 hours, with clinical success similar at 94% for piperacillin-tazobactam and 97% for ertapenem; these studies suggest noninferiority between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for pyelonephritis or cUTIs. In the subgroup of 231 patients with ESBL-E bloodstream infections from a urinary source in the aforementioned trial, higher mortality was identified in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (7% vs 3%) although not achieving statistical significance. Evaluating the totality of the data, the panel prefers carbapenem therapy (or oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, if susceptible) for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI; if piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy and clinical improvement occurs, the decision to continue should be made with the understanding that theoretically there may be an increased risk for microbiological failure with this approach.

Piperacillin–tazobactam dosing ratios and susceptibility breakpoints — In a 4.5 g dose of piperacillin-tazobactam there is an 8:1 ratio of piperacillin to tazobactam (ie, 4 grams of piperacillin and 0.5 grams of tazobactam), whereas in a 3 g dose of cefotolozane there is a 2:1 ratio of cefotolozane to tazobactam. The piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoint for Enterobacterales has been based on PK/PD considerations and a fixed concentration of 4 μg/mL of tazobactam in testing wells. In 2022, the CLSI lowered the piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoints for Enterobacterales: MICs of ≤ 8/4 μg/mL are considered susceptible and a MIC of 16 μg/mL is considered susceptible, dose-dependent; in the clinical trial mentioned in Question 1.3, 94% of isolates would have been considered susceptible or susceptible dose-dependent under the revised breakpoints, indicating that in the presence of ESBL production, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam may not correlate with clinical success.

### Piperacillin sodium and tazobactam sodium (Zosyn) [^116DSkuB]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Piperacillin sodium exerts bactericidal activity by inhibiting septum formation and cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. In vitro, piperacillin is active against a variety of gram‑positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Tazobactam sodium has little clinically relevant in vitro activity against bacteria due to its reduced affinity to penicillin‑binding proteins. It is, however, a beta-lactamase inhibitor of the Molecular class A enzymes, including Richmond-Sykes class III (Bush class 2b & 2b') penicillinases and cephalosporinases. It varies in its ability to inhibit class II and IV (2a & 4) penicillinases. Tazobactam does not induce chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases at tazobactam concentrations achieved with the recommended dosage regimen.

Antimicrobial Activity

ZOSYN has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)]:

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for piperacillin and tazobactam against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of ZOSYN in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

### Effect of piperacillin-tazobactam vs meropenem on 30-day mortality for patients with E. coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection and ceftriaxone resistance: a randomized clinical trial [^112BoJV8]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases mediate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone) in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Significant infections caused by these strains are usually treated with carbapenems, potentially selecting for carbapenem resistance. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be an effective "carbapenem-sparing" option to treat extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers.

Objectives

To determine whether definitive therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam is noninferior to meropenem (a carbapenem) in patients with bloodstream infection caused by ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible E coli or K pneumoniae.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Noninferiority, parallel group, randomized clinical trial included hospitalized patients enrolled from 26 sites in 9 countries from February 2014 to July 2017. Adult patients were eligible if they had at least 1 positive blood culture with E coli or Klebsiella spp testing nonsusceptible to ceftriaxone but susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. Of 1646 patients screened, 391 were included in the study.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, 4.5 g, every 6 hours (n = 188 participants) or meropenem, 1 g, every 8 hours (n = 191 participants) for a minimum of 4 days, up to a maximum of 14 days, with the total duration determined by the treating clinician.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days after randomization. A noninferiority margin of 5% was used.

Results

Among 379 patients (mean age, 66.5 years; 47.8% women) who were randomized appropriately, received at least 1 dose of study drug, and were included in the primary analysis population, 378 (99.7%) completed the trial and were assessed for the primary outcome. A total of 23 of 187 patients (12.3%) randomized to piperacillin-tazobactam met the primary outcome of mortality at 30 days compared with 7 of 191 (3.7%) randomized to meropenem (risk difference, 8.6% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 14.5%]; p = 0.90 for noninferiority). Effects were consistent in an analysis of the per-protocol population. Nonfatal serious adverse events occurred in 5 of 188 patients (2.7%) in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 3 of 191 (1.6%) in the meropenem group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with E coli or K pneumoniae bloodstream infection and ceftriaxone resistance, definitive treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam compared with meropenem did not result in a noninferior 30-day mortality. These findings do not support use of piperacillin-tazobactam in this setting.

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^1141YTtz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Among beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor agents, ticarcillin/clavulanate and ampicillin/sulbactam have been used in the treatment of intra mild to moderate intra-abdominal infections. Ampicillin-sulbactam is still indicated for community infections of mild-to-moderate severity, however the increasing resistance of Enterobacteriaceae reported in the last decade could compromise its clinical effectiveness.

Piperacillin/tazobactam is a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination with increased gram-negative spectrum and anti-pseudomonas activity. Piperacillin/tazobactam retains in vitro activity against broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing, many extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and many Pseudomonas isolates. It is still a reliable option for the empiric treatment of high risk intra-abdominal infections.

Carbapenems have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity that includes Gram-positive (except resistant gram positive cocci) and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic pathogens.

Group 1 carbapenems includes ertapenem, a once a day carbapenem that shares the activity of imipenem and meropenem against most species, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens, but is not active against non-fermentative gram negative and Enterococcus. Ertapenem is particularly suitable for low risk community-acquired intra-abdominal infections. Once-daily ertapenem is an interesting option for the treatment of these infections.

Group 2 includes imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem and doripenem, that share activity against non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli and are particularly suitable for severe infections.

Doripenem is a new 1-β-methyl carbapenem recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections. Doripenem similarly to imipenem and meropenem, has a broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria. Doripenem is more effective, in vitro, than meropenem and imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Group 2 carbapenems are important options for the empirical treatment of high risk intra-abdominal infections also in hospitalized patients.

In the past Cephalosporins have been often used in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. Cephalosporins except, the second generation subgroup with activity against Bacteroides spp (cefoxitin and cefotetan), do not exhibit anti-anaerobic activity and must always be used in combination with anti-anaerobic agents.

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) bloodstream infection — carbapenem preference and extrapolation: In those with clinical isolates available for retesting, 30-day mortality occurred in 9% vs 4% in the piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem arms, respectively, and although the 95% confidence interval ranged from −1% to 11%, the panel still suggests carbapenem therapy as the preferred treatment of ESBL-producing bloodstream infections. Comparable clinical trial data are not available for ESBL-E infections from other body sites, but the panel suggests extrapolating evidence for ESBL-E bloodstream infections to other common sites of infection, and suggests extending the findings to imipenem-cilastatin and ertapenem, with the latter limited to patients with normal serum albumin and patients who are not critically ill.

Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients

Mean age of patients was 66.3 ± 13.7 years and 30.9% of patients were female. Overall, 74.3% of patients were diagnosed with septic shock (Sepsis-2 definition). When applying ex post the currently valid Sepsis-3 definition, 52.2% of patients fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of septic shock and the remaining 47.8% the definition for sepsis. Overall, the treatment groups were well balanced with respect to baseline characteristics (Table 1). Concerning antimicrobial combination therapy there was also no difference between study groups. On day one, 38.5% of patients in the TDM group and 42.9% of patients without TDM received an additional antibiotic agent. The most common combination partner in both groups was a fluoroquinolone (28.1% of patients), followed by vancomycin (14.4%), macrolides (13.6%) and linezolid (10.8%). In 166 of 253 study participants (65.6%), a causative pathogen was identified. The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli [n = 86 (17.0%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (n = 59 (11.7%)] and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus [n = 34 (6.7%)] (eTable 3 electronic supplementary material). The piperacillin/tazobactam MIC of the five most commonly detected Gram-negative pathogens, which represent 78% (228/290) of all detected Gram-negative bacteria and 45% (228/505) of all detected pathogens, was ≤ 4 mg/L in 79.8% (182/228) of isolates. Only 6.1% (14/228) of isolates had a MIC of 8–16 mg/L and 14.0% (32/228) of isolates were resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam (MIC > 16 mg/L) (eTable 4 electronic supplementary material). Median time to availability of MIC values in patients with TDM-guided therapy was 2 days (2–3).

### Mortality of patients with sepsis administered piperacillin-tazobactam vs cefepime [^115mKY4n]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Experimental and observational studies have suggested that empirical treatment for bacterial sepsis with antianaerobic antibiotics (eg, piperacillin-tazobactam) is associated with adverse outcomes compared with anaerobe-sparing antibiotics (eg, cefepime). However, a recent pragmatic clinical trial of piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime showed no difference in short-term outcomes at 14 days. Further studies are needed to help clarify the empirical use of these agents.

Objective

To examine the use of piperacillin-tazobactam compared with cefepime in 90-day mortality in patients treated empirically for sepsis, using instrumental variable analysis of a 15-month piperacillin-tazobactam shortage.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In a retrospective cohort study, hospital admissions at the University of Michigan from July 1, 2014, to December 31, 2018, including a piperacillin-tazobactam shortage period from June 12, 2015, to September 18, 2016, were examined. Adult patients with suspected sepsis treated with vancomycin and either piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime for conditions with presumed equipoise between piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime were included in the study. Data analysis was conducted from December 17, 2022, to April 11, 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included organ failure-free, ventilator-free, and vasopressor-free days. The 15-month piperacillin-tazobactam shortage period was used as an instrumental variable for unmeasured confounding in antibiotic selection.

Results

Among 7569 patients (4174 men [55%]; median age, 63 [IQR 52–73] years) with sepsis meeting study eligibility, 4523 were treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam and 3046 were treated with vancomycin and cefepime. Of patients who received piperacillin-tazobactam, only 152 (3%) received it during the shortage. Treatment groups did not differ significantly in age, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, or time to antibiotic administration. In an instrumental variable analysis, piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with an absolute mortality increase of 5.0% at 90 days (95% CI, 1.9%-8.1%) and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.4–2.7) fewer organ failure-free days, 1.1 (95% CI, 0.57–1.62) fewer ventilator-free days, and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.01–2.01) fewer vasopressor-free days.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with suspected sepsis and no clear indication for antianaerobic coverage, administration of piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with higher mortality and increased duration of organ dysfunction compared with cefepime. These findings suggest that the widespread use of empirical antianaerobic antibiotics in sepsis may be harmful.

Piperacillin-tazobactam for Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa

CLSI revised the piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) clinical breakpoints for the Enterobacterales in 2022 and those of P. aeruginosa in 2023. These revisions were informed by an in-depth review of clinical data and the extensive body of PK-PD literature that has been published for TZP over the past four decades. Rationale documents are available for these changes from CLSI and have been published in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

TZP was first approved for human use in the United States in 1993, at which time breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. were the same. CLSI revised P. aeruginosa breakpoints in 2012, when the susceptible breakpoint was updated from ≤ 64 to ≤ 16 µg/mL, but the Enterobacterales breakpoint had not undergone review since 1993. The major incentive for a review was the publication of the MERINO trial, which failed to achieve a non-inferiority endpoint for TZP compared to meropenem for the treatment of ceftriaxone not susceptible (e.g. intermediate and resistant) Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. Post hoc analysis of this study identified that TZP was erroneously reported as susceptible by the commercial AST methods used in the trial, and reference broth microdilution (BMD) MIC results showed an association of MIC > 16 µg/mL and mortality in the trial. PD data indicated that a time above MIC of 50% is required for bactericidal activity of TZP. For patients treated with TZP using routine dosing (i.e. 3.375–4.5 g q6h as a 30-minute infusion), PK-PD analyses suggest that MICs up to 8 µg/mL can achieve this endpoint. However, if an extended infusion strategy is used (i.e. 4.5 g q6h as a 3-h infusion or q8h as a 4-h infusion), MICs up to 16 µg/mL are predicted to achieve the target. Based on these data, the TZP Enterobacterales breakpoints were revised to ≤ 8/4 µg/mL (susceptible), 16/4 µg/mL (susceptible-dose dependent using an extended infusion strategy), and ≥ 32/4 µg/mL (resistant).

IDSA 2023 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), piperacillin–tazobactam suggested approach — If piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis caused by an organism later identified as an ESBL-E and clinical improvement occurs, no change or extension of antibiotic therapy is necessary. The panel suggests TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems rather than piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI, and piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for the treatment of infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam is demonstrated.

### The effects of antibiotic cycling and mixing on antibiotic resistance in intensive care units: a cluster-randomised crossover trial [^114K3psP]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether antibiotic rotation strategies reduce prevalence of antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria in intensive care units (ICUs) has not been accurately established. We aimed to assess whether cycling of antibiotics compared with a mixing strategy (changing antibiotic to an alternative class for each consecutive patient) would reduce the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria in European intensive care units (ICUs).

Methods

In a cluster-randomised crossover study, we randomly assigned ICUs to use one of three antibiotic groups (third-generation or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, and carbapenems) as preferred empirical treatment during 6-week periods (cycling) or to change preference after every consecutively treated patient (mixing). Computer-based randomisation of intervention and rotated antibiotic sequence was done centrally. Cycling or mixing was applied for 9 months; then, following a washout period, the alternative strategy was implemented. We defined antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria as Enterobacteriaceae with extended-spectrum β-lactamase production or piperacillin-tazobactam resistance, and Acinetobacter spp and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with piperacillin-tazobactam or carbapenem resistance. Data were collected for all admissions during the study. The primary endpoint was average, unit-wide, monthly point prevalence of antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria in respiratory and perineal swabs with adjustment for potential confounders. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01293071.

Findings

Eight ICUs (from Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal, and Slovenia) were randomly assigned and patients enrolled from June 27, 2011, to Feb 16, 2014. 4069 patients were admitted during the cycling periods in total and 4707 were admitted during the mixing periods. Of these, 745 patients during cycling and 853 patients during mixing were present during the monthly point-prevalence surveys, and were included in the main analysis. Mean prevalence of the composite primary endpoint was 23% (168/745) during cycling and 22% (184/853) during mixing (p = 0.64), yielding an adjusted incidence rate ratio during mixing of 1.039 (95% CI 0.837–1.291; p = 0.73). There was no difference in all-cause in-ICU mortality between intervention periods.

Interpretation

Antibiotic cycling does not reduce the prevalence of carriage of antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria in patients admitted to the ICU.

Funding

European Union Seventh Framework Programme.

### Current evidence for therapy of ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacteremia [^115ee7JW]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article aims to give a state-of-the-art assessment of treatment options for bloodstream infection because of ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, especially those caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. In particular, this review assesses whether current data support 'carbapenem-sparing options' for treatment of these serious infections.

Recent Findings

The MERINO trial refuted earlier observational studies some of which showed equivalence in outcomes between beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and carbapenems for treatment of bloodstream infection because of ceftriaxone-resistant Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp. Although numerous factors influence mortality following bloodstream infection, the variability in piperacillin/tazobactam MICs observed in the MERINO trial make this a less secure option than meropenem. However, the search for carbapenem-sparing options continues with four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in progress and a number of other options in clinical development.

Summary

Hard outcomes from RCTs are still needed before intravenous carbapenems can be displaced as the treatment of choice for ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.

### Carbapenem therapy is associated with improved survival compared with piperacillin-tazobactam for patients with extended-spectrum β-lactamase bacteremia [^113h8EBp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ) for the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) bacteremia is controversial. We compared 14-day mortality of PTZ vs carbapenems as empiric therapy in a cohort of patients with ESBL bacteremia who all received definitive therapy with a carbapenem.

Methods

Patients hospitalized between January 2007 and April 2014 with monomicrobial ESBL bacteremia were included. A decrease of > 3 doubling dilutions in the minimum inhibitory concentration for third-generation cephalosporins tested in combination with 4 µg/mL of clavulanic acid was used to confirm ESBL status. The primary exposure was empiric therapy, defined as antibiotic therapy administered to a patient before ESBL status was known. Patients were excluded if they did not receive a carbapenem after ESBL production was identified. The primary outcome was time to death from the first day of bacteremia. Propensity scores using inverse probability of exposure weighting (IPW) were used to estimate the probability that a patient would receive PTZ vs carbapenems empirically. We calculated overall hazard ratios for mortality censored at 14 days using Cox proportional hazards models on an IPW-adjusted cohort.

Results

A total of 331 unique patients with ESBL bacteremia were identified. One hundred three (48%) patients received PTZ empirically and 110 (52%) received carbapenems empirically. The adjusted risk of death was 1.92 times higher for patients receiving empiric PTZ compared with empiric carbapenem therapy (95% confidence interval, 1.07–3.45).

Conclusions

PTZ appears inferior to carbapenems for the treatment of ESBL bacteremia. For patients at high risk of invasive ESBL infections, early carbapenem therapy should be considered. Our findings should not be extended to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations in development, as limited clinical data are available for these agents.

### Ertapenem versus piperacillin / tazobactam in the treatment of complicated intraabdominal infections: results of a double-blind, randomized comparative phase III trial [^115kfFdQ]. Annals of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the clinical efficacy and safety of ertapenem, a novel beta-lactam agent with wide activity against common pathogens encountered in intraabdominal infection.

Summary Background Data

Ertapenem has a pharmacokinetic profile and antimicrobial spectrum that support the potential for use as a once-a-day agent for the treatment of common mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections. METHODS This prospective, randomized, controlled, and double-blind trial was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of ertapenem with piperacillin/tazobactam as therapy following adequate surgical management of complicated intraabdominal infections.

Results

Six hundred thirty-three patients were included in the modified intent-to-treat population, with 396 meeting all criteria for the evaluable population. Patients with a wide range of infections were enrolled; perforated or abscessed appendicitis was most common (approximately 60% in microbiologically evaluable population). A prospective, expert panel review was conducted to assess the adequacy of surgical source control in patients who were failures as a component of evaluability. For the modified intent-to-treat groups, 245 of 311 patients treated with ertapenem (79.3%) were cured, as were 232 of 304 (76.2) treated with piperacillin/tazobactam. One hundred seventy-six of 203 microbiologically evaluable patients treated with ertapenem (86.7%) were cured, as were 157 of the 193 (81.2%) treated with piperacillin/tazobactam.

Conclusions

In this study, the efficacy of ertapenem 1 g once a day was equivalent to piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g every 6 hours in the treatment of a range of intraabdominal infections. Ertapenem was generally well tolerated and had a similar safety and tolerability profile to piperacillin/tazobactam. A formal process for review of adequacy of source control was found to be of benefit. The results of this trial suggest that ertapenem may be a useful option that could eliminate the need for combination and/or multidosed antibiotic regimens for the empiric treatment of intraabdominal infections.

### Carbapenems versus piperacillin-tazobactam for bloodstream infections of nonurinary source caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae [^115irFDa]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2015). Low credibility.

A recent, frequently quoted study has suggested that for bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL) Escherichia coli, treatment with β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors (BLBLIs) might be equivalent to treatment with carbapenems. However, the majority of BSIs originate from the urinary tract. A multicenter, multinational efficacy analysis was conducted from 2010 to 2012 to compare outcomes of patients with non-urinary ESBL BSIs who received a carbapenem (69 patients) vs those treated with piperacillin-tazobactam (10 patients). In multivariate analysis, therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with increased 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 7.9, P = 0.03). For ESBL BSIs of a non-urinary origin, carbapenems should be considered a superior treatment to BLBLIs.
