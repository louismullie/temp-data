## Question

what's the evidence for punctal plugs in dry eyes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evidence for punctal plugs in dry eye disease, including their efficacy, safety, patient selection, and how they are positioned in clinical guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence base, especially the Cochrane reviews. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (AAO, COP, BSR) recommend and how they grade the evidence. Next, I will examine key randomized and observational studies for signals of benefit and limitations. After that, I need to assess safety, retention, and complications. Then, I should consider special populations and contexts (Sjögren's, post-LASIK, pediatric, cGVHD). Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with appropriate caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the highest-quality evidence base. The 2017 Cochrane review included 18 trials and 711 participants and concluded that improvements in symptoms and commonly tested signs with punctal plugs are inconclusive overall, citing very low to low certainty evidence due to heterogeneity, small samples, and risk of bias. This is the most conservative and methodologically rigorous assessment to date [^114apacS]. Wait, let me verify whether a later summary changed that stance; the 2019 Cochrane summary echoed the same conclusion, noting that while some individual trials suggested symptom improvement, pooled effects were inconsistent and certainty remained low, reinforcing the need for cautious interpretation [^112PsZ7W].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to see how expert bodies translate this evidence. The 2024 AAO Preferred Practice Pattern recommends considering silicone punctal plugs for symptomatic relief in severe dry eye disease, emphasizing careful sizing to reduce extrusion and noting that evidence quality is insufficient but supportive enough for discretionary use in selected patients [^116ypD52] [^111uZrRD]. Hold on, I should verify the COP stance; the 2023 College of Optometrists guideline advises considering punctal plugs to diminish tear outflow in DED, aligning with a tear-conservation strategy when appropriate [^114GUcGi]. I need to check rheumatology guidance for Sjögren's; the 2025 British Society for Rheumatology recommends punctal plugs only in carefully selected patients because they may worsen corneal surface inflammation in some situations, underscoring the need for judicious selection and close follow-up [^111omY1M].

> I will now examine randomized and prospective studies for signals of benefit, while keeping their limitations in mind. A randomized trial comparing silicone plugs versus artificial tears suggested greater symptomatic improvement at 3 months with plugs, but the certainty remains low and heterogeneity in scales complicates inference [^112PsZ7W]. Let me consider device-specific retention; a randomized trial showed Parasol plugs had significantly better 6‑month retention than Super Flex plugs and reduced artificial tear use, with within-group improvements in objective measures, though between-group differences were limited and the sample was small [^116fmRHq]. But wait, what about combination therapy signals; a small RCT found plug-containing regimens improved Schirmer scores earlier than cyclosporine alone and that combination therapy yielded the greatest reduction in artificial tear use by 6 months, suggesting additive effects, albeit with very low certainty [^112m1dwE]. I should double-check that these findings are hypothesis-generating rather than definitive, given risk of bias and imprecision [^114apacS].

> Next, I should review observational data for real-world signals and safety. Large retrospective series report symptom improvement in roughly 74–86% of treated eyes and reduced reliance on lubricants, but spontaneous extrusion is common and retention varies by plug design and technique, reinforcing the need for careful sizing and follow-up [^113pbqeA] [^113UnjtN]. Hold on, I should verify long-term retention; prospective cohort data show approximately 84% retention at 3 months, 70% at 1 year, and 56% at 2 years, with canalicular stenosis occurring in about one-third after spontaneous loss, which can be clinically relevant if future lacrimal surgery is needed [^114htHin]. Let me reconsider the implication: this supports counseling about retention risk and planning for surveillance and potential alternatives if plugs are lost or stenosis develops [^111uZrRD].

> I need to ensure a balanced safety assessment. Common adverse effects include epiphora, foreign body sensation, and spontaneous plug loss. Less common but important complications include canaliculitis, dacryocystitis, pyogenic granuloma, and biofilm formation, with Staphylococcus epidermidis frequently identified on cultured plug material, which argues for hygiene and vigilance during placement and follow-up [^1157kke5] [^112XeExa]. Wait, let me verify device-specific issues. Intracanalicular plugs have higher rates of canaliculitis in some series, and surface defects on certain silicone plug designs have been linked to chronic irritation, highlighting the importance of plug selection and inspection at follow-up [^1157kke5] [^116psDHX]. I should confirm that these risks are uncommon overall but clinically meaningful and modifiable with technique and follow-up [^111uZrRD].

> Now, I should consider special populations and contexts. In Sjögren's disease, expert guidance advises caution due to potential worsening of surface inflammation from retained proinflammatory mediators. However, small studies and case series suggest symptomatic and objective improvements in selected patients, and combination with anti-inflammatory therapy may mitigate risks, so shared decision-making is essential [^111omY1M] [^117QnTHV]. For post-LASIK dry eye, punctal occlusion can improve wavefront aberrations and visual function in some patients, supporting a role after surface stabilization and inflammation control, though evidence quality is limited [^112k2BqY]. In children, retrospective data suggest good safety and efficacy with reduced lubricant burden, but extrusion is common and general anesthesia may be required, so expectations and logistics must be addressed [^114nVegP]. In chronic ocular GVHD, plugs can be effective adjuncts, but inflammation-first strategies and infection risk awareness remain critical, and cautery may be preferred if repeated extrusion occurs [^117JvzwD].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications. The totality of evidence indicates that punctal plugs can provide symptomatic relief and reduce artificial tear dependence in a meaningful subset of patients, particularly with aqueous-deficient phenotypes and after optimization of ocular surface inflammation, but the certainty of benefit is low to moderate at best and highly dependent on patient selection, plug type, and technique [^114apacS] [^112PsZ7W]. Hold on, I should verify the practical approach: guidelines position plugs as a discretionary option for moderate-to-severe DED refractory to first-line measures, ideally after achieving tear homeostasis and with attention to inflammation control to avoid retaining proinflammatory cytokines on the ocular surface [^116ypD52] [^111uZrRD]. I need to ensure we also note that combining plugs with anti-inflammatory therapy may yield additive benefits in some patients, though this remains hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^112m1dwE].

> I should now translate this into a stepwise clinical recommendation with built-in safeguards. First, optimize the ocular surface with preservative-free lubrication, lid hygiene, and short-course anti-inflammatory therapy as indicated; consider a brief course of topical corticosteroid before plug insertion in inflamed eyes to reduce the risk of worsening surface disease from retained cytokines, consistent with PPP guidance and inflammatory-first paradigms [^111uZrRD] [^112SydKJ]. Next, select silicone punctal plugs and size carefully to maximize retention; counsel that extrusion occurs in a substantial minority and that canalicular stenosis can follow spontaneous loss, which may have long-term implications for lacrimal drainage, so follow-up at 1–3 months is prudent [^114htHin] [^111uZrRD] [^113pbqeA]. Then, monitor for epiphora, discomfort, infection, and granuloma; if plugs are repeatedly lost or cause irritation, consider intracanalicular options or proceed to cautery in refractory cases, recognizing trade-offs in reversibility and infection risk [^1157kke5] [^116DGn4J]. Finally, reassess symptom burden, artificial tear use, and objective signs at 3–6 months to determine ongoing benefit and decide on removal, replacement, or escalation to surgical occlusion if appropriate [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the patient has primarily evaporative DED or significant meibomian gland disease. I should confirm that tear conservation alone may not address lipid layer instability; in such cases, prioritize MGD-directed therapy and consider plugs only as adjuncts once inflammation and meibomian function are optimized, to avoid masking underlying drivers of disease [^111AM5hD] [^113e8pmX]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with contemporary algorithms; yes, modern stepwise care emphasizes addressing lid margin disease and inflammation before or alongside tear retention strategies, which fits the mixed-mechanism reality of many DED patients [^116XuECY].

> In conclusion, punctal plugs are a reasonable, reversible tear-conservation option for carefully selected patients with moderate-to-severe aqueous-deficient DED who remain symptomatic despite optimized surface therapy, with the understanding that benefits are modest and heterogeneous, retention is imperfect, and complications are uncommon but consequential. Shared decision-making, meticulous technique, and planned follow-up are essential to realize benefit while minimizing harm [^114apacS] [^116ypD52] [^111uZrRD].

Punctal plugs are a **modestly effective** [^112PsZ7W] treatment for aqueous-deficient dry eye, with **symptom improvement in 60–85%** of patients and reduced artificial tear use [^113pbqeA] [^113UnjtN]. Evidence is limited by small, heterogeneous studies [^114apacS], and benefits are most pronounced in severe aqueous-deficient cases [^113LB2Hw]. Plugs are generally safe [^1157kke5], but epiphora, extrusion, and rare canaliculitis or dacryocystitis can occur [^114apacS]; careful patient selection and follow-up are essential [^113pbqeA]. Guidelines suggest use after optimizing medical therapy [^111uZrRD], especially in severe aqueous-deficient dry eye [^111uZrRD].

## Clinical evidence for efficacy

### Symptomatic improvement

- **RCTs and observational studies**: 60–85% report symptom improvement [^113pbqeA] [^113UnjtN], with reduced artificial tear use [^112PsZ7W].
- **Cochrane review**: modest symptom improvement, especially in severe aqueous-deficient dry eye [^113LB2Hw] [^117RWLLU].
- **Sjögren's syndrome**: significant symptom improvement in primary SS-related dry eye [^117QnTHV].

---

### Objective clinical signs

- **Tear film stability**: improved tear break-up time (TBUT) and reduced corneal/conjunctival staining [^114D2QZv] [^115HA8BM].
- **Tear volume**: increased tear meniscus height and Schirmer scores [^116fmRHq].
- **Combination therapy**: plugs plus cyclosporine may further improve signs and reduce artificial tear use [^112m1dwE].

---

## Safety and complications

Punctal plugs are **generally safe** [^1157kke5], but complications can occur:

| **Complication** | **Frequency** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Epiphora (tearing) | 9–15% | Common, usually mild [^1157kke5] [^114apacS] |
| Plug extrusion/loss | 30–50% | Common, often within 3–6 months [^113pbqeA] [^114htHin] |
| Canaliculitis | 8% (intracanalicular) | Rare, more with intracanalicular plugs [^1157kke5] [^116rbXVV] |
| Dacryocystitis | Rare | Serious infection, requires removal [^1157kke5] [^114apacS] |
| Pyogenic granuloma | Rare | Inflammatory tissue growth [^1157kke5] [^116rbXVV] |

---

## Patient selection and clinical guidelines

Guidelines recommend **careful selection** and timing:

- **Severity**: consider for severe aqueous-deficient dry eye refractory to medical therapy [^116ypD52] [^111uZrRD].
- **Inflammation**: optimize ocular surface inflammation before plugs to avoid worsening symptoms [^111AM5hD] [^111uZrRD].
- **Sjögren's syndrome**: consider in selected patients, but monitor for inflammation [^111omY1M] [^117RWLLU].
- **Post-LASIK**: useful for persistent dry eye after refractive surgery [^116yhzkf] [^112k2BqY].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current evidence

- **Study quality**: many studies are small, short-term, and heterogeneous [^114apacS] [^112PsZ7W].
- **Long-term data**: limited long-term efficacy and safety data [^114apacS] [^113LB2Hw].
- **Patient-reported outcomes**: inconsistent use of validated symptom scales [^115MYjB3] [^114apacS].

---

## Summary of evidence

Punctal plugs offer **modest symptom relief** and improved tear metrics, especially in severe aqueous-deficient dry eye [^112PsZ7W] [^113LB2Hw]. They are generally safe, but extrusion and rare infections can occur; careful selection and follow-up are key [^1157kke5] [^114apacS]. Use is best after medical optimization, with shared decision-making about benefits and risks [^111uZrRD].

### SmartPlug versus silicone punctal plug therapy for dry eye: a prospective randomized trial [^114D2QZv]. Cornea (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the clinical efficacy, retention rates, and complications of SmartPlug insertion compared with silicone punctal plugs in patients with dry eye.

Methods

Thirty-six eyes with subjective symptoms of dry eye in addition to a tear film breakup time (TBUT) < 5 seconds and evidence of ocular surface damage on rose Bengal or fluorescein staining were included. Treated eyes were randomized to either a silicone plug or SmartPlug inferior punctal occlusion. Pre- and posttreatment evaluations included subjective symptom scoring, tear meniscus height, TBUT, Schirmer test, fluorescein and rose Bengal staining, and artificial tear use.

Results

After a mean follow-up period of 11.2 weeks, both the silicone plug- and SmartPlug-treated eyes showed significant improvement in symptom scoring (P = 0.002 and P = 0.005, respectively), TBUT (P = 0.035 and P = 0.009, respectively), and fluorescein (P = 0.024 and P = 0.016, respectively) and rose Bengal (P = 0.008 and P = 0.046, respectively) staining. There was no significant difference in these parameters between the 2 plugs. SmartPlug-, but not the silicone plug-treated eyes showed significant improvement in mean tear meniscus height (P = 0.037). The use of artificial tear supplements was reduced in 10 (55.6%) silicone- and 11 (61.1%) SmartPlug-treated eyes. Minor complications related to plug insertion were experienced in 4 (22%) silicone- and 2 (11%) SmartPlug-treated eyes. Spontaneous plug loss occurred with 6 (33%) silicone plugs.

Conclusions

This prospective randomized trial shows that SmartPlug insertion has equivalent clinical efficacy to the use of conventional silicone plugs. Both SmartPlug and silicone plug use can reduce dependency on tear supplements in > 55% of patients with dry eye.

### Annual direct cost of dry eye in Japan [^112ATbGV]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This study was performed to estimate the annual direct cost incurred by dry eye patients, which includes expenses for treatment and drugs, as well as the cost of punctal plugs.

Methods

The study group consisted of 118 dry eye patients aged 20 years or older who visited any of the 15 medical care facilities that participated in this prospective cohort dry eye study. We estimated annual direct costs from outpatient medical records and survey questionnaires obtained from patients.

Results

Of the total patients enrolled, 10 were men and 108 women, and their average age was 64.1 ± 11.2 years. The number of hospital visits made by patients was 5.8 ± 3.6 per year. Among those who used ophthalmic solutions, the numbers of bottles used per year were as follows: 32.1 ± 20.8 bottles of hyaluronic acid ophthalmic solution (87 patients), 53.1 ± 42.2 bottles of artificial tears (40 patients), and 33.2 ± 23.2 bottles of over-the-counter eyedrops (15 patients). In patients with punctal plugs, 4.1 ± 3.9 plugs were used annually. The annual drug cost was 32,000 ± 21,675 Japanese yen (323 ± 219 US dollars). The clinical cost was 16,318 ± 9961 Japanese yen (165 ± 101 US dollars). The total direct costs including punctal plug treatment amounted to 52,467 ± 38,052 Japanese yen (530 ± 384 US dollars).

Conclusion

Although treatment modalities for dry eye in Japan were different from those in the US and in European countries, the direct cost of dry eye patients in Japan was comparable with that reported in those countries. Considering the high prevalence of dry eye, the direct cost of this chronic condition may be significant.

### Simple surgical punctal occlusion with high frequency radiowave electrosurgery [^114qgxsX]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

According to the DEWS report (2007), dry eye is classified into aqueous-deficient type and evaporating type. However, many patients tend to have both aspects. ADDE is composed of Sjögren's syndrome dry eye (SSDE) and non-Sjögren's syndrome dry eye (NSDE). Besides SS, ADDE can occur by various causes such as systemic drug, Graft-versus-host reaction or disease (GVHD), refractive surgery, chemical burn, cicatricial conjunctival disease, and so on.

For the management of aqueous deficient dry eye, various types of ocular lubricants are considered as primary treatments. Those who are refractory to these treatments are recommended to use punctal plug, moisture chamber, and immunomodulatory drugs as secondary treatments.

Plugs of various materials and shapes are being used in punctal occlusion method. Many studies have shown that the use of punctal plugs for patients with dry eye syndrome can significantly improve symptoms and ocular surface index. While punctal plug is easy to perform, complications such as self-extrusion, granuloma formation, and infection including dacryocystitis may also occur. According to a study by Ming-Cheng et al. when silicone punctal plug was used in dry eye patients who were refractory to the maximal tolerable medical treatment, it significantly improved ocular surface indices such as corneal erosion and Schirmer test. A study performed by Balaram et al. also showed similar results. However, punctal plugs were spontaneously lost due to self-extrusion in both studies. Besides, plug associated complications such as granuloma formation and bacterial biofilm formation have been reported. Thus, close care should be taken during the treatment.

### Safety and efficacy of lacrimal drainage system plugs for dry eye syndrome: a report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology [^1157kke5]. Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the published literature assessing the efficacy and safety of lacrimal drainage system plug insertion for dry eye in adults.

Methods

Literature searches of the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were last conducted on March 9, 2015, without date restrictions and were limited to English language abstracts. The searches retrieved 309 unique citations. The primary authors reviewed the titles and abstracts. Inclusion criteria specified reports that provided original data on plugs for the treatment of dry eyes in at least 25 patients. Fifty-three studies of potential relevance were assigned to full-text review. The 27 studies that met the inclusion criteria underwent data abstraction by the panels. Abstracted data included study characteristics, patient characteristics, plug type, insertion technique, treatment response, and safety information. All studies were observational and rated by a methodologist as level II or III evidence.

Results

The plugs included punctal, intracanalicular, and dissolving types. Fifteen studies reported metrics of improvement in dry eye symptoms, ocular-surface status, artificial tear use, contact lens comfort, and tear break-up time. Twenty-five studies included safety data. Plug placement resulted in ≥ 50% improvement of symptoms, improvement in ocular-surface health, reduction in artificial tear use, and improved contact lens comfort in patients with dry eye. Serious complications from plugs were infrequent. Plug loss was the most commonly reported problem with punctal plugs, occurring on average in 40% of patients. Overall, among all plug types, approximately 9% of patients experienced epiphora and 10% required removal because of irritation from the plugs. Canaliculitis was the most commonly reported problem for intracanalicular plugs and occurred in approximately 8% of patients. Other complications were reported in less than 4% of patients on average and included tearing, discomfort, pyogenic granuloma, and dacryocystitis.

Conclusions

On the basis of level II and III evidence in these studies, plugs improve the signs and symptoms of moderate dry eye that are not improved with topical lubrication, and they are well tolerated. There are no level I studies that describe the efficacy or safety of lacrimal drainage system plugs.

### Paradoxical increase of visual impairment with punctal occlusion in a patient with mild dry eye [^111jKu6F]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

We report a paradoxical increase in visual impairment after punctal plug placement despite improvement in corneal epithelial damage caused by mild dry eye. Ocular higher-order aberrations (HOAs) were measured sequentially with a wavefront sensor before and after punctal plug insertion in a patient with mild dry eye. Although postblink HOAs tend to increase in normal subjects or patients with dry eye, after treatment there was a maximum spike in HOAs for a few seconds that decreased gradually. Excessive retention of tear film by punctal occlusion may cause inferosuperior asymmetrical distribution in precorneal tear-film thickness, possibly leading to slower wavefront on the inferior cornea and increased coma-like aberrations. Increased visual impairment might occur paradoxically despite improvement in the corneal epithelial damage caused by dry eye.

Dry Eye PPP — evidence grading framework states that methods from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) group are used, and all studies used to form a recommendation for care are graded individually using a SIGN-based scale. To rate individual studies, levels I++ to III are defined as follows. I++ is "High-quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or RCTs with a very low risk of bias". I+ is "Well-conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a low risk of bias". I− is "Meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a high risk of bias". II++ is "High-quality systematic reviews of case-control or cohort studies High-quality case-control or cohort studies with a very low risk of confounding or bias and a high probability that the relationship is causal". II+ is "Well-conducted case-control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding or bias and a moderate probability that the relationship is causal". II− is "Case-control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding or bias and a significant risk that the relationship is not causal". III is "Nonanalytic studies (e.g., case reports, case series)".

Dry eye syndrome staged management — Step 4 specifies that if the above options are inadequate consider topical corticosteroid for longer duration, amniotic membrane grafts, surgical punctal occlusion (punctal cautery), and other surgical approaches (e.g., tarsorrhaphy, minor salivary gland transplantation). One or more options concurrently within each category can be considered within that step of the dry eye disease state, and options within a category are not ranked according to importance and may be equally valid.

### Expert opinion in the management of aqueous deficient dry eye disease (DED) [^1136PPei]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

A survey was distributed to researchers and expert practitioners in the field of DED via the internet survey tool SurveyMonkey (surveymonkey.com, LLC; Palo Alto, California) in April 2013. Experts were identified by collecting corresponding author information from recently published manuscripts in the field of dry eye. PubMed and Web of Science were queried using the search terms "sjögren eye", "keratoconjunctivitis sicca", and "dry eye", and all articles published from November 2008 to November 2012 were included. Those who had previously opted out of receiving emails from SurveyMonkey or those with invalid email addresses were pre-determined to be ineligible. The survey was anonymous and no participant identifiers of name, gender or age were collected; all recipients had the option of participating or opting out. IRB exemption was obtained from the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Human Research. The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and all federal and state laws. After its initial distribution in April 2013, two survey reminders were sent and the survey was closed on July 1, 2013.

The survey consisted of 11 questions (Appendix 1), which were developed after a literature search identified the most common available medications for DED. Survey recipients were first presented with a clinical scenario of a patient with symptoms and physical exam findings consistent with aqueous deficient DED. Respondents were then asked to describe their use of various therapies for this patient including punctal plugs, topical, and oral medications using Likert scales. Next, participants were asked to indicate which of these therapies they would be interested in using more and primary limitations to their current use. Respondents were questioned regarding their routine treatment algorithms and treatment milestones they use to guide therapy. Lastly, general demographic questions were asked. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed using Stata 10.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^1157A8uP]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Severe dry eye — beyond mild/moderate therapies, the following treatments may be considered for severe dry eye: permanent punctal occlusion can be accomplished by thermal or laser cautery with a stepwise approach so that no more than one punctum is cauterized in each eye at a session, and limited tarsorrhaphy for nonresponders. Autologous serum or autologous plasma rich in growth factors drops have been reported to improve ocular irritation symptoms and conjunctival/corneal dye staining in Sjögren's syndrome (I+, Insufficient, Strong), and a systematic review reported a benefit in symptoms with 20% autologous serum compared with artificial tears over 2 weeks; when repeated blood sampling is not possible, allogeneic serum eye drops have been shown to be an effective and safe alternative (I-, Insufficient, Discretionary). For filamentary keratitis, options include debridement (moistened cotton-tip applicator, cellulose sponge, or forceps), topical mucolytics such as N-acetylcysteine to decrease mucinous tear film viscosity, and soft contact lenses to prevent recurrence; if neurotrophic keratopathy is present, lenses should be used with caution due to infection risk, and insertion of a self-retaining or sutureless amniotic membrane in refractory cases should be considered with recognition of the short-term effect. Rigid gas-permeable scleral lenses have been used successfully for years, but use may be limited by fitting difficulties, cost, and patient ability to manage insertion and removal. Oral medications are available (I-, Moderate, Discretionary); cholinergic agonists such as cevimeline are FDA approved to treat dry mouth in Sjögren's syndrome, improve ocular irritation symptoms and aqueous tear production, and may have fewer adverse systemic side effects than oral pilocarpine. In a trial, pilocarpine 5 mg orally four times a day produced significantly greater improvement in the ability to focus during reading and in blurred vision versus placebo in Sjogren syndrome, but there was no improvement in light sensitivity, ocular discomfort, and other dry eye symptoms; the most common side effect was excessive sweating in over 40% of patients, and Two percent withdrew due to this and other drug-related side effects.

### Managing Sjögren's syndrome and non-Sjögren syndrome dry eye with anti-inflammatory therapy [^113H39gE]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory drugs that can be used to control inflammation. Corticosteroids act directly via glucocorticoid receptor mediated pathways to regulate gene expression. These drugs also act in receptor-independent pathways to interfere with transcriptional regulators of pro-inflammatory genes such as NF-kB. The effect of these pathways leads to limitation of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, decreases in the synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases and prostaglandins, and decreased expression of cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1.–Treatment of corneal epithelium with corticosteroids leads to a decrease in the production of a number of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), and MMP-9.

Corticosteroid treatment for corneal epithelial disease in dry eye has been shown successful in several clinical studies.–Corticosteroid therapy proved effective even in patients suffering with severe dry eye who did not see improvements from maximum aqueous enhancement therapies. In a prospective randomized clinical trial, topical treatment of dry eye patients with non-preserved methylprednisolone and punctal plugs significantly decreased the severity of ocular irritation symptoms and corneal fluorescein staining compared to the group that received punctual occlusion alone. In another double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized study of loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, patients with the most severe inflammatory signs were treated topically with loteprednol. These patients had a significant decrease in central corneal fluorescein staining scores compared to vehicle controls. There is a current Phase IV, randomized, parallel group, investigator-masked evaluation (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier NCT02028312) of the effect of loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic gel 0.5% in combination with cyclosporine A (CsA). In addition, an open-label randomized study showed that patients with KCS who had received fluorometholone in addition to artificial tear substitutes experienced lower symptom severity scores according to fluorescein and rose bengal staining compared to patients receiving artificial tear substitute alone or artificial tear substitute with flurbiprofen. Short-term use of concomitant topical corticosteroid and cyclosporine has been shown to reduce symptoms of stinging, and has improved compliance in the use of cyclosporine drops.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^112SydKJ]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Moderate dry eye — topical corticosteroids: Corticosteroids have been reported to decrease ocular irritation symptoms, decrease corneal fluorescein staining, and improve filamentary keratitis; in one study, a 2-week pretreatment with a topical nonpreserved corticosteroid before punctal occlusion reduced ocular irritation symptoms and corneal fluorescein staining. In a prospective randomized study, loteprednol etabonate 0.25% used over a 2-week period improved patients' symptoms and conjunctival hyperemia findings but not ocular surface staining, Schirmer test results, or use of artificial tears, and extending treatment to 4 weeks did not show further beneficial effects or increase in side-effect profile; low-dose topical corticosteroid therapy can be used at infrequent intervals.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

We will assess study eligibility based on the criteria listed below.

Types of studies

We will only include randomized controlled trials (RCT) with a minimum duration of 12 weeks. We will exclude cross‐over trials, cluster‐randomized trials, and quasi‐randomized trials, e.g. trials in which participants were randomized by date of birth or day of the week.

We will not exclude studies based on publication status, date, or language, as long as the full information can be accessed through the available data or by contacting study authors. Studies for which full information cannot be accessed will be labeled as 'awaiting classification'.

Types of participants

We will include studies of participants with dry eye disease, as defined by the study investigators (including self‐reported or physician‐diagnosed dry eye disease). There will be no restrictions based on age, sex, gender, ancestry (race), culture (ethnicity), or study setting (e.g. primary care, hospital, or community health).

Unless the data from the subset of eligible participants can be retrieved separately, we will exclude studies with participants who meet the following criteria:

Use of dry eye therapy other than artificial tears (e.g. serum tear drops, topical cyclosporine, topical corticosteroids, intranasal varenicline, punctal plugs, punctal cauterization, intense pulsed light [IPL]), without an appropriate washout period when relevant;
Use of glaucoma eye drops;
History of eye surgery less than a month before enrollment in the study.

For studies in which only a subset of participants is relevant to the review topic, we will include data from that subset, if available.

Types of interventions

We will include studies comparing the use of lifitegrast ophthalmic solution 5.0% twice daily for a minimum of 12 weeks alone or in combination with artificial tears, with the use of placebo (e.g. vehicle or saline), artificial tears alone, or no treatment. There will be no restrictions on the frequency of using artificial tears.

### Practical guidance for the use of loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.25% in the management of dry eye disease [^1139vNAy]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Tear conservation with punctal occlusion either through punctal plugs or permanent surgical occlusion can be used in patients who would benefit from aqueous retention on the ocular surface (ie contact lens wearer, refractive surgery). The use of punctal occlusion in the presence of concurrent ocular surface inflammation remains controversial and is generally not recommended as it may prolong the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines on the ocular surface. A Cochrane review of punctal plugs found while in general punctal plugs provided symptomatic improvement, few studies demonstrated a benefit of punctal plugs over a comparison intervention and in general there is a lack of well-designed clinical trials.

Autologous serum tears have been shown to improve signs and symptoms of DED. They have been shown to enhance corneal epithelial wound healing and inhibit release of inflammatory cytokines. Many small trials support the efficacy of autologous serum tears in treatment of DED. In general patients showed significant improvement in symptoms, and improved tear break up time and corneal fluorescein staining. However, lack of a universally accepted methodology for preparation of autologous serum tears and high cost limit its availability to patients.

Tetracyclines have been used off-label to treat DED and associated inflammatory disorders of DED including rosacea and blepharitis. Tetracyclines have been shown to decrease the activity of collagenase, MMPs, and the production of inflammatory cytokines like IL-1 and TNF-alpha. However, the optimal dosing schedule of tetracyclines has not been established and can vary from provider to provider.

### Patients' perspective on the environmental impact of the severe dry eye disease healthcare pathway [^114qc74y]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Dry eye disease is a highly prevalent illness shown to affect between 5% and 50% of the adult population worldwide. According to a Bayesian estimation, the global prevalence of dry eye disease that meets the Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society's Dry Eye Workshop (TFOS DEWS II) diagnostic criteria is 29.5%. Current prevalence is perhaps even higher as excessive screen use, general ageing of the population and increased air pollution are known drivers of incidence. The TFOS Lifestyle Report offers comprehensive evidence that environmental damage exacerbates dry eye disease, through climate factors, pollutants and allergens, contributing to a vicious cycle (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
The environmental impact of dry eye treatment on dry eye disease.

Dry eye disease is characterised by a loss of homeostasis of the eye's tear film, resulting in inflammation and corneal damage. Ordinarily, dry eye disease patients first present to primary care where treatment for mild-moderate symptoms involves lifestyle advice, lid hygiene, warm compress, artificial tears and topical lubricants. The eye drops dispensed in primary care lack the lubricant or nutrient properties of natural tears and so provide only transient support for the malfunctioning tear-film. This means symptom relief is short-lived and frequent application of drops is necessary. Patients with moderate-to-severe dry eye disease require referral to secondary care where medications such as antibiotics, corticosteroids, secretagogues or immunomodulatory drugs may be initiated. The systemic side effects of these medications are important to acknowledge. Referral to secondary care also might lead to employment of devices such as punctal plugs, therapeutic contact lenses and moisture chamber devices. However, these interventions are limited by patient tolerability and increased risk of infections. In severe dry eye disease, ophthalmologists may instead recommend advanced biomimetic therapies, such as serum eye drops. Serum eye drops are derived from the patient's own blood (autologous) or donor-blood (allogenic), and in the UK are supplied as an unlicensed medication by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT). Despite the advantageous biochemical properties of serum eye drops, frequent application of them is still necessary due to their short lasting relief of symptoms. Surgical procedures such as punctal occlusion, tarsorrhaphy, amniotic membrane graft, and salivary gland transplantation are reserved for the most severe cases only.

### Outcomes evaluated in randomized controlled trials of treatments for dry eye: a systematic review [^115MYjB3]. Cornea (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To initiate the process of core outcome set development for dry eye disease (DED) by conducting a systematic review of all outcomes in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments for DED. A core outcome set is an agreed-upon minimum set of outcomes that should be measured and reported in all clinical trials in a topic area.

Methods

We searched PubMed and Embase from January 1, 2016 to January 3, 2024 for RCTs of treatments for DED. Post hoc, we decided to focus on recent evidence and excluded RCTs published before 2016. Two independent investigators screened titles and abstracts (initially) and full-text articles (subsequently), resolving conflicts through discussion. We refined a previously developed outcome taxonomy for DED. We extracted all outcome domains and measurement instruments used for those domains in the included sample of RCTs.

Results

Our searches identified 6477 unique records, and we included 300 RCTs. The most frequently used outcome domains across all RCTs were tear film stability (90.6% of RCTs), overall assessment of ocular symptoms (84.3%), corneal staining score (75.7%), tear production (66.0%), conjunctival staining score (39.7%), visual acuity (35.0%), meibomian gland plugging/clogging grade (27.0%), inferior tear film meniscus height (16.0%), and adverse events (28.0%). There was considerable inconsistency regarding measurement instruments.

Conclusions

Variability in outcome measures and instruments used underscores the need for a core outcome set for DED. Our next steps are to begin prioritizing the identified outcomes for a core outcome set for DED.

### Management of post-LASIK dry eye: a multicenter randomized comparison of a new multi-ingredient artificial tear to carboxymethylcellulose [^116yhzkf]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

LASIK is considered to disrupt the lacrimal functional unit that maintains normal tear production and lubrication, through severing of corneal nerves and direct ocular surface effects during the procedure. Approximately 50% of subjects have dry eye signs and symptoms as early as 1 week after LASIK. Albietz et alreported diminished myopic outcomes in chronic dry eye patients more frequently than in normal patients. Moreover, visual regression after LASIK was related to chronic dry eye, highlighting the importance of adequate postoperative dry eye management. Post-LASIK dry eye symptoms are typically managed with artificial tears. Punctal plug occlusion, topical cyclosporine A, topical steroids, autologous serum tears, and scleral lenses may be used to control more severe dry eye following LASIK. This study looked at the efficacy and safety of a preservative-free, multi-ingredient CMC-HA formulation. The CMC-only formula was selected as the comparator since it is considered a standard lubricating eye drop post-LASIK.

OSDI scores increased following LASIK surgery in both CMC-HA and CMC treatment groups, peaking at day 10, then progressively improving to normal levels (overall score < 13). Other studies have reported similar significant increases in OSDI scores after femtosecond laser-assisted LASIK surgery, which can remain elevated up to 6 months. In this study, the new eye drop formulation containing CMC and HA met the primary efficacy endpoint and was noninferior to a formulation of CMC alone for change in OSDI score from baseline at day 90.

Among the refractive status groups (standard myope, moderate myope, hyperope), post hoc analyses revealed larger increases in OSDI scores from baseline to days 60 and 90 among the hyperopic eyes compared with standard and moderate myopic eyes in the CMC group, but no difference in the CMC-HA group. Although this finding must be interpreted with caution because of the small number of subjects in the hyperope subgroup, it is consistent with the greater degree of peripheral ablation for hyperopic treatment that is linked to post-LASIK dry eye. The cornea is steepened during hyperopic treatment with more tear instability resulting over the central cornea. The HA polymer and other ingredients in the CMC-HA formulation may provide improved benefit to the post-operative corneal surface than the CMC-only formula. Additional studies of hyperopic LASIK patients and those at higher risk of dry eye are warranted to further delineate the beneficial role of CMC-HA eye drops.

### Evaluation of clinical outcomes in patients with dry eye disease using lubricant eye drops containing polyethylene glycol or carboxymethylcellulose [^111RySd4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Patients

Investigators from 10 study sites in the US recruited patients aged ≥ 18 years with a NaFl corneal staining sum score ≥ 3 in either eye and best-corrected visual acuity of 0.6 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) or better in each eye who were already using a lubricant eye gel or ointment at least once weekly over the previous month. Key exclusion criteria included any ocular or systemic medical condition that may, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude safe administration of treatment or affect the results of the study, including inability to discontinue use of concomitant topical ocular drops during the study period (no washout period was required before the screening/baseline visit), previous ocular or intraocular surgery, intolerance or hypersensitivity to any component in the study medications, ocular infections within the last 30 days, temporary punctal plugs, permanent punctal plugs inserted ≤ 30 days before screening, punctal occlusion performed ≤ 30 days before screening, use of systemic medications that may contribute to dry eye (unless on a stable dosing regimen for ≤ 30 days before screening), active iritis or uveitis, or unwillingness to discontinue contact lens wear starting one week or more before screening.

### The effect of punctal plugs in reducing ocular surface irritation after povidone-iodine preparation of intravitreal injection-a randomized trial [^116w76SN]. Eye (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the utility of dissolvable collagen punctal plugs (CPP) in reducing ocular surface irritation after intravitreal injections (IVI).

Methods

Sixty-four subjects in the experimental group received CPP after intravitreal injections. Sixty-two controls did not receive CPP. Reductions in the Ocular Surface Disease Index © (OSDI) and Standardized Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness II (SPEED II) scores were analysed.

Results

Dry eye symptoms, as measured by reductions from the pre- to post-injection OSDI (p = 0.137) and SPEED II (p = 0.381) scores, did not significantly differ between the two groups. In sub-group analysis, patients with objective findings of dry eyes had significant improvement in their symptoms (p = 0.046) with CPP. The effect of CPP is not significant in those without dry eyes (p = 0.27).

Conclusion

CPPs were not effective in reducing post-injection ocular irritation in patients with no or only mild dry eye symptoms. CPPs improved patients' post-injection comfort levels in those who had moderate-to-severe symptoms and objective findings of dry eye. Though costly CPP could be considered in selective patients. A standardized eye rinse could be a simple, efficacious, and cost-effective way to reduce post-injection ocular irritation; however, more studies are needed.

### Plug surface defects as a late complication of silicone punctal plugs [^116psDHX]. Cornea (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report 3 cases of punctal plug surface defects as a cause of irritation complicating punctal plug therapy.

Methods

Interventional case series and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of punctal plugs.

Results

Three patients were found to have punctal plug surface defects and local irritation of conjunctiva and inferonasal cornea 9, 40, and 69 months after placement of AquaFlo silicone punctal plugs for the treatment of dry eyes. SEM of the explanted plugs confirmed a defective collarette surface. In addition, unused AquaFlo plugs from different lots examined by SEM showed a rough irregular collarette surface that was not seen in unused plugs of Parasol silicone punctal plugs.

Discussion

AquaFlo punctal plugs inherently have surface irregularities when compared with similar plug brands, which we suggest may predispose to plug breakdown over time, leading to mechanical irritation of the adjacent conjunctiva and cornea. This report highlights the local complications by AquaFlo punctal plugs associated with plug surface defects as a complication of punctal plug therapy.

### Cornea / external disease summary benchmarks – 2024 [^116XuECY]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye syndrome staged management and treatment recommendations outline a stepwise approach. Step 1 includes "Education on the condition, its management, treatment, and prognosis", environmental modification, dietary education "including oral essential fatty acid supplementation", medication review, "Ocular lubricants of various types (if MGD is present, then consider lipid-containing supplements)", and "Eyelid hygiene of various types and warm compresses". If the above options are inadequate consider Step 2 additions including "Nonpreserved ocular lubricants to minimize preservative-induced toxicity", Demodex therapy with "Tea tree oil or lotilaner drop treatment for Demodex (if present), also off-label use of ivermectin 1% cream for Demodex", tear conservation with "Punctal occlusion" and "Moisture chamber spectacles/goggles", "Overnight treatments (such as ointment or moisture chamber devices)", "In-office, physical heating and expression of the meibomian glands (including thermal pulsation devices)", and prescription drugs to manage dry eye disease (DED) such as "Topical antibiotic or corticosteroid applied to the lid margins short-term for anterior blepharitis (if present)", "Topical corticosteroid (limited duration)", "Topical secretagogues", "Topical nonglucocorticoid immunomodulatory drugs (such as cyclosporine)", "Topical LFA-1 antagonist drugs (such as lifitegrast)", "Topical water-free lipophilic liquid (perfluorohexyloctane)", "Nasal spray (such as varenicline), cholinergic neuroactivation via the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway", and "Oral macrolide or tetracycline antibiotics". If the above options are inadequate consider Step 3 options including "Oral secretagogues", "Autologous/allogeneic serum eye drops", "Platelet-rich plasma eye drops", "Blood-based products", and therapeutic contact lenses including "Soft bandage lenses with caution" and "Rigid scleral lenses". If the above options are inadequate consider Step 4 options including "Topical corticosteroid for longer duration", "Amniotic membrane grafts", "Surgical punctal occlusion (punctal cautery)", and "Other surgical approaches (e.g., tarsorrhaphy, minor salivary gland transplantation)". Notes state that "One or more options concurrently within each category can be considered within that step of the dry eye disease state", that options "are not ranked according to importance and may be equally valid", that "The severity and etiology of the DED state will dictate the range and number of management options selected from one or more steps", and that prescription drug use "needs to be considered in the context of the individual patient presentation, and the relative level of evidence supporting their use for those specific indications".

### The DEPOT study (dry eye prescription options for therapy): assessing the efficacy and safety of OTX-DED (dexamethasone ophthalmic insert 0.3 mg) for intracanalicular use compared with loteprednol suspension for the treatment of episodic dry eye [^1158WAuR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dry Eye Disease (DED) affects an estimated 5–15% of the American populationand is characterized by altered homeostasis of the tear film, in which tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnormalities play etiological roles. It is common for patients suffering from DED to experience episodic flares, which are typically associated with acute exacerbation of discomfort symptoms. Topical corticosteroid medication is routinely used to alleviate such acute signs and symptoms. In DED, eye drops are by far the most widely established method of topical medication delivery to the eye, with over 90% of ophthalmic formulations currently on the market being topical eye drops. Eye drops, however, are frequently associated with a lack of compliance, difficulty of use, and requirement of assistance from family members, with over 90% of patients demonstrating improper drop insertion technique. In addition, drops deliver medication to the eye at inconsistent frequencies, even when applied in accordance with proper usage, resulting in fluctuations in medication concentration. Novel drug delivery platforms present an alternative to eye drops, as they remove the difficulties associated with drop insertion from patients' routines. Dextenza (dexamethasone ophthalmic insert 0.4 mg, Ocular Therapeutix, Bedford, MA) is an intracanalicular insert delivered to the lower lid lacrimal canaliculus by an eye surgeon after cataract surgery. Similar in shape to a dissolving collagen punctal plug, this insert made of hydrogel has a length of 3 mm and width of about 0.55 mm, and delivers a tapering dose of 0.4 mg of dexamethasone over several weeks, offering sufficient potency to control postoperative inflammation. In canine models, this insert delivered sustained levels of dexamethasone around 1000 ng/mL in tear fluid through 7 days, with complete release by 17 days. This steroid delivery mechanism has gained wide acceptance in cataract surgery and shows very infrequent incidence of intraocular pressure rise, a possible side effect of topical corticosteroid treatment. A similar product, OTX-DED, which delivers 0.3 mg of dexamethasone in an insert of about 2.2 length by 0.5 mm width, is being developed to alleviate dry eye symptoms and is still under investigation. OTX-DED can be implanted with the same techniques as Dextenza and has similar risks associated with the insertion process, as demonstrated in the video reference below.OTX-DED is the subject of this study.

### Early adOption And utilization of perfluorohexyloctane for dry eye disease in the United States [^116H2reu]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study examined demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who were early adopters of PFHO leveraging recent real-world data. PFHO patients were younger than CsA patients but had a similar distribution by gender and geographic region of residence. Most PFHO patients had a commercial payer and received their index prescription from a mail order pharmacy while most CsA patients had a Medicare payer and received their index prescription from a retail pharmacy. For both cohorts, DED diagnosis appeared to be under-recorded in the claims data as less than two-thirds of patients in both groups had at least one diagnosis of DED in the 12-month baseline period. Furthermore, our study identified a comparatively higher proportion of patients with baseline DED medication use and prior punctal plug procedure among those treated with PFHO than those treated with CsA. Descriptively, a higher proportion of PFHO patients refilled their prescription within 90-days after initiation compared to CsA patients in both the main and secondary analysis. After adjusting for differences in baseline demographic, clinical, and index prescription characteristics, PFHO patients were associated with a higher likelihood of 90-day prescription refill compared to CsA patients.

### Cross-linked hyaluronic acid gel occlusive device for the treatment of dry eye syndrome [^116WyGmH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide. A proper tear film is essential for maintaining eye lubrication and clear vision. Symptoms of DES include foreign body sensation, burning, irritation, pain, and sensitivity to light.

The management of dry eyes is one of the most common disorders treated in an ophthalmic practice. Initial treatment of DES consists of medical therapy by replacing moisture with artificial tears and ointment. Punctal plugs are a common second-line treatment, and they function by blocking the outflow of tears from the eye. They have the advantage of using the patients' own tears to maintain the lubrication of the eye.

Plugs are made from a variety of materials, and there are several inherent problems with the current plug designs. Silicone plugs use a cap to hold the plug in place which sits above the lid margin, so that it does not slip into the deeper tear duct. The plug cap can rub on the surface of the eye causing ocular irritation. Sizing the correct plug can be challenging, and the plug can occasionally be lost if it is not properly fitted. Intracanalicular plugs have the benefit of being placed below the surface of the lid and therefore cannot rub on the eye, but they can act as a foreign body and cause canaliculitis.

The theory of blocking the outflow of tears is fundamentally sound, as it involves the use of patients' own tears to lubricate the eyes. The current plugs all have their unique drawbacks. An ideal canalicular occluder would be easy to place, block the outflow of tears effectively, be comfortable, biocompatible, long lasting, easily reversible, and have a low potential for infection. Cross-linked hyaluronic acid (xlHA) fits many of these desirable criteria.

HA is a natural, colorless, odorless mucopolysaccharide present in all mammals. Cross-linking free HA chains creates a more robust gel, which is more resistant to degradation. Synthetically xlHA is sufficiently soft to conform to the delicate inner walls of the canaliculus and theoretically block the tear outflow. A canalicular filler made of xlHA may be suitable for retaining tears on the surface of the eyes and potentially add its own lubricating effects, without rubbing on the ocular surface. This study describes a proof-of-concept pilot clinical study using synthetic xlHA gel as a canalicular occlusive device for the treatment of DES.

### Development of lifitegrast: a novel T-cell inhibitor for the treatment of dry eye disease [^113CYLu2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment

Options for treatment include modification of risk factors, artificial tears, lid hygiene procedures, punctal plugs, and pharmaceutical treatment with cyclosporine drops. There is no universally accepted regimen and the specific treatment regimen must be tailored to the individual patient's presentation. Examples of risk factor modifications include periodic breaks during prolonged visual-tasking activities, removal of topically administered medications that contain preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride that damage corneal epithelial cells, and surgical correction of lid margin pathology (eg, blepharoplasty, ectropion repair). Over-the-counter lubricating artificial tears are a common first-line treatment and may contain vasoconstrictive agents (eg, tetrahydrozoline) to reduce the often cosmetically displeasing conjunctival hyperemia associated with DED. Lid hygiene procedures are focused toward patients with meibomitis and/or blepharitis and involve gentle lid scrubs and warm compresses to soften inspissated meibum, concomitant antibiotic therapy, and oral fish oil supplements. Punctal occlusion with short-term collagen or long-term silicone plugs is used to increase thickness of the tear film by blockade of the normal nasolacrimal drainage. Finally, CsA 0.05% ophthalmic emulsion is often added to the treatment regimen to increase tear production.

Novel treatment approaches for DED by drug and device developers have commonly focused on enhancing one of the three key components of the tear film: the inner mucin layer (eg, goblet cell stimulators/secretagogues), the middle aqueous tear layer (eg, lacrimators to produce more tear volume either using drugsor nasal neurostimulation devices), or the outer lipid layer (eg, enhancement of normal lipid production from the meibomian glands). It was our observation that, regardless of the etiology of DED, a common pathophysiologic condition was establishment of ocular surface inflammation and that a core element of the treatment paradigm should focus on addressing the immunologic basis of disease.

Figure 2
Dry eye disease management algorithm.

For example, if significant inflammation of the meibomian glands (MGs) is present, stabilising the tear film without correcting the lid inflammation will be ineffective. In fact, MG changes will cause a disruption of the lipid layer stability, resulting in a reduced tear film break-up time and an inflammatory response in the conjunctival epithelium. Therefore, the main goal should be to reduce lid margin inflammation. This will include lid margin hygiene, corticosteroids/antibiotic ointment and eye drops, together with the use of tear substitutes in order to allow a more efficient control of the tear film stability. The choice of the tear substitute is also an important factor to consider: in this example, a low-viscosity formulation with limited retention time, thus able to dilute the pro-inflammatory agents present on the ocular surface and to increase tear clearance would be recommended. – The use of punctal plugs, even in the presence of poor tear volumes, should be avoided, as good clearance of the pro-inflammatory tear fluid is mandatory, together with efficient lid hygiene. However, a recent paper has demonstrated that the increase of tear inflammatory cytokine levels in patients with DED, treated with punctal plugs was temporary and returned to baseline after 3 weeks. Once lid margin inflammation is under control, the therapeutic strategy can be changed to address tear film instability and volume as well as epithelial protection, in order to further decrease inflammation. The addition of more viscous tear substitutes with osmo-protective activity can be used in conjunction with milder steroid eye drops. Punctal plugs, if still needed, could be taken into consideration, at this point, as a further tool.

Once a clinical improvement is achieved, a continued lid hygiene programme, including appropriate tear substitutes to prevent recurrence of the acute disease, would be mandatory. Timing of controls would be based on the presumed efficacy of the treatment used (table 1).

### The clinical efficacy of silicone punctal plug therapy [^113UnjtN]. Cornea (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of silicone punctal plugs in various ocular surface disorders.

Patients and Methods

Medical records of patients who underwent silicone punctal plug insertion from January 1996 to November 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical data collected included sex and age of the patients, indications for plug insertion, symptoms, corneal fluorescein staining and frequency of lubricant use at baseline and at 4 ± 2 weeks after the insertion, location (upper versus lower punctum), initial versus replacement plug, spontaneous extrusion or removal of the plug, and percentage of complications and punctum cauterization.

Results

There were 203 eyes of 153 patients (126 women and 27 men) in the study group. The total number of silicone punctal plug procedures was 312. Dry eye syndrome was the most common indication for punctal plug treatment (127 eyes, 62.5%), followed by epitheliopathy after penetrating keratoplasty (32 eyes, 15.8%). The symptoms improved in 150 (73.9%) of 203 eyes at 4 ± 2 weeks' follow-up. The mean score of the fluorescein staining of the cornea was reduced from 2.7 ± 0.1 to 1.3 ± 0.1 with silicone punctal plug treatment at 4 ± 2 weeks' follow-up. This reduction was statistically significant (p < 0.01). The overall success rate at 4 ± 2 weeks follow up was 76.8%. The frequency of the lubricant use was significantly decreased with punctal plug treatment (p < 0.001). Considering all plugs, the estimated probability of plug retention was 49.4% with 85.1 ± 7.3 weeks as the mean survival time. There was no statistical difference in plug retention rates between lower (49.6%) and upper (48.7%) plugs (p = 0.15). Retention rate of first plugs (53.5%) was significantly higher than that of second plugs (32.0%) (p = 0.05). The spontaneous total extrusion of silicone punctal plug was the most common complication in our study (158 plugs, 50.7%). The plug was removed in 14 eyes (14 plugs, 6.9%) because of epiphora in 11 eyes and conjunctival erosion in three eyes. The percentage of punctum cauterization performed in our population was 10.8%.

Conclusions

Punctal plug insertion is a simple, effective, safe, and reversible method to treat aqueous tear deficiency and other ocular surface diseases, such as epitheliopathy after penetrating keratoplasty, superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis, neurotrophic keratitis, recurrent corneal erosions, and toxic epitheliopathy not controlled by lubrication with preservative-free tears. However, spontaneous extrusion of silicone plug occurs commonly. Careful choosing of the optimal plug size and close follow-up are recommended to ensure the success of the treatment.

### Cyclosporine (Restasis multiDose) [^112Xer1s]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Four multicenter, randomized, adequate and well-controlled clinical studies were performed in approximately 1,200 patients with moderate to severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion, 0.05% demonstrated statistically significant increases in Schirmer wetting of 10 mm versus vehicle at six months in patients whose tear production was presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation. This effect was seen in approximately 15% of cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion, 0.05%-treated patients versus approximately 5% of vehicle-treated patients. Increased tear production was not seen in patients currently taking topical anti-inflammatory drugs or using punctal plugs.

No increase in bacterial or fungal ocular infections was reported following administration of cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion, 0.05%.

### Short-term efficacy and safety of biological tear substitutes and topical secretagogues for dry eye disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1179D1nh]. Cornea (2022). Medium credibility.

Dry eye is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface, with higher prevalence among women and elderly individuals. Loss of tear film homeostasis in dry eye disease (DED) results in symptoms of eye irritation, redness, and visual disturbance. Although not life-threatening, DED negatively affects common activities of daily living, such as reading, driving, computer use, performing professional work, and watching television, and substantially reduces quality of life. – The overall burden of DED on the American health care was estimated at 3.84 billion US dollars per year (55.4 billion US dollars from a societal perspective).

A stepwise treatment approach to DED has been recommended based on severity and etiology of the disease. Initial management of DED includes health education, environmental modification, and artificial tears. If the strategies in the first step are inadequate, further advanced treatment options, including tear conservation with punctal occlusion or moisture chamber spectacles/goggles, in-office treatments, and prescription drugs specifically designed for DED, should be considered. According to the pathophysiology of DED, besides artificial tears, topical medications that primarily aim to restore normal amount of tears are tear secretagogues and biological tear substitutes. Although several systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the efficacy of either topical tear secretagogues or biological tear substitutes compared against artificial tears or placebo have been reported, – there are no studies simultaneously comparing the efficacy of topical tear secretagogues and biological tear substitutes for patients with dry eye. The recent systematic review of the efficacy and safety of topical ophthalmic drugs in the treatment of DED included 26 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of 4 different drug groups (topical immunomodulators/antiinflammatory drugs, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 antagonist, tear secretagogues, and other investigational drugs targeting additional novel pathways). However, studies of biological tear substitutes were not included in this review. In addition, meta-analytic approaches were not applied. Given the absence of trials involving a direct comparison of various kinds of tear promotion eye drops (artificial tears, topical secretagogues, and biological tear substitutes), the use of network meta-analysis framework could allow the integration of multiple direct and indirect comparisons of these medications, provide estimates of relative treatment effect between them, and potentially generate a hierarchy among available treatments. Therefore, we conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to systematically compare and rank these medications regarding their efficacy and safety in the treatment of DED.

Other Procedures

Lacrimal occlusion with punctal or canalicular plugs has been used to treat DED for decades. Punctal plugs typically are associated with a low rate of AEs, and they are effective for retaining the natural tear film and prolonging the effect of tear substitutes in DED. Their use is recommended in patients with aqueous deficient DED. A wide variety of punctal plugs are available, with multiple options for plug designs, placement (ie, punctal vs canalicular), and resorbability. The indications for punctal plugs have expanded, now including numerous ocular surface diseases. Their use for managing evaporative DED, however, remains controversial, even though clinical data indicate that punctal plugs are effective in treating evaporative dry eye and improving meibomian gland status and lipid layer stability. One caveat to the use of punctal plugs in DED is that they should not be used in active inflammatory ocular surface disease as they reduce the ability of the ocular surface to flush out circulating toxins, exacerbating dry eye signs and symptoms.

Additional treatments that may help patients with more difficult-to-treat DED include bandage and scleral contact lenses and autologous serum eye drops. Bandage contact lenses protect the cornea and decrease the abrasive effects of eyelids during blink. Bandage contact lenses can facilitate corneal tissue repair, decrease pain, stabilize the tear film, and restore normal epithelial cell turnover. Scleral contact lenses also protect the ocular surface and maintain ocular surface hydration. Autologous serum eye drops are used in a variety of ocular surface conditions — most importantly, DED, non-healing corneal epithelial defects, and neurotrophic keratopathy — and they are believed to contain multiple factors that stimulate ocular surface healing. However, a meta-analysis of several clinical trials evaluating the effects of autologous tears found that they provide inconsistent benefit; additionally, there is a need for more standardized questionnaires and objective clinical tests to assess the value of autologous tears in the treatment of DED.

### A new surgical approach for punctal occlusion using fibrous tissue from under the lacrimal caruncle [^111N3EHW]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sjögren's syndrome (SS)-related aqueous-tear-deficient dry eye (ATDDE)sometimes results in severe superficial punctate keratopathy and/or persistent corneal filaments that can lead to severe ocular discomfort and/or pain. In such severe cases, since medical treatment involving the topical instillation of artificial tears or hyaluronic acid eye drops has some limitations, blocking of the lacrimal canaliculi and/or puncta is often chosen as the appropriate alternative treatment. For blocking of the lacrimal canaliculi and/or puncta, punctal plugs are generally used as the initial treatment, since in most cases that procedure can be reversed. However, in cases where the use of punctal plugs is not applicable, eg, when repeated plug extrusion results in the punctum becoming so enlarged that no appropriate plug size is availableor when the reopened canaliculus and/or punctum is deformed due to the failure of earlier blocking methods, a more reliable blocking method is necessary to improve the patient's symptoms. Various methods of punctal occlusion have previously been reported, however, some surgical methods, such as dacryocystectomy, nasolacrimal duct occlusion, or canalicular excision,–are relatively invasive and sometimes difficult to reverse. Cauterization methods such as thermal cautery,–diathermy, laser surgery, canalicular ligation, removal of punctal and canalicular epithelium followed by sutures, or a punctal patchare reportedly simple and less invasive, yet those methods alone may produce varied and unpredictable results, often leading to a reopening of the once-closed punctum and/or canaliculus.

The purpose of this present study was to investigate the efficacy of our newly developed surgical procedure to overcome the recanalization of once-surgically occluded punctum and/or canaliculus, and to establish a standardized reliable method for punctal occlusion.

### Prevalence of treated dry eye disease in a managed care population [^111Gj27n]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Survey studies are of limited utility in estimating the prevalence of treated dry eye. The use of claims data, which include only individuals who have a diagnosis of the disorder, provides a better estimation of the clinical significance of dry eye symptoms and appraisal of community needs.

Objective

The purpose of this paper is to estimate the prevalence of treated dry eye disease using a nonsurvey methodology.

Methods

Patients with dry eye diagnoses or who underwent punctal occlusion procedures were identified from PharMetrics' Integrated Outcomes database of medical claims for approximately 10 million patients enrolled in managed care plans. Prevalence estimates were calculated for 1997 and 1998.

Results

The prevalence of dry eye was 0.48% in 1997 and 0.39% in 1998, representing 25,180 and 27,289 cases, respectively. Patients aged ≥ 65 years were approximately 4 times as likely as those aged < 65 years to be diagnosed with keratoconjunctivitis sicca or tear film insufficiency. In 1997, dry eye was diagnosed or treated in 0.65% of women compared with 0.26% of men (P < 0.001). Rates of dry eye disease in 1998 were highest among women aged 75 to 79 years (2.02%) and men aged 80 to 84 years (1.30%). Women tended to receive a diagnosis at a younger age than did men. The most common diagnosis was tear film insufficiency (73.96% and 73.41% of dry eye patients in 1997 and 1998, respectively). The most common procedure was lacrimal punctal occlusion by plug (7.78% and 8.74% of dry eye patients in 1997 and 1998, respectively).

Conclusion

The prevalence of treated dry eye disease is 0.4% to 0.5% and is highest among women and the elderly.

### Punctal plug retention rates for the treatment of moderate to severe dry eye: a randomized, double-masked, controlled clinical trial [^116fmRHq]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare retention rates of Super Flex (Eagle Vision, Memphis, Tennessee, USA; Softplug-Oasis Medical Inc, Glendora, California, USA) vs Parasol (Odyssey Medical, Memphis, Tennessee, USA; Beaver Visitec International, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) punctal plugs.

Design

Randomized, double-masked, interventional controlled clinical trial.

Methods

Institutional study at Hotel Dieu Hospital (Queen's University) of 50 eyes, from patients with moderate to severe dry eye. Each eye from eligible patients was separately randomized to receive Super Flex or Parasol punctal plugs. The main outcome measure was plug retention at 6 months. Secondary outcome measures included objective tests of Schirmer I (mm), tear meniscus height (mm), tear break-up time (s), inferior fluorescein corneal staining (National Eye Institute [NEI] scale), and average lissamine green conjunctival staining (NEI scale).

Results

Punctal plug retention was significantly different at 6 months (P = .011). Sixty-eight percent of Parasol plugs were retained compared to 32% of Super Flex plugs. Parasol plugs required less frequent artificial tear use at 6 months (P = .024). There was a statistically significant improvement in all secondary outcome measures (Schirmer, tear meniscus height, tear break-up time, fluorescein corneal staining) at 6 months within plug groups except conjunctival staining. There were no additional significant differences between groups and no plug complications reported.

Conclusions

Punctal plugs improve symptoms of moderate to severe dry eye; however, retention rates differ significantly. These data will allow us to guide patient decision making for the safe and effective treatment of punctal plugs for moderate to severe dry eye.

### Punctal occlusion for dry eye syndrome [^113LB2Hw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Dry eye syndrome is a disorder of the tear film and is associated with symptoms of ocular discomfort. Punctal occlusion is a mechanical treatment in which the tear drainage system is blocked in order to aid in the preservation of natural tears on the ocular surface.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the safety and efficacy of punctal plugs for the management of dry eye.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 6), MEDLINE (January 1950 to June 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2010), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to June 2010), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com) and ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov). We also searched the Science Citation Index-Expanded database and reference lists of included studies. There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 21 June 2010.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of collagen or silicone punctal plugs in symptomatic participants diagnosed with aqueous tear deficiency or dry eye syndrome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study investigators for additional information.

Main Results

Seven randomized controlled trials including 305 participants (601 eyes) met the inclusion criteria and are summarized in this review. We did not perform meta-analysis due to appreciable variability in interventions and follow-up intervals. Although punctal plugs provided symptomatic improvement and clinical outcomes also improved from baseline measures, few studies demonstrated a benefit of punctal plugs over the comparison intervention. Reported adverse effects included epiphora (overflow of tears), foreign body sensation, eye irritation, and spontaneous plug loss.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review shows a relative scarcity of controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of punctal occlusion therapy in dry eye. Although the evidence is very limited, the data suggest that silicone plugs can provide symptomatic relief in severe dry eye. Moreover, temporary collagen plugs appear similarly effective to silicone plugs on a short-term basis.

### A systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions for primary Sjögren's syndrome [^115LqHrX]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Through a search of clinical trials databases, we were able to determine that there were 13 relevant clinical trials; however, only one of these had published results. A RCT has been registered in the Netherlands, investigating cognitive behavioural therapy and exercise training to treat fatigue in SS and non-SS sicca syndrome, but no results have yet been published. Further research is recommended into clinically relevant non-pharmacological interventions for which there is evidence of efficacy in other conditions with similar symptoms; such as cognitive behavioural therapy and graded exercise therapy for fatigue management in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.

A Cochrane systematic review of punctal plugs for dry eyes concluded that they provided some symptomatic relief in severe dry eyes, and it is likely that they would be of benefit in pSS as well as in other dry patient groups. Further investigation into any differences between pSS dry eye treatment and standard dry eye treatment is warranted.

Conclusion

Overall, we identified no current evidence to support any non-pharmacological interventions to improve the quality of life for people with pSS. The area needs good quality, appropriately powered RCTs that are reported according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines. Outcomes should be sensitive to changes that are important and relevant to patients.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of adult and juvenile onset Sjögren disease [^1144MU5s]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation

Lipiflow, IPL therapy and meibomian gland probing are not currently NHS funded as treatments within the UK. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend their routine use. However, these procedures are safe with, in some cases, weak evidence of benefit in dry eye and individuals may decide to undergo these treatments in the private sector (2, C) (SOA 84.5%).

Antibiotics for meibomian gland disease

A recent review of antibiotic treatment for dry-eye disease with meibomian gland dysfunction or blepharitis included 22 articles. The authors concluded that both oral and topical antibiotic treatment resulted in short-term improvements but noted that improvements were not sustained when treatment was discontinued and felt there was insufficient evidence to recommend long-term use.

Recommendation

Those with dry-eye disease associated with meibomian gland dysfunction or blepharitis could be offered short-term treatment with oral or topical antibiotics with an anti-inflammatory action (2, B) (SOA 92.3%).

Lipid-containing eye drops

Lipid-containing eye drops have been shown to be effective in MGD. A systematic review of lipid containing lubricants published in 2012 included three studies on liposomal eye sprays and four on lipid-containing eyedrops. None of the studies was free of bias and only three were double masked. All subjects reported symptomatic improvement although this was short-lived in two studies. TBUT improved in four of the five studies where it was measured. Three studies were assigned high level of evidence, three moderate and one low.

Recommendation

Individuals with dry-eye disease associated with meibomian gland dysfunction or blepharitis could be advised to use lipid containing eye drops or liposomal eye sprays as adjunctive treatment (2, C) (SOA 90.2%).

Punctal occlusion

A Cochrane review included 18 trials and 711 participants. Overall, they concluded that the evidence of benefit was inconclusive although individual studies suggest that punctal plugs may improve symptoms.

Expert opinion is that punctal plugs are suitable in certain circumstances but they may make corneal surface inflammation worse in certain situations. Careful patient selection is important.

Recommendation

Punctal plugs are suitable in in certain circumstances, but they may make corneal surface inflammation worse in certain situations. Careful patient selection is important (1, C) SOA 96.3%.

### Long-term retention rates and complications of silicone punctal plugs in dry eye [^114htHin]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate long-term retention rates and complications of silicone punctal plugs among dry eye patients.

Design

Prospective, observational cohort study.

Methods

Ninety-five silicone punctal plugs (FCI plugs; FCI Ophthalmics, Issy-les-Moulineaux Cedex, France) were placed in 93 eyes of 47 dry eye patients. Within the observation period of up to eight years, this survey included recording of the retention rate, spontaneous loss, removal, canalicular permeability after loss or removal, as well as other complications such as infection, intrusion, and granuloma.

Results

The retention rate of the plugs was 84.2% after three months, 69.5% after one year, and 55.8% after a median of two years (range, 17 to 93 months). No infection was observed, but granulomatous formation occurred in three eyes (one with extrusion, two with intrusion). Three plugs had to be removed for local discomfort or epiphora, and one piece of a broken plug intruded. Canalicular stenosis after spontaneous loss occurred in 14.3% after three months, in 26.9% after one year, and in 34.2% after a median of two years.

Conclusions

The retention rate after a median of two years of FCI punctal plugs was satisfactory with few complications. The major observation concerned canalicular stenosis after spontaneous loss.

### A systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions for primary Sjögren's syndrome [^1132Wt6f]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Overall, the quality of the included studies was poor. There was high risk of bias in most, and none had conducted power calculations. Furthermore, the sample sizes used were small, meaning the studies were likely to be underpowered for detecting an effect size that was predicted to be modest.

The quality of reporting was also poor; in particular data presentation, which made data interpretation difficult. For example, no baseline data were reported in two of the studies, and one of these reported improvements in an outcome but presented no supporting data. None of the included studies conducted the appropriate analysis of change in scores, or the analysis of difference between the two groups. Instead, baseline to study endpoint scores were reported.

Overall, our findings were inconclusive. These studies suggest that punctal plugs are effective for outcomes of body function and some activity outcomes. This is in line with a Cochrane review of punctal plugs in dry eyes, which was not pSS specific. The oral lubrication devices, psychodynamic therapy and acupuncture did not provide evidence of significant benefit. However, given the poor quality of the data presented and the small sample size, we cannot be certain that these interventions provide no benefit either.

The studies included some measures of glandular function, including damage to the eyes and some measures of activities. Of the activity measures, not all related to everyday life. An example is the PUTTICA speech test, which is a surrogate outcome with an unclear relationship to intelligibility or ease of speech. Only one study looked at any aspects of participation, and there appears to be a lack of appropriate outcome measures that are relevant to patients in terms of activity and participation. Studies investigating body function and structure outcomes need to determine the relevance of these outcomes to patients and to investigate the impact of such symptoms on participation, the ability to perform daily activities and quality of life.

We discovered no published reports of RCTs of studies looking at exercise or cognitive behavioural therapy, which have been examined in chronic fatigue syndrome studies. A small study investigating a group aerobic exercise intervention (Nordic walking) was not eligible for inclusion, as participants were not randomized and it is difficult to determine evidence of efficacy in non-randomized trials.

Eligibility

Participants aged ≥ 18 years, having a tear film break-up time (TFBUT) of ≤ 5 seconds in at least one eye, and best corrected visual acuity of ≥ 20/80 (or ≥ 55 letters score or ≥ 0.6 early treatment diabetic retinopathy study log of the minimum angle of resolution value) in both eyes at screening were eligible for inclusion. In addition to the above, participants who met at least one of the three criteria below in at least one eye at screening (randomization stratified based on the criteria below) were also included: (a) unanesthetized Schirmer I test score of ≤ 9 mm for a five-minute test duration (aqueous deficient dry eye stratum); (b) meibum quality score of ≥ 1 (on a 0 to 3 scale) or meibum expressibility score of > 1 (on a 0 to 3 scale) in either eyelid (evaporative dry eye stratum); and (c) met both entry criteria (a) and (b) (mixed dry eye stratum). (Information on meibum quality and expressibility scores is available in). Participants were required to discontinue the use of any other artificial tear supplements and use only the study product for the entire study duration. Key exclusion criteria were (a) history of hypersensitivity to the study drug or any of its excipients; (b) use of any topical ocular medication preserved with benzalkonium chloride or other products known to be toxic to the tear film lipid layer, or lid hygiene therapy or punctal plug insertion within 1 month prior to the screening visit; (c) contact lens use within a week prior to screening visit; (d) initiation of any topical ocular medication (with the exception of artificial tears/gels/lubricants) ≤ 2 weeks prior to the screening visit. Artificial tears/lubricants were prohibited from the beginning of the baseline visit until the patient was discontinued from the study.

### Dry eye symptoms and impact on vision-related function across international task force guidelines severity levels in the United States [^112ht2ba]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and patient selection

This was a non-interventional, cross-sectional study conducted from July 2014 to October 2014. To ensure real-world representation of dry eye patients' access to care, 5 ophthalmology and 5 optometry clinical practices across the United States were recruited to enroll patients. Prescription treatment-naïve dry eye patients at least 18 years of age, seeking routine consultation for relief of dry eye symptoms, were enrolled consecutively. For study eligibility, patients were required to show clinical signs of dry eye, as assessed from conjunctival (lissamine green) and corneal (fluorescein staining and Schirmer's test (type I with anesthesia), during screening. The study excluded patients with prior use of prescription dry eye medication or punctal plugs; ocular surgery within the previous 6 months; use of antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunosuppressant medications, topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or antivirals within 30 days of the start of the study; a diagnosis of active ocular allergies; infection of the anterior segment or uveitis; and a systemic or ocular disorder or condition deemed by the investigator to potentially affect interpretation of study results. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the following independent review boards: Liberty Institutional Review Board (DeLand, FL), Southern College of Optometry Institutional Review Board (Memphis, TN), and Western Institutional Review Board (Puyallup, WA). Patients provided written informed consent prior to study participation.

### Bridging the gap in managing dry eye disease: a consensus report by the Taiwan society of cataract and refractive surgeons [^113zF1rV]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Considerations following surgery

Current evidence indicates that cataract surgeons should proactively and aggressively employ DED management regimens in the days and weeks following cataract surgery because this surgery is known to cause or exacerbate pre-existing DED. Following surgery, therapy for DED should be more frequent than before and can be divided into short-term (within 1 month) and long-term (after 1 month) follow-up periods. Follow-ups are necessary to ensure the ocular surface's tolerance and to determine the relevant modifications of DED management that will optimize long-term visual outcomes. On the basis of the current evidence and clinical expertise, preservative-free ATs, topical steroids, and topical NSAIDs are recommended for use within the first postsurgical month. Thereafter, in addition to the aforementioned treatments, punctal plugs, topical autologous serum, topical cyclosporine, eyelid warming therapy, and mucin secretagogues are suggested for use in the treatment of post-cataract-surgery DED where necessary (Supplementary Table 3). Moreover, postoperative follow-up is essential for ensuring proper healing, detecting and managing any complications, optimizing treatment, and establishing a long-term management plan that will optimize the eye health of the patient. Expert advice suggests that the optimal postoperative follow-up schedule be employed to optimize surgical outcomes and ensure high patient satisfaction (Table 4).

Therapy for DED following surgery

Considering the aforementioned details, specific therapeutic interventions following surgery are essential for restoring ocular health and ensuring the ideal optical outcomes. Specific evidence and expert clinical advice support the use of aggressive therapeutics in cases of postsurgical DED complications with severe ocular surface inflammation. Treatments should be initiated at an advanced treatment level to reduce the incidence of postoperative DED (Table 5).

### Varenicline solution nasal spray 0.03 Mg for the treatment of dry eye disease following photorefractive keratectomy [^116VKA8P]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rescue Criteria

Rescue criteria were established to provide guidance for additional interventions related to the treatment of DED. If subjects required use of artificial tears more than or equal to 4 times daily following removal of the bandage contact lens, they met the criteria for rescue therapy. Rescue therapy options included additional preservative-free artificial tears, prescription dry eye therapy (eg, topical cyclosporine or lifitegrast) or punctal plugs in the upper or lower punctum.

Study Drug: Varenicline Solution Nasal Spray (VNS)

The VNS nasal spray mechanism facilitates the administration of a preservative-free, intranasal formulation containing 0.03 mg of varenicline. Varenicline is a highly selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist (nAChR) and targets the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway, which stimulates the nerves innervating the lacrimal function unit. This pathway is likely responsible for one-third of the basal tear film production and activation of this pathway represents a novel approach to improving the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.

Statistical Analyses

An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to compare VNS and placebo in the mean change from baseline at a certain time point (Day 84 or Day 128) for different efficacy endpoints (eg NEI VFQ-25, Corneal Fluorescein Staining, EDS). The ANCOVA model includes treatment as the fixed effect and baseline endpoint value as the covariate. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS ® (SAS Version 9.4. SAS Inc. NC, USA). A p value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

### A systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions for primary Sjögren's syndrome [^116rPtuh]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Primary SS (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease primarily affecting exocrine glands, resulting in dry eyes and dry mouth. It has a female preponderance, and a recent meta-analysis has identified a prevalence rate of 74/100 000 inhabitants, using the American–European Consensus Criteria. The disease can also have extra-glandular features, with patients experiencing symptoms of pain, fatigue, neurological symptoms, sleep disturbance, autonomic dysfunction, low mood and an increased risk of developing lymphoma. Consequently, many patients experience reduced quality of life and difficulty with carrying out a range of daily activities. Furthermore, the disease is associated with significant direct and indirect healthcare costs equating to ∼£12–15 000 per patient, per year. Similar figures have been identified in the USA. European studies have identified increased physician visits and higher work disability for patients with a diagnosis of pSS.

Non-pharmacological interventions for pSS may vary according to the particular symptom that they are targeting. They may be complex, target several symptoms at once and be conducted by more than one member of a multidisciplinary team. Such interventions may include fatigue and mood management, and patient education by healthcare professionals. Other interventions may be conducted by a clinician with specialist skills (such as occupational therapy to establish a balance in daily activities and improve function), insertion of lacrimal punctal plugs for dry eye symptoms or the use of acupuncture for the symptomatic relief of dry mouth.

Treatments in clinics for people with pSS tend to focus on pharmacological interventions. However, a recent systematic review has shown that evidence to support the efficacy of pharmacological therapies in pSS is poor. Given the range of bio-psychosocial symptoms that these patients experience, it is possible that there are effective non-pharmacological treatments that could improve symptoms. The reduced impact of symptoms consequently may lead to an improvement in quality of life, improved work capacity and a reduction in economic costs to society. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of non-pharmacological interventions for PSS in adults.

### The use of punctal plugs in children [^114nVegP]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of punctal plugs in children with dry eye syndrome.

Methods

A retrospective case series of patients who had an insertion of silicone punctal plugs for dry eye syndrome. Data collected included presenting symptoms, signs, systemic disorders if present, type of anaesthesia and complications by the time of last follow-up.

Results

Twenty-five patients (median age at insertion 7 years, range 1.5–13.8 years) were identified. Median follow-up was 18 months. The commonest symptoms were photophobia, soreness and blepharospasm, and the commonest sign was punctate epithelial erosions. Concurrent systemic disease was present in 18/25 patients. Repeated procedures were carried out in eight of 25 patients. Twenty-four of 35 insertions were performed under general anaesthesia. A substantial improvement in ocular surface disease was noted in all cases: frequency of lubricant use was reduced in eight of 25 and visual acuity improved in 15/25 patients. Spontaneous extrusion was the commonest complication and occurred within 6 months in 19% of cases.

Conclusion

Dry eye syndrome in children is often accompanied by systemic disease, so in a child with persistent symptoms this should be explored. Punctal plugs offer a safe and effective form of treatment especially as compliance of frequent lubrication is limited in children.

Recommendation

Consider vitamin A containing eye ointments (2, C) (SOA 89.8%).

Consider advising omega-3 supplementation in SD (2, C) (SOA 89.8%).

14. For people with SD, what cognitive therapy or behavioural change interventions are an effective treatment for fatigue and joint pain?

A systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions for SD identified five studies for review including a total of 130 participants. The majority of the studies were small, of low quality and at high risk of bias. The included studies investigated the effectiveness of an oral lubricating device for dry mouth, acupuncture for dry mouth, lacrimal punctal plugs for dry eyes and psychodynamic group therapy for coping with symptoms. Overall, the studies were of low quality and at high risk of bias. Although one study showed punctal plugs to improve dry eyes, the sample size was relatively small. The authors concluded that further high-quality studies were needed.

A review of interventions to manage fatigue in SD found no evidence to support pharmacological treatment of fatigue. Of the non-pharmacological interventions most studies were small and of relatively poor quality. The authors concluded that based on the few small studies available aerobic exercise appears to be safe and effective.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive method of electrical stimulation of the brain using a weak direct current applied to the scalp through electrodes. A parallel double-blind pilot study of tDCS in 36 females with SD randomized to 20 min sessions for 5 days, demonstrated improvements in both groups but with a significant greater improvement in fatigue severity in the active group vs the sham treatment group. There were no differences in sleep quality or pain overall.

Non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) has shown promising results in reducing fatigue in SD. In a pilot study, 15 subjects with SD used a nVNS device twice daily over a 26-day period and showed significant reduction in fatigue and daytime sleepiness. A recent sham-controlled study in 40 participants with SD showed significant improvements in three measures of fatigue at day 56, suggesting that further larger studies may be worthwhile.

Recommendation

We recommend an individualized holistic review for those with fatigue focusing on activity management (for example planning, prioritizing, pacing), sleep quality and lifestyle (2, C) (SOA 96.7%).

### Managing Sjögren's syndrome and non-Sjögren syndrome dry eye with anti-inflammatory therapy [^111v4YLP]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Treatments for the management of dry eye

Artificial tears

A common therapy for dry eye has been the use of artificial tears. These provide temporary relief of symptoms in most cases. There are several artificial tear products on the market with different compound formulations, but all contain similar ingredients such as water, lubricants, and electrolytes. Artificial tears can control symptoms in patients with mild disease but offer only temporary relief. Different lubricants used in the formulation of artificial tears vary in their viscosity and level of hydration. More viscous solutions offer longer relief but cause blurred vision and discomfort. Many products contain preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride, sodium perborate, and sodium chlorate that can cause damage to the ocular surface. In severe cases where administration is needed four times a day or more, preservative-free artificial tears are needed to limit preservative toxicity.

Punctal plugs

Punctal plugs are devices inserted into tear ducts to block drainage and increase the tear film. Insertion of punctal plugs has provided relief for patients suffering from mild severity of dry eye. However, with increased understanding of the pathogenesis of dry eye, punctual plugs can worsen long-term symptoms since without drainage, the tear film becomes saturated with inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases.

Anti-inflammatory therapies for dry eye

Clinical studies have shown that anti-inflammatory therapies that inhibit the inflammatory mediators reduce the symptoms of dry eye syndrome. The remainder of this review will focus on anti-inflammatory therapies in general, since anti-inflammatory management of dry eye benefits both SS and non-SS forms.

### Comparison of topical cyclosporine, punctal occlusion, and a combination for the treatment of dry eye [^112m1dwE]. Cornea (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy of topical cyclosporine, punctal occlusion, and a combination for the treatment of dry eye.

Methods

Patients with dry eye (N = 30) seen in a university-affiliated private practice were randomized to 1 of 3 treatments: cyclosporine 0.05% ophthalmic emulsion (RESTASIS) twice daily, lower-lid punctal plugs (PARASOL), or a plugs-cyclosporine combination. Tear volume, ocular surface staining, and artificial tear use were assessed at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months.

Results

All treatments improved Schirmer scores by 6 months (P ≤ 0.005 vs. baseline), with plug-containing regimens favored at 1 and 3 months (P < 0.001 vs. cyclosporine alone). Cyclosporine-containing regimens, but not plugs alone, improved rose bengal staining at 3 and 6 months (P ≤ 0.010 vs. baseline). Artificial tear use decreased with plug-containing regimens at 1 month and with all treatments at 3 and 6 months (P ≤ 0.005 vs. baseline). Combination therapy produced the greatest overall improvements and was superior to plugs alone in decreasing artificial tear use at 6 months (P = 0.012).

Conclusions

All 3 regimens effectively treated dry eye. Plug-containing regimens increased wetness initially; cyclosporine appeared to promote long-term ocular surface health. The effects may be additive. Patients with punctal occlusion may benefit from adjunctive cyclosporine.

### Punctal occlusion for dry eye syndrome [^114apacS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Dry eye syndrome is a disorder of the tear film that is associated with symptoms of ocular discomfort. Punctal occlusion is a mechanical treatment that blocks the tear drainage system in order to aid in the preservation of natural tears on the ocular surface.

Objectives

To assess the effects of punctal plugs versus no punctal plugs, different types of punctal plugs, and other interventions for managing dry eye.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 11), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 8 December 2016), Embase.com (1947 to 8 December 2016), PubMed (1948 to 8 December 2016), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database) (1982 to 8 December 2016), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com; last searched 18 November 2012 - this resource is now archived), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov; searched 8 December 2016), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en; searched 8 December 2016). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We also searched the Science Citation Index-Expanded database and reference lists of included studies. The evidence was last updated on 8 December 2016 SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of collagen or silicone punctal plugs in symptomatic participants diagnosed with aqueous tear deficiency or dry eye syndrome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study investigators for additional information when needed.

Main Results

We included 18 trials (711 participants, 1249 eyes) from Austria, Canada, China, Greece, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Turkey, the UK, and the USA in this review. We also identified one ongoing trial. Overall we judged these trials to be at unclear risk of bias because they were poorly reported. We assessed the evidence for eight comparisons. Five trials compared punctal plugs with no punctal plugs (control). Three of these trials employed a sham treatment and two trials observed the control group. Two trials did not report outcome data relevant to this review. There was very low-certainty evidence on symptomatic improvement. The three trials that reported this outcome used different scales to measure symptoms. In all three trials, there was little or no improvement in symptom scores with punctal plugs compared with no punctal plugs. Low-certainty evidence from one trial suggested less ocular surface staining in the punctal plug group compared with the no punctal plug group however this difference was small and possibly clinically unimportant (mean difference (MD) in fluorescein staining score -1.50 points, 95% CI -1.88 to -1.12; eyes = 61). Similarly there was a small difference in tear film stability with people in the punctal plug group having more stability (MD 1.93 seconds more, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.20; eyes = 28, low-certainty evidence). The number of artificial tear applications was lower in the punctal plug group compared with the no punctal plugs group in one trial (MD -2.70 applications, 95% CI -3.11 to -2.29; eyes = 61, low-certainty evidence). One trial with low-certainty evidence reported little or no difference between the groups in Schirmer scores, but did not report any quantitative data on aqueous tear production. Very low-certainty evidence on adverse events suggested that events occurred reasonably frequently in the punctal plug group and included epiphora, itching, tenderness and swelling of lids with mucous discharge, and plug displacement. One trial compared punctal plugs with cyclosporine (20 eyes) and one trial compared punctal plugs with oral pilocarpine (55 eyes). The evidence was judged to be very low-certainty due to a combination of risk of bias and imprecision. Five trials compared punctal plugs with artificial tears. In one of the trials punctal plugs was combined with artificial tears and compared with artificial tears alone. There was very low-certainty evidence on symptomatic improvement. Low-certainty evidence of little or no improvement in ocular surface staining comparing punctal plugs with artificial tears (MD right eye 0.10 points higher, 0.56 lower to 0.76 higher, MD left eye 0.60 points higher, 0.10 to 1.10 higher) and low-certainty evidence of little or no difference in aqueous tear production (MD 0.00 mm/5 min, 0.33 lower to 0.33 higher)Three trials compared punctal plugs in the upper versus the lower puncta, and none of them reported the review outcomes at long-term follow-up. One trial with very low-certainty evidence reported no observed complications, but it was unclear which complications were collected. One trial compared acrylic punctal plugs with silicone punctal plugs and the trial reported outcomes at approximately 11 weeks of follow-up (36 eyes). The evidence was judged to be very low-certainty due to a combination of risk of bias and imprecision. One trial compared intracanalicular punctal plugs with silicone punctal plugs at three months follow-up (57 eyes). The evidence was judged to be very low-certainty due to a combination of risk of bias and imprecision. Finally, two trials with very low-certainty evidence compared collagen punctal plugs versus silicone punctal plugs (98 eyes). The evidence was judged to be very low-certainty due to a combination of risk of bias and imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

Although the investigators of the individual trials concluded that punctal plugs are an effective means for treating dry eye signs and symptoms, the evidence in this systematic review suggests that improvements in symptoms and commonly tested dry eye signs are inconclusive. Despite the inclusion of 11 additional trials, the findings of this updated review are consistent with the previous review published in 2010. The type of punctal plug investigated, the type and severity of dry eye being treated, and heterogeneity in trial methodology confounds our ability to make decisive statements regarding the effectiveness of punctal plug use. Although punctal plugs are believed to be relatively safe, their use is commonly associated with epiphora and, less commonly, with inflammatory conditions such as dacryocystitis.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^111uZrRD]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye syndrome — aqueous tear deficiency punctal occlusion: For patients with aqueous tear deficiency, punctal occlusion is considered when the medical means of aqueous enhancement are ineffective or impractical, and punctal plugs are best used once tear homeostasis is achieved. A Cochrane Collaboration review found limited evidence in seven randomized controlled trials that silicone plugs may provide symptomatic relief in patients with severe dry eye (I-, Insufficient, Discretionary). Silicone plugs placed in the punctum have been shown to improve dry eye signs and symptoms and may be retained for many years without complications if appropriately sized, and the largest plug that can be inserted should be used to reduce the likelihood of extrusion (I-, Insufficient, Discretionary). One study found that 56% of silicone plugs were retained after 2 years, but among patients whose plugs were spontaneously lost, 34% were reported to have canalicular stenosis at 2 years. Punctal occlusion can be accomplished with silicone, collagen, or thermal labile polymer plugs, and the effectiveness of increasing the lower tear meniscus was similar with upper or lower tear duct occlusion. Thermal labile polymer plugs are placed intracanalicularly and have the advantage of not irritating the ocular surface; however, they have been associated with epiphora, canaliculitis, dacryocystitis, and keratitis; punctal plugs displaced into the lacrimal system may pass through the entire system but blockage with secondary infection has been reported, while surgical removal is rarely necessary.

### A technique for preventing spontaneous loss of lacrimal punctal plugs [^115muTDE]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe a technique for the prevention of spontaneous loss of lacrimal punctal plugs.

Design

Interventional case series.

Methods

Four consecutive patients (10 puncta in seven eyes) with severe dry eyes who experienced repeated spontaneous plug loss underwent punctal occlusion by suturing plugs with 10–0 polypropylene sutures.

Results

All punctal plugs were fitted to lacrimal puncta by anchoring the sutures. Plug retention rate was 80% at 6 months after the procedure.

Conclusion

Suturing punctal plugs is effective in the production of long-term punctal closure in patients with repeated spontaneous plug loss.

### Gaps in current knowledge and priorities for future research in dry eye [^116GWBN9]. Cornea (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Dry eye, a common yet underrecognized and evolving field, has few recommended treatment algorithms, mostly based on expert consensus rather than robust research evidence. There are high costs associated with managing dry eye and conducting research to identify effective and safe long-term treatments. To support evidence-based management of dry eye, our purpose was to identify and prioritize important clinical research questions for future clinical research.

Methods

We translated recommendations from the American Academy of Ophthalmology's 2013 Preferred Practice Patterns for dry eye into answerable clinical research questions about treatment effectiveness. Clinicians around the world who manage patients with dry eye rated each question's importance from 0 (not important) to 10 (very important) using a 2-round online Delphi survey. We considered questions as "important" if ≥ 75% of respondents assigned a rating of 6 or more in round 2. We mapped the identified important clinical research questions to reliable systematic reviews published up to March 2016.

Results

Seventy-five clinicians from at least 21 countries completed both Delphi rounds. Among the 58 questions, 24 met our definition of "important": 9/24 and 7/24 addressed topical and systemic treatments, respectively. All 4 questions with the highest 25th percentiles addressed topical treatments. Although 6/24 "important" questions were associated with 4 existing reliable systematic reviews, none of these reviews came to a definitive conclusion about treatment effectiveness.

Conclusions

We identified gaps pertaining to treatment options for dry eye. Future clinical research on the management of dry eye should strongly consider these prioritized questions.

### Clinical evaluation of the smart plug in the treatment of dry eyes [^113VTB5D]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy of a thermo sensitive punctum plug, the Smart Plug, in the treatment of dry eyes.

Design

Observational case-series study.

Methods

Eighteen eyes of 10 dry eye patients who previously failed conventional plug insertion were enrolled. Schirmer 1 test, vital staining scores, and tear clearance tests were performed before plug insertion, at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months after insertion.

Results

Although Schirmer test values were not significantly different before and after plug insertion, the tear clearance rate considerably decreased (Before insertion: 14.8 ± 11.4; After insertion: 8.2 ± 6.6) (P < .05). Rose-Bengal and fluorescein scores improved significantly after plug insertion (Rose-Bengal: Before insertion: 6.4 ± 2.0; After insertion: 3.3 ± 1.6 points, Fluorescein: Before insertion: 4.8 ± 2.3; After insertion: 2.1 ± 1.3) (P < .05). No complications were observed.

Conclusions

Smart Plug proved to be a safe and efficient option in the treatment of dry eye.

### Dry eye: why artificial tears are not always the answer [^117QnTHV]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Beyond anti-inflammatory agents, other local interventions and systemic medications have also been studied in individuals with SS-associated DED. For example, punctal plugs have been used in this population. One study placed SmartPlug in 22 individuals with primary SS-associated ADDE (Schirmer test < 5 mm) and followed individuals for 12 months. Compared with baseline measurements, significant improvements in TBUT (4.6 ± 3.8→7.5 ± 2.5 s, p < 0.001) and Schirmer test (2.0 ± 2.7→6.4 ± 5.1 mm, p = 0.006) were noted at the 12-month follow-up. This study suggests that punctal plugs may be a simple and effective treatment option for individuals with primary SS-related ADDE. However, the decision to proceed with punctal plugs needs to be made with caution. Punctal plugs may especially be contraindicated in patients with DED due to inflammatory causes and they may cause nasolacrimal drainage system infections. Oral pilocarpine, a cholinergic parasympathomimetic agonist that binds to M3 receptors, has also been studied in relation to SS-associated DED. In one study, 85 individuals with primary SS-associated DED were randomised to pilocarpine (5 mg two times per day) (n = 29), AT (n = 28) or inferior puncta occlusion (Collagen Plugs) (n = 28) for 12 weeks. Individuals who received pilocarpine also had greater subjective improvement (90% improved) compared with AT (30% improved, p < 0.001) and puncta occlusion (60% improved, p < 0.05), as evaluated by the visual analogue score. While Schirmer scores were similar between the groups, pilocarpine improved rose bengal staining (−1.1 ± 1.0 points, p < 0.05) to a greater degree than AT (0.0 ± 0.7 points, not significant) and puncta occlusion (−0.5 ± 0.9 points, p < 0.05). Oral pilocarpine, however, has side effects which include nausea, vomiting and sweating that limits its utility in the clinical arena. Overall, individuals with for SS-related DED often need more advanced treatments, beyond AT, to target the various aspects of their disease, namely, inflammation and ADDE.

To the Editor. — Punctal occlusion has proved to be a valuable adjunct in the treatment of moderate to severe dry-eye syndrome. Recently, silicon plugs have become available for reversible occlusion of the lacrimal punctum and canaliculus. 1 Although this device has proved beneficial to many cases in our experience, its use is not without some potential hazard, as the following two case reports will indicate. Report of Cases. — Case 1. — A 29-year-old woman suffered from moderate dry-eye syndrome that caused irritation, particularly of the right eye. Since she was helped by temporary occlusion of her canaliculi with collagen inserts, we elected to perform punctal occlusion using a punctal plug for her lower right punctum. The lower lid was grasped with forceps in the recommended manner and the punctum was dilated with the punctal dilator supplied by the manufacturer. An attempt was then made to insert the plug, but, because of the. Mandelcorn MS, Crichton A, Levenson JE, Hofbaver J.

### Aspergillus fumigatus colonization of punctal plugs [^116BvDAq]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Punctal plugs are used in patients with dry eye syndrome to preserve the tears. In this report, I present two cases of Aspergillus fumigatus colonization of punctal plugs.

Design

Observational series of two cases.

Methods

Approval was obtained from the institutional review board. Two men aged 29 and 31 years developed black spots inside the hole of punctal plug, which looked like eyeliner deposits. The deposits inside the hole of the plug in each patient were removed and cultured.

Results

Cultures of the two punctal plugs black deposits grew A fumigatus. Bacterial cultures were negative.

Conclusions

Colonization of the punctal plug hole with A fumigatus was observed in two cases. It is recommended that punctal plugs be removed in patients undergoing refractive or intraocular procedures or in patients who are receiving topical corticosteroids. Current punctal plugs should be redesigned to avoid the presence of an inserter hole.

### Long-term follow-up of punctal and proximal canalicular stenoses after silicone punctal plug treatment in dry eye patients [^1157fvSH]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the clinical value and relevance of punctal and proximal canalicular stenoses after punctal plug therapy in moderate to severe dry eye syndrome.

Design

Retrospective, observational case series.

Methods

Seventeen eyes were determined to have punctum or proximal canalicular stenoses after spontaneous loss of a collared silicone punctal plug. After initial diagnosis all patients had 12 months or more of follow-up (mean, 39; range, 12 to 87 months). The clinical data collected included gender and age of patients, localization of the stenosis, plug size, duration of punctal occlusion, subjective symptoms, objective ocular surface disease parameters, and occurrence of complications.

Results

A statistically significant correlation between localization of the stenosis and plug size, and localization of the stenosis and duration of punctal occlusion could not be found. At follow-up, subjective symptoms (P < .01) and frequency of artificial tear application (P < .001) were significantly reduced compared to data before plug insertion. Schirmer I test results (P < .001), corneal fluorescein staining (P < .01), and rose bengal staining (P < .001) improved significantly, whereas tear break-up time (P < .2) and impression cytology scores of the conjunctival surface (P = .2) remained almost unchanged. Complications could not be found.

Conclusion

Within the observation period of up to seven years, all stenoses remained asymptomatic. Additionally, subjective symptoms and most dry eye parameters in our study population improved.

### TearCaresystem extension study: evaluation of the safety, effectiveness, and durability through 12 months of a second tearCaretreatment on subjects with dry eye disease [^113e8pmX]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Since DED was formally defined as an ocular disease, there has been an evolution in the understanding of this ocular surface disease. Originally, DED, as its name suggests, was felt to be a disease of aqueous insufficiency of the tear film. This thinking persisted for years, and the primary modalities of treatment included the use of artificial tears, ointments, and punctal plugs. These were directed at supplementing the aqueous layer or shoring up the tear film. However, this perspective changed as a result of increasing evidence-based approaches which would lead to a convergence between meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) and dry eye. Led primarily by the International Dry Eye Workshop and also the International Workshop on Meibomian Gland Dysfunction, research has shown the involvement of meibomian glands in maintaining a healthy, evaporation resistant tear film. Conversely, in the presence of MGD, DED is frequently encountered. This association has led to the term "evaporative dry eye". Note that this does not exclude existence of aqueous deficient dry eye. Rather, it appears that patients with DED may actually suffer from either aqueous deficient dry eye, evaporative dry eye, or both.

One of the primary functions of the meibomian glands is the secretion of an oily substance, meibum, which reduces evaporation. While there is great debate over the total role of the lipid component of the tear film, there is accumulating evidence that the tear film lipids impart viscoelastic properties and thereby stabilize the tear film. The natural blinking mechanism, presumably with a contribution from the muscle of Riolan, is believed to facilitate physiologic expression of meibum from the meibomian glands into the tear film.MGD has been shown to be associated with decreased tear break-up time (TBUT), increased tear evaporation, and resultant dry eye. The role of MGD with respect to tear film disturbances has been demonstrated by Nichols in 2011. Furthermore, Lemp showed in 2012 that while patients may demonstrate both aqueous deficient dry eye and evaporative dry eye, the majority of patients have evaporative dry eye or at least a component of evaporative dry eye.

### Cross-linked hyaluronic acid gel occlusive device for the treatment of dry eye syndrome [^1124v4WJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Dry eye symptoms can negatively affect daily functioning and disable people with multiple problems such as decreased vision, burning, irritation, itching, and eye fatigue. An estimated 10%–14.4% of people in the USA suffer from dry eyes. The management of DES includes removal of causative factors, artificial tears, prescription drops, and punctal plugs.

Practitioners commonly rely on adding moisture via drops as a first-line therapy. Manufactured artificial tears cannot replicate nature's own tear composition and therefore are never as beneficial as a person's own tears. The tear film is a complex layering of an outer lipid layer, middle aqueous layer, and inner surface mucin layer, each with an important function. Tear substitutes only attempt to partially replace some of these vital components. Therefore, artificial tears are limited to short-term, palliative, symptomatic relief. Those patients who require additional ocular surface lubrication or are challenged in applying drops often benefit from punctal plugs as a second-line treatment. Plugs block the egress of tears from the ocular surface and increase a patient's own tears to lubricate the eye. This first-in-man study suggests that a new method of treating DES using xlHA gel as a canalicular occlusive device is also possible.

### Punctal occlusion for dry eye syndrome: summary of a cochrane systematic review [^112PsZ7W]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Dry eye disease is a disorder of the tear film associated with ocular signs and symptoms. Punctal occlusion aids the preservation of natural tears. We conducted a Cochrane systematic review to assess the effectiveness of punctal plugs for managing dry eye. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials were included. The primary outcome was symptomatic improvement (SI) at 2–12 months. Nine databases were searched with no date or language restrictions. Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data. Summary risk ratios and mean differences were calculated. Ten trials were included. In two trials of punctal plugs versus observation, there was less dryness with punctal plugs. The mean difference (MD) in the dry eye symptom score at 2 months was -28.20 points (95% CI -33.61 to -22.79, range 0 to 105, one trial). Three trials compared punctal plugs with artificial tears. In a pooled analysis of two trials, punctal plug participants reported more SI at 3 months than artificial tear participants (MD -4.20 points, 95% CI -5.87 to -2.53, scales varied from 0 to 6). In the remaining five trials comparing punctal plug placement, acrylic and silicone plugs, or comparing plugs with cyclosporine or pilocarpine, none of the investigators reported a clinically or statistically meaningful difference in symptomatic improvement at 2–12 months. The effectiveness of punctal plugs for treating dry eye symptoms and common signs are inconclusive. Heterogeneity in the type of punctal plug, type and severity of dry eye being treated, and trial methodology confounds the ability to make decisive statements regarding the effectiveness of punctal plugs.

### Five misconceptions related to punctal plugs in dry eye management [^1179w2cH]. Cornea (2018). Low credibility.

Punctal plugs are an effective treatment option for patients with aqueous-deficient dry eye refractory to topical medications. However, punctal plugs are not commonly used in clinical practice mainly because of various misconceptions, rather than clinical complications. We analyzed previous studies and present 5 misconceptions related to punctal plugs. The first and most important misconception is that ocular surface inflammation should be sufficiently controlled before punctal plug insertion. However, it is unclear how ocular surface inflammation can be sufficiently controlled in patients refractory to conventional topical medications. The second misconception is that silicone punctal plugs are made of nonabsorbable materials and, therefore, permanent. In fact, silicone plugs are reversible and can be easily removed if necessary. Therefore, depending on the specific type, nonabsorbable plugs may be classified as reversible or permanent. The third misconception is that punctal plugs disrupt normal tear drainage. However, punctal plugs maintain natural tears on the ocular surface for extended periods and reduce the frequency of artificial tear use. The fourth is that all punctal and canalicular plugs have similar effects. The efficacy and complication rates differ depending on plug types. The fifth misconception about punctal plugs is that they are effective only in aqueous-deficient dry eye disease. Many studies have reported that plugs are effective in a variety of ocular diseases and conditions. Understanding these 5 misconceptions may provide an opportunity to rethink the use of silicone punctal plugs in clinical practice.

Recommendation

Punctal plugs are suitable in certain circumstances, but they may make corneal surface inflammation worse in certain situations. Careful patient selection is important (1, C) SOA 96.3%.

Androgen replacement therapy (ART)

A systematic review of Androgen replacement therapy (ART) in dry eye disease concluded that despite short-term benefit there was insufficient evidence to recommend routine use.

Recommendation

There is insufficient evidence to recommend androgen replacement therapy for dry eye disease (2, C) SOA 96.3%

7. In people with SD who have sicca (dryness) symptoms of the mouth, what is the most clinically effective topical treatment?

A Cochrane review of topical treatments for dry mouth of any cause (including SD) found no strong evidence supporting one topical therapy over another.

A Cochrane review of non-pharmacological therapies for dry mouth concluded that acupuncture was no different from placebo, there was insufficient evidence on the effect of an electrostimulation device and no difference between manual and powered toothbrushing symptoms.

Recommendation

Suggest saliva substitutes for symptomatic relief of oral dryness (2, C) SOA 93.3%

8. In people with SD who have sicca (dryness) symptoms outside the eyes and mouth, what is the most clinically effective topical treatment?

Topical treatments for vaginal dryness

Vaginal dryness is a common symptom in patients with SD with low-to-moderate evidence of benefit from topical oestrogens and non-hormonal vaginal moisturizers.

Topical oestrogens are not recommended for use in children or adolescents.

Recommendations

Consider advising topical non-hormonal vaginal moisturizers plus oestrogen creams/pessaries in peri- or post-menopausal women with significant vaginal dryness (2, C) SOA 97.5%

9a. In people with SD who have sicca (dryness) symptoms, what is the most clinically effective stimulatory treatment?

Stimulatory treatments for ocular sicca pilocarpine

There are no recent studies of pilocarpine in SD, but some good evidence of benefit from historical studies. There is anecdotal evidence that starting with a low dose and titrating upwards over time reduces side effects.

Recommendation

Consider a trial of pilocarpine (5 mg once daily increasing to 5 mg tds/qds) in those with significant ocular sicca symptoms with evidence of residual glandular function (1 A) SOA 95.3%

### The effect of punctal occlusion on wavefront aberrations in dry eye patients after laser in situ keratomileusis [^112k2BqY]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the wavefront aberrations in post-laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) dry eye patients before and after punctal occlusion.

Design

Prospective, comparative, nonrandomized study.

Methods

Wavefront aberrometry was performed on 16 eyes of eight patients with dry eyes after LASIK surgery. Wavefront measurements were taken before and 1 month after punctal plug placement and compared with 10 eyes of post-LASIK patients without clinically dry eyes measured twice 1 month apart. Student t tests were used to assess the statistical significance of differences between pre- and post-punctal plug measurements.

Results

Punctal occlusion in the post-LASIK dry eye patients significantly reduced total, lower, and higher order wavefront aberrations by 47% to 63% (P < .01). Among higher-order aberrations, there were significant reductions in coma and spherical aberration but not in trefoil, after punctal occlusion. The reduction of wavefront aberrations by punctal occlusion in post-LASIK dry eye patients resulted in a significant improvement in quantitative visual acuity assessed using an Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart and in subjective qualitative vision, confirmed by convolutional analysis using image simulation. No statistically significant differences in any of these metrics were found in the post-LASIK control group without clinically dry eyes measured twice at a similar time interval.

Conclusions

Wavefront aberrometry provides a useful, objective assessment of post-LASIK dry eye patients before and after punctal plug placement. Aggressive treatment of dry eyes may be important before obtaining wavefront measurements that serve as the basis for planning refractive corneal laser treatments and retreatments.

### Comparison of retention rates and complications of 2 different types of silicon lacrimal punctal plugs in the treatment of dry eye disease [^111Nz1FF]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the retention rate and complications of 2 different types of silicon lacrimal punctal plugs with the focus on the relationship to punctum size.

Design

A prospective, nonrandomized, interventional, comparative study.

Method

Forty-four patients with dry eye syndrome received lacrimal punctal plug insertion with the Punctal Plug F (FCI Ophthalmics) and 30 patients received plug insertion with the Super Flex plug (Eagle Vision; Softplug-Oasis Medical Inc). In total, 110 plug insertion regions were performed using the Punctal Plug F (group A) and 110 insertion regions were carried out using Super Flex plug (group B). The gauging system of Eagle Vision was used before the lacrimal punctal plug insertion in all subjects. Plug conditions (retention rates, spontaneous plug loss, and removal) and complications related to lacrimal punctal sizes were compared between the 2 groups.

Results

Retention rates were 70.4% in group A and 30.1% in group B at 6 months. Spontaneous plug loss occurrence was significant with the larger lacrimal punctum size in group A (P < .05), whereas no significant differences were observed between lacrimal punctum sizes and spontaneous loss in group B. Spontaneous plug loss occurrence was significant in elderly patients in group B (P < .05). Granuloma and injector troubles were observed in 1 and 2 cases in group A, respectively.

Conclusions

The Punctal Plug F seems to be more applicable for insertion into the smaller punctal sizes. Punctum size and age seem to be important factors in determining the appropriate types of lacrimal punctal plugs.

### Tolerability of current treatments for dry eye disease: a review of approved and investigational therapies [^111YPXkP]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Punctual plugs, also called lacrimal plugs, are small devices made of silicone or collagen that can be used to treat patients with severe ADDE. Punctual plugs increase tear retention on the ocular surface by occluding tear ducts, which leads to delayed tear drainage. In a retrospective study examining the use of silicone punctual plugs between 1996 and 2000 in 153 patients and 203 eyes, including 127 eyes with DED, symptoms improved in 73.9% of eyes at 4 ± 2 weeks' follow-up. Additionally, mean corneal fluorescein staining scores, which assess the viability of the epithelium, significantly decreased at 4 ± 2 weeks' follow-up (P < 0.01), indicating an improvement in ocular surface disease with punctual plugs. The most common complication associated with the use of punctual plug is loss of the plug.

Although mechanical approaches are well tolerated, cost, availability, and reproducibility tend to create substantial access burdens, and the symptom relief experienced after in-office treatment tends to decline over time, limiting long-term tolerability for patients. In addition to the in-office treatments, patients may perceive maintenance protocols as tedious and time consuming, which can lead to poor adherence and tolerability.

### The treatment of severe trachomatous dry eye with canalicular silicone plugs [^115ppZXT]. Eye (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the effects of temporary canalicular occlusion with silicone plugs on trachomatous dry eye patients who were on maximal tolerable medical therapy.

Methods

Forty-four trachomatous dry eye patients who had Schirmer testing with topical anaesthetic measuring 5 mm or less and a tear film break-up time of 5 s or less were included. After the lacrimal efficiency test with dissolvable collagen punctal plugs, silicone canalicular plugs were placed in 22 trachomatous dry eye patients. The other 22 patients in the untreated control group were allowed to continue their medical therapy. Pretreatment and post-treatment evaluations included subjective patient assessment, rose Bengal and fluorescein staining, tear film break-up time, Schirmer testing, conjunctival impression cytology and goblet cell counting.

Results

Six months after plug placement, 18 eyes (82%) of 22 patients had subjective improvement and all these patients successfully wore plugs for at least 6 months. There were statistically significant differences between the pretreatment and post-treatment test results including rose Bengal and fluorescein staining scores, tear film break-up times and Schirmer testing measurements. Impression cytology showed improvement of squamous metaplasia in 17 eyes (77%). Eight of the patients (36%) were able to decrease dependency on topical therapy. Ten of the patients (45%) completely stopped using artificial tears. There were statistically significant differences between the two groups in the total symptom scores, staining scores, tear film break-up time, Schirmer testing, impression cytology scores and goblet cell counts.

Conclusion

In cases where topical tear supplementation is insufficient to relieve the signs and symptoms of severe dry eye and the lacrimal puncta have not already been closed by the trachomatous cicatrising process, occlusion of the canaliculi may be useful to prevent drainage of both natural and artificial tears. Canalicular occlusion improves the objective signs and subjective symptoms and may significantly decrease dependency on tear supplements in selected patients.

### Prevalence of dry eye disease in African populations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111kbwrw]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Thirdly, guidelines and education for clinicians on the management of DED must be developed. Treatment can now be ad hoc – patients are just told to go and purchase any of the available over-the-counter tear drops, which might or might not be sufficient. Guidelines with African settings in perspective (potentially using TFOS DEWS III) would enhance harmonization of treatment. They could, for example, emphasize the treatment of coexisting blepharitis/MGD (with eyelid hygiene and meibomian gland expression) since MGD is common among dry eye patients.

They can also alert when to intensify treatment (e.g. adding steroids for a short period in moderate disease, or punctal plugs in treatment-resistant disease). Lastly, our paper identifies gaps that research and policy must fill: there are no DED prevalence data in some areas (Central Africa, portions of East/West Africa). It is possible that our pooled estimate over-represents certain areas and under-represents others. We would strongly support future research to include large population-based reports from under-researched countries to give a more representative outcome. Notably, rural areas and other age groups (and children, as dry eye in children is becoming an increasing concern in some areas would be worth exploring. Furthermore, incidence and persistence longitudinal data on DED in Africa do not exist – these would inform us on how dry eye is chronic in these climates and what risk factors there are for developing the condition. Finally, trials of dry eye treatments in African populations (e.g. new environmental treatments or tear substitutes vs. known treatments in hot climates) would be valuable, as efficacy may be environment- and/or gene-dependent.

Limitations

The review has several limitations that need to be considered when interpreting the results:

Methodological heterogeneity

As described, the included studies employed various diagnostic criteria and study designs. Although we attempted to address this with subgroup analyses, it does mean that the pooled estimate should be regarded only as an approximate average. Having no single case definition across studies is a limitation of the literature. We attempted to standardize by excluding very low-quality studies, but heterogeneity remains. The large I 2 (~ 48%) indicates extreme inconsistency in study outcomes, which could not be fully explained by the covariates we had in mind.

### Clinical utility of cyclosporine (CsA) ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% for symptomatic relief in people with chronic dry eye: a review of the literature [^111PvNxx]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

CsA versus punctal occlusion versus combination

Roberts et alrandomized 30 patients into one of three treatment groups for 6 months: CsA 0.05% bid; lower lid punctal plugs; or plugs and CsA combination. They found that all the three methods treated dry eye, but the combination group produced the greatest reduction (5.5–6 to 1.6 times/d) in patient self-medication with artificial tears, a surrogate marker for relief from dryness and burning. Furthermore, continued reduction in lubricant use was noted during the course of the study in the combination group. This diminished need for supplemental artificial tears was also observed by Sall et al. In contrast, Perry et aldid not find any difference in CsA response with punctal plugs.

CsA versus topical vitamin A

Kim et alstudied 150 Korean patients with DED and divided them into groups receiving CsA 0.05% emulsion bid, retinyl palmitate 0.05% qid, or only preservative-free artificial tears qid. They found that both CsA and vitamin A led to significant improvement in blurred vision when compared to the lubricant only group.

CsA in other autoimmune diseases, such as thryoid eye disease- and Stevens–Johnson syndrome-related chronic DED

There have been small studies on CsA in dry eye related to other systemic diseases. A Thai studyexamined 17 patients with Stevens–Johnson syndrome for 6 months and found significant alleviation of symptoms including foreign body sensation, photophobia, eye pain, and dry sensation, which were graded by the visual analog scale. A Turkish study of 12 consecutive thyroid orbitopathy patients with dry eye showed a significant improvement in OSDI with 2 months of twice-daily CsA treatment.

CsA in trachomatous DED

Guzey et alexamined 64 patients with severe trachomatous DED and divided them into CsA 0.05% emulsion bid with nonpreserved artificial tears 5 times daily, and vehicle emulsion bid with nonpreserved artificial tears 5 times daily. They found that the CsA group had significantly improved OSDI.

### Chronic ocular GVHD treatment at two locations of a tertiary referral center [^117JvzwD]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Punctal plugs can be considered for patients who require additional relief. These are generally effective and well tolerated with rare side effects, and are also easily reversible if epiphora occurs. There is some concern with the use of punctal plugs in inflammatory conditions due to retention of proinflammatory tear components leading to further ocular surface damage. However, Sabti et al did not find punctal occlusion to increase inflammation in oGVHD patients. Additionally, the flange of punctal plugs can rub on the ocular surface especially if puncta are located in an entropic position. Synthetic temporary extended punctal inserts can be considered in patients experiencing irritation or discomfort with silicone plugs. Lastly, plugs can be spontaneously lost, particularly in patients with KCS secondary to oGVHD. If silicone plugs are repeatedly dislodged, cause irritation due to flange rubbing, or result in long-term biofilm coating formation, punctal cautery offers a more long-term solution. Wang et al found that cauterization significantly improved CFS in patients with dry eye disease and that this improvement persisted for more than 12 months. Recanalization and reopening of puncta may occur requiring repeat cauterization, especially in patients younger than 60 years of age. Studies have found recanalization rates between 21% and 25%, although these are reported to be lower in cicatrizing processes like cGVHD. Autologous serum tears can be used as an alternative or adjunctive therapy to punctal occlusion and have been shown to provide both subjective and objective improvements in oGVHD patients. These are produced using autologous serum and contain growth factors, cytokines, fibronectin, and vitamin A which help promote ocular surface healing. In addition to lubrication, serum tears may also affect disease course by reducing inflammation and providing nutrition. However, serum tears are not covered by insurance and are a recurring cost to patients. Topical anti-inflammatory drugs such as cyclosporine, lifitegrast, or tacrolimus ointment may be difficult for patients to tolerate but can be used in conjunction with other treatment options and are useful in oGVHD management due to their immunosuppressive effects.

### Efficacy and safety of topical and systemic medications: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of Sjögren's syndrome [^117RWLLU]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

With respect to AS and plug insertion, in addition to the very limited evidence available for primary-2002 patients, the two Cochrane SLRs found significant limitations in the quality of trials (incomplete descriptive statistics for reported treatment outcomes, sample sizes with too few participants, quasi-randomisation methods, complete masking may not have been feasible, short-term evaluation of efficacy, lack of details on adverse outcomes and tolerance). For AS, the Cochrane SLR concluded that current evidence suggests that 20% AS might provide some benefit in improving patient-reported symptoms over the short term (2 weeks), but longer periods of follow-up provide no evidence of improvement over longer periods, while no clear effects were found for objective clinical measures of the ocular surface. For punctal occlusion, the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low (frequently downgrading the level of evidence due to the high RoB or imprecision in effect estimates), and it was concluded that current evidence suggests that punctal plugs are a modestly effective means of treating dry eye. For all these reasons, the use of AS and plugs in primary SjS has been considered as a rescue therapeutic option, always under prescription by an ophthalmologist. A combination of AS and plugs has recently been evaluatedin 28 SjS patients (primary and associated, criteria not detailed). Ophthalmologists play a key role in prescribing topical and systemic therapies for ocular dryness, always with a close multidisciplinary follow-up.

### A new punctal plug insertion technique to prevent intracanalicular plug migration [^112dq583]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the intracanalicular migration rate during plug insertion with a new plug insertion technique compared with a standard technique.

Design

Interventional, nonrandomized, comparative study.

Method

Forty-five patients with dry eye syndrome underwent a punctal plug insertion with the new technique, and 33 patients underwent a punctal plug insertion with a standard technique at the dry eye subspecialty outpatient clinic of the Department of Ophthalmology at Keio University. Tear function examinations and ocular surface evaluations, including the Schirmer test, tear film breakup time, fluorescein and Rose Bengal vital staining scores, were performed before punctal plug insertion. Super Flex Punctum Plugs (Eagle Vision, Memphis, Tennessee, USA; Softplug-Oasis Medical Inc, Glendora, California, USA) were implanted in all subjects with both techniques. In total, 120 procedures were carried out with the new technique and 132 procedures with the standard technique.

Results

There were no statistical differences between the two groups in tear function and ocular surface staining scores (P > .05). There was no intracanalicular plug migration with the new insertion technique, whereas there were 18 incidents of intracanalicular migration of 132 standard plug insertion procedures (13.6%).

Conclusions

The new plug insertion technique seems to be effective in eliminating intracanalicular plug migration during the insertion procedure.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^112X8Zhw]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye disease — prevalence and risk factors are summarized as follows: Estimates from managed-care claims show that among nearly 10 million enrollees, dry eye was diagnosed or treated with punctal occlusion in 0.4% to 0.5% of enrollees. Older age and female gender have been identified as major risk factors, and increased prevalence has been reported among Japanese office workers using visual display terminals, with concurrent use of glaucoma medication containing benzalkonium chloride and rheumatoid arthritis also associated with dry eye. After controlling for age and gender, smoking and multivitamin use were associated with an increased risk, whereas caffeine use was associated with a decreased risk; real‑world data also found increased prevalence among sleep disorder patients and that use of a sedative-hypnotic might be associated with dry eye development. Additional associated risk factors included use of antihistamines, antidepressant and antianxiety medications, and oral corticosteroids, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were associated with a lower risk. Among the 25,665 postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Study, hormone replacement therapy, particularly estrogen use alone, was associated with an increased risk of clinically diagnosed dry eye disease or severe symptoms. A large community-based study from China reported a 15.7% prevalence of dry eye among patients with diabetes (mean age 68.9 ± 8.9 years), particularly those with poor metabolic control.

### Topical omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for the treatment of dry eye-results from a pilot randomized controlled masked-observer study [^113TEmB3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Study Design

This was a pilot, multicenter, single (= observer) masked, randomized, active-controlled, two-arm study with four visits scheduled over an observation period of 13 weeks. The screening visit, during which patients were checked for eligibility, was followed by a one-week run-in period. At the subsequent baseline visit, patients still fulfilling all eligibility criteria were randomized to treatment. At two further visits after four and twelve weeks of treatment, efficacy and safety/tolerability outcomes were measured. A treatment duration of four weeks was considered sufficient to evaluate efficacy, whereas twelve weeks were deemed required to evaluate any anti-inflammatory effects and treatment-associated risks.

The study was approved by local Ethics Committees (Ethikkommission der Landesärztekammer Baden-Württemberg, Ethik-Kommission der Ärztekammer Hamburg, Ethikkommission der Med. Fakultät der Ludwig-Maximilian-Universität), fully complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable local regulations, and was registered under clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02908282).

Patients

Eligible were men and women between 18 and 80 years of age with moderate to severe DED, defined by a mean tear break-up time (TBUT) ≤ 10 s, and an Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) ≥ 20 for the same eye at both the screening and baseline visit. When both eyes met these criteria, the eye with the lower TBUT was studied as the index eye.

Patients were excluded, if they presented: (a) a contraindication for any of the study treatments, (b) any disease or condition judged by the investigator to be incompatible with study assessments, or (c) if they had to take concomitant medications affecting the tear film, tear secretion or ocular surface integrity or that might have biased any treatment effect such as local/systemic corticosteroids or antibiotics, omega-3 oral supplements, topical cyclosporine A.

Wearing of contact lenses had to be discontinued and punctal plugs had neither to be removed nor replaced later than one month prior to inclusion until the end of the study. Any eye surgery had to date back ≥ 6 weeks. Patients with any concurrent systemic disease or with controlled glaucoma were eligible if on stable therapy. Participants of childbearing potential had to use adequate methods of birth control for the duration of the study; pregnant or lactating females were excluded. All eligible patients had to sign written informed consent prior to inclusion.

### Executive summary: British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of adult and juvenile onset Sjögren disease [^117ViRvw]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation

Topical ciclosporin eye drops, under ophthalmic supervision, may be indicated for patients with persistent surface inflammation despite maximal management with conventional eye drops (1, B) SOA 94.9%

Treatments for meibomian gland deficiency (MGD)

A systematic review of evidence-based treatments for MGD found all eight standard forms of treatment — including self-applied eyelid warming, thermal pulsation, IPL, MG probing, antibiotics, lipid containing eye drops and perfluorohexyloctane — were effective, although with variable clinical improvement.

Recommendations

Advise a heated eyelid compress for at least 10 min daily (1, A) SOA 94.9%

Lipiflow, intense pulsed light therapy and meibomian gland probing are not currently NHS-funded as treatments within the UK. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend their routine use. However, these procedures are safe with, in some cases, weak evidence of benefit in dry eye and individuals may decide to undergo these treatments in the private sector (2, C) SOA 84.5%.

Antibiotics for meibomian gland disease

A review of antibiotic treatment for dry eye disease with meibomian gland dysfunction or blepharitis confirmed short-term improvements but felt there was insufficient evidence to recommend long-term use.

Recommendation

Those with dry eye disease associated with meibomian gland dysfunction or blepharitis could be offered short-term treatment with oral or topical antibiotics with an anti-inflammatory action (2, B) SOA 92.3%

Lipid-containing eye drops

A systematic review of lipid-containing lubricants confirmed short-lived symptomatic improvement.

Recommendation

Individuals with dry eye disease associated with meibomian gland dysfunction or blepharitis could be advised to use lipid-containing eye drops or liposomal eye sprays as adjunctive treatment (2, C) SOA 90.2%

Punctal occlusion

A Cochrane review concluded that the evidence of benefit was inconclusive although individual studies suggest that punctal plugs may improve symptoms. Expert opinion is that punctal plugs are suitable in some patients, but they may make corneal surface inflammation worse in certain situations.

### Autologous serum eye drops for the treatment of severe dry eye in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease [^111j1M11]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

We investigated the efficacy and safety of autologous serum eye drops for the treatment of severe dry eye after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). A total of 14 patients (four males and 10 females; median age, 31.0 years) with severe dry eye associated with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) were enrolled in this study. All patients were refractory to treatment with conventional artificial tears. Autologous serum eye drops, a solution made of 20% autologous serum in sterile saline, were applied 10 times per eye per day. The patients were evaluated every 4 weeks according to visual acuity, corneal sensitivity, vital staining of the ocular surface, tear dynamics, and subjective assessments of symptoms (complaints scores). The median follow-up period was 19.4 months (range: 4–41 months). After 4 weeks of treatment, significant improvement was observed in both complaint scores (from 33.7 ± 12.3 to 23.6 ± 10.6 points; P < 0.01) and fluorescein scores (from 5.8 ± 2.0 to 2.4 ± 0.9 points; P < 0.005). Significant improvements were observed also in rose-bengal staining and tear break-up time. In seven of the 14 patients, the responses were maintained for 6–41 months (median:19.4 ± 8.3 months), while six of the other seven patients required treatment with punctal plugs in addition to autologous serum eye drops. One of these other seven patients developed eczema around the eyelids, after which the treatment was discontinued. No serious adverse events were observed. We conclude that autologous serum eye drops are safe and effective for treating severe dry eye associated with cGVHD and that more efficient control of dry eye may be achieved by the combined use of autologous serum eye drops with punctal plugs.

### The detection of bacteria and bacterial biofilms in punctal plug holes [^112XeExa]. Cornea (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

An investigation into bacterial biofilm formation on and in punctal plugs.

Methods

The study involved 21 patients with severe dry eye whose puncta were occluded by the use of punctal plugs. Of these, 15 had Sjögren's syndrome, 3 had non-Sjögren's syndrome, 2 had Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and 1 had graft-versus-host disease. From 17 of the 21 subjects, 18 samples of material were extracted from the holes of the punctal plugs (16 unilateral and 1 bilateral) and were subjected to enrichment culture. Nineteen punctal plugs were removed and processed for electron microscopy: 15 by scanning electron microscopy, and 4 by transmission electron microscopy.

Results

Positive cultures were found in 8 of 18 (44%) samples of the material extracted from the holes of punctal plugs. In six of these eight cases (75%) the cultured bacterial species was Staphylococcus epidermidis, whereas in the other two cases (25%) it was S. aureus. In 8 of the 15 punctal plugs examined by scanning electron microscopy and in the material extracted from 1 plug that was examined by transmission electron microscopy, there was clear evidence of bacterial colonization.

Conclusion

Careful observation of patients with punctal plugs is important. If material accumulates in or on a punctal plug, it may contain bacteria and may form a bacterial biofilm. In these cases, replacement of the plug, clearing of the hole, or an alternative treatment should be considered.

### Cross-linked hyaluronic acid gel occlusive device for the treatment of dry eye syndrome [^116rbXVV]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

It has been well documented that punctal occlusion is beneficial in both subjective and objective manifestations of dry eye disease with 74%–86% of patients treated with plugs gaining improvement in dry eye symptoms. Plugs have also been shown to significantly improve dry eye outcome measures such as visual acuity, Schirmer's test, fluorescein corneal staining, tear film quality, TBUT, TMH, tear osmolarity, goblet cell density, and quality of life in patients with aqueous deficiency.–The American Academy of Ophthalmology paper on punctal plugs reported a ≥ 50% improvement of dry eye signs and symptoms that are not responsive to topical treatment. This included improved ocular surface health, decreased artificial tear use, and improved contact lens tolerance.

Punctal occlusion using traditional solid plugs suffers from drawbacks. The disadvantages of cap plugs include the technical challenges in sizing and placing, the cap head rubbing on the eye, poor retention with rates ranging from 30% to 90%, spontaneous extrusion, dislodgement, canalicular dissection, infection, and pyogenic granuloma formation requiring surgical removal.–Intracanalicular plugs were popularized partially to circumvent the issue of the cap rubbing on the ocular surface. They are available in many forms such as temporary collagen plugs as a short-term trial to assess efficacy. Intracanalicular plugs can also sometimes be made of harder acrylic material that can erode into the soft lining of the canaliculus. This can lead to an infection and fulminant canaliculitis with bleeding granulation tissue, a bacterial infection, and chronic conjunctivitis necessitating surgical removal. One survey of American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery members reported that 61% of the respondents encountered complications with intracanalicular plugs such as canaliculitis and that 51% required surgery to correct the problem. Although all types of plug can be safe and effective, complications such as infection, allergic reaction, extrusion, and migration can plague current plug designs.

### Expert opinion in the management of aqueous deficient dry eye disease (DED) [^1113SWkP]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Among non-topical therapies for DED patients, respondents were most commonly using punctal plugs, oral EFA supplements, low-dose oral doxycycline and flaxseed supplements. Punctal plugs have been studied in multiple clinical trials, and a recent Cochrane review found that although the literature did not decisively support its efficacy for dry eye treatment, the data did suggest "usefulness" in DED. EFA supplements are traditionally used to treat evaporative DED or meibomian gland disease. Systemic EFA supplements have been studied in small- to moderate-sized clinical trials; only a few showed improvements for limited measures of DED, with others finding no statistically significant improvement. Doxycycline, an antibacterial with anti-inflammatory effects, gained traction as a therapy for DED when inflammatory pathways were added to the understanding of dry eye pathogenesis. It has primarily been studied in ocular rosacea, but a recent study in a small number of patients suggests doxycycline to be effective in restoring tear film stability in dry eye patients. Despite limited data for both omega fatty acids and doxycycline, both are being used by survey respondents, with significant interest in increasing their use.

### Efficacy and safety of topical and systemic medications: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of Sjögren's syndrome [^1141KHwy]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate current evidence on the efficacy and safety of topical and systemic medications in patients with primary Sjögren syndrome (SjS) to inform European League Against Rheumatism treatment recommendations.

Methods

The MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for case-control/prospective cohort studies, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews.

Results

Current evidence in primary SjS patients fulfilling the 2002 criteria is based on the data from 9 RCTs, 18 prospective cohort studies and 5 case-control studies. Two Cochrane systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have reported that topical treatments for dry mouth and dry eye are safe and effective. Ocular cyclosporine A was safe and effective in two RCTs including 1039 patients with dry eye syndrome. Two Cochrane SLRs on serum tear drops and plugs showed inconsistency in possible benefits, both for symptoms and objective measures. Five RCTs reported significant improvements in oral dryness and salivary flow rates for pilocarpine and cevimeline. An RCT showed no significant placebo-differences for hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day for the primary outcome (visual analogue scale (VAS) composite of dryness, fatigue and pain). We identified seven RCTs carried out in primary SjS patients. RCTs using infliximab, anakinra and baminercept found no placebo-differences for the primary outcomes. The two largest RCTs randomised 255 patients to receive rituximab or placebo and reported no significant results in the primary outcome (VAS composite), while prospective studies suggested efficacy in systemic disease.

Conclusion

The current evidence supporting the use of the main topical therapeutic options of primary SjS is solid, while limited data from RCTs are available to guide systemic therapies.

### A practical approach to severity classification and treatment of dry eye disease: a proposal from the Mexican dry eye disease expert panel [^116oG523]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Step 2

For this therapy step, unpreserved ocular lubricants are recommended to minimize toxicity induced by the preservatives or by any inflammation in the damaged ocular surface. Lubricant eye drops with high viscosity and gel, or ointment formulations may also be considered. Preferentially overnight. Eye drops promoting corneal and conjunctival epithelial healing and regeneration are also recommended for cases with significant ocular surface damage due to dryness. The use of moisture chamber glasses is an alternative therapeutic modality to improve tear stability and reduce DED symptoms with as few as 10 minutes of use. Temporary punctal occlusion has also been proven to improve symptoms, Schirmer test, and TFBUT scores. However, the panel recommends punctal plugs must be used judiciously since inadvertent ocular surface inflammation may worsen due to inflammatory mediators' retention.

### Efficacy and tolerability outcomes after punctal occlusion with silicone plugs in dry eye syndrome [^113pbqeA]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Silicone punctal plugs are widely used to conserve moisture in tear-deficient eyes. We studied the efficacy and tolerability of punctal plugs in symptom reduction and improvement of ocular surface disease parameters in dry eye syndrome.

Methods

We reviewed the records of 50 consecutive patients with dry eye syndrome who were symptomatic despite maximally tolerable lubricant therapy and had bilateral lower punctal plug insertion. After plug insertion, all patients (41 women and nine men) had 6 months or more of follow-up. The subjects ranged in age from 22 to 57 years (mean, 30 years). We recorded subjective and objective improvement of ocular surface disease, frequency of lubricant use, need for upper punctal occlusion, and occurrence of complications after plug insertion. We determined plug retention rates using Kaplan-Meier analyses and assessed associated factors using Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

Six months after initial plug placement, 43 of 50 patients (86%) were symptom free, 28 of them (56%) with plugs alone, and 38 patients (76%) had stopped using lubricants on a daily basis. Spontaneous loss of plugs was common, especially in the initial 3 months of follow-up. Considering all plugs, the estimated probability of plug retention was 63% after 6 months of follow-up. Puncta refitted after initial plug loss were twice as likely to lose the replacement plug (P = .02). Upper punctal plugs showed a 4.3-fold higher risk of loss compared with plugs inserted in lower puncta (P < .0001).

Conclusions

There is both a reduced dependency on artificial lubricants and relief of symptoms of dry eye after punctal plugs. However, spontaneous plug loss occurs in a substantial minority of patients. Patient education and close follow-up, particularly in the first 3 months, is recommended to detect plug loss and ensure adequate control of the disease.

### Silicone versus collagen plugs for treating dry eye: results of a prospective randomized trial including lacrimal scintigraphy [^115HA8BM]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the short-term efficacy of collagen and silicone plugs for treating dry eye using quantitative lacrimal scintigraphy.

Design

Prospective randomized clinical trial.

Methods

In this institutional study, 24 dry eye patients were evaluated in two groups: group I (n = 22 eyes) received collagen plugs and group II (n = 26 eyes) received silicone plugs. Comparisons were made with normal control subjects (n = 22 eyes). Data for the Schirmer I test, tear break-up time, and ocular surface staining with rose bengal dye were recorded before and after punctal occlusion. Lacrimal scintigraphy was performed at each time point, and the time to half maximum activity on the ocular surface (T(1/2)), and the percentage retention of activity on the ocular surface at the end of the dynamic study (RI) were recorded.

Results

In both patient groups, Schirmer I results, tear break-up times, and rose bengal staining scores improved significantly after plug insertion. Mean T(1/2) values and RI values increased significantly in both groups (P < .0001 for both). The differences for these values between groups I and II was statistically insignificant (P > .05).

Conclusions

Collagen and silicone plugs both resulted in significant increases in aqueous tear volume, half-life of nuclear material on the ocular surface, and percentage of nuclear material retention. The groups' post-insertion values for all parameters were similar. These results suggest that these two plug types have similar efficacy as treatments for dry eye in the short term. Further studies evaluating long-term results are required.
