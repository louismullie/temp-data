## Question

Influenza virus infection diagnosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about influenza virus infection diagnosis, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical presentation and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach by care setting and severity. Next, I will review test types and performance, followed by specimen selection and timing. After that, I need to interpret results in the context of local activity and patient risk. Finally, I should integrate testing with treatment decisions, special populations, and outbreak/public health considerations, and close with a concise algorithmic summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical presentation and pretest probability anchors. Influenza typically presents with abrupt onset of fever, cough, myalgias, and malaise, but hospitalized patients frequently lack classic features, so I should not over-rely on ILI criteria in the inpatient setting; in fact, only about half of hospitalized influenza cases meet CDC ILI criteria, which means I need a high index of suspicion during circulation periods and in high-risk hosts [^111VfEUS] [^116ZgQii]. I should also remember that older adults may not mount fever and can present with delirium or functional decline, and that vaccination does not exclude influenza, so I must incorporate local activity, exposure risks, and host factors into pretest probability rather than relying on symptoms alone [^113d6abo] [^117RDwGm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing everyone indiscriminately; I need to check guideline-based indications. Testing should be performed when results are anticipated to influence clinical management or public health response, including hospitalized patients with acute respiratory illness, immunocompromised hosts with compatible symptoms, and outpatients at high risk for complications or when results will change antiviral or antibiotic decisions; conversely, routine testing is not required for otherwise healthy outpatients with classic ILI during high activity when results won't change management [^116ua787] [^115wydMM] [^114bdov1]. I should double-check that IDSA explicitly recommends testing all hospitalized patients with acute respiratory symptoms during influenza season and considering testing in high-risk outpatients even outside typical season, which aligns with this approach [^115ZWnfA] [^113pMJ5w].

> Next, I should review test types and performance so I choose the right assay for the right question. Rapid molecular assays (NAATs) are preferred for their high sensitivity and specificity and can return results in about 15–30 minutes at the point of care, making them the first-line choice when testing will influence management; rapid antigen tests are highly specific but have lower sensitivity, so a negative result cannot safely exclude influenza, especially in severe disease or low viral loads [^111k6zio] [^116Xffxp] [^1133uBkh]. Wait, let me verify the sensitivity figures; contemporary summaries place RIDT sensitivity roughly 50–75%, whereas NAATs are typically 92–95% or higher, reinforcing the need to confirm negative RIDTs with NAAT in high-risk or inpatient settings [^1141gj82] [^116Xn346].

> I will now examine specimen selection and timing because these materially affect yield. For outpatients, a nasopharyngeal swab is preferred and should be collected as early as possible, ideally within 4 days of symptom onset, since viral shedding declines thereafter; for hospitalized patients with suspected lower tract disease or negative upper tract testing, I should obtain endotracheal aspirate or BAL if intubated, and consider repeat molecular testing if clinical suspicion remains high [^1178tebu] [^1153Ptam] [^113Uvg8M]. But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised or critically ill? Shedding can persist for weeks, so later specimens may still be positive on molecular assays, which justifies repeat or lower respiratory sampling when upper tract tests are negative yet suspicion persists [^117FP5ta] [^113Uvg8M].

> Now I need to ensure I interpret results in the right epidemiologic context. During high influenza activity, a positive antigen or molecular test is very likely a true positive, whereas a negative antigen test has low negative predictive value and should be confirmed with NAAT or treated empirically if clinical suspicion is high; during low activity, a positive antigen test has a lower positive predictive value and should be confirmed with NAAT, while a negative antigen test is more reassuring but still not definitive in high-risk patients [^1133uBkh] [^115xdyNA]. Hold on, I should verify that this activity-based interpretation is explicitly endorsed; yes, IDSA provides activity-level guidance and emphasizes that molecular assays have the best performance characteristics and should be prioritized when results will change management [^116ua787] [^11676VrU].

> Let me integrate testing with treatment decisions, because timing is critical. For hospitalized patients or those with severe or progressive disease, initiate antivirals immediately and do not delay for test results; for high-risk outpatients, treat within 48 hours of symptom onset when possible, and consider treatment beyond 48 hours if illness is severe or progressive; for low-risk outpatients, treatment within 2 days can be considered, but testing may help avoid unnecessary antivirals when pretest probability is low [^117DnkUL] [^115wydMM] [^112RYqGv]. I should confirm that WHO aligns with treating all confirmed cases and prioritizing early therapy in severe or high-risk patients, which it does, reinforcing the principle of early empiric therapy when indicated [^1137Tjr9].

> I need to check special populations and scenarios so I don't miss nuances. In immunocompromised hosts, shedding is prolonged and upper tract sampling may be insufficient; multiplex molecular panels can be useful to detect coinfections, and if an assay returns "unsubtypeable" influenza A, I should suspect a novel strain and contact public health for specialized testing; in pediatrics, clinical diagnosis is common, but NAAT improves detection and can guide therapy and school/public health decisions; in older adults, absence of fever is common, so behavioral change or functional decline should trigger testing and treatment [^11718LZ3] [^116Xffxp] [^113yz9SS] [^113d6abo]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said to routinely test nonrespiratory sites in severe disease; I should correct that — routine blood, urine, or stool testing for influenza is not recommended, and serology is not useful for acute management, so I should avoid these low-yield strategies [^115tt9dq] [^112MkHgH].

> Next, I should review outbreak and public health considerations so testing also serves surveillance and control. In closed settings or clusters, testing the first few symptomatic individuals helps identify the pathogen and guide control measures; in hospitals, a single healthcare-associated case should trigger active surveillance; and suspected novel avian or variant influenza requires immediate public health coordination and subtype-specific testing at specialized laboratories [^113yz9SS] [^117X9tQo] [^114WGATt]. Hold on, I should verify that commercial assays won't distinguish seasonal from zoonotic influenza A; that's correct, so any suspicion of novel infection mandates notification and referral testing [^114WGATt].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. In the outpatient setting, diagnose clinically during high activity unless the patient is high risk or results will change management; if testing, use NAAT when available and treat high-risk patients empirically while awaiting results; in the ED, favor NAAT to improve detection and stewardship; in the hospital, test all suspected cases with molecular assays, obtain lower respiratory specimens when indicated, and start antivirals immediately without waiting for results; avoid viral culture and serology for acute management due to poor timeliness [^115wydMM] [^11676VrU] [^115ZWnfA] [^113cXfQP] [^117WoQtS]. I should double-check that this aligns with IDSA and CDC guidance, which it does, including the caution that a positive influenza test does not exclude bacterial coinfection and that antibiotics should be considered when pneumonia is suspected [^115xdyNA] [^117T12qP].

> Finally, I need to ensure I've addressed limitations and follow-up. Negative tests, especially RIDTs, can be falsely negative early or late in illness or in severe disease, so clinical judgment and repeat or alternative specimen testing are essential; if patients deteriorate or fail to improve on antivirals, I should reassess for bacterial coinfection, resistant virus, inadequate antiviral exposure, or alternative diagnoses rather than prematurely abandoning the influenza diagnosis [^1133uBkh] [^111fp6ag] [^112rHDT6]. Let me reconsider the overall message: accurate, timely molecular testing integrated with clinical risk and local activity yields the best outcomes by enabling early antivirals, reducing unnecessary antibiotics, and supporting infection control, which is precisely what the guidelines aim to achieve [^113BBC6c] [^116ua787].

Influenza diagnosis relies on **clinical suspicion plus confirmatory testing** [^114ooqty]. Clinical features (abrupt fever, cough, myalgia, malaise) guide suspicion, but **testing is required** to confirm influenza and guide management [^111VfEUS]. Rapid molecular assays (NAATs) are preferred for their high sensitivity and specificity and fast turnaround [^11676VrU] [^113Uvg8M]; rapid antigen tests are less sensitive but useful when NAAT is unavailable [^1133uBkh]. PCR is the gold standard, especially in severe or hospitalized cases [^1141gj82] [^113Fx7a9]. Testing is essential in hospitalized patients, high-risk outpatients, and during outbreaks; **early results enable timely antiviral therapy** and infection control [^115ZWnfA] [^114aHgei].

---

## Clinical presentation and initial assessment

Influenza typically presents with **abrupt onset of fever, cough, myalgia, malaise, and chills** [^111VfEUS]; sore throat and nasal congestion are common, and gastrointestinal symptoms may occur, especially in children [^notfound]. Initial assessment should consider **seasonal influenza activity**, exposure history, and patient risk factors (age, comorbidities, immunocompromise, pregnancy) [^116ua787].

---

## Diagnostic testing methods

### Molecular assays (nucleic acid amplification tests, NAATs)

- **Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)**: Gold standard with high sensitivity/specificity; detects influenza A/B and subtypes; results in 1–8 hours [^1141gj82] [^113Uvg8M].
- **Rapid molecular assays**: Point-of-care NAATs with results in 15–30 minutes; high sensitivity/specificity; preferred for hospitalized and high-risk outpatients [^11676VrU] [^114aHgei].
- **Multiplex PCR panels**: Detect influenza alongside other respiratory pathogens; useful in severe illness or outbreaks [^114JKx44] [^11718LZ3].

---

### Antigen detection tests

- **Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs)**: Results in 10–15 minutes; moderate sensitivity (50–70%), high specificity (> 90%); useful when NAAT is unavailable; negative results may need confirmation [^1133uBkh] [^116anQSa].
- **Digital immunoassays**: Improved sensitivity over traditional RIDTs; results in 15–30 minutes; suitable for point-of-care use [^114SFfPv].

---

### Viral culture

Viral culture is **highly specific** but slow (3–10 days), making it impractical for clinical management; it is used mainly for research and public health surveillance [^113cXfQP] [^112WdbZk].

---

### Serology

Serology is **not recommended for acute diagnosis** because it requires paired sera and delayed results; it is used mainly for retrospective or epidemiologic purposes [^117WoQtS] [^115tt9dq].

---

## Specimen collection and handling

- **Upper respiratory tract specimens**: Nasopharyngeal swabs are preferred; collect within 4 days of symptom onset for optimal yield [^1178tebu] [^117FP5ta].
- **Lower respiratory tract specimens**: Endotracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage for severe/critical illness or when upper tract tests are negative [^1153Ptam] [^113Uvg8M].
- **Specimen transport**: Use viral transport medium and transport promptly to preserve integrity [^notfound].

---

## Interpretation of test results

| **Test method** | **Positive result** | **Negative result** |
|-|-|-|
| RT-PCR/NAAT | Confirms influenza; high specificity | Does not exclude influenza if pretest probability is high; repeat testing if suspicion persists [^113Uvg8M] |
| RIDT | Confirms influenza; high specificity | Does not exclude influenza; confirm with NAAT if clinical suspicion is high [^1133uBkh] |
| Viral culture | Confirms influenza; high specificity | Slow; not useful for acute management [^113cXfQP] |
| Serology | Not useful for acute diagnosis | Not useful for acute diagnosis [^117WoQtS] |

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring diagnostic testing

- **Hospitalized patients**: All patients with acute respiratory illness during influenza season [^115ZWnfA].
- **High-risk outpatients**: Immunocompromised, elderly, pregnant, chronic conditions [^1148qvac].
- **Outbreaks**: Settings like long-term care facilities, schools, or hospitals [^111Qtp29].
- **Severe illness**: Pneumonia, respiratory failure, or progressive disease [^113Fx7a9].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Test sensitivity**: RIDTs have lower sensitivity, especially in adults and outside peak shedding [^1133uBkh] [^117FP5ta].
- **Timing**: Sampling after 4 days of illness reduces sensitivity; immunocompromised patients may shed longer [^117FP5ta].
- **Coinfections**: Bacterial coinfection is common in severe influenza; interpret results cautiously [^115xdyNA].

---

## Impact of diagnostic testing on clinical management

Early, accurate diagnosis enables timely antiviral therapy, reduces unnecessary antibiotics, and supports infection control. Rapid molecular assays improve detection and guide management in real time [^111k6zio] [^115xdyNA].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

IDSA recommends **molecular assays for hospitalized patients** and for high-risk outpatients; RIDTs are acceptable when NAAT is unavailable, with confirmatory testing as needed [^11676VrU] [^111k6zio]. WHO endorses **rapid molecular assays** and digital immunoassays for suspected influenza, especially in high-risk patients [^114aHgei].

---

Influenza diagnosis integrates clinical suspicion with confirmatory testing; **molecular assays are preferred** for their accuracy and speed, while RIDTs remain useful when NAAT is unavailable. Early, accurate diagnosis enables timely antiviral therapy and infection control, improving outcomes.

How is influenza diagnosed?

Most influenza is diagnosed clinically in the community at times when the virus is known to be circulating. Patients admitted to hospital may have respiratory samples taken for testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), rapid antigen test, or immunofluorescence assay. With respiratory outbreaks in a closed setting (such as care homes, schools, hospitals) nasal swabs may be taken from the first few symptomatic individuals to identify the responsible organism.

Influenza is an acute viral respiratory infection that affects all age groups and is associated with high mortality during pandemics, epidemics, and sporadic outbreaks. Nearly 10% of the world's population is affected by influenza annually, with about half a million deaths each year. Influenza vaccination is the most effective method for preventing influenza infection and its complications. The influenza vaccine's efficacy varies each season based on the circulating influenza strains and vaccine uptake rates. Currently, three antiviral drugs targeting the influenza virus surface glycoprotein neuraminidase are available for treatment and prophylaxis of disease. Given the significant burden of influenza infection globally, this review is focused on the latest findings in the etiology, epidemiology, transmission, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of influenza.

### Influenza: diagnosis and treatment [^111VfEUS]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Influenza is an acute viral respiratory infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Three types of influenza cause disease in humans. Influenza A is the type most responsible for causing pandemics because of its high susceptibility to antigenic variation. Influenza is highly contagious, and the hallmark of infection is abrupt onset of fever, cough, chills or sweats, myalgias, and malaise. For most patients in the outpatient setting, the diagnosis is made clinically, and laboratory confirmation is not necessary. Laboratory testing may be useful in hospitalized patients with suspected influenza and in patients for whom a confirmed diagnosis will change treatment decisions. Rapid molecular assays are the preferred diagnostic tests because they can be done at the point of care, are highly accurate, and have fast results. Treatment with one of four approved anti-influenza drugs may be considered if the patient presents within 48 hours of symptom onset. The benefit of treatment is greatest when antiviral therapy is started within 24 hours of symptom onset. These drugs decrease the duration of illness by about 24 hours in otherwise healthy patients and may decrease the risk of serious complications. No anti-influenza drug has been proven superior. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all people six months and older who do not have contraindications.

### Influenza [^114ooqty]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Annual seasonal influenza epidemics of variable severity caused by influenza A and B virus infections result in substantial disease burden worldwide. Seasonal influenza virus circulation declined markedly in 2020–21 after SARS-CoV-2 emerged but increased in 2021–22. Most people with influenza have abrupt onset of respiratory symptoms and myalgia with or without fever and recover within 1 week, but some can experience severe or fatal complications. Prevention is primarily by annual influenza vaccination, with efforts underway to develop new vaccines with improved effectiveness. Sporadic zoonotic infections with novel influenza A viruses of avian or swine origin continue to pose pandemic threats. In this Seminar, we discuss updates of key influenza issues for clinicians, in particular epidemiology, virology, and pathogenesis, diagnostic testing including multiplex assays that detect influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2, complications, antiviral treatment, influenza vaccines, infection prevention, and non-pharmaceutical interventions, and highlight gaps in clinical management and priorities for clinical research.

Purpose Of Review

To review the clinico-epidemiological aspects of influenza in the context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; the recent advances in point-of-care molecular diagnostics and co-detection of influenza and coronaviruses, and the development of new influenza therapeutics.

Recent Findings

Rates of influenza have declined globally since the 2020–2021 season; waning population immunity and uncertainty in vaccine strains could pose a risk in its significant resurgence, especially where pandemic public health interventions start being lifted. As symptoms are similar for influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, accurate, rapid diagnostics are needed to guide management. In addition to neuraminidase inhibitors, newer class of antivirals including polymerase inhibitors show promise in treating influenza infections in adults, children, and high-risk individuals.

Summary

This review summarizes the most recent data on rapid molecular diagnostics, including point-of-care tests and co-detection of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The implications to inform clinical and infection control practices, and detection of antiviral resistance are discussed. The latest clinical trial data on neuraminidase inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors, their efficacy, limitations, and resistance concerns are reviewed.

### Influenza [^114zaRG5]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Influenza is an acute respiratory illness, caused by influenza A, B, and C viruses, that occurs in local outbreaks or seasonal epidemics. Clinical illness follows a short incubation period and presentation ranges from asymptomatic to fulminant, depending on the characteristics of both the virus and the individual host. Influenza A viruses can also cause sporadic infections or spread worldwide in a pandemic when novel strains emerge in the human population from an animal host. New approaches to influenza prevention and treatment for management of both seasonal influenza epidemics and pandemics are desirable. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, transmission, diagnosis, management, and prevention of seasonal influenza infection. We also review the animal-human interface of influenza, with a focus on current pandemic threats.

### Treat or test first? Decision analysis of empirical antiviral treatment of influenza virus infection versus treatment based on rapid test results [^1127b9Pj]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors have recently become available for treatment of influenza. Rapid antigen detection assays at 'point-of-care' may improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis, but the value of these techniques in assisting with the appropriate use of antivirals remains controversial.

Objective

to compare the diagnostic utilities of two management strategies for influenza, empirical antiviral therapy versus therapy based on a positive rapid test result in pre-epidemic and epidemic periods.

Study Design

a threshold decision analytic model was designed to compare these competing strategies and sensitivity analysis performed to examine the impact of diagnostic variables on the expected utility of the decision with a range of prior probabilities of infection between 1 and 50%.

Results

on the basis of the calculated sensitivity (77%) and specificity (95%) of a point-of-care test for influenza, pre-treatment testing was preferred and cost-effective in non-epidemic stage of the influenza cycle. The alternative strategy of empirical treatment produces a higher utility value during epidemics, but may result in overuse of antivirals for low-risk populations. The two strategies had equivalent efficacy when the probability of influenza was 42%.

Conclusions

Patients with flu-like illness, who present outside the influenza outbreak and are considered to be at low risk for influenza-related complications, should be tested to confirm the diagnosis before starting antiviral treatment with a NA inhibitor. The most important variables in the model were the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis and the pre-test probability of influenza. A threshold probability of influenza of 42% would dictate changing from the rapid testing strategy to a 'treat regardless' strategy.

Regarding medical management for influenza virus infection, more specifically with respect to indications for treatment, IDSA 2018 guidelines recommend to consider initiating antiviral treatment in adult and pediatric patients not at high risk of influenza complications, with documented or suspected influenza, irrespective of influenza vaccination history, meeting any of the following criteria:

- outpatients with illness onset ≤ 2 days before presentation

- symptomatic outpatients who are household contacts of persons at high risk of developing complications from influenza, particularly with severe immunocompromising conditions

- symptomatic healthcare providers caring for patients at high risk of developing complications from influenza, particularly with severe immunocompromising conditions.

### Influenza [^111pAvDd]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The World Health Organisation estimates that approximately one billion people are infected and up to 500 000 people die from influenza each year. The greatest burden of illness usually occurs among children, while the highest burden of severe disease (in terms of hospitalisation and death) occurs in those with underlying medical conditions, infants and young children, and elderly people. Current circulating influenza strains in humans include influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and both influenza B viruses (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata). This article provides non-specialists with information on how to diagnose, manage, and prevent flu.

### Influenza [^112WsYxz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Seasonal influenza epidemics of variable severity pose challenges to public health. Annual vaccination is the primary way to prevent influenza, and a wide range of vaccines are available, including inactivated or live attenuated standard-dose, recombinant vaccines, as well as adjuvanted or high-dose vaccines for persons aged 65 years or older. Persons at increased risk for influenza complications include young children, persons with underlying medical conditions, and older adults. Prompt diagnosis of influenza can facilitate early initiation of antiviral treatment that provides the greatest clinical benefit. This article summarizes recommendations for providers on influenza vaccination, diagnostic testing, and antiviral treatment.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — testing and empiric treatment during community circulation: Confirmation of influenza virus infection by diagnostic testing is not required for decisions to prescribe antiviral medication, and initiation of empiric antiviral treatment should not be delayed while influenza testing results are pending; antiviral treatment is clinically most beneficial when started as close to illness onset as possible. All hospitalized patients with suspected influenza should be tested, and influenza testing may be used to inform decisions on use of antibiotics or continuation of antiviral medication, on need for further diagnostic tests, on consideration for home care, or on recommendations for ill persons living with others who are at high risk for influenza complications; influenza testing may be useful in order to inform decisions in infection control practices. Antiviral treatment is recommended for outpatients with suspected influenza who are at high risk for complications or those with progressive disease not requiring hospital admission, and antiviral treatment of outpatients who are not at high risk can be considered based upon clinical judgment if presenting within 2 days of illness onset.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) seasonal influenza guideline (2018 update) — executive summary epidemiology and clinical impact: Seasonal influenza A and B virus epidemics are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with the seasonal incidence of symptomatic influenza among all ages in the United States during 2010–2016 approximately 8% and varying from 3% to 11%. During 2010–2018 in the United States, seasonal influenza epidemics were associated each year with an estimated 4.3–23 million medical visits, 140 000–960 000 hospitalizations, and 12 000–79 000 respiratory and circulatory deaths, while a modeling study estimated 291 243–645 832 seasonal influenza–associated respiratory deaths annually worldwide. Use of available diagnostic modalities and proper interpretation can accurately identify patients presenting with influenza; timely diagnosis may decrease unnecessary testing and antibiotic use, improve infection prevention and control measures, and increase appropriate antiviral use; early treatment with antivirals reduces symptom duration and the risk of some complications and hospitalization, and may decrease mortality among high-risk populations.

### Role of the laboratory in diagnosis of influenza during seasonal epidemics and potential pandemics [^111BVd5k]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Laboratory diagnosis of influenza is critical to its treatment and surveillance. With the emergence of novel and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, the role of the laboratory has been further extended to include isolation and subtyping of the virus to monitor its appearance and facilitate appropriate vaccine development. Recent progress in enhancing testing for influenza promises to both improve the management of patients with influenza and decrease associated health care costs. The present review covers the technological characteristics and utilization features of currently available diagnostic tests, the factors that influence the selection of such tests, and the developments that are essential for pandemic preparedness.

### Diagnostic testing or empirical therapy for patients hospitalized with suspected influenza: what to do? [^114KJErT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence supports the use of specific diagnostic tests and antiviral therapies for seriously ill patients with influenza. Among available diagnostic tests, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction is faster than culture and more sensitive than commercial antigen assays. Current neuraminidase inhibitors were approved on the basis of their efficacy in ambulatory patients, but seriously ill patients who receive these agents are less likely to die, even when treatment is initiated > 48 h after symptom onset. For patients hospitalized with suspected influenza, it is unclear which circumstances warrant diagnostic testing and which warrant the use of empirical therapy. Rapid antigen assays may reduce the unnecessary use of other tests and medications but are relatively insensitive, thus eliminating many patients with influenza as candidates for treatment. Empirical antiviral therapy ensures that all patients receive treatment promptly, at a cost equivalent to that of diagnostic tests alone, but results in the receipt of treatment by many patients without influenza. For patients hospitalized with suspected influenza, clinicians need to combine these approaches in order to optimize patient care.

Influenza diagnostic testing — indications and test selection: Influenza testing should be performed when the results are anticipated to influence clinical management or public health response, and the decision to test is related to suspicion for influenza, local influenza activity, and the sensitivity and specificity of available influenza tests. The appropriate respiratory tract specimen depends on the approved specimens for the specific test used, patient acceptability, and disease severity, and the choice of test depends on the clinical setting and test performance; clinicians should be aware of the prevalence of influenza viruses in the tested population to inform pretest probability, understand test limitations, and properly interpret results, particularly negative results. Molecular assays that detect influenza virus nucleic acids have the best performance characteristics.

### Influenza virus-related critical illness: prevention, diagnosis, treatment [^113B3nux]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Annual seasonal influenza epidemics of variable severity result in significant morbidity and mortality in the United States (U.S.) and worldwide. In temperate climate countries, including the U.S. influenza activity peaks during the winter months whereas in tropical regions influenza activity may be more variable. Most persons with symptomatic influenza virus infection have self-limited uncomplicated upper respiratory tract illness. One study estimated that during 2010–2016, approximately 8.3% of the U.S. population experienced symptomatic influenza each year. However, complications may result in severe illness, including fatal outcomes. During 2010–2018, an estimated 4.3–23 million medical visits, 140,000–960,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000–79,000 deaths were associated with influenza each year in the U.S. Another study estimated that 18,000–96,000 influenza-related intensive care unit (ICU) admissions occur annually in the U.S. There are an estimated 291,000–646,000 respiratory deaths attributed to seasonal influenza each year worldwide. Here, we review strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of influenza virus infections in the ICU (Table 1).

Simple and rapid diagnosis of influenza is useful for making treatment decisions in the clinical setting. Although many influenza rapid diagnostic tests (IRDTs) are available for the detection of seasonal influenza virus infections, their sensitivity for other viruses, such as H5N1 viruses and the recently emerged swine origin pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, remains largely unknown. Here, we examined the sensitivity of 20 IRDTs to various influenza virus strains, including H5N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses. Our results indicate that the detection sensitivity to swine origin H1N1 viruses varies widely among IRDTs, with some tests lacking sufficient sensitivity to detect the early stages of infection when the virus load is low.

### Correlation between negative rapid influenza diagnostic test and severe disease in hospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection [^112ZimBZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics globally, with significant morbidity and mortality. Novel influenza may cause outbreaks without warning in any place of the world. Awareness is a prerequisite for diagnosis and treatment of this infectious disease that has great public health importance. Although most of the infected only suffer from mild illness, there is a population of patients with severe disease. Patients with severe influenza should get timely antiviral medication as previous observational studies have suggested lower mortality with early diagnosis and antiviral treatment in hospitalized patients. –

The rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) is popular in point-of-care settings as it provides physicians results in a timely fashion. The test is easy to perform and provides results within 30 minutes. A positive test with its high specificity confirms the diagnosis. However, the sensitivity of RIDTs is limited, ranging from 50% to 70% across different clinical settings, including those of critically ill patients. – A negative test with its low sensitivity often misleads physicians to exclude an influenza diagnosis. – The false readings are especially problematic for patients with severe disease, as the chance for timely management with antiviral medication is often missed.

We studied RIDT results among our hospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection. We aimed to evaluate 1) whether a negative RIDT is associated with severity of illness as well as lower respiratory tract symptoms and 2) whether a negative RIDT causes a delay in initiating antiviral treatment.

### Novel avian influenza A virus infections of humans [^115VDHei]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

A high index of suspicion and early diagnosis of avian influenza A virus infection is essential to initiating interventions (antiviral treatment; infection prevention and control measures) as soon as possible to reduce transmission risk from symptomatic persons to close contacts, including health care personnel. Clinical suspicion relies on eliciting a history of recent exposure to poultry or to sick persons with suspected or confirmed avian influenza A virus infection. Diagnosis requires the collection of appropriate respiratory specimens, ideally from the lower respiratory tract when available, for specific testing for seasonal and avian influenza A virus subtypes at specialized public health laboratories. Patients with suspected infection should be isolated immediately and patients with lower respiratory tract disease should be placed on airborne precautions if possible, and NAI antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible even before specific testing results are available. Corticosteroids and salicylates should be avoided and clinical management is focused on supportive care of complications, including nosocomial bacterial or fungal infections. Sporadic human infections with avian influenza A viruses resulting in mild to severe illness are expected to continue to occur in persons with close exposures to infected poultry and other birds. Options to decrease human exposure to enzootic avian influenza include interventions in live poultry markets, which serve as a major source of zoonotic infection and virus amplification. Because zoonotic avian influenza A viruses pose potential pandemic threats, it is important to risk assess these viruses to prioritize countermeasure development such as vaccines.

### Novel avian influenza A virus infections of humans [^114PdKHT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Because the signs, symptoms, and clinical findings are nonspecific, clinical suspicion of avian influenza A virus infection (all subtypes with at least 1 human infection; see Tables 1 and 2) is based on eliciting a history of (1) recent poultry exposure in a virus enzootic region, in particular, visiting a market where live poultry are sold or slaughtered, or at small farms or inside/outside homes (where poultry are raised), or (2) recent close exposure to a symptomatic person with suspected or confirmed avian influenza A virus infection (eg, viruses in which limited human-to-human transmission has been reported, namely, H5N1, H7N7, and H7N9). The optimal respiratory specimens to collect depends on the time from illness onset to presentation, the presumed site of the major pathology and the patient's disease severity. For example, although a nasopharyngeal specimen might be sufficient for detecting some avian influenza A viruses associated with upper respiratory symptoms, a throat swab specimen has a higher yield for detecting H5N1 virus in patients without severe lower respiratory tract disease. For hospitalized patients, the collection of respiratory specimens from multiple respiratory sites, including sputum, can increase the likelihood of detecting avian influenza A virus infection. For critically ill patients with respiratory failure receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, an endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage specimen should be collected for testing.

Commercially available influenza tests available in clinical settings, including molecular assays, detect influenza A and B viruses but do not specifically distinguish between seasonal influenza A viruses circulating among people worldwide and zoonotic avian influenza A viruses. Therefore, respiratory specimens must be sent to a public health laboratory for specific testing for avian influenza A virus subtypes by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (eg, H5, H7, H9) and additional analyses, such as genetic sequencing. Antigen detection tests are less sensitive than reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays for detecting avian influenza A virus infection. Serologic testing of paired acute and convalescent sera can yield a retrospective diagnosis, but must be performed at a specialized public health or research laboratory.

Discharge Criteria

No guidelines exist on discharge criteria for hospitalized patients with avian influenza A virus infection, but key criteria are clinical recovery with demonstration of clearance of viral RNA from the respiratory tract.

Clinicians can consider testing for influenza in patients with acute, febrile respiratory tract illness, especially children and adults who are immunocompromised or at high risk of complications, or if the results might influence antiviral treatment or chemoprophylaxis decisions for high-risk household contacts.

### Delay in diagnosis of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus infection in critically ill patients and impact on clinical outcome [^116jDCif]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study shows important differences in patients diagnosed with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection depending on the speed with which the infection is diagnosed. Late diagnosis of community-acquired influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection is associated with a higher severity of illness, delay in ICU admission, need for therapeutic resources, greater duration of ICU and hospital stay, and, more importantly, higher intra-ICU mortality. The present findings highlight the need during the epidemiological seasons for an early diagnosis of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and prompt antiviral treatment in all hospitalized patients with signs of respiratory infection, independently of other clinical diagnoses.

### Influenza virus-related critical illness: prevention, diagnosis, treatment [^113DbpYq]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Novel influenza A viruses are typically of animal origin, differ antigenically and genetically from currently circulating seasonal influenza A viruses (including H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 subtypes) and have infected at least one person. Novel influenza A viruses can cause a wide clinical spectrum of illness, ranging from asymptomatic infection, uncomplicated illness, to fulminant pneumonia, ARDS, and multi-organ failure and human infection with a novel influenza A virus is of public health concern. In the U.S. human infection with a novel influenza A virus is nationally reportable to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; globally, under the International Health Regulations, countries are required to report such human cases to the World Health Organization. A major concern is the risk of novel influenza A virus transmission among humans; depending upon the prevalence of pre-existing immunity in the population, novel influenza A viruses may have pandemic potential. Patients suspected with novel influenza A virus infection should be investigated for a possible epidemiological link, i.e. a history of recent exposure to poultry or pigs or close contact to an individual with suspected or confirmed novel influenza A virus infection. Novel influenza A virus infection cannot be distinguished from seasonal influenza A virus infection by clinical findings or testing at clinical laboratories and therefore requires specific molecular testing of respiratory specimens by RT-PCR at public health laboratories. Cases of suspected novel influenza A virus infections should be discussed with appropriate local and or national public health and laboratory staff to coordinate the testing of appropriate respiratory specimens.

### Cost-effective respiratory virus testing [^117DjewU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The timely and accurate diagnosis of respiratory virus infections has the potential to optimize downstream (posttesting) use of limited health care resources, including antibiotics, antivirals, ancillary testing, and inpatient and emergency department beds. Cost-effective algorithms for respiratory virus testing must take into consideration numerous factors, including which patients should be tested, what testing should be performed (for example, antigen testing versus reverse transcription-PCR testing or influenza A/B testing versus testing with a comprehensive respiratory virus panel), and the turnaround time necessary to achieve the desired posttesting outcomes. Despite the clinical impact of respiratory virus infections, the cost-effectiveness of respiratory virus testing is incompletely understood. In this article, we review the literature pertaining to the cost-effectiveness of respiratory virus testing in pediatric and adult patient populations, in emergency department, outpatient, and inpatient clinical settings. Furthermore, we consider the cost-effectiveness of a variety of testing methods, including rapid antigen tests, direct fluorescent antibody assays, and nucleic acid amplification tests.

### Is influenza an influenza-like illness? Clinical presentation of influenza in hospitalized patients [^116ZgQii]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Early recognition of influenza virus infection in hospitalized patients can prevent nosocomial transmission.

Objective

To determine the clinical presentation of influenza in hospitalized patients.

Design

Case series. Data were collected retrospectively from medical records and included demographic information, comorbidities, clinical symptoms and signs, microbiologic test results, and outcomes (including pneumonia and intensive care unit [ICU] admission).

Setting

A 1,400-bed teaching hospital.

Patients

A total of 207 inpatients who received a diagnosis of influenza virus infection during 3 seasons from 2000 to 2003.

Results

Over the course of 3 seasons, 207 patients received a diagnosis of influenza (186 were infected with influenza A virus, and 21 were infected with influenza B virus). The most commonly reported symptoms were cough (186 patients [90%]) and subjective fever (137 patients [66%]); 124 patients (60%) had a documented temperature of 37.8 degrees C or greater before influenza was diagnosed. Sore throat was uncommon (44 patients [21%]). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for influenza-like illness (ILI) — temperature 37.8 degrees C or greater and either cough or sore throat — were met by 107 patients (51%). There were no differences in the proportion of patients who met ILI criteria with respect to age, sex, season, influenza virus type, or time to diagnosis in the hospital. Most patients (150 [72%]) received acetaminophen. Only 41 patients (20%) had positive results of clinical cultures; 178 patients (86%) received antibiotic therapy. Fifty-six patients (27%) had pneumonia: 36 (17%) required admission to the ICU, and 25 (12%) required ventilatory support. Patients with pulmonary disease were more likely to require ventilatory support (12 [26%] vs 13 [8%]; p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Only half of hospitalized patients with influenza met CDC criteria for ILI. These criteria may be more appropriate in outpatient settings. A high index of suspicion is needed to recognize influenza in hospitalized patients.

### The clinical utility of point-of-care tests for influenza in ambulatory care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Xn346]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Influenza is a major global disease. The World Health Organization estimates 1 billion infections and half a million deaths from respiratory complications each year. Influenza affects healthcare, society, and the world economy, although often the impact is attributed to other infections such as pneumonia. In the United Kingdom, influenza is responsible for more than half a million primary care consultations and more than 19000 hospital admissions and deaths each year, though they are often not recognized as influenza.

Many respiratory infections cause the same syndrome as influenza; these are referred to as influenza-like illnesses (ILIs). Despite being unable to distinguish clinical features of influenza from other causes of ILI, clinical diagnosis is widespread. Diagnostic uncertainty in ILI contributes to antibiotic prescribing, so diagnostics could improve antimicrobial stewardship. UK guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends no antibiotic prescribing for patients with respiratory tract infections that are likely to be self-limiting, including influenza, unless patients are systemically unwell or at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes. Nonetheless, 14%–40% of patients with influenza are prescribed antibiotics.

Influenza point-of-care tests (POCTs) are specific (> 98%), but rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) have low sensitivity compared to nucleic acid amplification tests (53%–54% vs 92%–95%). Even RADTs offer more accurate diagnoses than clinical evaluation and are fast enough to influence prescribing in ambulatory settings. We cannot assume POCTs will automatically lead to beneficial outcomes. This review aims to collate the available evidence on the impact of point-of-care influenza tests in ambulatory care. We sought to examine clinically relevant impacts, including hospital admissions, antibiotic and antiviral prescribing, and the use of other diagnostic tests.

Seasonal influenza — viral shedding kinetics and timing of specimen collection: In most persons, infectious influenza virus levels in the upper respiratory tract of persons with uncomplicated influenza peak during the first 1–2 days after illness onset, and decline to undetectable levels within 1 week. Collection of upper respiratory tract specimens from immunocompetent outpatients with influenza > 3–4 days after illness onset may yield negative results because of substantially decreased influenza viral shedding, especially in older children and adults, although influenza viruses might be detectable in upper respiratory tract specimens for longer periods in some patients, particularly when molecular assays are used. Infants and young children and adults hospitalized with severe lower respiratory tract illness often shed influenza viruses for ≥ 1 week, and immunocompromised patients may have prolonged influenza virus replication and shed infectious influenza viruses for weeks to months, even when asymptomatic or without fever. The appropriate respiratory tract specimen to collect depends upon which influenza test is used and patient acceptability.

### Clinical diagnosis of influenza in the ED [^1156Ywvk]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Timely and accurate diagnosis of influenza remains a challenge but is critical for patients who may benefit from antiviral therapy. This study determined the test characteristics of provider diagnosis of influenza, final ED electronic medical record (EMR) diagnosis of influenza, and influenza-like illness (ILI) in patients recommended to receive antiviral treatment according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. In addition, we evaluated the compliance with CDC antiviral guidelines.

Methods

A prospective cohort of adults presenting to a tertiary care ED with an acute respiratory illness who met CDC criteria for recommended antiviral treatment were enrolled and tested for influenza. A clinical diagnosis of influenza was assessed by asking the clinician: "Do you think this patient has influenza?" Influenza-like illness was defined according to current CDC criteria.

Results

In this cohort of 270 subjects, 42 (16%; 95% confidence interval, 11%-20%) had influenza. Clinician diagnosis had a sensitivity of 36% (95% CI, 22%-52%) and specificity of 78% (95% CI, 72%-83%); EMR final ED diagnosis had a sensitivity of 26% (95% CI, 14%-42%) and specificity of 97% (95% CI, 94%-99%); ILI had a sensitivity of 31% (95% CI, 18%-47%) and specificity of 88% (95% CI, 83%-92%). Only 15 influenza-positive patients (36%) received antiviral treatment.

Conclusion

Clinician diagnosis, final ED EMR diagnosis, and ILI have low sensitivity for diagnosing influenza, and there is overall poor compliance with CDC antiviral treatment recommendations. Improved methods of influenza diagnosis are needed to help guide management in the clinical setting.

### Influenza virus-related critical illness: pathophysiology and epidemiology [^1115fRvv]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The challenge of diagnosing pneumonia and ARDS in patients with positive laboratory results for influenza relates to the temporality of the clinical events. Influenza virus infection alone can cause severe pneumonia and ARDS, but it can also act in conjunction with a bacterial infection (discussed below). It can precede a pneumonia episode caused by a secondary bacterial infection, most commonly by S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, or can be followed by an episode of nosocomial pneumonia. Clinicians commonly fail to clinically diagnose influenza in up to two-thirds of patients whom have confirmed influenza virus infection. In the case of severe pneumonia or ARDS, the only reliable clue that influenza is a possible causal agent is the presentation during the peak season of the epidemic because the symptomatology alone cannot distinguish severe influenza from other viral or bacterial respiratory infections. Primary influenza pneumonia shows persistence and/or subsequent worsening of respiratory symptoms, while secondary bacterial pneumonia occurs 1–3 weeks as a "relapse" after the initial Influenza symptoms have ended or subsided; however, bacterial co-infection can also occur a few days after the Influenza illness onset. That said, only 5% of all severe pneumonias admitted to the ICU are from a viral etiology.

Regarding medical management for influenza virus infection, more specifically with respect to management of bacterial coinfection, IDSA 2018 guidelines recommend to investigate and empirically treat bacterial coinfection in patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed influenza who present initially with severe disease having extensive pneumonia, respiratory failure, hypotension, and fever, in addition to antiviral treatment for influenza.

### Influenza virus resistance to antiviral agents: a plea for rational use [^113jjc97]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Although influenza vaccine can prevent influenza virus infection, the only therapeutic options to treat influenza virus infection are antiviral agents. At the current time, nearly all influenza A/H3N2 viruses and a percentage of influenza A/H1N1 viruses are adamantane resistant, which leaves only neuraminidase inhibitors available for treatment of infection with these viruses. In December 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new data demonstrating that a high percentage of circulating influenza A/H1N1 viruses are now resistant to oseltamivir. In addition, oseltamivir-resistant influenza B and A/H5N1 viruses have been identified. Thus, use of monotherapy for influenza virus infection is irrational and may contribute to mutational pressure for further selection of antiviral-resistant strains. History has demonstrated that monotherapy for influenza virus infection leads to resistance, resulting in the use of a new monotherapy agent followed by resistance to that new agent and thus resulting in a background of viruses resistant to both drugs. We argue that combination antiviral therapy, new guidelines for indications for treatment, point-of-care diagnostic testing, and a universal influenza vaccination recommendation are critical to protecting the population against influenza virus and to preserving the benefits of antiviral agents.

### Influenza in the emergency department: vaccination, diagnosis, and treatment: clinical practice paper approved by American academy of emergency medicine clinical guidelines committee [^116CiAZm]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Influenza is an acute respiratory virus that results in significant worldwide morbidity and mortality each year. As emergency physicians, we are often the first to encounter patients with seasonal influenza. It is therefore critical that we draw on the most recent and relevant research when we make clinical decisions regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis of this disease.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature search from August 2009 to August 2015 was performed using the keywords influenza vaccination efficacy AND systematic, influenza AND rapid antigen testing, and Oseltamivir AND systematic, while limiting the search to human studies written in the English language. General review articles and case reports were omitted. Each of the selected articles then underwent a structured review.

Results

We identified 163 articles through our literature search, of which 68 were found to be relevant to our clinical questions. These studies then underwent a rigorous review from which recommendations were given.

Conclusions

Influenza vaccine efficacy continues to range between 40% and 80%. Vaccination has the potential to decrease disease severity and is recommended for individuals older than 6 months of age. If resources permit, vaccination can be offered to patients presenting to the emergency department. Rapid antigen detection for influenza is a simple bedside test with high specificity, but generally low sensitivity. If a patient presents with a syndrome consistent with influenza and has negative rapid antigen detection, they should either receive a confirmatory reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or be treated as if they have influenza. Treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors can decrease the duration of influenza and is recommended in hospitalized patients, or in those with high risk of complications.

### Severe flu management: a point of view [^114JtE3w]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Annual flu seasons are typically characterized by changes in types and subtypes of influenza, with variations in terms of severity. Despite remarkable improvements in the prevention and management of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of influenza, annual seasonal influenza continues to be associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Admission to the intensive care unit is required for patients with severe forms of seasonal influenza infection, with primary pneumonia being present in most of the cases. This review summarizes the most recent knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment strategies in critically ill patients with influenza, focused on diagnostic testing methods, antiviral therapy, use of corticosteroids, antibacterial and antifungal therapy, and supportive measures. The review focuses on diagnostic testing methods, antiviral therapy, use of corticosteroids, antibacterial and antifungal therapy, supportive measures and relevant existing evidence, in order to provide the non-expert clinician a useful overview. An enhanced understanding of current diagnostic and treatment aspects of influenza infection can contribute to improve outcomes and reduce mortality among ICU patients with influenza.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^117RDwGm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — vaccination status, immunocompromised hosts, and treatment initiation — Annual influenza vaccination can prevent influenza, but influenza vaccine effectiveness has ranged from low to moderate in preventing medically attended outpatient visits and hospitalizations, and may have lower effectiveness in immunocompromised patients, who may also experience prolonged influenza viral replication. A history of current season influenza vaccination does not exclude a diagnosis of influenza in either immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients. Therefore, antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible in hospitalized patients, high-risk persons, and those with severe or progressive disease if influenza is suspected, irrespective of receipt of influenza vaccine.

### Detecting 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection: availability of diagnostic testing led to rapid pandemic response [^1133q5M4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Diagnostic tests for detecting emerging influenza virus strains with pandemic potential are critical for directing global influenza prevention and control activities. In 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received US Food and Drug Administration approval for a highly sensitive influenza polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Devices were deployed to public health laboratories in the United States and globally. Within 2 weeks of the first recognition of 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed and began distributing a new approved pandemic influenza H1N1 PCR assay, which used the previously deployed device platform to meet a > 8-fold increase in specimen submissions. Rapid antigen tests were widely used by clinicians at the point of care; however, test sensitivity was low (40%-69%). Many clinical laboratories developed their own pandemic influenza H1N1 PCR assays to meet clinician demand. Future planning efforts should identify ways to improve availability of reliable testing to manage patient care and approaches for optimal use of molecular testing for detecting and controlling emerging influenza virus strains.

### Influenza and viral pneumonia [^116KCb7J]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Influenza and other respiratory viruses are commonly identified in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and in immunocompromised patients with pneumonia. Clinically, it is difficult to differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. Similarly, the radiological findings of viral infection are in general nonspecific. The advent of polymerase chain reaction testing has enormously facilitated the identification of respiratory viruses, which has important implications for infection control measures and treatment. Currently, treatment options for patients with viral infection are limited but there is ongoing research on the development and clinical testing of new treatment regimens and strategies.

### Differences in clinical characteristics between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and influenza: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Lnuk2]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The first case occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and COVID-19 quickly spread worldwide, posing great challenges to the health systems of various countries. SARS-CoV-2 shares a 79.6% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV and 51.8% identity with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The latter two pathogens caused regional outbreaks of acute respiratory diseases in 2002–2003 and 2012, respectively, and each disease caused hundreds of deaths –. Influenza virus is an RNA virus that can cause influenza in humans and animals and belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family. This family has four genera; however, only genera A and B are clinically relevant to humans. Influenza has obvious seasonality. The WHO estimates that the annual influenza season usually leads to approximately 3–5 million critical cases and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths. Although influenza often leads to significant mortality and morbidity, the public usually thinks that influenza is a trivial disease, similar to the common cold. In the early stage of the pandemic, COVID-19 was downplayed as only a 'little flu' by some people. There are many similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus in terms of transmission and manifestations, but compared with influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious, and influenza makes diagnosing COVID-19 difficult.

### Evaluation of 11 commercially available rapid influenza diagnostic tests – United States, 2011–2012 [^116anQSa]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of influenza is critical for clinical management, infection control, and public health actions to minimize the burden of disease. Commercially available rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) that detect the influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) antigen are widely used in clinical practice for diagnosing influenza because they are simple to use and provide results within 15 minutes; however, there has not been a recent comprehensive analytical evaluation of available RIDTs using a standard method with a panel of representative seasonal influenza viruses. This report describes an evaluation of 11 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared RIDTs using 23 recently circulating influenza viruses under identical conditions in a laboratory setting to assess analytical performance. Most RIDTs detected viral antigens in samples with the highest influenza virus concentrations, but detection varied by virus type and subtype at lower concentrations. Clinicians should be aware of the variability of RIDTs when interpreting negative results and should collect test samples using methods that can maximize the concentration of virus antigen in the sample, such as collecting adequate specimens using appropriate methods in the first 24–72 hours after illness onset. The study design described in this report can be used to evaluate the performance of RIDTs available in the United States now and in the future.

### Predictors of influenza diagnosis among patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza [^111jkTCP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was performed to determine predictors of clinical influenza diagnosis among patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza.

Methods

Prospective, laboratory-confirmed surveillance for influenza was conducted among patients of all ages who were hospitalized or presented to the emergency department with fever and respiratory symptoms during 2009–2013. We evaluated all enrolled persons who had influenza confirmed by viral culture and/or polymerase chain reaction and received any discharge diagnosis. The primary outcome, clinical influenza diagnosis, was defined as (1) a discharge diagnosis of influenza, (2) a prescription of neuraminidase inhibitor, or (3) a rapid test positive for influenza virus. Bivariate analyses and multiple logistic regression modeling were performed.

Results

Influenza was diagnosed for 29% of 504 enrolled patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza and for 56% of 236 patients with high-risk conditions. Overall, clinical influenza diagnosis was predicted by race/ethnicity, insurance status, year, being hospitalized, having high-risk conditions, and receiving no diagnosis of bacterial infection. Being diagnosed with a bacterial infection reduced the odds of receiving an influenza diagnosis by > 3-fold for all patients and for patients with high-risk conditions.

Conclusions

Many influenza virus-positive patients, including those with high-risk conditions, do not receive a clinical diagnosis of influenza. The pattern of clinical diagnoses among influenza virus-positive patients suggests preferential consideration of bacterial diseases as a diagnosis.

### The host response to infection: advancing a novel diagnostic paradigm [^114Q4bgV]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Capturing the host response by using genomic technologies such as transcriptional profiling provides a new paradigm for classifying and diagnosing infectious disease and for potentially distinguishing infection from other causes of serious respiratory illness. This strategy has been used to define a blood-based RNA signature as a classifier for pandemic H1N1 influenza infection that is distinct from bacterial pneumonia and other inflammatory causes of respiratory disease. To realize the full potential of this approach as a diagnostic test will require additional independent validation of the results and studies to examine the specificity of this signature for viral versus bacterial infection or co-infection.

Seasonal influenza — definitions for surveillance and clinical terms include that influenza season refers to the surveillance period when influenza activity typically occurs, such as during October through May, in the United States; influenza activity is defined as the circulation of seasonal influenza A and B viruses among persons in the local community, with high influenza activity defined as high circulation during the colder fall, winter, and spring months and low influenza activity defined as low or lack of circulation such as during the warm summer months. Acute respiratory illness is defined as infection of either the upper or lower respiratory tract with respiratory symptoms, with or without fever; influenza-like illness (ILI) is defined as acute respiratory illness with fever and either cough or sore throat; influenza refers to symptomatic illness caused by seasonal influenza A or B virus infection; respiratory distress is defined as difficulty in breathing usually associated with an increased respiratory rate and use of accessory muscles of breathing; and laboratory-confirmed influenza is defined as acute respiratory illness with laboratory testing evidence of influenza virus infection.

### Influenza [^114GSBwo]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Influenza is an acute viral respiratory disease that affects persons of all ages and is associated with millions of medical visits, hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, and thousands of deaths during annual winter epidemics of variable severity in the United States. Elderly persons have the highest influenza-associated hospitalization and mortality rates. The primary method of prevention is annual vaccination. Early antiviral treatment has the greatest clinical benefit; otherwise, management includes adherence to recommended infection prevention and control measures as well as supportive care of complications.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — specimen sources and serology: Clinicians should not collect or routinely test specimens for influenza from nonrespiratory sites such as blood, plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and stool (A-III), and should not collect serum specimens, including single or paired sera, for serological diagnosis of seasonal influenza virus infection for clinical management purposes (A-III). Clinicians should not use serologic testing for diagnosis of influenza because results from a single serum specimen cannot be reliably interpreted, and collection of paired (acute/convalescent) sera 2–3 weeks apart are needed for serological testing (A-III).

Test interpretation and immediate management emphasize that the high specificity among most influenza screening tests and molecular assays indicates that the frequency of false-positive results is generally very low, especially when influenza activity is high in the patient population tested, but the potential for a false-positive result is higher when influenza activity is very low and a positive influenza test result in a person without known exposure to influenza during low influenza periods (low positive predictive value) could be a false positive. Collection of additional respiratory specimens for testing of influenza viruses by molecular assays should be considered for outpatients who are at high risk for influenza complications and hospitalized patients with suspected influenza, and antiviral treatment should be started promptly while molecular assay results are pending. Persons who receive live attenuated influenza virus vaccine for intranasal administration can shed influenza vaccine virus strains in the upper respiratory tract for up to 7 days after intranasal vaccination and can test positive during this period. Clinicians should also consider that a positive influenza test result does not exclude bacterial coinfection, and evaluation of the potential need for antibiotics, especially in patients with pneumonia, should be considered.

### Influenza diagnosis and treatment in children: a review of studies on clinically useful tests and antiviral treatment for influenza [^112HLTmm]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Prompt testing for influenza can help guide clinical management of patients with suspected influenza. Three antiviral medications, amantadine, oseltamivir and zanamivir, are approved for treatment of influenza in children. Rimantadine and ribavirin have also been used.

Objectives

To review the published evidence on clinically useful diagnostic tests and antiviral treatment for influenza virus infections in children.

Methods

Studies published from 1966 through September 2002 were reviewed on clinical diagnosis, immunofluorescence and rapid influenza tests and on antiviral treatment of influenza virus infections among pediatric populations.

Results

No studies assessed the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of influenza in children compared with viral culture. Compared with viral culture, direct immunofluorescence antibody and indirect immunofluorescence antibody tests for influenza had fair to moderate median sensitivities and high median specificities, whereas rapid influenza diagnostic tests had moderate median sensitivities and moderately high median specificities. No randomized, placebo-controlled studies were found of amantadine or rimantadine for treatment of influenza A. In a few separate controlled studies, oseltamivir, zanamivir and ribavirin each reduced symptom duration of influenza compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Additional data are needed about the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of influenza in children. Although direct immunofluorescence antibody staining, indirect immunofluorescence antibody staining and rapid tests are moderately to reasonably accurate in detecting influenza virus infections in children, physicians should use clinical judgment and local surveillance data about circulating influenza viruses when interpreting test results. Further controlled studies of the efficacy, adverse effects and emergence of antiviral resistance during treatment of influenza are needed for all of the antiviral drugs.

### Influenza virus-related critical illness: prevention, diagnosis, treatment [^112WdbZk]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Several kinds of influenza diagnostic tests are available in clinical settings with variable sensitivities and specificities, including antigen detection assays, and molecular assays (nucleic acid detection) using respiratory tract specimens (Table 3). Within each of these testing categories, there is a wide range of available tests with varying diagnostic accuracy, and understanding the limitations of each diagnostic tool will allow the clinician to properly interpret their results. Most studies of influenza diagnostic accuracy have been conducted on specimens from patients with uncomplicated influenza, and few have assessed the performance of influenza tests in critically ill patients. The IDSA guidelines recommend molecular influenza assays for testing respiratory specimens from all hospitalized patients with suspected influenza because of their high sensitivity, specificity, and time to results (15 min to several hours). The use of rapid influenza molecular diagnostic testing can result in better outcomes for patients and reduce the amount of resources required to care for patients in the emergency room. Serology and viral culture are not recommended for clinical decision making, because timely results will not be available to inform clinical management. Serology requires collection of appropriately paired acute and convalescent sera performed at specialized public health reference laboratories, and results based upon a single serum specimen are not interpretable. Although viral culture can confirm the presence of infectious virus with very high sensitivity and specificity, it must be performed at public health laboratories and requires 3–10 days to yield results.

Seasonal influenza — extrapulmonary testing and serology are generally not useful for routine diagnosis. Seasonal influenza viruses infect the respiratory tract and typically are not associated with viremia, and except for research purposes or for special patient populations, there is no diagnostic utility to routinely collect whole blood, plasma, or serum specimens for seasonal influenza virus testing by any assay. Influenza viral RNA or infectious virus has rarely been detected in stool and such detection is of unknown clinical importance; therefore, testing of stool for influenza virus is not recommended. For suspected seasonal influenza-associated central nervous system disease, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for influenza is not routinely recommended, and clinicians should test respiratory specimens for influenza if influenza-associated neurologic disease is suspected. For serologic diagnosis, paired acute and convalescent serum specimens must be collected and tested together, there is no validated immunoglobulin M assay or other available serologic assay to diagnose seasonal influenza virus infection in a single serum specimen, and therefore single serum or paired sera specimens should not be collected for influenza serology except for research purposes.

Travel- and exposure-related influenza risk and novel/variant influenza A: During low influenza activity (eg, summer months in the United States), a diagnosis of influenza should be considered for all international travelers or their ill contacts because influenza viruses circulate year-round in the tropics and during winter in temperate climates of the Southern Hemisphere; influenza should also be considered in persons with acute febrile respiratory symptoms who have recently spent time in settings linked to an influenza outbreak including organized tour groups, international mass gatherings, cruise ships, and military ships. Clinicians should consider novel influenza A virus infection in travelers returning from countries with poultry outbreaks who have febrile respiratory symptoms and recent direct or close exposure to poultry; if novel influenza A virus infection is suspected, clinicians should seek prompt consultation with the local and state health departments for possible testing for novel influenza A virus infection, with laboratory confirmation at the CDC. Human infection with swine influenza A viruses is referred to as "variant virus infection", and most human infections occur with recent direct or close contact with pigs, such as at animal exhibits at agricultural fairs.

Influenza antiviral medications are an important adjunct to vaccination in the treatment and prevention of influenza. Treatment with influenza antiviral medications as close to the onset of illness as possible is recommended for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at high risk for influenza complications. Antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible for patients who are at high risk for complications or who are severely ill with suspected influenza infection, even if rapid antigen-detection influenza diagnostic test results are negative.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available online.

### The diagnosis of viral respiratory disease in older adults [^1125NuvM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Viral respiratory disease in older adults has been increasingly recognized as a significant cause of hospitalizations and death. Unfortunately, the recognition and diagnosis of infection due to many viral respiratory pathogens in older adults can be elusive because of atypical clinical presentations and the insensitivity of current laboratory diagnostic tests in this population. For influenza diagnosis, rapid antigen tests followed by viral culture (if antigen test results are negative), can be useful in older adults as long as clinicians are mindful of test limitations. Although specific, rapid antigen tests are insensitive in this population. Erroneous negative results may lead to delays in timely administration of antiviral treatment and institution of appropriate isolation precautions. The increasing availability of new, rapid, and sensitive molecular diagnostics, such as polymerase chain reaction testing, should provide more accurate and timely diagnoses of viral respiratory infections in older adults in the near future.

### Current regulatory landscape for viral point-of-care testing in the United States [^112u8rcM]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Historically, the diagnosis of viral infections has been accomplished using a combination of laboratory-based methods, including culture, serology, antigen-based tests, and molecular (e.g., real-time PCR) assays. Although these methods provide an accurate way to detect viral pathogens, testing in a centralized laboratory may delay results, which could impact patient diagnosis and management. Point-of-care tests, including antigen- and molecular-based assays, have been developed to assist with the timely diagnosis of several viral infections, such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and COVID-19. Despite the ability of point-of-care tests to provide rapid results (i.e., < 30 min), there are issues to consider prior to their routine use, including test performance and specific regulatory requirements. This review will provide a summary of the regulatory landscape of point-of-care tests for viral infections in the United States, and address important considerations such as site certification, training and inspection readiness.

Rapid influenza antigen tests — use and result interpretation by influenza activity: For rapid influenza diagnostic test antigen detection (immunoassay or immunofluorescence assay), sensitivity is low to moderate and specificity is high, and these tests should not be used for testing of patients with progressive illness and hospitalized patients. When influenza activity is low, a negative result has high negative predictive value and is likely to be a true-negative if an upper respiratory tract specimen was collected < 4 days after illness onset, while a positive result has low positive predictive value, is likely to be a false-positive result, and should be confirmed with a molecular assay. When influenza activity is high, a negative result has low negative predictive value, may be a false-negative result especially if an upper respiratory tract specimen was collected > 4 days after illness onset, cannot exclude influenza virus infection, antiviral treatment should not be withheld if clinically indicated, and confirmation with a molecular assay is advised; a positive result has high positive predictive value and is likely to be a true-positive result.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^114bdov1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Evidence summary — Although clinical diagnosis during influenza outbreaks has reasonable sensitivity and specificity, laboratory testing should be performed when the results may influence clinical management or infection prevention and control (IPC) decisions. Influenza testing is recommended for all hospitalized patients during influenza season with acute respiratory illness including pneumonia, respiratory failure, or exacerbation of a chronic condition (eg, asthma, coronary artery disease, COPD) and for immunocompromised patients with any of the above or nonspecific respiratory symptoms or unexplained fever. A test confirming influenza may reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics (especially if the procalcitonin level is low, suggesting that bacterial infection is unlikely) and improve antibiotic stewardship. One randomized clinical trial (RCT), performed at medical wards of 2 teaching hospitals in the United Kingdom, found no evidence that reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for influenza influenced antibiotic prescribing or clinical outcome in adult patients; however, few study patients with RT-PCR–confirmed influenza were prescribed antiviral treatment, and the authors suggested this was in part due to the length of illness prior to admission (> 48 hours) or unfamiliarity by physicians with RT-PCR.

### Overview of influenza testing methods… [^114SFfPv]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know
- Influenza virus testing is not required to make a clinical diagnosis of influenza in outpatients with suspected influenza.
- Influenza virus testing is recommended for all patients with suspected influenza who are being admitted to hospital.
- Clinicians should understand the limitations of influenza virus tests and how to properly interpret the results, particularly negative results.
- Diagnostic tests available for detection of influenza viruses in respiratory specimens include molecular assays and antigen detection tests. Types of tests Diagnostic tests available for detection of influenza viruses in respiratory specimens include molecular assays and other nucleic acid amplification tests); and antigen detection tests.

Viral culture is important for public health purposes, but does not provide timely results to inform clinical management. These assays can yield results in approximately 45 minutes to several hours depending upon the assay. Notably, the detection of influenza viral RNA or nucleic acids by these assays does not necessarily indicate detection of viable infectious virus or on-going influenza viral replication. It is important to note that not all assays have been cleared by the FDA for diagnostic use. Some multiplex molecular assays are available that can detect influenza viral nucleic acids and distinguish influenza virus infection from other respiratory pathogens and may also be useful for management of severely immunosuppressed patients, or for use in identifying the cause of an institutional outbreak of respiratory illness.

Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Tests Rapid influenza diagnostic tests are antigen detection assays that can detect influenza viral antigens in 10–15 minutes with moderate sensitivity and high specificity. Some tests are CLIA-waived and approved for use in any outpatient setting, whereas others must be used in a moderately complex clinical laboratory. Some RIDTs utilize reader device to standardize results to improve sensitivity. FDA now requires RIDTs to achieve 80% sensitivity. Detection of influenza virus antigen does not necessarily indicate detection of viable infectious virus or on-going influenza viral replication. Immunofluorescence Immunofluorescence assays are antigen detection assays that generally require use of a fluorescent microscope to produce results in approximately 2–4 hours with moderate sensitivity and high specificity.

Both direct and indirect fluorescent antibody staining assays are available to detect influenza A and B viral antigens in respiratory tract specimens.

### Information on rapid molecular assays, RT-PCR, and other… [^116Xffxp]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Rapid molecular assays are molecular influenza diagnostic tests that can detect seasonal influenza viral RNA or nucleic acids in upper respiratory tract specimens in approximately 15–30 minutes. One platform uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification and has high sensitivity, and yields results in 15 minutes or less. Other platforms use RT-PCR and produce results in approximately 20–30 minutes. Some multiplex molecular assays are able to detect and discriminate between infections with influenza A and B viruses; other tests can also identify specific seasonal influenza A virus subtypes, for example Apdm09, or A. FDA-cleared rapid molecular assays can provide results in 15–30 minutes, and some are CLIA-waived for point-of-care use. Other molecular assays can provide results in 45–80 minutes or several hours, depending upon the assay.

Some FDA-cleared multi-pathogen molecular assays are available that can detect seasonal influenza A and B viruses and other respiratory pathogens. Influenza Testing of Hospitalized Patients
- Hospitalized patients with suspected influenza without lower respiratory tract disease should have upper respiratory tract specimens collected for influenza testing by a molecular influenza assay. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends use of RT-PCR or other molecular assays for detection of influenza viruses in respiratory specimens of hospitalized patients. Consult IDSA Influenza Clinical Practice Guidelines for recommendations on influenza testing and information on interpretation of testing results.
- Clinicians and laboratorians using molecular assays that are capable of detecting all currently circulating seasonal influenza A virus subtypes, for example Apdm09, or A. and who identify an "unsubtypeable" result, should contact their state or local public health laboratory immediately for additional testing to determine if the infection is due to a novel influenza A virus.
- Influenza molecular assay interpretation will depend on the individual test that is performed. For example, a negative result from an influenza molecular assay that only detects influenza A virus and the Apdm09 subtype does not preclude infection with influenza B virus. Clinicians can consult the package insert for detailed description of each FDA-cleared test and what the result may or may not signify.
- A positive result indicates detection of influenza viral RNA or nucleic acids in the respiratory specimen tested, confirming influenza virus infection, but does not necessarily mean infectious virus is present or that the patient is contagious.

Background Molecular assays available for detecting influenza virus infection include rapid molecular assays, Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction, and other nucleic acid amplification tests. These tests can detect influenza viral RNA or nucleic acids in respiratory specimens with high sensitivity and high specificity. Notably, the detection of influenza viral RNA or nucleic acids by molecular assays does not necessarily indicate detection of viable virus or on-going influenza viral replication. __Antiviral Drugs, Information for Health Care Professionals__. Some molecular assays are able to detect and discriminate between infections with influenza A and B viruses; other tests can also identify specific seasonal influenza A virus subtypes, for example Apdm09, or A. FDA-cleared rapid molecular assays can provide results in 15–30 minutes, and some are CLIA-waived for point-of-care use.

Consult the IDSA Influenza Clinical Practice Guidelines for recommendations on influenza testing and information on interpretation of testing results.
- Collection of lower respiratory tract specimens from hospitalized patients with suspected influenza and pneumonia can be considered for influenza testing by RT-PCR and other molecular assays if influenza testing of upper respiratory tract specimens is negative and if positive testing would result in a change in clinical management. Hospitalized patients with suspected influenza and respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation can have an endotracheal aspirate specimen collected for influenza testing by RT-PCR if a laboratory diagnosis of influenza has not been determined.
- Clinicians and laboratorians using molecular assays that are capable of detecting all currently circulating seasonal influenza A virus subtypes, for example Apdm09, or A. and who identify an "unsubtypable" result, should contact their state or local public health laboratory immediately for additional testing to determine if the infection is due to a novel influenza A virus.
