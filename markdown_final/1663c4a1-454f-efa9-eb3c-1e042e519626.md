## Question

45 yo F with chronic migraines and a history of "strange muscle spasms after certain medications" is admitted for severe UTI. She reports dysuria and fever (T 38.4°C), BP 122/74, HR 89. Allergic to penicillin (rash). Urine culture pending. Medical intern recommends starting IV ciprofloxacin.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether IV ciprofloxacin is appropriate empiric therapy for a 45-year-old woman with a severe UTI, a penicillin allergy history described as a rash, and a history of "strange muscle spasms" after certain medications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and severity to decide whether IV therapy is warranted. Then, I should verify the penicillin allergy phenotype and cross-reactivity with cephalosporins to see if a β-lactam is still an option. Next, I will evaluate the patient's neuromuscular symptom history against fluoroquinolone safety risks. After that, I need to check guideline-concordant empiric choices for severe UTI and local resistance constraints. Finally, I will outline a safer, evidence-based plan and specify dosing and monitoring if a fluoroquinolone is unavoidable, while confirming culture-directed de-escalation steps [^45cf5fbf] [^2e391f2e].

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture and severity. Fever, dysuria, and systemic symptoms in a hospitalized patient support a complicated UTI or pyelonephritis, for which IV therapy is appropriate until the patient stabilizes and can take oral agents, with a typical total duration of 7 days if improving and 10–14 days if slow response or complicating factors are present, so IV therapy is reasonable initially [^45cf5fbf] [^2e391f2e].

> Wait, let me verify the penicillin allergy phenotype before excluding β-lactams. A non-anaphylactic rash to penicillin carries a very low risk of cross-reactivity with third-generation cephalosporins, and contemporary guidance allows use of structurally dissimilar R1-side-chain cephalosporins without prior testing in many such patients, so ceftriaxone remains a first-line option for severe UTI unless there is a convincing history of anaphylaxis or a severe cutaneous adverse reaction [^ff904f5f] [^41667e4e] [^ce26ceb5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about fluoroquinolones. I need to check the patient's neuromuscular history against fluoroquinolone risks. "Strange muscle spasms" after medications raises concern for drug-induced neuromuscular adverse effects, and fluoroquinolones carry boxed warnings for disabling and potentially permanent musculoskeletal and neurologic adverse effects, including tendinopathy, tendon rupture, and peripheral neuropathy; they can also exacerbate myasthenia gravis and cause CNS effects, so in a patient with prior neuromuscular symptoms, I should avoid fluoroquinolones unless there is no safer alternative and the benefit clearly outweighs the risk [^357e92e4] [^0c19a982] [^6cf641c3].

> I should confirm guideline-preferred empiric therapy for severe UTI in a patient with a non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy. Ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV every 24 hours is a first-line choice for severe UTI and pyelonephritis, with alternatives including cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, or an aminoglycoside depending on severity, local resistance, and risk factors; fluoroquinolones are not preferred empirically due to safety concerns and resistance, and should be reserved for specific scenarios or when no better options exist [^45cf5fbf] [^0f5be0b1].

> But wait, what if cephalosporins are not an option due to a high-risk penicillin allergy phenotype or prior severe reaction? In that case, aztreonam is a reasonable β-lactam alternative for severe UTI with a true β-lactam allergy, and it avoids the cross-reactivity seen with cephalosporins; I should also consider local resistance patterns and add an aminoglycoside if Pseudomonas risk is present or if the patient is critically ill [^8d299936] [^45cf5fbf].

> I need to ensure we address stewardship and resistance. Fluoroquinolones should be avoided when possible due to collateral damage and rising resistance; if a fluoroquinolone is ultimately required, I should confirm local susceptibility and use the narrowest effective agent and duration, with close monitoring for adverse effects and a low threshold to discontinue if neuropsychiatric or musculoskeletal symptoms emerge [^eb6d1dac] [^6cf641c3].

> Let me reconsider the intern's suggestion of IV ciprofloxacin. Given the patient's prior neuromuscular symptoms and the availability of safer, guideline-concordant β-lactam options, empiric IV ciprofloxacin is not the best choice here; I should recommend ceftriaxone as first-line unless the allergy history truly contraindicates it, with aztreonam as an alternative if needed, and then tailor therapy to culture results with an early IV-to-oral switch when stable [^45cf5fbf] [^2e391f2e].

> If, despite these concerns, a fluoroquinolone is absolutely necessary, I should double-check dosing and safety counseling. For severe UTI, ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV every 8–12 hours is acceptable, but I must counsel on tendon pain, neuropathy symptoms, and CNS effects, and stop the drug immediately if such symptoms occur; I should also monitor renal function and adjust dosing in impairment, and prefer the shortest effective total duration with early switch to oral therapy when feasible [^361144a6] [^357e92e4] [^2e391f2e].

> Next, I should review the immediate action plan. Start ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV every 24 hours now, obtain urinalysis and blood cultures if febrile or systemically ill, and reassess at 48–72 hours to de-escalate based on culture and susceptibility; if the patient cannot tolerate β-lactams, use aztreonam and consider adding an aminoglycoside if severe or Pseudomonas is suspected, while avoiding fluoroquinolones given the neuromuscular history and safety profile [^45cf5fbf] [^0f5be0b1] [^8d299936].

---

The intern's plan to start **IV ciprofloxacin** is **not appropriate** because the patient has a history of "strange muscle spasms", which raises concern for fluoroquinolone-associated neuromuscular adverse effects, and ciprofloxacin is **contraindicated in patients with prior fluoroquinolone-associated serious adverse reactions**. Additionally, ciprofloxacin is not first-line for severe UTI due to safety concerns and rising resistance; **ceftriaxone is preferred** given the non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy, with aztreonam as an alternative if beta-lactams are not tolerated. If a fluoroquinolone is absolutely necessary, monitor closely for neuromuscular symptoms and discontinue immediately if they occur [^357e92e4] [^45cf5fbf].

---

## Clinical assessment of the patient's condition

The patient presents with **severe UTI symptoms**, including dysuria and fever (T 38.4°C), indicating a complicated UTI or pyelonephritis. Her vital signs are stable (BP 122/74 mmHg, HR 89 bpm), suggesting no immediate hemodynamic instability. She has a reported penicillin allergy characterized by a rash, indicating a non-anaphylactic reaction. Additionally, she reports a history of "strange muscle spasms" after certain medications, which raises concern for potential drug-induced neuromuscular adverse effects.

---

## Evaluation of the intern's recommendation: IV ciprofloxacin

### Pharmacological considerations

Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic commonly used for complicated UTIs due to its broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative pathogens, including Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The **recommended IV dosage** for complicated UTIs is 200–400 mg every 8–12 hours for 7–14 days [^361144a6].

---

### Safety concerns: neuromuscular adverse effects

Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, are associated with **serious adverse effects**, including:

- **Tendinitis and tendon rupture**: Particularly in patients over 60 years old, those on corticosteroids, or with renal impairment [^a6ab7090].
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Potentially irreversible [^357e92e4].
- **Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis**: Contraindicated in patients with known myasthenia gravis [^357e92e4].
- **Central nervous system effects**: Seizures, confusion, and psychosis [^6cf641c3].

Given the patient's history of "strange muscle spasms", there is a legitimate concern for potential **fluoroquinolone-induced neuromuscular adverse effects**, even if she does not have a diagnosed myasthenia gravis. The FDA has issued warnings about these serious adverse effects, emphasizing the need to reserve fluoroquinolones for cases in which no alternative options are available [^6cf641c3].

---

### Allergy considerations

The patient has a reported penicillin allergy characterized by a rash, which is a non-anaphylactic reaction. Cross-reactivity between penicillins and fluoroquinolones is **negligible**, so the penicillin allergy does not directly contraindicate ciprofloxacin use. However, the presence of any drug allergy warrants caution and careful monitoring for adverse reactions.

---

## Guideline recommendations and evidence-based alternatives

Current guidelines and expert consensus recommend **reserving fluoroquinolones** for cases in which no safer alternatives are available due to their significant adverse effect profile. For severe UTIs, particularly in hospitalized patients, **first-line therapy** typically includes:

- **Third-generation cephalosporins**: Such as ceftriaxone, which are effective against most uropathogens and have a favorable safety profile [^0f5be0b1].
- **Aztreonam**: A monobactam antibiotic suitable for patients with beta-lactam allergies, including penicillin allergy [^8d299936].
- **Aminoglycosides**: Such as gentamicin, often used in combination with beta-lactams for severe infections or when beta-lactams are contraindicated [^ccadc5c0].

Given the patient's non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy, **ceftriaxone is a reasonable first-line option** because cross-reactivity with third-generation cephalosporins is low (approximately 1–3%) [^ff904f5f]. If beta-lactams are contraindicated, aztreonam is a suitable alternative [^8d299936].

---

## Risk-benefit analysis

| **Factor** | **Ciprofloxacin (iv)** | **Ceftriaxone (iv)** |
|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | Effective against most uropathogens | Effective against most uropathogens |
| Safety | - Significant risk of neuromuscular adverse effects <br/> - Tendinitis <br/> - Tendon rupture <br/> - Peripheral neuropathy | Favorable safety profile; minimal neuromuscular adverse effects |
| Allergy considerations | No significant cross-reactivity with penicillins | Low cross-reactivity (1–3%) with penicillins |
| Guideline recommendation | Reserved for cases with no alternatives | First-line therapy for severe UTIs |

---

Given the patient's history of muscle spasms and the availability of safer alternatives, the risks of IV ciprofloxacin outweigh the benefits in this scenario.

---

## Recommended course of action

Based on the clinical assessment, safety considerations, and guideline recommendations, the following course of action is recommended:

- **Discontinue the plan to start IV ciprofloxacin** due to potential neuromuscular adverse effects.
- **Initiate IV ceftriaxone** 1–2 g every 24 hours as first-line therapy for severe UTI, considering the patient's non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy [^0f5be0b1].
- **Monitor closely** for any allergic reactions or adverse effects during therapy.
- **Adjust antibiotic therapy** based on urine culture and sensitivity results once available [^45cf5fbf].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The intern's recommendation to start **IV ciprofloxacin** is **not appropriate** given the patient's history of muscle spasms and the potential for serious neuromuscular adverse effects associated with fluoroquinolones. Ceftriaxone is the preferred first-line therapy for severe UTI in this patient, with aztreonam as an alternative if beta-lactams are contraindicated. If a fluoroquinolone is absolutely necessary, the patient should be closely monitored for neuromuscular symptoms, and the drug should be discontinued immediately if any adverse effects occur [^357e92e4].

Self-treatment with antibiotics for recurrent UTI — Self-treatment can be paired with standing physician orders for urine culture before and possibly after treatment, but compared with continuous prophylaxis it is associated with a higher rate of infection (2.2 UTI per year vs 0.2 UTI per year). Self-treatment is an option for women with the ability to reliably recognize UTI symptoms and start antibiotics, those not suitable for long-term prophylaxis, or those who do not wish to take long-term therapy, and patients should contact their clinician if symptoms progress or fail to resolve within 48 hours. Fluoroquinolones are not preferred agents for self-treatment regimens, and we recommend use of other agents whenever possible.

### Penicillin allergy as an instrumental variable for estimating antibiotic effects on resistance [^9454bdba]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Antibiotics are vital in combating bacterial infections, yet their effectiveness is diminishing due to increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR), partly stemming from overuse and misuse. The susceptibility of an infection to antibiotics is typically determined through microbiological testing, a process that can take several days. Consequently, a common scenario contributing to antibiotic misuse arises when patients are treated with antibiotics before the causative pathogen and its AMR profile are identified — an approach known as empiric therapy. Once antibiotic susceptibility results are available, they are reported as minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) — the minimum concentration of an antibiotic required to inhibit the growth of the pathogen — or categorized into susceptible, intermediate, or resistant groups based on established MIC thresholds. To enhance the responsible prescription of antibiotics, guidelines have been developed that facilitate treatment decisions based on anticipated pathogens, resistance profiles, and related healthcare costs of different antibiotics.

AMR arises from both individual and population-level antibiotic use. At the population level, the overall volume and patterns of antibiotics play a significant role in driving resistance, as resistant pathogens spread between individuals. At the individual level, antibiotic use selects for infection and colonization with resistant bacterial strains. In recent years, there has been a growing focus on the potential of different antibiotics to induce future resistance on an individual level. For example, quinolones, previously the primary choice for urinary tract infections and community-acquired pneumonia, are now often disfavored due to their high potential for resistance induction.

Nonetheless, a significant gap in current research is the lack of quantitative, causal assessments of the risk of future resistance caused by different antibiotics. Randomized control trials, the benchmark for causal effect estimation, present logistical difficulties in this context, including limited patient follow-up and the requirement for numerous studies to address various clinical scenarios and antibiotic combinations. Consequently, ranking of antibiotics by their collateral resistance cost is often reached by expert opinion –. Alternatively, cohort studies aimed at evaluating the effects of antibiotics are susceptible to numerous confounding mechanisms that undermine the causal validity of their results.

Patient considerations for selection of antimicrobial agent — allergies and adverse reactions: Clinicians should review drug allergies and intolerances before prescribing antibiotics for a UTI and should not readminister an antibiotic in patients with previously severe reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome unless essential for survival; allergy desensitization may be considered for challenging resistance. Table guidance distinguishes side effect (undesirable pharmacological effect at recommended doses), adverse drug reaction (any noxious or unintended reaction to a drug administered in appropriate doses by the proper route, with infrequent examples including fever, vomiting, erythema, dermatitis, angioedema, seizures, pseudomembranous colitis), and allergy (immunologically mediated with specificity and recurrence on reexposure; Type I immediate hypersensitivity [IgE mediated], Type II cytotoxic reactions [IgG and IgM mediated], Type III immune complex reactions [IgG and IGM mediated], Type IV T cell–mediated reactions), with examples including anaphylaxis, drug-induced hemolytic anemia, post–streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and contact dermatitis; clinicians are advised to educate patients on these differences, and patients can be referred to an allergist for drug allergy testing, noting that recurrence risk of type I hypersensitivity reactions is substantial.

Conclusions

Our results support the assumption of non-inferiority of ibuprofen as compared to ciprofloxacin for treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTI. By all means, this approach needs to be followed further by an adequately powered trial. If our results could be confirmed, one should consider modified treatment recommendations towards symptomatic treatment of uncomplicated UTI.

Second-line antimicrobial agents — when first-line medications are not available or cannot be prescribed — include β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, and "Randomized trial evidence suggests that the effectiveness of 3-day cefpodoxime or TMP-SMX is comparable at 89.4% vs 100%". However, "Generally, cephalosporins have a lower cure rate than TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones", and "β-lactams, like cephalexin, can also be used if first-line antibiotics are inappropriate for any reason". Although "3-day fluoroquinolone regimens (eg, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are highly efficacious, they are not first-line agents because of increasing resistance, higher expense, and serious adverse events as described in a 2016 Food and Drug Administration warning". Fosfomycin pharmacokinetics are noted as "resulting in urine levels that persist for 30 to 40 hours", and "When there is greater than 20% local E. coli resistance to TMP-SMX, an alternative treatment should be given".

### Management of patients with a history of allergy to β-lactam antibiotics [^f7ce356a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of penicillin allergy pose a treatment dilemma. Unnecessary avoidance of this relatively nontoxic class of drugs exposes the patient to potentially more toxic drugs, increases health care costs, and contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. Yet for those who truly have allergy or other serious adverse reactions to beta-lactams, the use of alternate drugs is a must.

Acute UTI with complicating factors — Women with rUTI who have complicating factors, such as abnormal genitourinary anatomy, immunosuppression, and chronic catheterization, require additional vigilance in diagnosis and management. Initial empiric therapy until culture results are available to guide therapy (consider only if local resistance < 20%) can include a fluoroquinolone (eg, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), an aminopenicillin plus a β-lactam inhibitor, a cephalosporin group 3a (parenteral), or an aminoglycoside. For empirical treatment in severe cases or initial failure, options include a fluoroquinolone (if not used for initial therapy), piperacillin plus a β-lactam inhibitor, a cephalosporin group 3b (parenteral), or a carbapenem. Not recommended for empirical treatment are aminopenicillins (eg, ampicillin, amoxicillin, bacampicillin), TMP-SMX, and fosfomycin trometamol.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children — empiric therapy and limited fluoroquinolone role — emphasizes cephalosporins for uncomplicated cases and restricts fluoroquinolones to severe presentations. Standard empiric therapy for uncomplicated UTI in the pediatric population continues to be a cephalosporin antibiotic agent, because TMP-SMX– and amoxicillin-resistant E coli are increasingly common. The fluoroquinolones remain potential first-line agents only in the setting of pyelonephritis or complicated UTI.

2. Dosage and Administration

Ciprofloxacin tablets should be administered orally as described in the appropriate Dosage Guidelines tables.

2.1 Dosage in Adults

The determination of dosage and duration for any particular patient must take into consideration the severity and nature of the infection, the susceptibility of the causative microorganism, the integrity of the patient's host-defense mechanisms, and the status of renal and hepatic function. Ciprofloxacin tablets may be administered to adult patients when clinically indicated at the discretion of the physician.

Table 1: Adult Dosage Guidelines

1. Generally ciprofloxacin should be continued for at least 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared, except for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure).

2. Used in conjunction with metronidazole.

3. Begin drug administration as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure.

Conversion of IV to Oral Dosing in Adults

Patients whose therapy is started with ciprofloxacin IV may be switched to ciprofloxacin tablets when clinically indicated at the discretion of the physician (Table 2) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

Table 2: Equivalent AUC Dosing Regimens

2.2 Dosage in Pediatric Patients

Dosing and initial route of therapy (that is, IV or oral) for cUTI or pyelonephritis should be determined by the severity of the infection. Ciprofloxacin tablets should be administered as described in Table 3.

The initial empiric therapy for these patients should include an agent with a broad spectrum of activity against the expected uropathogens. Treatment most often includes a fluoroquinolone, administered orally if possible. In patients who are unable to tolerate oral medication or who require hospitalization for concomitant medical problems, appropriate initial therapy may be parenteral administration of one of the following: a third-generation cephalosporin with antipseudomonal activity such as ceftazidime or cefoperazone., cefepime, aztreonam, imipenemcilastatin or the combination of an antipseudomonal penicillin with an aminoglycoside. Enterococci are frequently encountered uropathogens in complicated UTIs. In areas in which vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium is prevalent, the investigational agent quinupristindalfopristin may be useful.
20.

Patients who are too ill to take oral antibiotics or who are unable to take them should initially be treated with parenterally administered single agents, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a third-generation cephalosporin, aztreonam, a broad-spectrum penicillin, a quinolone or an aminoglycoside. The choice of antibiotic is largely empiric, but Gram staining of the urine may be helpful. Once these patients have improved clinically, they can be switched to oral therapy based on the results of culture and sensitivity studies. 28, 29 Most pregnant women with pyelonephritis should be hospitalized. Initially, these patients should receive intravenous antibiotic therapy. They should complete a 14-day course of acute antibiotic therapy followed by nightly suppressive therapy until delivery.

Recent studies have shown that selected pregnant women with pyelonephritis can be treated with either outpatient intramuscularly administered ceftriaxone or orally administered cephalexin. 28 Ceftriaxone, a third-generation parenterally administered cephalosporin, is a suitable agent for inpatient treatment. Tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones should be avoided in pregnancy.

4. 1 Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions to amoxicillin, clavulanate or to other beta‑lactam antibacterial drugs. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea/loose stools, nausea, skin rashes and urticaria, vomiting and vaginitis. Less than 3% of patients discontinued therapy because of drug‑related adverse reactions. The overall incidence of adverse reactions, and in particular diarrhea, increased with the higher recommended dose. Other less frequently reported adverse reactions include: Abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and headache. A total of 575 patients were enrolled, and only the suspension formulations were used in this trial.

Overall, the adverse reactions seen were comparable to that noted above; however, there were differences in the rates of diarrhea, skin rashes/urticaria, and diaper area rashes. Immune: Hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, serum sickness-like reactions, hypersensitivity vasculitis. Renal: Interstitial nephritis, hematuria, and crystalluria have been reported. Hemic and Lymphatic Systems: Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.

3 Allopurinol The concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving amoxicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of amoxicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.

### Fosfomycin Vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^b1ace86d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

This study has some limitations. First, the study was terminated before the planned sample size was reached. Yet, noninferiority of fosfomycin for the primary end point was demonstrated so that the results support the use of fosfomycin for this indication. Continuation of the trial until the planned sample size would have provided more precision for the secondary end points. Second, the current study was performed in settings with low levels of antibiotic resistance, and practices in other countries may differ in the broadness of empirical antibiotic treatment, duration on IV treatment, and IV–oral switch. Nevertheless, eligibility was conditional on susceptibility to both fosfomycin and ciprofloxacin. Therefore, we consider our findings, that is, noninferiority of fosfomycin to ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment, valid in such settings for fosfomycin-susceptible isolates. Third, for feasibility and safety reasons, we used a treatment duration of 10 days for all patients, even though 7 days of ciprofloxacin has been demonstrated to be sufficient for treatment of acute pyelonephritis and gram-negative bacteremia. Last, implementation of fosfomycin use for step-down treatment requires reliable susceptibility testing. The MIC of E. coli to fosfomycin, as measured with automated panel tests, seems to correlate poorly with clinical and microbiological efficacy of fosfomycin for the empirical treatment of cystitis. Future improvements in routine fosfomycin susceptibility testing possibly affect the targeted use of fosfomycin, although theoretically it would lead to a higher of fosfomycin efficacy.

In conclusion, this trial demonstrates that fosfomycin 3g every 24 hours as targeted step-down treatment for E. coli fUTIs in women is noninferior to ciprofloxacin with regard to clinical cure. Fosfomycin is an additional oral antibiotic option for this indication, especially in cases of resistance, intolerance, or allergies to existing options.

What if I receive a sample of Proquin XR from my healthcare provider?

This sample contains only one dose for the first day of treatment of Proquin®XR and is not a complete treatment. To treat your bladder infection, you must take all 3 daily doses of Proquin®XR. You must fill a prescription from your healthcare provider for the remaining two daily doses before your next scheduled dose. Take all of your doses as prescribed by your healthcare provider, even if you are feeling better after the first dose. If you stop taking Proquin®XR before all of your doses are complete, Proquin®XR may not cure your bladder infection. It is not known if Proquin®XR will treat infections other than bladder infections. See also " How should I take Proquin XR? "

How should I take Proquin XR?

Take Proquin®XR exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider.
Proquin®XR should be taken by mouth one time each day for 3 days
Take Proquin®XR with your main meal of the day, preferably the evening meal. Try to take Proquin®XR at about the same time each day.
Swallow Proquin®XR whole. Do not split, crush, or chew Proquin®XR. Tell your healthcare provider if you cannot swallow the tablets whole. Your healthcare provider will prescribe a different medicine for you.
Drink plenty of fluids while taking Proquin®XR.
Do not take Proquin®XR at the same time that you drink milk or juices with added calcium, unless you drink them with a main meal.
Proquin®XR does not work as well if you take it without a meal.
Do not skip any doses, or stop taking Proquin®XR even if you begin to feel better, until you finish your prescribed treatment, unless:
you have tendon effects (see " What is the most important information I should know about Proquin XR? ")
you have a serious allergic reaction (see " What are the possible side effects of Proquin XR? "), or
your healthcare provider tells you to stop.
This will help make sure that all of the bacteria are killed and lower the chance that the bacteria will become resistant to Proquin®XR. If this happens, Proquin®XR and other antibiotic medicines may not work in the future.
Tell your healthcare provider if you do not feel better or if you get fever and back pain, while you are taking Proquin®XR or after you finish taking it. This may mean that your infection has not been cured and you may need another antibiotic medicine to treat your infection.
If you miss a dose of Proquin®XR, take it as soon as your remember. Do not take more than one Proquin®XR tablet a day, even if you miss a dose.
If you take too much, call your healthcare provider or get medical help immediately.

14. Clinical Studies

14.1 Complicated Urinary Tract Infection and Pyelonephritis-Efficacy in Pediatric Patients

Ciprofloxacin administered intravenously and/or orally was compared to a cephalosporin for treatment of cUTI and pyelonephritis in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age (mean age of 6 ± 4 years). The trial was conducted in the U.S. Canada, Argentina, Peru, Costa Rica, Mexico, South Africa, and Germany. The duration of therapy was 10 to 21 days (mean duration of treatment was 11 days with a range of 1 to 88 days). The primary objective of the study was to assess musculoskeletal and neurological safety.

Patients were evaluated for clinical success and bacteriological eradication of the baseline organism(s) with no new infection or superinfection at 5 to 9 days post-therapy (Test of Cure or TOC). The Per Protocol population had a causative organism(s) with protocol specified colony count(s) at baseline, no protocol violation, and no premature discontinuation or loss to follow-up (among other criteria).

The clinical success and bacteriologic eradication rates in the Per Protocol population were similar between ciprofloxacin and the comparator group as shown below.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infection has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have changed. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infection; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

### Appropriate antibiotic treatment of genitourinary infections in hospitalized patients [^01e3a0d3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The etiology of urinary tract infections (UTIs) that require hospitalization, whether they originate in the hospital or in the community, is changing, with increasing findings of gram-positive organisms. The Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) criteria recommend evaluating treatment choices on the basis of sound clinical evidence, potential for therapeutic benefits, safety, optimal duration of treatment, and cost-efficacy in order to improve antibiotic treatment. Evidence-based guidelines recommend fluoroquinolones for the treatment of patients with cases of pyelonephritis or bacterial prostatitis severe enough to warrant hospitalization. For other serious UTIs, fluoroquinolones are usually recommended either when traditional agents have failed or when resistance to traditional agents is high. Even in the context of rapidly changing antimicrobial resistance patterns, the fluoroquinolones have maintained consistent, well-tolerated efficacy against many of the principal organisms responsible for UTIs, and are generally considered safe for most patients. To increase the likelihood of treatment success with first-line therapy, an antimicrobial agent must attain sufficient concentrations in the target tissue or in the urine for an appropriate amount of time. Both levofloxacin and gatifloxacin are excreted unchanged in the urine in concentrations that far exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration of most uropathogens. Factors that affect cost-effectiveness that should be considered include acquisition costs as well as treatment success and ease of use for hospital staff.

### Taking a rational approach to a reported antibiotic allergy [^ad49e8a0]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Up to 10% of hospitalized patients have an antibiotic allergy label in their medical file, most frequently concerning penicillins. However, the vast majority of reported allergies to antibiotics does not represent a "true" allergy but are due to drug intolerance, idiosyncratic reactions or symptoms of the concurrent infectious disease. Since antibiotic allergy labels result in deviation from first-choice antimicrobial therapy, tackling the issue of incorrect antibiotic allergy labelling, already at young age, is a core element of antibiotic stewardship. In this article, we describe the structured approach to the patient with a presumed antibiotic allergy with emphasis on key elements of allergy-specific history taking and the limited risk of cross-allergic reactions between beta-lactam subclasses.

4. Worsening of myasthenia gravis (a problem that causes muscle weakness). Fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin tablets may cause worsening of myasthenia gravis symptoms, including muscle weakness and breathing problems. Tell your healthcare provider if you have a history of myasthenia gravis before you start taking ciprofloxacin tablets. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any worsening muscle weakness or breathing problems.

What are ciprofloxacin tablets?

Ciprofloxacin tablets are a fluoroquinolone antibacterial medicine used in adults age 18 years and older to treat certain infections caused by certain germs called bacteria. These bacterial infections include:

urinary tract infection
chronic prostate infection
lower respiratory tract infection
sinus infection
skin infection
bone and joint infection
nosocomial pneumonia
intra-abdominal infection, complicated
infectious diarrhea
typhoid (enteric) fever
cervical and urethral gonorrhea, uncomplicated
people with a low white blood cell count and a fever
inhalational anthrax
plague

Studies of ciprofloxacin tablets for use in the treatment of plague and anthrax were done in animals only, because plague and anthrax could not be studied in people.
Ciprofloxacin tablets should not be used in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, acute uncomplicated cystitis, and sinus infections, if there are other treatment options available.
Ciprofloxacin tablets should not be used as the first choice of antibacterial medicine to treat lower respiratory tract infections caused by a certain type of bacterial called Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Ciprofloxacin tablets are also used in children younger than 18 years of age to treat complicated urinary tract and kidney infections or who may have breathed in anthrax germs, have plague or have been exposed to plague germs.
Children younger than 18 years of age have a higher chance of getting bone, joint, or tendon (musculoskeletal) problems such as pain or swelling while taking ciprofloxacin tablets. Ciprofloxacin tablets should not be used as the first choice of antibacterial medicine in children under 18 years of age.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^2e391f2e]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI — In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy. An effective antimicrobial agent means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

Direct treatment approach for ceftriaxone — third-generation cephalosporins in low-risk histories: Among persons with confirmed IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, the level of cross-reactivity with third-generation cephalosporins is low. If a patient has a low-risk history for an IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, ambulatory settings often treat with third-generation cephalosporins without further testing. Low-risk history includes one nonspecific symptom (e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, fatigue, or nonurticarial rash), and examples listed in Box 2 include gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, pruritis without rash, localized rash, delayed onset rash (> 24 hours), symptoms unknown, family history of penicillin or another drug allergy, and a recorded allergy the patient denies. In addition, a family history of penicillin or β-lactam allergy alone is not a contraindication for treatment with β-lactam antibiotics.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Ciprofloxacin tablets should be administered orally as described in the appropriate Dosage Guidelines tables.

2.1 Dosage in Adults

The determination of dosage and duration for any particular patient must take into consideration the severity and nature of the infection, the susceptibility of the causative microorganism, the integrity of the patient's host-defense mechanisms, and the status of renal and hepatic function.

Ciprofloxacin tablets may be administered to adult patients when clinically indicated at the discretion of the physician.

Table 1: Adult Dosage Guidelines

* Generally ciprofloxacin should be continued for at least 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared, except for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure).

†Used in conjunction with metronidazole.

‡Begin drug administration as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure.

Conversion of IV to Oral Dosing in Adults

Patients whose therapy is started with ciprofloxacin IV may be switched to ciprofloxacin tablets when clinically indicated at the discretion of the physician (Table 2) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Table 2: Equivalent AUC Dosing Regimens

2.2 Dosage in Pediatric Patients

Dosing and initial route of therapy (that is, IV or oral) for cUTI or pyelonephritis should be determined by the severity of the infection. Ciprofloxacin should be administered as described in Table 3.

Table 3: Pediatric Dosage Guidelines

* The total duration of therapy for cUTI and pyelonephritis in the clinical trial was determined by the physician. The mean duration of treatment was 11 days (range 10 to 21 days).

†Begin drug administration as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure.

‡Begin drug administration as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to Y. pestis.

### The use of systemic and topical fluoroquinolones [^9ac8ac5c]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Fluoroquinolones in pediatrics — approvals and scope indicated that "the parenteral fluoroquinolones were appropriate for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens for which no alternative safe and effective parenteral agent existed", and "for outpatient management, oral fluoroquinolones were only indicated when other options were intravenous (IV) treatment with other classes of antibiotic agents". Quinolones currently approved for pediatric patients and "available in an IV and oral suspension formulation are ciprofloxacin for the indications of inhalational anthrax, plague, complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), and pyelonephritis and levofloxacin for the indications of inhalational anthrax and plague"; this review "will contain no discussion of the use of fluoroquinolones in infants younger than 6 months".

Recommendations — contraindications to testing and β-lactam use: Persons with a history of severe adverse cutaneous reaction (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis) and other severe non–IgE-mediated reactions (e.g., interstitial nephritis or hemolytic anemia) are not candidates for penicillin skin testing or challenge. Penicillin and any other β-lactam antibiotics should be avoided indefinitely among these patients, who should be referred to an allergy center for further evaluation. Patients who deny penicillin allergy but report previous IgE-type reactions to cephalosporins should be referred to an allergist for specific cephalosporin testing.

### Practical aspects of choosing an antibiotic for patients with a reported allergy to an antibiotic [^ea47b77a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Physicians often must select antibiotics for patients who are reported to have an antibiotic allergy. For penicillins, the sensitivity of penicillin skin testing for predicting serious allergic reactions is excellent. For other beta-lactam antibiotics, penicillin skin testing is useful for excluding the possibility of sensitivity to the beta-lactam ring. For other antibiotics, the patient history remains the most useful tool for determining whether a serious reaction is likely to occur with further drug exposure. The cross-reactivity between penicillins and second- or third-generation cephalosporins (excluding cefamandole) is probably no higher than is the cross-reactivity between penicillins and other classes of antibiotics. When a patient has a suspected immunoglobulin E-mediated antibiotic allergy, desensitization therapy should be considered, if the efficacy of alternate antibiotics is in doubt. For the treatment of serious infections, it is usually possible to safely administer the antibiotic of choice despite a history of possible antibiotic allergy.

### FDA warning about fluoroquinolones and risk of aortic ruptures or tears [^6cf641c3]. ACOG (2019). High credibility.

FDA warning about fluoroquinolones — U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance advises against prescribing systemic fluoroquinolones to patients who have other treatment options for bacterial infections, including uncomplicated urinary tract infections, because the risks outweigh the benefits in these patients. Potential risks associated with fluoroquinolone use include hypoglycemic coma, certain adverse mental health effects, disabling and potentially permanent adverse effects to the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system, peripheral neuropathy, and tendinitis and tendon rupture. The FDA is continuing to assess safety issues with fluoroquinolones as part of its ongoing review of drugs and will provide updates if additional actions are needed, and refers readers to the FDA's Fluoroquinolone Antimicrobial Drugs Information page for more information.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (proquin) [^767af160]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Proquin XR is indicated only for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms listed below. Proquin XR is not interchangeable with other ciprofloxacin extended-release or immediate release oral formulations. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for specific recommendations.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF PROQUIN XR IN TREATING PYELONEPHRITIS, COMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS, AND INFECTIONS OTHER THAN UNCOMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED. Alternative therapy should be considered for patients who remain symptomatic or develop fever and back pain while on treatment with Proquin XR.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Proquin XR and other antibacterial drugs, Proquin XR should only be used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and sensitivity information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Penicillin and beta-lactam hypersensitivity [^5f369bee]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Ten percent of patients report penicillin allergy, but more than 90% of these individuals can tolerate penicillins. Skin testing remains the optimal method for evaluation of possible IgE-mediated penicillin allergy and is recommended by professional societies, as the harms for alternative antibiotics include antimicrobial resistance, prolonged hospitalizations, readmissions, and increased costs. Removal of penicillin allergy leads to decreased utilization of broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones and vancomycin. There is minimal allergic cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins. IgE-mediated allergy to cephalosporins is usually side-chain specific and may warrant graded challenge with cephalosporins containing dissimilar R1 or R2 group side chains.

### Fosfomycin Vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^9257d061]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Procedures

Baseline variables at admission and randomization were collected using participant questionnaires and from the electronic patient file (Supplemental Material, Protocol S1). Patients were assigned (1:1) to an IV–oral switch to fosfomycin–trometamol every 24 hours as a powder for solution, equivalent to 3g fosfomycin, or ciprofloxacin 0.5g every 12 hours as capsules. Patients received an identical placebo for both active substances to ensure blinding (double-dummy). The duration of antimicrobial treatment was set at 10 days that consisted of 2–5 days empirical IV treatment and the remaining 5–8 days oral study treatment.

Patients were asked to register the intake of study medication and the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) in a paper diary. A physical appointment was planned 6–10 days after study treatment was finished to assess early end points and to collect urine; a telephone appointment at 30–35 days was set to assess late end points. At inclusion and during both follow-up meetings, structured questionnaires were obtained regarding urinary tract and systemic symptoms, antimicrobial use, health status, and healthcare consumption.

Outcomes

The primary end point was clinical cure at days 6–10 post-end of treatment (PET). Clinical cure was defined as being alive with reduction of all initial local and systemic fUTI-related symptoms, without the requirement of additional antibiotic therapy for UTI (except for antibiotic prophylaxis). In case of an indwelling catheter, local symptoms were not counted. According to this definition, patients who did not meet the criteria for early clinical cure could do so for late clinical cure and vice versa. Secondary end points included microbiological cure at days 6–10 PET and clinical cure, relapse, reinfection, no additional antibiotic therapy for presumed UTI, and AEs at days 30–35 PET. Microbiological cure was defined as a negative urine culture for E. coli (< 10³ CFU/mL) with an identical antibiotic resistance profile as the initially cultured E. coli. Microbiological cure was only established in patients who did not use additional antibiotic treatment. Definitions and criteria of all secondary end points are specified in the protocol (Supplementary Material, Protocol S1).
