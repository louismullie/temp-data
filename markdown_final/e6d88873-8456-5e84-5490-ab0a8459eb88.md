## Question

Best topical treatment for tinea corporis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best topical treatment for tinea corporis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and scope of tinea corporis. Then, I should appraise the evidence hierarchy and identify the highest-quality sources. Next, I will extract and compare efficacy data for specific topical agents. After that, I need to weigh safety, tolerability, and stewardship considerations. Finally, I will integrate guideline recommendations and outline a practical, patient-centered recommendation with contingencies for special scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope so I don't jump to conclusions. Tinea corporis is a superficial dermatophyte infection of glabrous skin, typically treated with topical therapy unless disease is extensive, refractory, or involves hair-bearing sites where systemic therapy may be needed, so I should keep both topical and escalation pathways in mind as I evaluate options [^b29f50e0] [^5de2211d].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy to anchor the strength of recommendations. The Cochrane systematic review of 129 randomized controlled trials with 18,086 participants is the highest-quality source for topical therapy comparisons, though many individual studies are old and at high or unclear risk of bias, so I need to interpret pooled estimates cautiously while still prioritizing them over lower-level evidence [^33d684f9] [^3e4c41e7]. Contemporary guidelines from AAFP 2025 provide high-credibility, practice-oriented recommendations and will help me reconcile evidence quality with real-world care [^b29f50e0] [^f2adabfc].

> I will now examine the most robust efficacy signals from the Cochrane review. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and direction of benefit. Terbinafine showed significantly higher clinical cure versus placebo with a risk ratio around 4.51 and a number needed to treat of about 3, though the evidence quality was rated low due to risk of bias and imprecision, which still supports a clinically meaningful benefit signal for allylamines [^33d684f9] [^3e4c41e7]. Naftifine also demonstrated superiority to placebo for mycological cure with a risk ratio near 2.38 and an NNT around 3, again with low-quality evidence but consistent directionality favoring allylamines over placebo [^33d684f9] [^3e4c41e7]. Clotrimazole showed benefit versus placebo as well, reinforcing that azoles are effective, though head-to-head class comparisons often show minimal differences between azoles and allylamines in pooled analyses [^33d684f9] [^f809fce9].

> Hold on, I should verify comparative effectiveness across classes rather than assume allylamine superiority. The Cochrane review found no statistically significant difference in mycological cure between azoles and benzylamines, and substantial heterogeneity precluded pooling for several allylamine versus azole comparisons, suggesting broadly similar efficacy across classes even though allylamines may have a theoretical pharmacologic advantage due to fungicidal activity and shorter courses [^33d684f9] [^3e4c41e7]. Let me reconsider the practical implication: while allylamines may achieve comparable outcomes faster, the highest-quality synthesis does not demonstrate a consistent, clinically decisive superiority of one class over another, so agent selection should balance efficacy, duration, tolerability, and stewardship [^33d684f9] [^3e4c41e7].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability to ensure the recommendation is balanced. Across topical antifungals, adverse effects are generally mild and infrequent, typically limited to local irritation, burning, or pruritus, with no consistent safety advantage of one class over another in pooled analyses, which supports the favorable risk–benefit profile of topical therapy for localized tinea corporis [^33d684f9] [^f809fce9]. I should double-check that this aligns with FDA safety summaries for commonly used agents like naftifine and luliconazole, which likewise report low rates of mostly mild local reactions, reinforcing the safety conclusion [^21b033ff].

> I need to ensure I incorporate guideline direction that reflects both evidence and stewardship. AAFP 2025 recommends a 2-week trial of topical antifungal therapy without corticosteroid for suspected tinea corporis when diagnostic testing is impractical, with follow-up to document improvement, and explicitly advises avoiding combination antifungal–corticosteroid products due to risks of masking, atrophy, and treatment failure, which is a critical stewardship point I must emphasize [^b29f50e0] [^f2adabfc]. The CDC also advises against steroid creams for ringworm, aligning with this stance and supporting monotherapy selection [^b4067e11].

> Let me think about practical, patient-centered choices and durations. Allylamines such as terbinafine 1% or naftifine 1–2% offer short, once-daily courses of about 1–2 weeks, which can improve adherence, while azoles like clotrimazole, ketoconazole, oxiconazole, or luliconazole typically require 2–4 weeks of once- or twice-daily application; luliconazole 1% has FDA-labeled 7-day courses for tinea corporis, which can be attractive for convenience, though comparative superiority is not firmly established [^b3c4c5ed] [^27cd681f] [^1b86c7d6] [^54c8ed91]. I should confirm that extending therapy about one week beyond clinical clearing reduces recurrence, a principle reflected in older guidance and consistent with antifungal pharmacodynamics, so I will include that in the plan [^534a24c9].

> But wait, what if the infection is extensive, inflamed, or refractory to appropriate topical therapy. I should confirm escalation triggers: widespread disease, immunocompromise, or failure after a correctly executed topical trial warrant systemic therapy, with oral terbinafine or itraconazole as common options depending on species and severity, noting that itraconazole has RCT data supporting dose-response in tinea corporis/cruris, though higher doses carry more cost and similar relapse rates, so dose selection should be individualized [^5de2211d] [^a47fc229]. I also need to keep antifungal resistance in mind, particularly Trichophyton indotineae, where first-line terbinafine failure is increasingly reported; in such cases, species identification and susceptibility testing, when available, can guide alternative systemic choices and combination strategies [^e58711cb] [^5895fe91].

> I should double-check special populations and formulations. For children, topical therapy remains first-line for tinea corporis, and pediatric RCTs support the safety and efficacy of naftifine 2% cream applied once daily for 2 weeks, with low adverse event rates comparable to vehicle, which supports using standard pediatric dosing and duration with appropriate follow-up [^43c8fd6f] [^1615e2c5]. For patients with prominent inflammation, I initially thought a combination steroid–antifungal might help symptoms, but hold on, I should verify guideline positions: AAFP and CDC advise against routine use of topical corticosteroids in tinea because of masking, atrophy, and potential to worsen infection, so I should correct that impulse and avoid combination products unless a dermatologist directs a very short, carefully monitored course for a specific indication [^f2adabfc] [^b4067e11].

> Putting this together, my best-supported recommendation is to use a topical allylamine such as terbinafine 1% once daily for 1–2 weeks or naftifine 1–2% once daily for 2 weeks as preferred first-line therapy for localized tinea corporis, extending treatment about one week after clinical clearing to reduce recurrence, and reserving azoles like clotrimazole, ketoconazole, oxiconazole, or luliconazole as acceptable alternatives when allylamines are unavailable, contraindicated, or not tolerated, recognizing broadly similar efficacy across classes and choosing shorter-duration options like luliconazole 1% for 7 days when adherence is a concern [^b3c4c5ed] [^27cd681f] [^33d684f9] [^b29f50e0]. I need to ensure I reinforce avoidance of combination antifungal–corticosteroid creams, arrange follow-up to confirm improvement by 2 weeks, and escalate to systemic therapy if disease is extensive, refractory, or in immunocompromised hosts, with consideration of resistance patterns in nonresponders [^f2adabfc] [^b29f50e0] [^e58711cb].

---

The best topical treatment for tinea corporis is **terbinafine 1% once daily for 7 days** [^b3c4c5ed] because it achieves high mycological and clinical cure rates with a short, convenient course and low adverse effects [^33d684f9]. Alternatives with similar efficacy include **naftifine 1–2% for 2 weeks** [^1615e2c5] and **luliconazole 1% for 7 days** [^27cd681f] [^20e1a1cc]. Azoles (clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole) are effective but typically require 2–4 weeks [^1b86c7d6] and have lower cure rates than allylamines [^notfound]. Avoid combination corticosteroid creams [^f2adabfc] due to risk of masking, relapse, and complications [^d07d2fd3] [^eebb5851]. Choose based on availability, cost, and patient preference, and extend treatment 1 week after clearance to reduce recurrence [^534a24c9].

## Comparative efficacy of topical antifungal agents

Several classes of topical antifungals are available, including allylamines, azoles, and benzylamines. Comparative studies and systematic reviews provide insight into their relative efficacy:

| **Agent** | **Efficacy** | **Treatment duration** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Terbinafine 1% | High mycological and clinical cure rates | 7 days | Fungicidal; short course; low adverse effects [^33d684f9] [^b3c4c5ed] |
| Naftifine 1–2% | High mycological and clinical cure rates | 14 days | Fungicidal; anti-inflammatory; low adverse effects [^1615e2c5] [^43c8fd6f] |
| Luliconazole 1% | High mycological and clinical cure rates | 7 days | Short course; low adverse effects [^27cd681f] [^20e1a1cc] |
| Clotrimazole 1% | Moderate efficacy | 14–28 days | Widely available; low cost [^1b86c7d6] [^8ed0b4cf] |
| Ketoconazole 2% | Moderate efficacy | 14–28 days | Available OTC; low cost [^1b86c7d6] [^e6383eca] |
| Miconazole 2% | Moderate efficacy | 14–28 days | Widely available; low cost [^b4067e11] |

---

Allylamines (terbinafine, naftifine) are generally considered **more effective than azoles** due to their fungicidal activity and shorter treatment duration [^c665b9f1]. Terbinafine 1% applied once daily for 7 days achieves high mycological and clinical cure rates, making it the preferred first-line treatment [^b3c4c5ed].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting terbinafine

Terbinafine 1% cream applied once daily for 7 days has been extensively studied and demonstrates **high efficacy and safety** [^b3c4c5ed]. A Cochrane review found terbinafine significantly increased clinical cure rates compared to placebo (risk ratio [RR] 4.51, 95% CI 3.10–6.56) [^33d684f9]. It is also well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects such as local irritation or burning [^33d684f9].

---

## Alternative topical treatments

While terbinafine is the preferred first-line treatment, **alternatives include**:

- **Naftifine 1–2%**: Applied once daily for 2 weeks, naftifine demonstrates high efficacy and anti-inflammatory properties, making it suitable for inflamed lesions [^1615e2c5] [^43c8fd6f].
- **Luliconazole 1%**: Applied once daily for 7 days, luliconazole is a newer azole with high efficacy and a short treatment duration [^27cd681f] [^20e1a1cc].
- **Azoles (clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole)**: These agents are effective but typically require longer treatment durations (2–4 weeks) and have lower cure rates compared to allylamines [^1b86c7d6] [^8ed0b4cf].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment choice should be individualized based on **patient-specific factors**, including:

- **Severity and extent of infection**: Extensive or inflamed lesions may benefit from allylamines due to their anti-inflammatory properties and shorter treatment duration [^c665b9f1].
- **Patient preference**: Convenience, cost, and availability of medication influence adherence and satisfaction [^notfound].
- **Previous treatment response**: Recurrent or refractory infections may require alternative agents or combination therapy [^5de2211d].

---

## Importance of adherence and proper application

Adherence to prescribed treatment and proper application techniques are critical for optimal outcomes. Patients should apply medication to the **affected area and a 1–2 cm margin of healthy skin** [^b29f50e0], and continue treatment for at least one week after clinical clearance to prevent recurrence [^534a24c9].

---

## Potential side effects and precautions

Topical antifungal agents are generally well tolerated, but **local irritation, burning, or allergic reactions** may occur. Patients should discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider if severe reactions occur. Combination corticosteroid creams should be avoided due to risks of masking symptoms, promoting relapse, and causing skin atrophy [^f2adabfc] [^d07d2fd3].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Terbinafine 1% applied once daily for 7 days is the **best topical treatment** for tinea corporis due to its high efficacy, short treatment duration, and favorable safety profile [^b3c4c5ed]. Alternative options such as naftifine 1–2% for 2 weeks or luliconazole 1% for 7 days are also effective [^1615e2c5] [^27cd681f]. Treatment choice should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, adherence, and cost considerations.

### Topical antifungal treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis [^33d684f9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea infections are fungal infections of the skin caused by dermatophytes. It is estimated that 10% to 20% of the world population is affected by fungal skin infections. Sites of infection vary according to geographical location, the organism involved, and environmental and cultural differences. Both tinea corporis, also referred to as 'ringworm' and tinea cruris or 'jock itch' are conditions frequently seen by primary care doctors and dermatologists. The diagnosis can be made on clinical appearance and can be confirmed by microscopy or culture. A wide range of topical antifungal drugs are used to treat these superficial dermatomycoses, but it is unclear which are the most effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antifungal treatments in tinea cruris and tinea corporis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 13th August 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. We handsearched the journal Mycoses from 1957 to 1990.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with proven dermatophyte infection of the body (tinea corporis) or groin (tinea cruris).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, and analyses.

Main Results

Of the 364 records identified, 129 studies with 18,086 participants met the inclusion criteria. Half of the studies were judged at high risk of bias with the remainder judged at unclear risk. A wide range of different comparisons were evaluated across the 129 studies, 92 in total, with azoles accounting for the majority of the interventions. Treatment duration varied from one week to two months, but in most studies this was two to four weeks. The length of follow-up varied from one week to six months. Sixty-three studies contained no usable or retrievable data mainly due to the lack of separate data for different tinea infections. Mycological and clinical cure were assessed in the majority of studies, along with adverse effects. Less than half of the studies assessed disease relapse, and hardly any of them assessed duration until clinical cure, or participant-judged cure. The quality of the body of evidence was rated as low to very low for the different outcomes. Data for several outcomes for two individual treatments were pooled. Across five studies, significantly higher clinical cure rates were seen in participants treated with terbinafine compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 4.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.10 to 6.56, number needed to treat (NNT) 3, 95% CI 2 to 4). The quality of evidence for this outcome was rated as low. Data for mycological cure for terbinafine could not be pooled due to substantial heterogeneity. Mycological cure rates favoured naftifine 1% compared to placebo across three studies (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.14, NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 4) with the quality of evidence rated as low. In one study, naftifine 1% was more effective than placebo in achieving clinical cure (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.41 to 4.16, NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 5) with the quality of evidence rated as low. Across two studies, mycological cure rates favoured clotrimazole 1% compared to placebo (RR 2.87, 95% CI 2.28 to 3.62, NNT 2, 95% CI 2 to 3). Data for several outcomes were pooled for three comparisons between different classes of treatment. There was no difference in mycological cure between azoles and benzylamines (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07). The quality of the evidence was rated as low for this comparison. Substantial heterogeneity precluded the pooling of data for mycological and clinical cure when comparing azoles and allylamines. Azoles were slightly less effective in achieving clinical cure compared to azole and steroid combination creams immediately at the end of treatment (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.84, NNT 6, 95% CI 5 to 13), but there was no difference in mycological cure rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.05). The quality of evidence for these two outcomes was rated as low for mycological cure and very low for clinical cure. All of the treatments that were examined appeared to be effective, but most comparisons were evaluated in single studies. There was no evidence for a difference in cure rates between tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Adverse effects were minimal - mainly irritation and burning; results were generally imprecise between active interventions and placebo, and between different classes of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

The pooled data suggest that the individual treatments terbinafine and naftifine are effective. Adverse effects were generally mild and reported infrequently. A substantial number of the studies were more than 20 years old and of unclear or high risk of bias; there is however, some evidence that other topical antifungal treatments also provide similar clinical and mycological cure rates, particularly azoles although most were evaluated in single studies. There is insufficient evidence to determine if Whitfield's ointment, a widely used agent is effective. Although combinations of topical steroids and antifungals are not currently recommended in any clinical guidelines, relevant studies included in this review reported higher clinical cure rates with similar mycological cure rates at the end of treatment, but the quality of evidence for these outcomes was rated very low due to imprecision, indirectness and risk of bias. There was insufficient evidence to confidently assess relapse rates in the individual or combination treatments. Although there was little difference between different classes of treatment in achieving cure, some interventions may be more appealing as they require fewer applications and a shorter duration of treatment. Further, high quality, adequately powered trials focusing on patient-centred outcomes, such as patient satisfaction with treatment should be considered.

### Evidence-based topical treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis: a summary of a cochrane systematic review [^3e4c41e7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Tinea cruris and tinea corporis are common fungal infections. Most can be treated with a variety of topical antifungals. This review aimed to assess the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of topical treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Searches included the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, LILACS and ongoing trials registries (August 2013). One hundred and twenty-nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 18 086 participants evaluated a range of interventions - mostly azoles. Pooling of data for several outcomes was only possible for two individual treatments. In five studies, terbinafine showed a statistically significant higher clinical cure rate compared with placebo [risk ratio (RR) 4·51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3·10–6·56]. Data for mycological cure could not be pooled owing to substantial heterogeneity. Across three studies, mycological cure rates favoured naftifine (1%) compared with placebo (RR 2·38, 95% CI 1·80–3·14) but the quality of the evidence was low. Combinations of azoles with corticosteroids were slightly more effective than azoles for clinical cure, but there was no statistically significant difference with regard to mycological cure. Sixty-five studies were assessed as 'unclear' and 64 as being at 'high risk' of bias; many were over 20 years old, and most were poorly designed and inadequately reported. Although most active interventions showed sufficient therapeutic effect, this review highlights the need for further, high-quality, adequately powered RCTs to evaluate the effects of these interventions, which can ultimately provide reliable evidence to inform clinical decision making.

### Diagnosis and management of tinea infections [^b29f50e0]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for tinea corporis, more specifically with respect to topical antifungals, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to consider initiating a 2-week trial of topical antifungal therapy (without a corticosteroid component), for suspected tinea corporis when diagnostic testing or dermatology referral is impractical. Ensure follow-up to document improvement.

### Topical treatment of common superficial tinea infections [^534a24c9]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Tinea infections are superficial fungal infections caused by three species of fungi collectively known as dermatophytes. Commonly these infections are named for the body part affected, including tinea corporis (general skin), tinea cruris (groin), and tinea pedis (feet). Accurate diagnosis is necessary for effective treatment. Diagnosis is usually based on history and clinical appearance plus direct microscopy of a potassium hydroxide preparation. Culture or histologic examination is rarely required for diagnosis. Treatment requires attention to exacerbating factors such as skin moisture and choosing an appropriate antifungal agent. Topical therapy is generally successful unless the infection covers an extensive area or is resistant to initial therapy. In these cases, systemic therapy may be required. Tinea corporis and cruris infections are usually treated for two weeks, while tinea pedis is treated for four weeks with an azole or for one to two weeks with allylamine medication. Treatment should continue for at least one week after clinical clearing of infection. Newer medications require fewer applications and a shorter duration of use. The presence of inflammation may necessitate the use of an agent with inherent anti-inflammatory properties or the use of a combination antifungal/steroid agent. The latter agents should be used with caution because of their potential for causing atrophy and other steroid-associated complications.

### Diagnosis and management of tinea infections [^5de2211d]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Tinea infections (often called ringworm) are caused by dermatophyte fungi and classified by the body site involved. Tinea corporis and tinea capitis are most common in prepubertal children, and tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea unguium (most common type of onychomycosis) are more likely in adolescents and adults. Clinical diagnosis without testing may be unreliable because other conditions can resemble tinea infections (eg, tinea corporis can be confused with eczema, and onychomycosis with dystrophic toenails from repeated low-level trauma or psoriasis). Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis generally respond to inexpensive topical antifungal agents, but oral antifungal agents may be indicated for patients with extensive disease, lack of response to topical treatment, immunocompromise, or hair follicle involvement (eg, tinea capitis). Oral terbinafine is considered first-line therapy for tinea capitis and onychomycosis because it is well tolerated, effective, and inexpensive. Emerging tinea infections may be more severe than classic tinea infections and generally do not improve with first-line topical or oral antifungals. These infections may require prolonged oral antifungal therapy and specialized diagnostic testing. Antifungal stewardship, including avoiding the use of combination antifungal-corticosteroids, should be emphasized to optimize outcomes and help prevent resistance.

### Efficacy and safety of naftifine HCl cream 2% in the treatment of pediatric subjects with tinea corporis [^43c8fd6f]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea corporis is fungal infection of body surfaces other than the feet, groin, scalp, or beard. Naftifine hydrochloride is a topical antifungal of the allylamine class used to treat tinea corporis, displaying fungicidal activity and clinically significant anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. <br/>

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of two-weeks once daily application of naftifine cream 2% in the treatment of tinea corporis among pediatric subjects. <br/>

Methods

At baseline, 231 subjects were randomly assigned 1:1 to naftifine cream 2% (n = 116) and vehicle (n = 115). Treatment effect consisting of mycologic determination (KOH and dermatophyte cultures) and scoring of clinical symptom severity was evaluated at baseline, week 2 (end of treatment) and week 3. Efficacy was analyzed in 181 subjects (n = 88, naftifine; n = 93, vehicle) with a positive baseline dermatophyte culture and KOH for whom week 3 assessments were available. Safety was evaluated by adverse events (AE) and laboratory values in 231 subjects (n = 116, naftifine; n = 115, vehicle). <br/>

Results

Children with tinea corporis treated with naftifine cream 2% demonstrated significantly greater improvements from baseline over vehicle for mycological cure (<em> P </em> < 0.0001) and treatment effectiveness (<em> P < /em ≥ 0.003) as early as 2 weeks (end of treatment). Response rates continued to increase post-treatment and were the highest 1-week after completion of the therapy (<em> P < /em ≥ 0.003 for complete cure; and <em> P </em> < 0.001 for mycological cure and treatment effectiveness). Treatment related adverse events were minimal. <br/>

Conclusions

Treatment with naftifine cream 2% applied once daily for two weeks was well-tolerated and was effective in treating tinea corporis in children. Further improvement was observed 1-week after treatment completion for all key outcome measures (complete cure, mycological cure, treatment effectiveness, clinical cure, and clinical success) and clinical signs and symptoms (erythema, induration, and pruritus). <br/> <br/> <em> J Drugs Dermatol. </em> 2016;15(6):743–748.

### Common tinea infections in children… [^7825ad60]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

TREATMENT Tinea capitis must be treated with oral agents to penetrate the affected hair shafts. Although griseofulvin is often considered the treatment of choice for children, other agents are increasingly more cost-effective and may be more convenient. 8 If griseofulvin is used, micronized oral griseofulvin is recommended at a dosage of 20 mg per kg per day for at least eight weeks. The long duration of treatment and the adverse effects of nausea, vomiting, and photosensitivity often negatively affect patient compliance. Ketoconazole and itraconazole are not recommended for treating tinea capitis because of the limited data on their effectiveness and safety. Adjunctive selenium sulfide should be used to decrease the spread of tinea capitis. 15 Selenium sulfide 2. 5% shampoo is most effective and should be applied at least two to three times per week and should remain on the scalp for at least five minutes per application.
16.

TREATMENT Topical treatment is often sufficient to cure tinea corporis, although oral medications can be used for patients with severe infection or for infections that do not respond to topical therapy. A topical antifungal agent is applied to the lesion and a 2-cm area surrounding the lesion once or twice daily; therapy is continued for one week after the lesion appears to resolve. Topical therapy is usually a sufficient treatment for tinea cruris. Therapies include terbinafine cream or spray applied once daily for one week and butenafine 1% cream applied once daily for two weeks. TREATMENT Topical antifungal agents such as terbinafine applied once daily for one week or butenafine 1% applied once daily for two weeks are effective for most forms of tinea pedis. The therapies can be applied directly to the web spaces and other affected areas. As with treatment of tinea cruris, these therapies are more effective than clotrimazole and miconazole.

Occasionally, systemic terbinafine therapy, 250 mg taken orally every day for two weeks, or fluconazole, 150 mg taken once weekly for three weeks, can be used to treat severe or refractory infections. TREATMENT The best evidence supports terbinafine for treating adolescents with tinea unguium.

### Comparative study of 2% sertaconazole solution and cream formulations in patients with tinea corporis, tinea pedis interdigitalis, or a corresponding candidosis [^a0bb1583]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Based on the results of numerous preclinical and clinical studies, sertaconazole can be considered a safe and effective drug for the treatment of fungal skin infections.

Objective

The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of a solution containing 2% sertaconazole with the well established 2% sertaconazole cream formulation in patients with tinea corporis, tinea pedis interdigitalis, or a corresponding candidosis.

Methods

This was a prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, noninferiority therapy study. Patients received either sertaconazole solution or cream twice daily for 28 days. The full analysis set comprised 160 patients in the solution group and 153 patients in the cream group. The primary efficacy parameter was a combination of culture test result and total clinical score. Efficacy was defined by eradication of the pathogen and reduction of the total clinical score between pretreatment and the final visit.

Results

Efficacy was documented in 90.6% of patients using the solution and 88.9% of those using the cream (full analysis set). No adverse events occurred.

Conclusion

Solution and cream formulations of 2% sertaconazole applied for 28 days were associated with comparable efficacy and safety in the treatment of fungal skin infections.

### Superficial fungal infections [^b48ef769]. Pediatrics in Review (2012). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis, tinea corporis, and pityriasis versicolor are common superficial fungal infections in the pediatric population.
- Tinea capitis is the most common dermatophyte infection worldwide. In North America, the cause is almost exclusively T tonsurans. Diagnosis of tinea capitis usually can be made by clinical features alone, especially when occipital or postauricular lymphadenopathy is present. Skin scrapings prepared with potassium hydroxide for microscopic examination, or a cotton swab for fungal culture, usually are diagnostic.
- Treatment of tinea capitis requires systemic antifungal therapy. Terbinafine and griseofulvin are both effective against T tonsurans and are FDA-approved for this indication in children.
- Adjunctive topical therapy for the patient and household contacts decreases transmission of this infection.
- Topical antifungal therapy usually is effective for tinea corporis and pityriasis versicolor. However, recurrences of pityriasis versicolor are common.

### Effect of different itraconazole dosing regimens on cure rates, treatment duration, safety, and relapse rates in adult patients with tinea corporis / cruris: a randomized clinical trial [^a47fc229]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

With worldwide emergence of recalcitrant and resistant dermatophytosis, itraconazole is increasingly being used as the first-line drug for treatment of tinea corporis/cruris (TCC). Apparent inadequacy with low doses has led to empirical use of higher doses and antifungal combinations.

Objective

To compare cure rates, treatment durations, safety profiles, and relapse rates of itraconazole 100, 200, and 400 mg/d for the treatment of TCC.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind randomized clinical trial included adult patients with treatment-naive TCC involving at least 5% body surface area. Patients were recruited from the dermatology outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to 1 of the 3 treatment groups. Biweekly blinded assessments were performed until cure or treatment failure. Posttreatment follow-up of at least 8 weeks was conducted to detect relapses.

Main Outcome and Measures

Cure rates, treatment durations, safety profiles, and relapse rates were assessed. Secondary outcomes included comparison of rapidity of clinical response and cost-effectiveness between groups.

Results

Of the 149 patients assessed, the mean (SD) age was 34.3 (12.2) years, 69 patients (46.4%) were women, and 80 patients (53.6%) were men. The difference in cure rate between the 100- and 200-mg groups was statistically nonsignificant (hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; 95% CI, 0.91–2.30; P = 0.12), while the difference between the 100- and 400-mg groups (HR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.78–4.62; P < .001) and between the 200- and 400-mg groups (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.28–3.09; P = 0.002) was statistically significant. Mean (SD) treatment durations were statistically significantly different between the 100- and 400-mg groups (7.7 [4.7] weeks vs 5.2 [2.6] weeks; P = 0.03) and between the 200- and 400-mg groups (7.2 [3.8] weeks vs 5.2 [2.6] weeks; P = 0.004), but the difference between the 100- and 200-mg groups was not statistically significant. A total of 55 patients (47.4%) relapsed after treatment. Relapse rates were comparable across groups. No patient discontinued treatment due to adverse effects. Treatment with the 200-mg dose incurred a 63% higher cost and 400 mg a 120% higher cost over 100 mg in achieving cure.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, high overall efficacy was observed among the 3 itraconazole doses for treatment of TCC, but with prolonged treatment durations and considerable relapse rates. Treatment with the 200- and 100-mg doses did not differ significantly in efficacy or treatment durations, while 400 mg scored over the other 2 on these outcomes. Considerable additional cost is incurred in achieving cure with the 200- and 400-mg doses.

### Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea nigra, and piedra [^894d1ea2]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Tinea infections are among the most common dermatologic conditions throughout the world. To avoid a misdiagnosis, identification of dermatophyte infections requires both a fungal culture on Sabouraud's agar media, and a light microscopic mycologic examination from skin scrapings. Topical antifungals may be sufficient for treatment of tinea corporis and cruris and tinea nigra, and the shaving of hair infected by piedra may also be beneficial. Systemic therapy, however, may be required when the infected areas are large, macerated with a secondary infection, or in immunocompromised individuals. Preventative measures of tinea infections include practicing good personal hygiene; keeping the skin dry and cool at all times; and avoiding sharing towels, clothing, or hair accessories with infected individuals.

### Onychomycosis: epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment in a changing landscape [^cc6b6c4e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is an often overlooked and/or undertreated disease. This may be in part due to an under appreciation among both physicians and patients of its impact on quality of life and the potential for significant complications, from tinea corporis and cruris, to bacterial superinfection. Some health care providers are unaware of the effective low-risk treatments currently available. Changing demographic characteristics such as the relative aging of the population; the increasing prevalence of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease, and widespread iatrogenic immunosuppression; and changes in lifestyle practices such as earlier and greater participation in sports, are likely to lead to an increased prevalence of onychomycosis in both adults and children. Two topical onychomycosis treatments, efinaconazole 10% solution, and tavaborole 5% solution were recently approved by the FDA. This article reviews the state of knowledge and describes, briefly, these new treatment options.

### Treatments of tinea pedis [^30b0df4d]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

The severity of tinea pedis infection determines the course of treatment required. Mild infections may be resolved using a topical agent. More severe presentations (eg, dermatophytosis complex) may require treatment that eliminates the bacterial and fungal infection. Some topical monotherapies may exhibit both antifungal and antibacterial activity. In other instances, it may be necessary to combine an antifungal agent with an antibacterial agent. If inflammation is present, an agent with known anti-inflammatory action may need to be used. The chronic presentation of tinea pedis (dry type) sometimes does not respond well to topical therapy. In such instances, systemic antifungal therapy is required to ensure that adequate concentrations of the therapeutic agent are present at the site of infection.

### Advances in topical and systemic antifungals [^81e471cd]. Dermatologic Clinics (2007). Low credibility.

Topical antifungal agents are generally used for the treatment of superficial fungal infections unless the infection is widespread, involves an extensive area, or is resistant to initial therapy. Systemic antifungals are often reserved for the treatment of onychomycosis, tinea capitis, superficial and systemic candidiasis, and prophylaxis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. With the development of resistant fungi strains and the increased incidence of life-threatening invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, some previously effective traditional antifungal agents are subject to limitations including multidrug interactions, severe adverse effects, and their fungistatic mechanism of actions. Several new antifungal agents have demonstrated significant therapeutic benefits and have broadened clinicians' choices in the treatment of superficial and systemic invasive fungal infections.

14.3 Tinea Corporis

Naftifine Hydochloride Cream has been investigated for safety and efficacy in a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multi-center trial in 184 subjects with symptomatic and dermatophyte culture positive tinea corporis. Subjects were randomized to receive Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream or vehicle. Subjects applied the study agent to all affected body surface areas with tinea corporis plus a ½ inch margin of healthy skin surrounding the affected lesions for two weeks. Signs and symptoms of tinea corporis (presence or absence of erythema, induration, and pruritus) were assessed and KOH examination and dermatophyte culture were performed for the assessment of primary efficacy endpoint at Day 21.

The trial population was pediatric (≥ 2 to < 18 years of age) with a median age of 9 years (Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream) or 8 years (vehicle); 61% of subjects were male and 45% were white. At baseline, subjects were confirmed to have signs and symptoms of tinea corporis, positive KOH exam, and confirmed dermatophyte culture. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportions of subjects with a complete cure at the Day 21 visit. Complete cure was defined as both a clinical cure (absence of erythema, induration, and pruritus on all lesions present at baseline) and mycological cure (negative KOH and dermatophyte culture).

The efficacy results at Day 21, one week following the end of treatment, are presented in Table 3 below.

### Common tinea infections in children [^c665b9f1]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

The common dermatophyte genera Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton are major causes of superficial fungal infections in children. These infections (e.g., tinea corporis, pedis, cruris, and unguium) are typically acquired directly from contact with infected humans or animals or indirectly from exposure to contaminated soil or fomites. A diagnosis usually can be made with a focused history, physical examination, and potassium hydroxide microscopy. Occasionally, Wood's lamp examination, fungal culture, or histologic tissue examination is required. Most tinea infections can be managed with topical therapies; oral treatment is reserved for tinea capitis, severe tinea pedis, and tinea unguium. Topical therapy with fungicidal allylamines may have slightly higher cure rates and shorter treatment courses than with fungistatic azoles. Although oral griseofulvin has been the standard treatment for tinea capitis, newer oral antifungal agents such as terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole are effective, safe, and have shorter treatment courses.

### Efficacy and safety of topical antifungals in the treatment of dermatomycosis: a systematic review [^f809fce9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

The analysis of comparative efficacy and safety of topical antifungals in the literature is restricted to the treatment of tinea pedis and onychomycosis. Therefore our objective was to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of topical antifungals used in the treatment of dermatomycosis, we performed a comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the following databases: Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Lilacs and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, we identified studies that compared the use of topical antifungals with other antifungals or with placebo published up to July 2010 in English, Spanish or Portuguese. The quality of reporting was assessed according to the Jadad scale; only studies with a score of 3 or more were included. The outcomes evaluated were mycological cure at the end of treatment, sustained cure, occurrence of adverse events and tolerability, including withdrawals due to adverse events. A total of 104 RCTs satisfied the inclusion criteria, containing a total of 135 comparisons, with 55 out of 120 possible comparisons among the 16 drugs evaluated. Pooled data on efficacy showed that all the antifungals were better than placebo. There were no significant differences among antifungal classes. No differences were found in safety or tolerability in any direct comparison. Sensitivity analysis indicated the robustness of the findings. Our results indicate the clear superiority of topical antifungals over placebo but that there is no consistent difference among classes. Mixed treatment comparisons are necessary to rank antifungals, as direct comparisons among many of them are lacking.

### Comparable efficacy and safety of various topical formulations of terbinafine in tinea pedis irrespective of the treatment regimen: results of a meta-analysis [^a5932b63]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Terbinafine has been widely used with major success as a topical antifungal therapy for tinea pedis (athlete's foot). Its efficacy and safety have been validated in several clinical trials, which have demonstrated clinical efficacy for the drug after only 1 week of treatment when applied once daily, a reflection of the high fungicidal potency of the drug and its ability to form a depot in the upper skin layer. To improve patients' compliance further, a terbinafine-containing film-forming solution has been developed for single-dose therapy of athlete's foot. This novel formulation delivers terbinafine in high amounts and for a prolonged period of time into the skin, making one-shot treatment feasible. Over the past years there have been a variety of trials evaluating use of topical terbinafine addressing different pharmaceutical formulations, treatment durations, and application frequencies, but a detailed meta-analysis of these trials has not been conducted to date.

Objective

The present study is the first meta-analytic evaluation of the available data on the efficacy (clinical and mycologic cure rates) and safety (adverse events) of all topical forms of terbinafine for the treatment of tinea pedis.

Methods

An international, systematic literature search of 12 electronic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases) using a pre-specified search strategy was conducted in March 2006. This meta-analysis included only randomized controlled trials in which terbinafine had been used for topical treatment of tinea pedis in comparison with placebo or an active control. Studies of all available topical formulations of terbinafine, frequencies of application, and durations of treatment were included.

Results

Of 100 identified articles published between 1990 and 2006, 19 met the criteria for analysis. These 19 studies involved 2899 patients with clinical and mycologic diagnoses of tinea pedis (nine placebo-controlled trials and ten active-controlled trials). Efficacy analysis demonstrated that the mycologic cure rate was significantly superior with terbinafine compared with placebo (relative risk [RR] 3.17; p < 0.001). No significant differences in efficacy were found amongst different formulations of terbinafine, treatment durations, or frequencies of application. Comparable results were obtained with respect to clinical cure rate for terbinafine compared with placebo (RR 2.75; p < 0.001). Comparison of the efficacy of terbinafine versus active control indicated a nonsignificant difference in favor of terbinafine with regard to mycologic cure rate (RR 1.03; p = 0.423) and clinical cure rate (RR 1.09; p = 0.11). The median duration of treatment was also shorter with terbinafine (1 week) compared with active controls (2 weeks). Analysis of the placebo-controlled studies showed that there was no significant difference in the risk of adverse events with terbinafine compared with placebo (RR 1.34; p = 0.34). Likewise, no significant differences in adverse events were found between terbinafine and active controls (RR 1.08; p = 0.72).

Conclusion

Terbinafine is very well tolerated in any topical pharmaceutical formulation and also has high efficacy as a cure for tinea pedis, irrespective of type of pharmaceutical formulation, treatment duration, and frequency of application, including the recently established one-shot regimen. In addition, terbinafine has an apparently unique advantage over other antifungal agents with respect to the required duration of treatment for tinea pedis.

### Limited effectiveness of four oral antifungal drugs (fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole and terbinafine) in the current epidemic of altered dermatophytosis in India: results of a randomized pragmatic trial [^461cb63d]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Dermatophytic infections have undergone unprecedented changes in India in the recent past. Clinical trials to find out the effectiveness of the four main oral antifungal drugs are lacking.

Objectives

We tested the effectiveness of oral fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole and terbinafine in chronic and chronic relapsing tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei in an investigator-initiated, randomized, pragmatic trial.

Methods

Two hundred patients with microscopy-confirmed tinea were allocated to four groups (50 patients in each group): fluconazole 5 mg kg -1 per day, griseofulvin 10 mg kg -1 per day, itraconazole 5 mg kg -1 per day and terbinafine 7·5 mg kg -1 per day. Allocation was performed by concealed block randomization and the patients were treated for 8 weeks or until cure. Effectiveness was calculated based on intention-to-treat analysis. The trial was registered with the Clinical Trials Registry India (CTRI/2017/04/008281).

Results

At 4 weeks, all drugs were similarly ineffective, with cure rates being 8% or less (P = 0·42). At 8 weeks, the numbers of patients cured were as follows: fluconazole 21 (42%), griseofulvin seven (14%), itraconazole 33 (66%) and terbinafine 14 (28%) (P < 0·001). Itraconazole was superior to fluconazole, griseofulvin and terbinafine (adjusted P ≤ 0·048). Relapse rates after 4 and 8 weeks of cure with the four treatments were not different (P ≥ 0·42). Numbers needed to treat (vs. griseofulvin), calculated on the basis of cure rates at 8 weeks, were as follows: fluconazole 4, itraconazole 2 and terbinafine 8.

Conclusions

The results show limited effectiveness of all four antifungal drugs. In view of cure rates and the number needed to treat, itraconazole is the most effective drug, followed by fluconazole (daily), terbinafine and then griseofulvin, in chronic and chronic relapsing dermatophytosis in India. What is already known about this topic? Oral antifungal drugs are considered to have a high cure rate in tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei. Unprecedented changes have been noticed in the last few years in India in the morphology, course and treatment responsiveness of tinea; however, data about the effectiveness of oral antifungals are lacking. What does this study add? Our results show limited effectiveness of four oral antifungal drugs (fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole and terbinafine) in the current epidemic of altered dermatophytosis in India. Among the four drugs tested, oral itraconazole is the most effective. Linked Comment: Elewski. Br J Dermatol 2020; 183:798–799.

### Guidelines for the management of tinea capitis in children [^9d55b6b1]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Practice guidelines for the treatment of tinea capitis (TC) from the European Society for Pediatric Dermatology are presented. Tinea capitis always requires systemic treatment because topical antifungal agents do not penetrate the hair follicle. Topical treatment is only used as adjuvant therapy to systemic antifungals. The newer oral antifungal agents including terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole appear to have efficacy rates and potential adverse effects similar to those of griseofulvin in children with TC caused by Trichophyton species, while requiring a much shorter duration of treatment. They may be, however, more expensive (Grading of recommendation A; strength of evidence 1a). Griseofulvin is still the treatment of choice for cases caused by Microsporum species. Its efficacy is superior to that of terbinafine (Grading of recommendation A; strength of evidence 1b), and although its efficacy and treatment duration is matched by fluconazole (Grading of recommendation A; strength of evidence 1b) and itraconazole (Grading of recommendation A; strength of evidence 1b), griseofulvin is cheaper. It must be noted, however, that griseofulvin is nowadays not available in certain European countries (e.g. Belgium, Greece, Portugal, and Turkey).

### Econazole nitrate foam 1% for the treatment of tinea pedis: results from two double-blind, vehicle-controlled, phase 3 clinical trials [^6fec6cc1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Econazole nitrate is a broad-spectrum topical antifungal with activity against a variety of dermatophytes and yeasts. A new topical dosage form, econazole nitrate topical foam 1%, utilizing patented Proderm Technology® has been developed for treatment of interdigital tinea pedis.

Objective

To evaluate econazole nitrate foam 1% versus foam vehicle for treatment of interdigital tinea pedis.

Methods

Two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled, multicenter studies enrolled males and females ≥ 12 years old with a clinical diagnosis of interdigital tinea pedis and baseline fungal culture positive for a dermatophyte. Subjects applied econazole nitrate foam 1% (n = 246) or foam vehicle (n = 249) once daily for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was proportion of subjects achieving a complete cure (negative KOH, negative fungal culture, complete resolution of all signs and symptoms) at 2 weeks post-treatment (Day 43). Secondary endpoints included mycologic cure (negative KOH and negative culture) and effective treatment (mycologic cure + no or mild erythema and/or scaling and all other signs and symptoms absent).

Results

The complete cure rate at Day 43 was 24.3% for econazole nitrate foam 1% vs 3.6% for foam vehicle. In addition, higher rates of mycologic cure (67.6% vs 16.9%) and effective treatment (48.6% vs 10.8%) were observed with econazole nitrate foam 1% versus the foam vehicle. There were few adverse events and only nasopharyngitis and headache were experienced by > 1% of subjects. No serious adverse events were reported for econazole nitrate foam 1%.

Conclusions

Econazole nitrate foam 1% exhibited superiority over foam vehicle for the primary and secondary endpoints with a high mycologic cure rate for all pathogens evaluated. Econazole nitrate foam 1% was safe and well tolerated with a safety profile comparable with the foam vehicle. Econazole nitrate foam 1% presents a novel alternative for the management of tinea pedis.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

During clinical trials, 903 subjects were exposed to naftifine 1% and 2% cream formulations. A total of 564 subjects with interdigital tinea pedis, tinea cruris, or tinea corporis were treated with Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream.

In two randomized, vehicle-controlled trials (400 subjects were treated with Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream). The population was 12 to 88 years old, primarily male (79%), 48% Caucasian, 36% Black or African American, 40% Hispanic or Latino and had either predominantly interdigital tinea pedis or tinea cruris. Most subjects received doses once-daily, topically, for 2 weeks to cover the affected skin areas plus a ½ inch margin of surrounding healthy skin. In the two vehicle-controlled trials, 17.5% of Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream treated subjects experienced an adverse reaction compared with 19.3% of vehicle subjects. The most common adverse reaction (≥ 1%) is pruritus. Most adverse reactions were mild in severity. The incidence of adverse reactions in the Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream treated population was not significantly different than in the vehicle treated population.

In a third randomized, vehicle-controlled trial, 116 pediatric subjects with tinea corporis were treated with Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream. The population was aged ≥ 2 to < 18 years (mean age of 9 years), predominately male (61%), 47% White, 51% Black or African American, 92% Hispanic or Latino, and infected with tinea corporis. Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream was topically applied once daily for 2 weeks to all affected body surface areas with tinea corporis plus a ½ inch margin of healthy skin surrounding the affected lesions. The incidence of adverse reactions in the Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream treated population was not significantly different than in the vehicle treated population.

In two open-label pediatric pharmacokinetics and safety trials, 49 pediatric subjects 2 to < 18 years of age with interdigital tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis received Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream. The incidence of adverse reactions in the pediatric population was similar to that observed in the adult population.

### Treatment of ringworm and fungal nail infections… [^b4067e11]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Antifungal medications are used to treat ringworm and fungal nail infections.
- Medications may be creams/ointments or pills.
- Do not use steroid creams or ointments to treat ringworm or a rash that may be ringworm.
- Use antifungal medications exactly as directed for as long as directed. Overview Treatment for ringworm depends on symptom severity and the part of the body infected. Antifungal medications for ringworm come in the form of creams, ointments, lotions, powders, and pills. Some forms of ringworm can be treated with non-prescription antifungal medications. Ringworm infections may need to be treated with prescription antifungal medications. Treatment types Ringworm on the skin Ringworm on the skin like athlete's foot and jock itch are usually treated with non-prescription antifungal medications.

Antifungal creams, ointments, lotions, or powders are usually applied to the skin for 2 to 4 weeks. Follow product instructions and apply the antifungal for as long as directed even if symptoms start to improve. There are many non-prescription products available to treat ringworm, including:

- Clotrimazole
- MiconazoleA
- Terbinafine
- Ketoconazole. Ringworm on the scalp Ringworm on the scalp usually needs to be treated with prescription antifungal medication taken by mouth for 1 to 3 months. Creams, lotions, or powders don't work for ringworm on the scalp. Prescription antifungal medications used to treat ringworm on the scalp include:

- Griseofulvin
- Terbinafine
- Itraconazole
- Fluconazole.

### Naftifine hydrochloride gel 2%: an effective topical treatment for moccasin-type tinea pedis [^4a88abe5]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Naftifine hydrochloride (naftifine) is a topical antifungal of the allylamine class, displaying fungicidal and fungistatic activity. Naftifine is generally used to treat interdigital tinea pedis; however, systemic therapy is often prescribed by healthcare providers for moccasin tinea pedis. Well-controlled clinical data on topical antifungal therapy for moccasin tinea pedis is limited.

Objective

The objective of this analysis is to present data from two pooled randomized, vehicle-controlled studies that evaluated efficacy of once daily topical naftifine gel 2% and vehicle at end of treatment (week 2) and at 4 weeks post-treatment in subjects with moccasin tinea pedis.

Methods

At visit 1, subjects were randomized to naftifine gel 2% or vehicle groups and subjects underwent baseline mycology culture, KOH, and symptom (erythema, scaling, and pruritus) severity grading. Naftifine gel 2% and vehicle treatment were applied once daily for 2 weeks and the subjects returned at weeks 2 and 6 for efficacy evaluation (mycology culture and grading of symptom severity). A total of 1174 subjects were enrolled with interdigital tinea pedis with or without moccasin infection. Of these subjects, 674 subjects had interdigital presentation while 500 subjects had moccasin infection in addition to the interdigital presentation. All 1174 subjects with interdigital presentation satisfied the inclusion criteria of a minimum of moderate erythema and scaling, and mild pruritus. Of the 500 subjects who had moccasin presentation, 380 satisfied the same inclusion criteria as mentioned above. Since data was analyzed as observed cases, between 337 and 349 subjects had data available for analysis of efficacy. Mycologic cure is defined as a negative dermatophyte culture and KOH, treatment effectiveness is defined as mycologic cure and symptom severity scores of 0 or 1, and complete cure is defined as mycologic cure and symptoms severity scores of 0.

Results

At week 6, the cure rates in the naftifine arm vs. the vehicle were statistically higher (P < 0.0001) for mycological cure rate (65.8% vs. 7.8%), treatment effectiveness (51.4% vs 4.4%), and complete cure rate (19.2% vs 0.9%).

Conclusion

Two weeks application of topical naftifine gel 2% is an effective monotherapy treatment for moccasin tinea pedis.

### Six novel antimycotics [^c83115a4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

We have reviewed six new antimycotic agents which have potential applications for human cutaneous and mucosal diseases. Information on these six drugs was obtained via an English language search of PubMed through the US National Library of Medicine. The antimycotic agents reviewed include rilopirox, lanoconazole, NND-502, butenafine, eberconazole and voriconazole. Rilopirox is a synthetic pyridone derivative, related to ciclopirox, with a fungicidal action. Rilopirox is a hydrophobic, topical agent with potential application in mucosal candida infections, tinea versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis. Lanoconazole, an imidazole, is a topical agent with potential application in tinea infections and cutaneous candidiasis. The drug has been available for clinical use in Japan since 1994 and once-daily application to affected areas is recommended. In addition to its antifungal effect, animal data suggest that application of lanoconazole 0.5 or 1% cream is associated with accelerated wound healing. NND-502, a stereoselective analog of lanoconazole, is a topical agent with potential application in tinea pedis infection. NND-502 appears to be more effective in inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis than lanoconazole or bifonazole and clinical trials comparing these agents are awaited. Butenafine is the first member of a new class of antifungals, the benzylamine derivatives, and has been approved for topical use in Japan (since 1992) and the US. Butenafine has a potent fungicidal action and the drug has been shown to be effective in multiple clinical trials in patients with tinea pedis, tinea corporis and tinea cruris. Butenafine has also been reported to exert an anti-inflammatory action after topical application and this may offer potential benefit over other topical antifungal agents. Eberconazole, an imidazole derivative, is a topical antifungal agent that has been shown to be effective in clinical trials in patients with tinea infections. Preliminary data indicate that the eberconazole is effective against some triazole-resistant yeasts such as Candida krusei and Candida glabrata. Voriconazole is an azole antifungal derivative of fluconazole. The drug is available in both oral and parenteral formulations. Oral voriconazole 200mg twice daily has been effective in treating oropharyngeal candidiasis and apergillosis in immunocompromised patients. After 12 weeks' treatment, a similar dosage of the drug elicited a positive response in 69% of nonimmunocompromised patients with invasive aspergillosis.

### Persistent and recurrent tinea corporis in children treated with combination antifungal / corticosteroid agents [^d07d2fd3]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Combination antifungal/corticosteroid preparations are widely used by nondermatologists in the treatment of superficial fungal infections in patients of all ages. Over half of the prescriptions written for the most commonly used combination agent clotrimazole 1%/betamethasone diproprionate 0.05% cream (Lotrisone, Schering, Kenilworth, NJ) were prescribed for children younger than 4 years old. Our pediatric dermatology division has recently encountered a series of children with recurrent or persistent tinea corporis, especially tinea faciei, treated initially with combination antifungal/corticosteroid cream.

Methods

All children evaluated for tinea corporis in a university hospital pediatric dermatology clinic from January through June 2001 were identified from the clinic registry for a retrospective chart review. Response to therapy was confirmed by telephone survey and/or follow-up visits at least 1 month after clearing of infection.

Results

Six children ranging in age from 4 to 11 years were evaluated for tinea corporis in a pediatric dermatology clinic at our institution during the 6-month period. All 6 children were diagnosed clinically by their pediatrician with tinea corporis and initially treated with clotrimazole 1%/betamethasone diproprionate 0.05% cream for 2 to 12 months. In our pediatric dermatology clinic, patients had their diagnosis confirmed with a positive potassium hydroxide preparation and were treated with one of several oral or topical antifungal agents with clearing of all tinea infections.

Conclusion

The use of combination clotrimazole 1% cream/betamethasone diproprionate 0.05% cream (Lotrisone) for the treatment of tinea corporis may be associated with persistent/recurrent infection.

### Oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot [^8e1d2c92]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

About 15% of the world population have fungal infections of the feet (tinea pedis or athlete's foot). There are many clinical presentations of tinea pedis, and most commonly, tinea pedis is seen between the toes (interdigital) and on the soles, heels, and sides of the foot (plantar). Plantar tinea pedis is known as moccasin foot. Once acquired, the infection can spread to other sites including the nails, which can be a source of re-infection. Oral therapy is usually used for chronic conditions or when topical treatment has failed.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot (tinea pedis).

Search Methods

For this update we searched the following databases to July 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and CINAHL (from 1981). We checked the bibliographies of retrieved trials for further references to relevant trials, and we searched online trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of oral treatments in participants who have a clinically diagnosed tinea pedis, confirmed by microscopy and growth of dermatophytes (fungi) in culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently undertook study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction.

Main Results

We included 15 trials, involving 1438 participants. The 2 trials (71 participants) comparing terbinafine and griseofulvin produced a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 2.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 3.44) in favour of terbinafine's ability to cure infection. No significant difference was detected between terbinafine and itraconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole, fluconazole and ketoconazole, or between griseofulvin and ketoconazole, although the trials were generally small. Two trials showed that terbinafine and itraconazole were effective compared with placebo: terbinafine (31 participants, RR 24.54, 95% CI 1.57 to 384.32) and itraconazole (72 participants, RR 6.67, 95% CI 2.17 to 20.48). All drugs reported adverse effects, with gastrointestinal effects most commonly reported. Ten of the trials were published over 15 years ago, and this is reflected by the poor reporting of information from which to make a clear 'Risk of bias' assessment. Only one trial was at low risk of bias overall. The majority of the remaining trials were judged as 'unclear' risk of bias because of the lack of clear statements with respect to methods of generating the randomisation sequence and allocation concealment. More trials achieved blinding of participants and personnel than blinding of the outcome assessors, which was again poorly reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence suggests that terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin, and terbinafine and itraconazole are more effective than no treatment. In order to produce more reliable data, a rigorous evaluation of different drug therapies needs to be undertaken with larger sample sizes to ensure they are large enough to show any real difference when two treatments are being compared. It is also important to continue to follow up and collect data, preferably for six months after the end of the intervention period, to establish whether or not the infection recurred.

### A network meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of monotherapies for tinea capitis, and an assessment of evidence quality [^e9d87435]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Various monotherapies exist for tinea capitis; however, their relative efficacies have never been determined using a statistical approach which compares treatments' efficacy simultaneously. The goal of this study was to determine the relative efficacy (mycologic and complete cure rates) of monotherapies for the treatment of tinea capitis. On October 5, 2019, searches were performed in Scopus, PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE (Ovid), and CINAHL; there were no date restrictions. For the main network meta-analysis, eligible studies were randomized trials that investigated the effect of tinea capitis monotherapies on subjects' mycological and complete cure rates. Network meta-analyses were conducted in accordance with the 2015 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist for network meta-analyses. Mycological cure rate was the primary outcome; complete cure rate and adverse events were secondary outcomes. Twelve studies met the eligibility criteria for the main network; five systemic monotherapies were identified, griseofulvin, ketoconazole, terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole. When the causative species was of the Microsporum genus, griseofulvin was most efficacious in terms of mycological cure (SUCRA = 66.1%) and complete cure (SUCRA = 80.6%). For tinea capitis caused by the Trichophyton species, terbinafine was the most efficacious in terms of both mycological and complete cure (SUCRA values of 75.2% and 78.2%, respectively). Risk of adverse events did not significantly differ across the interventions. Our results are congruent with those of previous pairwise meta-analyses; our findings also corroborate clinical experience and anecdotal evidence.

### Griseofulvin (griseofulvin MICROSIZE) [^cde60140]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium – depending on rate of growth – fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis. In some forms of tinea pedis, yeasts and bacteria may be involved as well as dermatophytes. Griseofulvin tablets, USP will not eradicate these associated bacterial or yeast infections.

ADULTS: 0.5 g daily (125 mg q.i.d., 250 mg b.i.d., or 500 mg/day). Patients with less severe or 300 extensive infections may require less, whereas those with widespread lesions may require a starting dose of 0.75 g to 1 g/day. This may be reduced gradually to 0.5 g or less after a response has been noted. In all cases, the dosage should be individualized.

PEDIATRIC PATIENTS (older than 2 years): A dosage of 10 mg/kg daily is usually adequate (pediatric patients from 30 to 50 lb, 125 mg to 250 mg daily; pediatric patients over 50 lb, 250 mg to 500 mg daily, in divided doses). Dosage should be individualized, as with adults. Clinical relapse will occur if the medication is not continued until the infecting organism is eradicated.

Safety is not established at higher doses than recommended.

### A randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled efficacy and safety study of naftifine 2% cream in the treatment of tinea pedis [^b9f70569]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Naftifine HCl 2% cream (NAFT-2) is a topical allylamine antifungal agent under development in the United States. This randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, phase 3 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of two weeks of NAFT-2 treatment in subjects with tinea pedis. Naftifine 1% cream (NAFT-1) treatment for four weeks and vehicle were also evaluated as a positive control.

Methods

709 subjects were randomly assigned 2:1:2:1 to one of four treatment groups: (i) NAFT-2 (n = 235), (ii) two-week vehicle (n = 118), (iii) NAFT-1 (n = 237), or (iv) four-week vehicle (n = 119). Efficacy was evaluated at baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 6 and consisted of mycology determination (KOH and dermatophyte culture) and scoring of clinical symptom severity (erythema, scaling, and pruritus). Efficacy was only analyzed in 425 subjects with positive baseline dermatophyte culture. Safety was evaluated by adverse events (AE) and laboratory values in 707 subjects.

Results

At week 6, NAFT-2 subjects achieved 18 percent complete cure rate, 67 percent mycological cure rate, 57 percent treatment effectiveness, 22 percent clinical cure rate, and 78 percent clinical success rate compared to respective vehicle rates of seven percent (one-sided, P < 0.01), 21 percent (P < 0.001), 20 percent (P < 0.001), 11 percent (P = 0.04) and 49 percent (P < 0.001). Week 6 efficacy responses in NAFT-1-treated subjects were significantly higher than vehicle subjects and almost identical to NAFT-2 subjects. Mycological cure and clinical response rates in both NAFT-2 and NAFT-1 increased from week 2 to week 6. Treatment-related AEs occurred in five percent of NAFT-2 subjects, seven percent of vehicle subjects, four percent of NAFT-1 subjects and eight percent of vehicle subjects. The most common AEs for all groups were application site pruritus and skin irritation.

Conclusion

Topical NAFT-2 for two weeks is safe and provides significantly superior antifungal treatment than vehicle in tinea pedis subjects. NAFT-2 produces equivalent efficacy responses to four weeks of NAFT-1 treatment. The fungicidal activity of naftifine continues to increase for at least one month after treatment is completed.

### The role of naftifine HCl 2% gel and cream in treating moccasin tinea pedis [^d0580599]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

In recent years, new topical antifungals have emerged for the treatment and management of tinea pedis, but all have been investigated and approved for the treatment of interdigital tinea pedis. Moccasin tinea pedis has not been recognized by governing bodies as a definable and treatable disease entity separate from interdigital tinea pedis at this time. Thus, creating randomized, controlled clinical trials to investigate moccasin tinea pedis is a challenge without an agreed upon definition of the disease state, treatment regimen, and treatment course. Considering systemic therapy issues and the lack of data from large trials demonstrating safety and efficacy in the topical management of this clinical presentation, an unmet need has been created for a topical antifungal agent that can treat moccasin tinea pedis. Naftifine 2% gel, an allylamine, was studied in a clinical trial that enrolled patients who had interdigital or both interdigital and moccasin-type tinea pedis. In the moccasin group, the primary efficacy endpoint of complete cure at week 2 (end of treatment) was 1.7% (gel) vs 0.9% (vehicle) and week 6 (four weeks post-treatment) was 19.2% (gel) vs 0.9% (vehicle). Naftifine 2% cream in combination with urea 39% also showed improvement in hyperkeratotic moccasin tinea pedis.

### Expert panel review of skin and hair dermatophytoses in an era of antifungal resistance [^e58711cb]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Dermatophytoses are fungal infections of the skin, hair, and nails that affect approximately 25% of the global population. Occlusive clothing, living in a hot humid environment, poor hygiene, proximity to animals, and crowded living conditions are important risk factors. Dermatophyte infections are named for the anatomic area they infect, and include tinea corporis, cruris, capitis, barbae, faciei, pedis, and manuum. Tinea incognito describes steroid-modified tinea. In some patients, especially those who are immunosuppressed or who have a history of corticosteroid use, dermatophyte infections may spread to involve extensive skin areas, and, in rare cases, may extend to the dermis and hair follicle. Over the past decade, dermatophytoses cases not responding to standard of care therapy have been increasingly reported. These cases are especially prevalent in the Indian subcontinent, and Trichophyton indotineae has been identified as the causative species, generating concern regarding resistance to available antifungal therapies. Antifungal-resistant dermatophyte infections have been recently recognized in the United States. Antifungal resistance is now a global health concern. When feasible, mycological confirmation before starting treatment is considered best practice. To curb antifungal-resistant infections, it is necessary for physicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for resistant dermatophyte infections coupled with antifungal stewardship efforts. Furthermore, by forging partnerships with federal agencies, state and local public health agencies, professional societies, and academic institutions, dermatologists can lead efforts to prevent the spread of antifungal-resistant dermatophytes.

### Griseofulvin — microsize) — griseofulviin — microsize [^3f9aae70]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium — depending on rate of growth — fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis since in some forms of athlete's foot, yeasts and bacteria may be involved. Griseofulvin will not eradicate the bacterial or monilial infection.

Adults: A daily dose of 500 mg will give a satisfactory response in most patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea capitis.

For those fungus infections more difficult to eradicate such as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, a daily dose of 1 gram is recommended.

Children: Approximately 5 mg per pound of body weight per day is an effective dose for most children. On this basis the following dosage schedule for children is suggested:

### Treatment and diagnostic challenges associated with the novel and rapidly emerging antifungal-resistant dermatophyte [^f74e428b]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

T. indotineae dermatophytosis can be severe, covering large areas of the body, and challenging to treat. They can present as extensive, pruritic plaques, minimally inflammatory, primarily affecting the trunk, extremities, and groin, causing tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea faciei, and tinea genitalis. Central clearing is often absent, and plaques may resemble eczema, and post-cure pruritus has frequently been reported. Dark-skinned individuals can present with prominent pigmentation. Lesions may present in various atypical morphologies, including erythematous, scaly concentric plaques with a "pseudoimbricata" appearance, papulosquamous, pustular, or steroid-modified tinea forms. Patients often report a history of ineffective treatment with topical or oral antifungals, including TRB, and some may have recently traveled to or been in contact with individuals from countries where T. indotineae infections are prevalent. However, domestic cases in patients without travel history are increasingly being documented. The use of topical corticosteroid products often for severe pruritus can exacerbate the condition by masking symptoms and altering lesion morphology, complicating diagnosis and treatment. T. indotineae has rarely been implicated in nail or hair infections. To date, only two cases of onychomycosis have been reported — one from Italy in a patient who immigrated from India and the other in a French man — both involving toenails and associated with extensive tinea corporis, presenting with proximal erosion of the nail plate. The reasons for the limited involvement of T. indotineae in hair and nail infections as compared to other Trichophyton species remain unknown. Pavlovic et al. have suggested that poor keratolytic activity of T. indotineae may be the reason for rare nail infections. Some other possibilities may include its lack of lipolytic activity or it may have just been underreported.

### Potential sexual transmission of antifungal-resistant trichophyton indotineae [^9e09b988]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Dermatophytosis, also called ringworm or tinea, is a common superficial fungal skin infection most often caused by Trichophyton, Microsporum, or Epidermophyton fungi and often treated using over-the-counter topical antifungal agents. Oral terbinafine is a first-line antifungal treatment for extensive skin infections, which typically occur in immunocompromised or older persons. Outbreaks of extensive, recalcitrant, and frequently terbinafine-resistant dermatophytosis in immunocompetent persons are ongoing in southern Asia because of the recently emerged dermatophyte Trichophyton indotineae (formerly Trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VIII). T. indotineae typically causes tinea faciei, corporis, or cruris; easily spreads person-to-person; and has been reported globally, including in multiple US states. Laboratory identification requires advanced molecular techniques because culture-based methods cannot distinguish T. indotineae from other Trichophyton species.

### Cutaneous infections dermatophytosis, onychomycosis, and tinea versicolor [^b8c03223]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Cutaneous fungal infections cause significant morbidity for healthy and ill patients. The incidence of some dermatomycoses is increasing, despite availability of newer and better topical and systemic treatments. Fungal remnants last months to years under the ideal conditions, allowing continued spread of infection. Mycoses treated in one area may recur because of organism travel from concomitant areas of infection. Failure of patients and physicians to recognize a fungal etiology early may lead to more extensive, severe, or difficult-to-treat infections. Finally, a patient's concurrent illnesses may play a part in susceptibility and ability to manage fungal infections. For these reasons, scientists have studied and developed newer antifungal agents with better efficacy and greater convenience in dosing. These drugs, however, still have side effects and medication interactions that may limit their use in some patients. Better efforts to educate patients and physicians alike may aid in faster recognition and treatment of dermatophytoses. More research is needed to continue to develop drugs suitable for use in a broader range of patients and diagnostic tests that may be quicker or more specific than conventional ones.

### Treatment and diagnostic challenges associated with the novel and rapidly emerging antifungal-resistant dermatophyte [^6768117e]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dermatophytosis is a superficial mycosis of the skin, hair, and nails caused by dermatophytes, which are keratinophilic fungi. Trichophyton species causes the majority of dermatophyte infections. Infections are acquired through contact with infected humans, animals, soil, or contaminated fomites. Dermatophyte infections have generally responded well to first-line oral antifungal agents such as terbinafine (TRB), griseofulvin, and azoles. However, since 2016, Indian dermatologists started reporting widespread, chronic dermatophytosis resistant to first-line antifungal treatment, notably TRB. These isolates were negative for both urease and hair perforation tests (HPTs). Subsequently, these isolates were identified as Trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VIII. In 2020, based on clinical, mycological, and molecular features, this TRB-resistant Trichophyton species belonging to T. mentagrophytes genotype VIII was described as a novel species and designated as Trichophyton indotineae to indicate the country (India) from where it was first reported. However, in a recent publication, the appropriateness of the name T. indotineae has been questioned, with two major concerns: the pejorative connotation of the term indotineae and inadequate information regarding the origin of this novel dermatophyte.

Over the past decade, India has experienced an alarming rise in T. indotineae infections.

A recent survey revealed that 78% of dermatophyte cases in the country are caused by T. indotineae. It is hypothesized that widespread availability and misuse of topical corticosteroid creams and antifungal agents in India contributed to the emergence of this infection. T. indotineae causes extensive, recalcitrant tinea cruris and tinea corporis, including atypical locations such as genitalia. Now endemic to both India and Iran, T. indotineae has also been identified in imported cases worldwide, with occasional reports of limited local transmission, highlighting the risk of epidemic spread to more countries in the near future. The rapid emergence and importation of this drug-resistant dermatophyte to many countries present a significant public health problem, highlighting the urgent need for better diagnostic tools and methods for the detection of T. indotineae and better treatment options.

### Luliconazole (luzu) [^dcce94df]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Subcutaneous doses of 4, 20 and 100 mg/kg/day luliconazole were administered during the period of organogenesis (gestational days 6–18) to pregnant female rabbits. No treatment-related effects on maternal toxicity, embryofetal toxicity or malformations were noted at 100 mg/kg/day (24 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons).

In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, subcutaneous doses of 1, 5 and 25 mg/kg/day luliconazole were administered from the beginning of organogenesis (gestation day 7) through the end of lactation (lactation day 20). In the presence of maternal toxicity, embryofetal toxicity (increased prenatal pup mortality, reduced live litter sizes and increased postnatal pup mortality) was noted at 25 mg/kg/day.

No embryofetal toxicity was noted at 5 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). No treatment effects on postnatal development were noted at 25 mg/kg/day (3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There is no information available on the presence of luliconazole in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production after topical application of LUZU Cream, 1% to women who are breastfeeding. LUZU Cream, 1% has low systemic absorption. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of LUZU Cream, 1% to an infant during lactation. Therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for LUZU Cream, 1% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from LUZU Cream, 1% or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of LUZU Cream, 1% in pediatric patients 12 to < 18 years of age with tinea pedis and tinea cruris have been established by evidence from well-controlled trials in adult and pediatric subjects and a pharmacokinetic (PK) study in pediatric subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14)].

### Clinical course, antifungal susceptibility, and genomic sequencing of trichophyton indotineae [^5895fe91]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

The median (range) time from tinea onset to diagnosis was 10 (3 [patient H] to 42 [patient K]) months. All patients had lesions affecting multiple body sites, most commonly the trunk, extremities, buttocks, and groin; 2 patients (patients F and G) had facial involvement. Nine patients reported pruritus. Six patients received medium- to high-potency topical corticosteroids before tinea diagnosis; 2 patients received the topical corticosteroid as part of combination corticosteroid-antifungal creams obtained in Bangladesh. All patients received at least 1 topical antifungal medication, none of which was effective as monotherapy. Duration of topical and oral antifungal therapy and adherence to therapy abroad before presentation were unknown. Ten of the patients received multiple topical antifungal agents. All patients demonstrated incomplete responses to typical doses and duration of oral antifungal therapy for tinea corporis/cruris (Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Trichophyton indotineae Causing Tinea Corporis

The patient was treated with 6 weeks of itraconazole, 100 mg twice daily.

Seven patients (patients A, B, D, F, G, J, and K) received a course of terbinafine without resolution of infection. Terbinafine doses were universally 250 mg daily and ranged from 14 days (patients B, J, and K) to 28 days (patients D and F) to 42 days (patient A). The dose and duration of terbinafine for 1 patient (patient G) was unknown. Seven patients' isolates had elevated terbinafine MIC values (range, 0.5 to > 128 μg/mL). AFST data and terbinafine MIC values were unavailable for patient A, as this patient's isolate was not saved. Three patients (patients C, E, and I) who did not receive oral terbinafine treatment had isolates with terbinafine MIC values of 0.0039 μg/mL or lower.

### Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the use of telemedicine on the diagnosis and treatment of tinea corporis: an experience of Southern Italy center [^59a33c11]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Teledermatology played a central role during the COVID‐19 pandemic, which led to a strong development of this type of service, providing ample satisfaction for both physicians and pa Although works in the literature suggest how helpful this service has been, in our experience not all dermatologic conditions can benefit equally from this type of visit.

In conclusion, it is often not easy to manage or explain a treatment through this modality, so we believe that there are still considerable difficulties for therapeutic management as our data show.

We believe that new guidelines are needed for the future to improve these services and increase the satisfaction of both patients and dermatologists.

### Emergence of difficult-to-treat tinea corporis caused by trichophyton mentagrophytes complex isolates, paris, France [^636d0640]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Dermatophytes are filamentous keratinophilic fungi responsible for superficial fungal diseases involving the skin, hair, or nails. On the basis of the site of the lesions, conditions are called tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea capitis, tinea pedis, or tinea unguium. Since the mid-2010s, difficult-to-treat cases of tinea corporis and tinea cruris have emerged in India; molecular analysis revealed that this clinical presentation was caused by a unique clade related to the Trichophyton mentagrophytes complex. Since 2018, we have observed several cases of clinically resistant tinea corporis with extensive lesions that do not respond to terbinafine, the preferred first-line treatment. We investigated the microbiological origin of this resistance by looking for mutations in the squalene epoxidase (SQLE) gene, which terbinafine targets, and determining the MICs of antifungal drugs.

### Clotrimazole / betamethasone diproprionate: a review of costs and complications in the treatment of common cutaneous fungal infections [^eebb5851]. Pediatric Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

The use of antifungal/corticosteroid combinations as topical therapy for dermatophytoses has been criticized as being less effective, more expensive, and the cause of more adverse cutaneous reactions than antifungal monotherapy. The combination of clotrimazole and betamethasone diproprionate (Lotrisone) is a mix of an azole antifungal and a high-potency corticosteroid, and is one of the most widely prescribed of these combinations. Our objective was to describe the beneficial and deleterious effects of Lotrisone in the treatment of common cutaneous fungal infections and its relative cost-effectiveness. We did a literature review documenting clinical trial data and adverse reactions to Lotrisone and collected a cost analysis of topical antifungal prescribing data over a 2-month period from a large midwestern staff-model health maintenance organization (HMO). Lotrisone is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis in adults and children more than 12 years of age. Treatment is limited to 2 weeks in the groin area and 4 weeks on the feet. The most concerning adverse effects of Lotrisone were reported in children and included treatment failure, striae distensae, hirsuitism, and growth retardation. This combination was also reported to have decreased efficacy in clearing candidal and Trichophyton infections as compared to single-agent antifungals. Lotrisone was considerably more expensive than clotrimazole alone and was found to account for more than 50% of topical antifungal expenditures as prescribed by primary care physicians, but only 7% of topical antifungals prescribed by dermatologists. We found that Lotrisone was shown to have the potential to induce many steroid-related side effects and to be less cost effective than antifungal monotherapy. This combination should be used judiciously in the treatment of cutaneous fungal infections and may not be appropriate for use in children.

### Real world analysis of response rate and efficacy of oral ketoconazole in patients with recalcitrant tinea corporis and cruris [^ea721517]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Recalcitrant dermatophytosis has had an alarming rise in India with concomitant decreased effectiveness of conventional antifungal agents. This has prompted the use of second-line agents for treatment. In this retrospective study, we aimed to analyze the response rate, efficacy, relapse rate, and side effects of oral ketoconazole (KZ) in the treatment of recalcitrant tinea corporis and cruris. Institutional records were reviewed for patients presenting with tinea cruris or corporis who had failed treatment with conventional antifungal drugs and treated with oral KZ. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) findings, culture reports, and response to treatment was noted based on the percentage improvement in lesions and reduction in itching compared with baseline. Fourty-three patients (mean age 31.3 years) with tinea corporis/cruris who had taken prior treatment with antifungals were recruited in the study. KOH mount and culture were positive in 76.7% patients. Trichophyton mentagrophytes was the commonest species, isolated in 62.8% of patients. Ketoconazole showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration on antifungal susceptibility tests with various antifungals. With a dose of 400 mg daily, 67.4% of patients were cured of disease with mean duration of 9.4 weeks. Patients having less than 40% clearance at 2 weeks had a 68.9% less probability of getting cured of disease. Of the 29 patients cured, 37.9% relapsed because of various predisposing factors. Two patients developed increase in liver enzymes on treatment. Our analysis suggests that KZ can be used as alternative drug in cases with failure to conventional antifungal drugs. Though there are relapses, these can be partially explained by various predisposing factors that support fungal survival and transmission.

### Topical and device-based treatments for fungal infections of the toenails [^2b729252]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis refers to fungal infections of the nail apparatus that may cause pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007; a substantial amount of new research warrants a review exclusively on toenails.

Objectives

To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device-based therapies for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of topical and device-based therapies for onychomycosis in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by positive cultures, direct microscopy, or histological nail examination. Eligible comparators were placebo, vehicle, no treatment, or an active topical or device-based treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete cure rate (normal-looking nail plus fungus elimination, determined with laboratory methods) and number of participants reporting treatment-related adverse events.

Main Results

We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild-to-moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks; 23% reported disease duration (variable). Thirty-five studies specifically examined dermatophyte-caused onychomycosis. Forty-three studies were carried out in outpatient settings. Most studies assessed topical treatments, 9% devices, and 11% both. We rated three studies at low risk of bias across all domains. The most common high-risk domain was performance bias. We present results for key comparisons, where treatment duration was 36 or 48 weeks, and clinical outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks. Based on two studies (460 participants), compared with vehicle, ciclopirox 8% lacquer may be more effective in achieving complete cure (risk ratio (RR) 9.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 50.14; low-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.12; moderate-quality evidence). Ciclopirox lacquer may lead to increased adverse events, commonly application reactions, rashes, and nail alteration (e.g. colour, shape). However, the 95% CI indicates that ciclopirox lacquer may actually make little or no difference (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.92; low-quality evidence). Efinaconazole 10% solution is more effective than vehicle in achieving complete cure (RR 3.54, 95% CI 2.24 to 5.60; 3 studies, 1716 participants) and clinical cure (RR 3.07, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.53; 2 studies, 1655 participants) (both high-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.94; 3 studies, 1716 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Risk of adverse events (such as dermatitis and vesicles) was slightly higher with efinaconazole (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 studies, 1701 participants; high-quality evidence). No other key comparison measured clinical cure. Based on two studies, compared with vehicle, tavaborole 5% solution is probably more effective in achieving complete cure (RR 7.40, 95% CI 2.71 to 20.24; 1198 participants), but probably has a higher risk of adverse events (application site reactions were most commonly reported) (RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 8.85; 1186 participants (both moderate-quality evidence)). Tavaborole improves mycological cure (RR 3.40, 95% CI 2.34 to 4.93; 1198 participants; high-quality evidence). Moderate-quality evidence from two studies (490 participants) indicates that P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) is probably more effective than the comparators ciclopirox 8% lacquer or amorolfine 5% in achieving complete cure (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.48), but there is probably little or no difference between the treatments in achieving mycological cure (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37). We found no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.92; 2 studies, 487 participants; low-quality evidence). The most common events were erythema, rash, and burning. Three studies (112 participants) compared 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser to no treatment or sham treatment. We are uncertain if there is a difference in adverse events (very low-quality evidence) (two studies; 85 participants). There may be little or no difference in mycological cure at 52 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.85; 2 studies, 85 participants; low-quality evidence). Complete cure was not measured. One study (293 participants) compared luliconazole 5% solution to vehicle. We are uncertain whether luliconazole leads to higher rates of complete cure (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be little or no difference in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.16) and there may be increased mycological cure with luliconazole; however, the 95% CI indicates that luliconazole may make little or no difference to mycological cure (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.97). Commonly-reported adverse events were dry skin, paronychia, eczema, and hyperkeratosis, which improved or resolved post-treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Assessing complete cure, high-quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole, moderate-quality evidence supports P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) and tavaborole, and low-quality evidence supports ciclopirox 8% lacquer. We are uncertain whether luliconazole 5% solution leads to complete cure (very low-quality evidence); this outcome was not measured by the 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser comparison. Although evidence supports topical treatments, complete cure rates with topical treatments are relatively low. We are uncertain if 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser increases adverse events compared with no treatment or sham treatment (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates that there is no difference in adverse events between P-3051 (ciclopirox hydrolacquer), luliconazole 5% solution, and their comparators. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer may increase adverse events (low-quality evidence). High- to moderate-quality evidence suggests increased adverse events with efinaconazole 10% solution or tavaborole 5% solution. We downgraded evidence for heterogeneity, lack of blinding, and small sample sizes. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of device-based treatments, which were under-represented; 80% of studies assessed topical treatments, but we were unable to evaluate all of the currently relevant topical treatments. Future studies of topical and device-based therapies should be blinded, with patient-centred outcomes and an adequate sample size. They should specify the causative organism and directly compare treatments.

Regarding medical management for tinea capitis, more specifically with respect to oral antifungals, BAD 2014 guidelines recommend to offer the following options as first-line therapy in patients with tinea capitis, recognizing that terbinafine requires a shorter course of treatment which may increase compliance:

- **griseofulvin (more effective against Microsporum species)**: 1 g/day (15–20 mg/kg/day for < 50 kg) as a single or divided dose for 6–8 weeks

- **terbinafine (more effective against Trichophyton species)**: 250 mg/day (125 mg/day for 20–40 kg; 62.5 mg/day for < 20 kg) for 2–4 weeks.

### Systemic antifungal therapy for tinea capitis in children [^61e55023]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis is a common contagious fungal infection of the scalp in children. Systemic therapy is required for treatment and to prevent spread. This is an update of the original Cochrane review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic antifungal drugs for tinea capitis in children.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to November 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2015, Issue 10), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), and CINAHL (from 1981). We searched five trial registers and checked the reference lists of studies for references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We obtained unpublished, ongoing trials and grey literature via correspondence with experts in the field and from pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs of systemic antifungal therapy in children with normal immunity under the age of 18 with tinea capitis confirmed by microscopy, growth of fungi (dermatophytes) in culture or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 25 studies (N = 4449); 4 studies (N = 2637) were new to this update. Terbinafine for four weeks and griseofulvin for eight weeks showed similar efficacy for the primary outcome of complete (i.e. clinical and mycological) cure in three studies involving 328 participants with Trichophyton species infections (84.2% versus 79.0%; risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.15; low quality evidence). Complete cure with itraconazole (two to six weeks) and griseofulvin (six weeks) was similar in two studies (83.6% versus 91.0%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.05; N = 134; very low quality evidence). In two studies, there was no difference between itraconazole and terbinafine for two to three weeks treatment (73.8% versus 78.8%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.19; N = 160; low quality evidence). In three studies, there was a similar proportion achieving complete cured with two to four weeks of fluconazole or six weeks of griseofulvin (41.4% versus 52.7%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.05; N = 615; moderate quality evidence). Current evidence for ketoconazole versus griseofulvin was limited. One study favoured griseofulvin (12 weeks) because ketoconazole (12 weeks) appeared less effective for complete cure (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; low quality evidence). However, their effects appeared to be similar when the treatment lasted 26 weeks (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; low quality evidence). Another study indicated that complete cure was similar for ketoconazole (12 weeks) and griseofulvin (12 weeks) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.39; low quality evidence). For one trial, there was no significant difference for complete cure between fluconazole (for two to three weeks) and terbinafine (for two to three weeks) (82.0% versus 94.0%; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.01; N = 100; low quality evidence). For complete cure, we did not find a significant difference between fluconazole (for two to three weeks) and itraconazole (for two to three weeks) (82.0% versus 82.0%; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.20; low quality evidence). This update provides new data: in children with Microsporum infections, a meta-analysis of two studies found that the complete cure was lower for terbinafine (6 weeks) than for griseofulvin (6–12 weeks) (34.7% versus 50.9%; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.86; N = 334; moderate quality evidence). In the original review, there was no significant difference in complete cure between terbinafine (four weeks) and griseofulvin (eight weeks) in children with Microsporum infections in one small study (27.2% versus 60.0%; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.35; N = 21; low quality evidence). One study provides new evidence that terbinafine and griseofulvin for six weeks show similar efficacy (49.5% versus 37.8%; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.88; N = 1006; low quality evidence). However, in children infected with T. tonsurans, terbinafine was better than griseofulvin (52.1% versus 35.4%; RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.77; moderate quality evidence). For children infected with T. violaceum, these two regimens have similar effects (41.3% versus 45.1%; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.24; low quality evidence). Additionally, three weeks of fluconazole was similar to six weeks of fluconazole in one study in 491 participants infected with T. tonsurans and M. canis (30.2% versus 34.1%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.14; low quality evidence). The frequency of adverse events attributed to the study drugs was similar for terbinafine and griseofulvin (9.2% versus 8.3%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.57; moderate quality evidence), and severe adverse events were rare (0.6% versus 0.6%; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.88; moderate quality evidence). Adverse events for terbinafine, griseofulvin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and fluconazole were all mild and reversible. All of the included studies were at either high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Using GRADE to rate the overall quality of the evidence, lower quality evidence resulted in lower confidence in the estimate of effect.

Authors' Conclusions

Newer treatments including terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole are at least similar to griseofulvin in children with tinea capitis caused by Trichophyton species. Limited evidence suggests that terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole have similar effects, whereas ketoconazole may be less effective than griseofulvin in children infected with Trichophyton. With some interventions the proportion achieving complete clinical cure was in excess of 90% (e.g. one study of terbinafine or griseofulvin for Trichophyton infections), but in many of the comparisons tested, the proportion cured was much lower. New evidence from this update suggests that terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin in children with T. tonsurans infection. However, in children with Microsporum infections, new evidence suggests that the effect of griseofulvin is better than terbinafine. We did not find any evidence to support a difference in terms of adherence between four weeks of terbinafine versus eight weeks of griseofulvin. Not all treatments for tinea capitis are available in paediatric formulations but all have reasonable safety profiles.

Regarding medical management for tinea capitis, more specifically with respect to oral antifungals, BAD 2014 guidelines recommend to suspect lack of compliance, suboptimal absorption of the drug, the relative insensitivity of the organism, and reinfection in case of treatment failure. Continue current treatment for further 2–4 weeks in cases of clinical improvement but ongoing positive mycology. Switch to second-line therapy if there has been no initial clinical improvement.

### Unusual presentation of tinea corporis associated with the use of a microneedling device [^29f9a7bf]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Figure 3.
Posterior aspect of both forearms (A) and anterior aspect of both thighs (B) of the same patient 3 weeks after starting the treatment with terbinafine 250 mg per os daily and topical sertaconazol twice daily. Great improvement was observed. The patient continued terbinafine for one more week, and topical sertaconazol until complete resolution.

Considering the patient's anamnesis and this unusual pattern of tinea corporis, with simultaneously arising lesions in the sites where the microneedling device was applied, we can consider that the disruption of the epidermis by the microneedles facilitated the infection of multiple sites when in contact with the infected cat and/or bed linen. Microneedling dramatically increases the skin's permeability to therapeutic and cosmeceutical substances by creating reversible microchannels in the skin. This enhanced permeability was shown to be optimal at 5 minutes after microneedling with 1 mm long needles, and drastically reduced after 30 minutes. Similarly, while open, these microchannels may facilitate the access of microorganisms or deleterious substances. The exact depth of needle penetration and the effects on skin permeability with the device used by the patient may differ from those results due to a higher density of shorter needles and variations in the pressure used. Nevertheless, in superficial mycoses, fungi invade keratinized tissues, so even if the depth of the microchannels is eventually smaller, the disruption of the stratum corneum is sufficient to facilitate a fungal infection. As the procedure was performed by the patient, a less rigorous pre- and postprocedural care with the device cannot be excluded, and might be an important additional factor.

Microneedling is a minimally invasive procedure, with a low risk of complications. However, even if it remains relatively intact, the epidermis is indeed disrupted, and this may predispose to cutaneous infections. This case report emphasizes the critical need for standardized protocols for safe microneedling techniques, specific regulatory guidelines for home vs medical usage, and avoidance of inadvertent exposure to infectious agents in the treatment environment. We strongly advise that patients be informed of the appropriate care with homecare rollers and to avoid undue exposure to contaminants during the critical period for reestablishment of the skin's barrier system. These concerns should apply equally to motorized devices and treatments in medical facilities. Although microneedling is usually a safe procedure, technical expertise during the procedure and vigilant proactive aftercare are essential to obtain successful outcomes and should be mandatory.

### Infectious diseases associated with organized sports and outbreak control [^7604f40d]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Tinea pedis (T pedis) management — Topical and systemic regimens with efficacy and pediatric approvals are detailed. Ciclopirox olamine cream or gel (0.77%) applied twice daily for 4 weeks was superior to 1% clotrimazole or vehicle, achieving ~60% versus 6% end-of-treatment cures and 85% versus 16% two weeks after treatment. For children, a dosage of topical application twice a day is recommended for use in children older than 10 years. Naftifine twice daily for 4 weeks and sulconazole nitrate 1% daily for 4 to 6 weeks yielded higher mycological clearance (57%–66%) than vehicle (13%–34% cleared), though sulconazole is not approved for use in children in the United States. Terbinafine 1% cream applied twice daily for 1 week produced > 93% mycological cure at 4 weeks and is approved for children 12 years and older, whereas a 1% luliconazole cream trial in adults cured less than 50% and is only approved for adults. Oral terbinafine, 250 mg once daily for 1 week, had similar efficacy to 4 weeks of clotrimazole 1% twice daily with faster clinical resolution and was similar to itraconazole, 100 mg over 2 weeks, with a slightly lower rate of relapse. Terbinafine is well tolerated in children, with occasional isolated neutropenia and rare liver failure, typically in people with preexisting liver disease.

Ringworm

Background

Ringworm or "tinea" is a type of skin infection caused by several different species of fungus. A ringworm infection can occur on the scalp (tinea capitis), the body (tinea corporis), the hands (tinea manuum), the feet (tinea pedis or "athlete's foot"), the nails (tinea unguium), the groin or inner thighs (tinea cruris of "jock itch"), and the beard area (tinea barbae). Typical symptoms include red, itchy skin, a ring-shaped rash, and hair loss.

Ringworm spreads by contact with personal items from someone whohas a ringworm infection, such as towels, clothing, or hair care items, or surfaces that are contaminated with the fungus. It also can spread by contact with an infected dog or cat.

Treatment for ringworm depends on where the infection is on the body. Over-the-counter topical medication can treat infections on the skin, but a prescription medication taken by mouth is used to treat infections on the scalp. There are rare reports of infections that are resistant to antifungal medicines.

Recommendations

Allow entry of individuals who have ringworm infection once they have begun treatment for the infection. A rash should not be not used as a reason for excluding someone who has begun treatment, as a ringworm rash may persist for several weeks.
Refer guests who develop a rash while staying at the facility for medical evaluation by their primary care physician or licensed clinician.

### Treatment-resistant dermatophytosis: a representative case highlighting an emerging public health threat [^feca8296]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Superficial dermatophytoses are among the most common conditions prompting patients to seek dermatologic evaluation. The dermatophyte, T rubrum, is the most frequent cause of onychomycosis and cutaneous infection in the United States. Despite its prevalence, microbiologically proven drug resistance is rare and most patients improve with oral terbinafine. However, we have recently seen numerous cases of extensive tinea corporis from T rubrum that was initially resistant to terbinafine or recurred rapidly after a brief interval improvement. Although uncommon, these cases have been increasing in frequency, and we have seen several patients in our clinic with widespread cutaneous disease that persisted despite prolonged treatment with oral terbinafine or second-line systemic therapies (oral fluconazole or itraconazole). Treatment-resistant dermatophytosis has emerged as a public health threat in endemic areas like India. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no such cases of treatment-resistant dermatophytosis reported in the United States.

We have treated several cases of extensive and resistant T rubrum tinea corporis in otherwise healthy patients with no risk factors predisposing them to recurrent fungal infections including recent steroid use. Several patients did report a remote history of onychomycosis although most had no active nail involvement upon their initial presentation. A subset of patients initially responded to oral terbinafine and reported clearance within 2 weeks, although all noted recurrent and persistent lesions shortly after discontinuing treatment. Several patients, however, had no initial improvement with progressive disease while on therapy (Fig 1, A and B). Cultures from skin scrapings, in several cases, surprisingly resulted within a few days and showed T rubrum. Despite absence of clinical improvement, only some patients demonstrated terbinafine resistance on broth microdilution antifungal susceptibility testing (MIC > 0.5 μg/mL). Further workup including biopsies were unrevealing for inflammatory or alternative etiologies. Patients were switched to oral fluconazole or itraconazole in combination with topical agents. Most patients had partial improvement, although several had no clinical response despite continuous treatment on this alternative regimen.

### Notes from the field: first reported U.S. cases of tinea caused by trichophyton indotineae-new york city, December 2021-March 2023 [^788b9e72]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Tinea is a common, highly contagious, superficial infection of the skin, hair, or nails caused by dermatophyte molds. * During the past decade, an epidemic of severe, antifungal-resistant tinea has emerged in South Asia because of the rapid spread of Trichophyton indotineae, † a novel dermatophyte species; the epidemic has likely been driven by misuse and overuse of topical antifungals and corticosteroids §. T. indotineae infections are highly transmissible and characterized by widespread, inflamed, pruritic plaques on the body (tinea corporis), the crural fold, pubic region, and adjacent thigh (tinea cruris), or the face (tinea faciei). T. indotineae isolates are frequently resistant to terbinafine, a mainstay of tinea treatment. T. indotineae infections have been reported throughout Asia and in Europe and Canada but have not previously been described in the United States.

On February 28, 2023, a New York City dermatologist notified public health officials of two patients who had severe tinea that did not improve with oral terbinafine treatment, raising concern for potential T. indotineae infection; these patients shared no epidemiologic links. Skin culture isolates from each patient were previously identified by a clinical laboratory as Trichophyton mentagrophytes and were subsequently forwarded to the Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, for further review and analysis. Sanger sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal gene, followed by phylogenetic analysis performed during March 2023, identified the isolates as T. indotineae (Supplementary Figure;). Activity related to this investigation was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.

### Topical efinaconazole: a sequential combination therapy with oral terbinafine for refractory tinea unguium [^d3f8dce5]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Efinaconazole is a topical antifungal drug used to treat tinea unguium that was approved by the Japanese government in 2014. A phase 3 study enrolled patients with a nail involvement ratio of 20–50% (mean, 36.7%), and the complete cure rate at 52 weeks was 17.8% (117/656). Furthermore, a multicenter study including severe cases with a mean nail involvement of 49.1% showed that continuous application up to 72 weeks contributed to a relatively high cure rate of 31.1% (68/223). A recent Cochrane review of treatments for onychomycosis confirmed that high‐quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole for achieving a complete cure. Oral terbinafine at 250 mg daily for 12 weeks and oral itraconazole pulse therapy (3 cycles of 400 mg daily) are mainly applied internationally, with complete cure rates of 35% and 14%, respectively. Combination therapy can be administrated in parallel or sequentially. Parallel therapy is recommended for patients who are not likely to respond to the therapy (e.g. patients with diabetes), whereas sequential therapy is recommended for patients who have shown a poor response to initial treatment. Combination therapy is one way of improving the cure rate of onychomycosis. We herein report the efficacy of topical efinaconazole in sequential combination therapy with oral terbinafine.

### Topical efinaconazole: a sequential combination therapy with oral terbinafine for refractory tinea unguium [^f615f378]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Efinaconazole is a topical antifungal drug approved in Japan for tinea unguium. Although topical treatments generally have low cure rates with a prolonged therapy period, a Cochrane review confirmed that high-quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole for the complete cure of tinea unguium. Combination therapy is a way to improve the cure rate of onychomycosis. In this study, topical efinaconazole was administrated to 12 patients who had been treated with oral terbinafine (125 mg daily) for more than 20 weeks with little expected effect. Because terbinafine accumulates for a long time in the nail, treatment immediately followed by other drugs can be considered sequential combination therapy. During terbinafine monotherapy, the percentage involvement decreased from 53.5% to 44.0% after 37.4 weeks and the effective and cure rates were 16.7% and 0%, respectively. During sequential topical efinaconazole therapy combined with lasting terbinafine in the nail, the percentage involvement decreased from 44.0% to 18.7% after 28.4 weeks, and the effective and cure rates were 66.7% and 16.7%, respectively. The improvement rate per month of combination therapy (12.6%) was higher than that with monotherapy (2.1%) (p = 0.002). There were no serious side-effects. This sequential combination therapy with efinaconazole was effective in poor terbinafine responders, making it a promising regimen for improving the cure rate of tinea unguium.

### British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the management of tinea capitis 2014 [^75156503]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for tinea capitis, more specifically with respect to oral antifungals, BAD 2014 guidelines recommend to consider offering itraconazole 50–100 mg/day for 4 weeks or 5 mg/kg/day for 2–4 weeks as second-line therapy in patients with tinea capitis. Switch to terbinafine as second-line therapy for Trichophyton species or griseofulvin for Microsporum species at standard dosing regimens if itraconazole has been administered as first-line therapy.
