## Question

Can a CT scan rule out nec fasc

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a negative CT scan can reliably rule out necrotizing fasciitis and what the clinical implications are for decision-making and timing of surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic gold standard and the time-critical nature of management. Then, I should review CT performance characteristics from high-quality studies. Next, I will reconcile conflicting evidence and consider early-stage disease and modality-specific limitations. After that, I need to integrate guideline recommendations and clinical risk stratification. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-based approach and state a clear bottom line with caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: necrotizing fasciitis is primarily a clinical diagnosis, and the definitive test is surgical exploration with direct visualization of necrotic fascia. Delays to operative source control worsen outcomes, so time-to-debridement is the key driver of survival, not perfect preoperative imaging certainty [^1151HDCN] [^112aMeRh] [^116FGeyW].

> Now, I should review the best available CT data. The JAMA study reported that among 184 patients with suspected NSTI, a negative IV contrast-enhanced CT had a negative predictive value of 100% and a sensitivity of 100%, suggesting that a negative CT reliably excluded the need for surgical intervention; however, I need to check the methodology and spectrum bias, as only 17 patients had positive CTs and 38 of 167 with negative CTs still underwent surgery due to high clinical suspicion, which could inflate the NPV in a low-prevalence, enriched-surgery cohort [^114azqJR].

> Wait, let me verify consistency across studies. A systematic review and meta-analysis found CT sensitivity around 88.5% and specificity around 93.3%, implying that a negative CT cannot absolutely rule out NSTI in real-world mixed-prevalence settings. Similarly, a focused CT study identified "fluid along the deep fascia" as highly specific but only modestly sensitive, reinforcing that absence of this sign does not exclude disease. And a large operative series showed CT identified gas or concerning features in most but not all true NSTIs, again arguing against 100% sensitivity in practice [^113oRyfC] [^112WWxis] [^1127fcSP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single study. I initially thought the JAMA data might generalize broadly, but I should double-check for early-disease limitations and modality-specific blind spots. MRI literature suggests very high sensitivity but can miss early fascial involvement; conversely, CT can miss early cases without gas or with subtle fascial changes, and case reports document ultrasound detecting deep fascial fluid with subsequent negative CT/MRI, later proven surgically to be NSTI; moreover, gas is variably present and appears relatively late, so a negative CT without gas cannot reassure in a high-suspicion patient [^117NTk8r] [^1125exHX] [^1146dLR4].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to anchor practice. WSES/SIS-E advises that imaging may be considered when the diagnosis is uncertain but should never delay surgical consultation. IDSA emphasizes that CT or MRI may show fascial edema but sensitivity/specificity are ill-defined and clinical judgment is paramount. And the ACR recommends MRI or CT when suspicion remains high after normal radiography, again underscoring that imaging is adjunctive, not definitive [^112JBKL9] [^1151HDCN] [^111VZ6JV].

> I need to ensure I integrate clinical risk stratification. The LRINEC score has poor sensitivity and cannot be used to rule out NSTI; clinical triggers such as pain out of proportion, rapidly progressive edema, systemic toxicity, or crepitus warrant urgent surgical evaluation regardless of imaging; and institutional data suggest an acceptable negative exploration rate around 20%, reinforcing that surgical exploration is appropriate when suspicion is high even if some explorations are negative [^113oRyfC] [^113X5dYY] [^112Th2W6].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. In a hemodynamically stable patient with low-to-moderate suspicion, contrast-enhanced CT can help assess extent and alternative diagnoses and, if negative, may support nonoperative management with close observation. However, in unstable patients or those with high clinical suspicion, imaging must not delay emergent surgical consultation and debridement, and a negative CT should not override clinical judgment. If imaging is pursued, MRI offers superior soft-tissue contrast but is slower and less available, whereas ultrasound/POCUS can rapidly detect fascial fluid and guide urgency at the bedside [^112JBKL9] [^114azqJR] [^116xAVuM].

> Bottom line, with caveats: a negative CT scan cannot absolutely rule out necrotizing fasciitis, especially in early disease or in patients with high clinical suspicion. While a high-quality study suggested a 100% NPV, broader evidence and biological plausibility indicate imperfect sensitivity, so clinical suspicion should remain the decisive factor and surgical exploration should not be delayed when the presentation is concerning [^113mGPo6] [^113oRyfC] [^112WWxis] [^1151HDCN].

---

CT cannot reliably rule out necrotizing fasciitis (NF) because **early disease may show no CT abnormalities** and **false negatives are common** [^113oRyfC] [^112WWxis]. CT may show fascial thickening, edema, or gas, but these findings are neither sensitive nor specific enough to exclude NF [^1151HDCN] [^117LZwxd]. MRI has higher sensitivity but is slower and less available; **clinical suspicion remains the key** [^117NTk8r] [^1151HDCN]. If NF is suspected, **do not delay surgical consultation** for imaging [^112JBKL9] [^113UQqA3].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of CT for necrotizing fasciitis

CT is **not definitive** for NF: sensitivity and specificity vary, and false negatives occur, especially early [^113oRyfC] [^112WWxis].

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: CT sensitivity ranges from ~80–100% and specificity from ~81–98%, depending on criteria and cohort [^113mGPo6] [^113oRyfC] [^114azqJR] [^112FUt58].
- **False negatives**: Early NF may show no gas, fascial thickening, or edema, yielding false negatives [^117LZwxd] [^111ho64u].
- **Specific CT findings**: Fascial thickening, fat stranding, fluid along fascial planes, and subcutaneous gas suggest NF but are not pathognomonic [^113mGPo6] [^117LZwxd].

---

## Limitations of CT in ruling out necrotizing fasciitis

CT has **important limitations** in excluding NF:

- **Early disease**: Early NF may have minimal or no CT findings, limiting sensitivity [^117LZwxd] [^112WWxis].
- **Patient factors**: Obesity, edema, and poor contrast can obscure findings [^notfound].
- **False positives**: Cellulitis, abscess, or non-necrotizing infections can mimic NF on CT [^117LZwxd].

## Comparison with other imaging modalities

| **Attribute** | **Ct** | **Mri** | **Ultrasound** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Sensitivity | 80–100% | 100% | 85–100% |
| Specificity | 81–98% | 86% | 44–98% |
| Advantages | Fast, widely available, good for gas detection | High soft-tissue contrast, early fascial changes | Bedside, no radiation, early fascial fluid |
| Limitations | False negatives, radiation, contrast risks | Slow, limited availability, motion artifacts | Operator-dependent, limited field |

---

MRI has **higher sensitivity** but is slower and less available; ultrasound is **bedside and radiation-free** but operator-dependent [^116d1orL] [^116k6zni].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize that **clinical suspicion outweighs imaging** [^113UQqA3] [^1151HDCN]:

- **Clinical diagnosis**: NF is primarily a clinical diagnosis; imaging is adjunctive [^1151HDCN].
- **Do not delay surgery**: Do not delay surgical consultation for imaging if NF is suspected [^112JBKL9] [^113UQqA3].
- **Imaging role**: Use CT/MRI/ultrasound to assess extent or guide surgery, not to rule out NF [^112goTU7] [^113UQqA3].

---

## Clinical scenarios where CT may be useful

CT can aid **surgical planning** by defining disease extent and guiding operative strategy [^112goTU7] [^112ddpjh]. It also helps evaluate alternative diagnoses — such as abscess, cellulitis, or osteomyelitis — when NF is less likely [^114v1SHF]. In hemodynamically stable patients with low-to-moderate suspicion, CT can support decision-making, but clinical vigilance remains essential [^114byawk].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

CT **cannot reliably rule out NF** because of false negatives and limited specificity [^113oRyfC] [^11613UGV]. Clinical suspicion should drive urgent surgical consultation and debridement; imaging should not delay care [^112JBKL9] [^116FGeyW]. Use CT only to assess extent or alternative diagnoses, and maintain a high index of suspicion even with negative imaging [^114v1SHF] [^117LZwxd] [^1151HDCN].

### Necrotizing fasciitis: strategies for diagnosis and management [^116QmLg2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is uncommon and difficult to diagnose, and it cause progressive morbidity until the infectious process is diagnosed and treated medically and surgically. The literature addressed NF contains confusing information, inaccurate bacteriologic data, and antiquated antibiotic therapy. A delay in diagnosis is associated with a grave prognosis and increased mortality. The main goal of the clinician must be to establish the diagnosis and initially treat the patient within the standard of care. This review is planned as a guide for the clinician in making an early diagnosis of NF and initiating effective medical and surgical therapy.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and management with three case reports: torso, abdominal wall, upper and lower limbs [^114TSoaU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Early clinical status during the first 24 hours usually includes minor trauma, skin infection like folliculitis or abscess, gangrene on the extremities, pressure sore(s), or a complicated surgical incision like hernia repair. The external signs on the skin may be erythema or induration. The patient usually feels pain on the site of the injury. There is a disproportion between the character of the injury and intensity of the pain. Pain out of proportion with the apparent lesion severity should suggest a possible NF diagnosis.

During the next 2–4 days, the pain becomes more intense. In the clinical status we find many symptoms of general toxicity like fever, dehydration, confusion, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, weakness and malaise. If the patient is not admitted to an ICU or the diagnosis is established late in its course, more serious clinical symptoms ensue. The limbs and the area of body where the patient felt pain begin to swell, and may show a purplish rash or blisters with "dish-wash" purulent or haemorrhagic fluid. Cutaneous changes may be minimal, or may progress to blisters and bullae, and then to circumscribed necrosis of skin. Also, emphysema and gas formations with crepitations in overlying skin may appear. The pain grows, but remains an disproportionate to the clinical picture.

Diagnostic imaging modalities

The most important clinical signs of NF are tissue necrosis, putrid discharge, bullae, severe pain, gas formations in soft tissue, rapid spreading through fascial planes and the lack of classical tissue inflammatory signs, i.e. " dolor, color, rubor, tumor and functio laesa ". Today, CT and MRI are superior methods compared to sonography, scintigraphy and plain radiography, which also provide useful information about the nature and the extent of necrotizing infection. Nevertheless, physical examination and a clear understanding of the clinical picture are the most important means in establishing an early diagnosis of any type of NSTI and NF.

Treatment

Successful treatment of NSTI requires a multidisciplinary approach from the onset and coordination between general practitioners and surgeons for outpatient cases, and between the surgeons and other specialists in hospital facilities. The first and economically most important decision in treating necrotizing infections concerns the need for hospitalization. Most pyodermas and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections do not require hospitalization. Complicated necrotizing infections often require admission, especially if fascia or muscle involvement is suspected. If the process is rapidly progressing, signs of systemic toxemia develop, the diagnosis or prognosis is in doubt, exploratory surgery is contemplated or the patient cannot adequately comply with outpatient treatment. These days NSTI and NF still exists as a life threatening soft tissue disease, therefore patient must be promptly admitted into a hospital ICU in which appropriate treatment including radical surgical debridement of the entire affected area should be performed. The fluid resuscitation must be ordered immediately upon arrival, to maintain hemodynamic stability and vital functions.

### Lower limb necrotising fasciitis descending from malignant colonic perforation: a rare pattern [^1146dLR4]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Clostridium species are anaerobes often present in polymicrobial infections, known to produce gas which can result in crepitus clinically and gas on X-ray; however, gas is not present in all cases of NF and may only be present in around 18–38% of cases. Alternatively, in monomicrobial infections, virulent bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes release toxins with rapid progression to toxic shock syndrome, involving profound systemic compromise and multiorgan failure requiring intensive care support.

The diagnosis of NF relies on a high index of suspicion and debridement should not be delayed; however, in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, further investigations may provide evidence to support the need for surgical interventions. Gross derangement of blood will often be present, including elevated C reactive protein, white cell count, creatine kinase, lactic acidosis and deranged clotting function. Acute kidney injury may also be present. Blood cultures may be positive in up to 27% of NF cases if obtained prior to administration of antibiotics, compared with just 2% of cellulitis cases; however, the time taken to yield blood culture results limits diagnostic value in the acute setting.

X-ray is not a sensitive diagnostic modality and while gas may or may not be visible, absence of it does not rule out NF. MRI is 100% sensitive and 86% specific. It shows gas tracking, fat stranding and fascial thickening. CT is 80% sensitive.

While investigations can be useful, NF is ultimately a clinical diagnosis and where suspicion of NF is high, investigations should not delay surgical debridement. A delay of 24 hours or more is an independent risk factor for mortality. Intraoperative findings may include lack of bleeding, necrotic, non-contractile tissues, 'dishwater pus' and lack of resistance in usually adherent tissues. Here, we are reporting a rare, unusual case of lower limb necrotising fasciitis which required a high index of clinical suspicion and timely intervention to achieve adequate source control with good outcome.

### Soft tissue and joint infection [^114XAo58]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Soft tissue infection may be acute or chronic and may be introduced by the haematogenous route, or by inoculation, including surgical infection, or spread from other areas. The spectrum of infecting organism differs in primary infection, in immunodeficiency or when foreign bodies, including prostheses, are present. Bacterial infections are usually more rapid than those due to fungi or atypical organisms. Inflammation usually begins as cellulitis, proceeding through necrosis to cavitation and abscess formation, sometimes complicated by haemorrhage. Imaging, apart from MRI in selected cases, is rarely helpful in the early stages, but early diagnosis of pyomyositis and necrotizing fasciitis is mandatory. When infection is established, US, CT and MRI all have individual value in diagnosis, including biopsy, and in directing therapy, including percutaneous or surgical drainage or debridement. Both MRI and CT are best suited to monitoring progress. Septic arthritis presents as rapidly progressive, destructive arthritis, and early diagnosis is essential to prevent long-term morbidity. Ultrasound offers the best method of detecting early joint effusion and synovial thickening, but aspiration is usually required for diagnosis. In more advanced stages CT is valuable for revealing destructive changes, and MRI for documenting intra-articular changes and detecting inflammation in surrounding bone.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^111QVQ1S]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

In order to predict the presence of necrotizing soft tissue infection, a group of investigators described the development and application of the Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing infection (LRINEC) score in a 2004 report. This scoring system assigned points for abnormalities in six independent variables: serum C-reactive protein level (> 150 mg/L), WBC count (> 15,000/μL), hemoglobin level (< 13.5 g/dL), serum sodium level (< 135 mmol/L), serum creatinine level (> 1.6 mg/dL), and serum glucose level (> 180 mg/dL). With a score of 8 or higher, there is a 75% risk of a necrotizing soft tissue infection. The authors recommended that the LRINEC score be used to determine which patients require further diagnostic testing, given that the negative predictive value of this screening tool was 96%. Subsequent evaluation of the LRINEC score has demonstrated that it lacks the sensitivity to be a useful adjunct for the diagnosis of necrotizing infections.

The diagnosis of NSTIs is primarily a clinical diagnosis. However, plain radiographs, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be able to provide useful information for necrotizing infection when the diagnosis is uncertain.

The most common plain radiographic findings are similar to those of cellulitis, with increased soft-tissue thickness and opacity. Frequently, plain radiographs are normal unless the infection and necrosis are advanced. The characteristic finding is gas in the soft tissues, but subcutaneous gas may be present in few cases of necrotizing infection and is not present in pure aerobic infections such as those caused by S. pyogenes.

Additionally, subcutaneous gas may not be present in earlier stages of the disease process and only become manifest as the patient's condition deteriorates.

12) Both CT and MRI may be useful for diagnosing necrotizing soft tissue infections. However MRI may be difficult to perform under emergency situations. (Recommendation 2 C).

### Triple diagnostics for early detection of ambivalent necrotizing fasciitis [^113RB5wq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Necrotizing fasciitis is a relatively rare disease, which describes a group of infections that comprises skin, soft tissue and muscle and swiftly can spread through fascial planes. The disease can be rapidly progressive and can have devastating outcome with many patients not surviving the infection (up to 70% mortality rate reported in past series). Early diagnosis followed by immediate and thorough surgical debridement of affected tissue is necessary to prevent mortality and curb the systemic effects from resultant sepsis. However, diagnosis in the early stages can be challenging. Patients with necrotizing fasciitis might be brought to the ICU because of their sepsis without known cause and later prove unresponsive to resuscitation therapy. In a systematic review, a close correlation between the percentage of initially missed cases and the mortality rate in the presented cohort series has been described. A 75% mortality reduction has been reported if operated within 12 h after onset. Moreover, a mismatch between external signs and affected fascia has been mentioned. Thus, early recognition, timely surgery and thorough initial debridement are mandatory for survival.

Over the last decade, mortality rate has decreased to 20–40% in reported series. Some have attributed this to the improved awareness for necrotizing fasciitis at general practitioners and ED-physicians, probably due to the attention that has been given to this disease in medical journals and general media. Due to this improved awareness, patients are presented to the different surgical specialties in more early stages of their disease. This is a challenge for the treating surgeon, as local signs can be minimal and only become more prominent as the disease progresses. In these early stages of necrotizing fasciitis, triple diagnostics is suggested to be a useful adjunct in obtaining a diagnosis. We provide an algorithm that contributes in the early phases of these patients in which a fresh frozen section and Gram staining can be of paramount importance to the treating surgeon. Implementation of this algorithm was analysed.

### Point of care ultrasound in the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis [^115KYaJ9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a severe, life-threatening soft tissue infection requiring prompt diagnosis and immediate surgical debridement. Imaging, including a computed tomography (CT) scan, can often aid in the diagnosis, though it can prolong time to treatment and diagnosis. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is often used in the ED to identify soft tissue infections. The objective of this study is to evaluate the use of POCUS to identify NF in patients presenting to the emergency department.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) with suspected soft tissue infection who received a computed tomography and/or surgical consult. POCUS images of the suspected site of infection were obtained by the emergency medicine physician and interpreted based on sonographic findings of NF. These findings were compared with CT scan or surgical impression.

Results

We enrolled 64 patients in this study. Eight were determined to be at high risk of having NF based on CT scan and/or surgical impression. All of these patients also had POCUS images interpreted as concerning for NF. Furthermore, 56 patients were classified as being low risk for having NF based on CT scan and/or surgical impression. All but one of these patients had POCUS images interpreted as not concerning for NF.

Conclusions

Our data indicates that POCUS can be used to identify NF with a high sensitivity and specificity.

### About necrotizing fasciitis | Group A strep… [^113cjvgC]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare, but serious bacterial infection.
- It can develop very quickly into a life-threatening emergency.
- Early symptoms include fever, severe pain, and an infection that spreads quickly.
- People with necrotizing fasciitis need immediate hospital care, antibiotics, and surgery.
- Speak with a healthcare provider if you have concerns about necrotizing fasciitis. Symptoms Necrotizing fasciitis spreads very quickly. Early symptoms can include:

- A red, warm, or swollen area of skin that spreads quickly
- Fever
- Severe pain, including beyond the area that's red, warm, or swollen. Complications Necrotizing fasciitis can lead to
- Organ failure
- Sepsis
- Shock It can also result in life-long complications from loss of limbs or severe scarring due to surgically removing infected tissue. Recent data show how deadly necrotizing fasciitis can be. Even with treatment, up to 1 in 5 people died from the infection.

Testing and diagnosis There are many infections that look similar to necrotizing fasciitis in the early stages, which can make diagnosis difficult. In addition to looking at the injury or infection, healthcare providers can diagnose necrotizing fasciitis with:

- Biopsies
- Bloodwork for signs of infection and muscle damage
- Imaging of the damaged area However, it's important to start treatment as soon as possible. Therefore, healthcare providers may not wait for test results if they think a patient might have necrotizing fasciitis. Treatment and recovery Necrotizing fasciitis is a very serious illness that requires hospital care. Antibiotics and surgery are typically necessary. Antibiotics To try to stop the infection, healthcare providers give antibiotics through an IV, which allows medicine to flow into a vein.

Sometimes, however, antibiotics can't reach all the infected areas because the bacteria have killed too much tissue and reduced blood flow. When this happens, healthcare providers must surgically remove the dead tissue. Surgery Since necrotizing fasciitis can spread rapidly, patients often must get surgery quickly. It's not unusual for someone with necrotizing fasciitis to end up needing multiple surgeries. In serious cases, the patient may need a blood transfusion.

### What is subacute necrotizing fasciitis? A proposed clinical diagnostic criteria [^1117xLvH]. The Journal of Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Subacute necrotizing fasciitis is a poorly defined clinical entity. Its very existence has been the subject of much controversy. While rarely reported, subacute forms of necrotizing fasciitis have been documented in the literature by many authors. This paper highlights some recently reported cases in the literature that clearly shows that subacute forms of necrotizing fasciitis indeed exist and may in fact be under-reported because of the lack of awareness and a consistent diagnostic criteria.

Methods

A Medline search was performed with the following keyword; necrotizing fasciitis, subacute, variant and indolent.

Results

Majority of reported cases did not give sufficient information to satisfy the reviewer that these cases were indeed subacute forms of necrotizing fasciitis. We identified three cases of subacute necrotizing fasciitis that clearly are subacute cases and analysed their clinical presentation. A diagnostic criterion for defining subacute necrotizing fasciitis was proposed based on these cases and the authors' clinical experiences.

Conclusion

This proposed diagnostic criterion serves to facilitate future reporting and documentation of this condition. The clinical significance and implication of this are discussed.

### Necrotizing fasciitis with Clostridium perfringens after laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^111Xgxia]. Surgical Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive infection of the fascia and subcutaneous tissues accompanied by a high mortality rate approaching 80% to 100%. Factors that predispose patients to this life-threatening complication include obesity, malnutrition, malignancy, chronic alcoholism, drug abuse, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and immunosuppressive therapy. The pathomechanisms for the development of this rare disease still remain unclear. We report a case of necrotizing fasciitis with Clostridium perfringens after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patient left the hospital 5 months after admission. Early recognition based on clinical signs (pain, asymmetric abdominal thickening, crepitus) and computed tomography scanning (gas dissection along fascial planes), in conjunction with prompt, aggressive surgical therapy and debridement of all devitalized tissue, high-dose antibiotic therapy, and therapy at the intensive care unit, appears to afford patients the best chance of survival.

### Can necrotizing soft tissue infection be reliably diagnosed in the emergency department? [^112GCf3M]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Imaging is another diagnostic modality to consider. Plain films have been demonstrated to be of low sensitivity and specificity and should not be used in the diagnosis of NSTI but may be useful in certain patient groups such as intravenous drug users to identify foreign bodies. Cross-sectional imaging appears to have some promise. CT seems to be the most clinically available, with images that are rapidly acquired and interpretable by surgeons. The first reported series of 67 patients with NSTI who underwent CT scanning as part of their management concluded that CT was 100% sensitive and 81% specific. Those investigators concluded that CT could reliably exclude NSTI. The features specifically assessed were soft tissue asymmetry, muscle necrosis, gas and fluid collections.

The findings of this study were confirmed and extended by a group which examined a series of 305 patients undergoing CT imaging for NSTI assessment. Using these data, the authors synthesized a weighted scoring system based on the presence of fascial air, muscle/fascial edema, fluid tracking, lymphadenopathy and subcutaneous edema. A value greater than six or greater had a sensitivity of 86.3%, a specificity of 91.5% with an AUC of 0.928.

Although the presented evidence is compelling, most studies are collected retrospectively and the few studies with a control group generally rely on patients with non-NSTI, which can introduce significant heterogeneity. To address this issue, a large prospective observational study is currently underway in Northern Europe called the Immune Failure in Critical Therapy study. This project aims to recruit 400–500 patients collecting data on several diagnostic, treatment and outcome variables.

### Cervical necrotizing fasciitis, diagnosis and treatment of a rare life-threatening infection [^11613UGV]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Importance

Necrotizing fasciitis is a relatively uncommon and potentially life-threatening soft tissue infection, with morbidity and mortality approaching 25% to 35%, even with optimal treatment. The challenge of diagnosis for necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) is their rarity, with the incidence of approximately 1000 cases annually in the United States. Given the rapid progression of disease and its similar presentation to more benign processes, early and definitive diagnosis is imperative.

Findings

Signs and symptoms of NSTIs in the early stages are virtually indistinguishable from those seen with abscesses and cellulitis, making definitive diagnosis difficult. The clinical presentation will depend on the pathogen and its virulence factors which ultimately determine the area and depth of invasion into tissue. There are multiple laboratory value scoring systems that have been developed to support the diagnosis of an NSTI. The scoring system with the highest positive (92%) and negative (96%) predictive value is the laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC). The score is determined by 6 serologic markers: C-reactive protein (CRP), total white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin, sodium, creatinine, and glucose. A score ≥ 6 is a relatively specific indicator of necrotizing fasciitis (specificity 83.8%), but a score < 6 is not sensitive (59.2%) enough to rule out necrotizing fasciitis. In terms of imaging, computed tomography (CT) imaging, while more sensitive (80%) than plain radiography in detecting abnormalities, is just as nonspecific. Computed tomography imaging of NSTIs demonstrates fascial thickening (with potential fat stranding), edema, subcutaneous gas, and abscess formation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has demonstrated sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 86%, though MRI may not show early cases of fascial involvement of necrotizing fasciitis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Necrotizing soft tissue infections are rapidly progressive and potentially fatal infections that require a high index of clinical suspicion to promptly diagnose and aggressive surgical debridement of affected tissue in order to ensure optimal outcomes. Prompt surgical and infectious disease consultation is necessary for the treatment and management of these patients. While imaging is useful for further characterization, it should not delay surgical consultation. Necrotizing soft tissue infection remains a clinical diagnosis, although plain radiography, CT imaging, and ultrasound can provide useful clues. In general, the management of these patients should include rapid diagnosis, using a combination of clinical suspicion, laboratory data (LRINEC score), and imaging (MRI being the recommended imaging modality), prompt infectious disease and surgical consultation, surgical debridement, and delayed reconstruction. Laboratory findings that can more strongly suggest a diagnosis of NSTI include elevated CRP, elevated WBC, low hemoglobin, decreased sodium, and increased creatinine. Imaging findings include fascial thickening (with potential fat stranding), edema, subcutaneous gas, and abscess formation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started in all cases of suspected NSTI. Surgical debridement, however, remains the lynchpin for treatment of cervical necrotizing fasciitis.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and management with three case reports: torso, abdominal wall, upper and lower limbs [^1177rMMR]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

In highly suspicious cases of necrotizing infections a multidisciplinary team approach is mandatory, involving the GP doctor, general and plastic surgeons, radiologists, microbiologists, physiotherapists and nutritionists. In the majority of clinical cases, surgeons have a high responsibility level for timely and appropriate surgical treatment and therefore the final outcome. Thus, early surgical debridement, combined with broad spectrum antibiotics, intensive care therapy and adjuvant HBO therapy should become part of the "Treatment doctrine for NSTI and NF", as well as for the treatment of clostridial myonecrosis.

Patient Consent

Written informed consent was obtained from the patients for publication of this case report and accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal.

### Differentiating necrotizing soft tissue infections from cellulitis by soft tissue infectious fluid analysis: a pilot study [^114scAD7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) is a life-threatening soft tissue infection which is characterized by rapid progressive destruction of the muscle fascia and the surrounding soft tissue. A delay in diagnosis and management, including a delay in administering broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement, increases mortality and morbidity (e.g. amputation). Distinguishing NSTI from cellulitis on the basis of clinical symptoms and signs may be difficult initially. Several diagnostic adjuncts, including laboratory tests, the Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) scoring system, soft tissue ultrasonography, enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fascia biopsy, have been developed to accurately diagnose NSTI. However, early diagnosis of NSTI remains a challenge because no single examination provides both timely and accurate information for the differential diagnosis of NSTI and non-NSTI.

The fascia necrotizes and the tissue is damaged due to the rapid progressive infection from the subcutaneous tissue to the deep facia. Imaging studies have revealed obvious fat stranding and infectious fluid accumulation along the fascia layer. However, no previous studies have been designed to evaluate the pathological fascial fluid. This retrospective study aimed to explore the characteristics of the infectious fluid that appears during NSTI and compare these characteristics with those of the infectious fluid that appears during cellulitis.

### Modern concepts of the diagnosis and treatment of necrotizing fasciitis [^115kSUPV]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Necrotizing fasciitis is a potentially fatal infection involving rapidly progressive, widespread necrosis of the superficial fascia.

Objectives

The purpose of this collective review is to review modern concepts of the treatment and diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis.

Discussion

Necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by widespread necrosis of the subcutaneous tissue and the fascia. Although the pathogenesis of necrotizing fasciitis is still open to speculation, the rapid and destructive clinical course of necrotizing fasciitis is thought to be due to multibacterial symbiosis. During the last two decades, scientists have found that the pathogenesis of necrotizing fasciitis is usually polymicrobial, rather than monomicrobial. Although there has been no published well-controlled, clinical trial comparing the efficacies of various diagnostic imaging modalities in the diagnosis of necrotizing infections, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred technique to detect soft tissue infection. MRI provides unsurpassed soft tissue contrast and spatial resolution, has high sensitivity in detecting soft tissue fluid, and has multiplanar capabilities. Percutaneous needle aspiration followed by prompt Gram's staining and culture for a rapid bacteriologic diagnosis in soft tissue infections is recommended. Surgery complemented by antibiotics is the primary treatment of necrotizing fasciitis.

Conclusion

Wide, extensive debridement of all tissues that can be easily elevated off the fascia with gentle pressure should be undertaken. Successful use of intravenous immunoglobulin has been reported in the treatment of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. The use of adjunctive therapies, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, for necrotizing fasciitis infection continues to receive much attention.

How can necrotizing infections be classified?

Patients with NSTIs should be classified into the following:
High risk of poor outcome.
Mild/moderate risk of poor outcome.

Scores used for severity assessment of patients with necrotizing infections may be useful in the emergency room or outside the intensive care unit (ICU) and may identify patients early, who require surgical treatment and perioperative intensive care management (recommendation 1C).

Several classifications of NSTIs have been proposed; however, none are universally accepted. Necrotizing infections have been described according to their anatomical locations (i.e. Fournier gangrene) and the depth of infections: dermal and subcutaneous components (necrotizing cellulitis), fascial component (necrotizing fasciitis), and muscular components (necrotizing myositis). NSTIs may also be classified into three types defined by the bacterial pathogens initiating the infection and their typical clinical characteristics: type 1 — polymicrobial, type 2 — mono-microbial pathogenic β-hemolytic streptococci or CA-MRSA, and type 3 — mono-microbial secondary to a variety of pathogenic bacilli. However, resolution of these nomenclature issues requires a consensus among international infectious disease physicians, surgeons, and intensivists, and probably, these various methods of classification are not clinically useful. Although many specific variations of NSTIs have been described, the initial approach to diagnosis, antimicrobial treatment, and surgical intervention is similar for all forms and identifying those infections needing immediate aggressive management is more important than determining the specific variant.

Delay in diagnosis and/or treatment of NSTIs correlates with a poor outcome, leading to multiple organ failure. Early prognostic evaluation of NSTIs is crucial to assess the severity and decide the aggressiveness of treatment. Necrotizing infections remain an important source of patient morbidity and are frequently associated with poor clinical prognosis. Any process of improving quality of care for necrotizing infections globally should focus on simple diagnostic criteria based on physical examination findings and recognition of patients needing timely critical care.

A classification of patients based on a severity assessment which could identify cases requiring surgical and critical care may be an important tool both in ICU and outside of the ICU. The Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score first published in 2004 is based on routinely performed parameters and offers a method to identify NSTIs at early stage. With a score of 8 or higher, there is a 75% risk of a NSTI.

Learning points

A carbuncle typically develops at the back of the neck in middle-aged and older men and is especially likely to occur in persons with diabetes, resulting from folliculitis that can occur in any skin lesion bearing hair including in the head, neck, trunk, buttocks and extremities, as a single lesion or multiple lesions.
The Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score is used with laboratory evaluation for suggesting necrotising fasciitis was high. Patients with a LRINEC score of ≥ 6 should be carefully evaluated for the presence of necrotising fasciitis.
When soft tissue infection is severe, it is difficult to distinguish necrotising fasciitis from abscess with necrotic tissue. Systemic symptoms (pain disproportionate to clinical signs, hypotension, skin necrosis and haemorrhagic bullae) and laboratory evaluation should be considered together. In either case, surgical exploration and biopsy are needed to determine the extent of the infection, to assess the need for debridement and to obtain specimens for Gram staining and culture.

### The role of radiologic evaluation in necrotizing soft tissue infections [^1127fcSP]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The role of diagnostic imaging in suspected necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) is not clear owing to concerns about its value and possible delays in definitive surgical care.

Methods

Plain radiograph (XR) and computed tomography (CT) results of all patients who underwent operative debridement for a presumed NSTI from 2007 through 2014 at LAC + USC Medical Center were reviewed. Preoperative imaging was classified as being negative, suspicious (inflammatory changes), or diagnostic (soft tissue gas) for NSTI.

Results

Of 226 patients undergoing operative exploration for a suspected NSTI, 172 (76.1%) were found to have a true NSTI based on intraoperative or pathology findings. In patients with true NSTI, preoperative XR and CT demonstrated soft tissue gas in 47.9% and 70.3% of cases, respectively. CT diagnosed or highly suspected NSTI in 97.3% of cases with true NSTI compared to 83.6% with XR; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

CT was superior to XR in the radiologic evaluation of patients with suspected NSTIs.

Level Of Evidence

Diagnostic test, level IV.

### Triple diagnostics for early detection of ambivalent necrotizing fasciitis [^1133hWLj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

To aid in the identification of patients with necrotizing fasciitis, several adjuncts have been described. A large base deficit or high Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score have been suggested to increase the possibility of a patient having necrotizing fasciitis, however, they are not tools to provide a definitive diagnosis. Their values may provide insight in the severity of disease, however, sensitivity remains low.

Imaging studies might provide additional information. Although air in the fascial planes is seldom present in the early stages and fascial fluid collections are not always seen. Moreover, CT-scanning might provide information about underlying conditions in cases for necrotizing fasciitis in the maxillo-facial area or trunk (Fournier), such as diverticulitis or abscesses. Some clinics have incorporated CT-scanning in their standard work-up for hemodynamic stable patients with fasciitis to screen for underlying pathology. In certain cases CT helps to evaluate the extent of tissue infection showing swelling, inflammation and gas formation.

MRI scanning proves to have the highest sensitivity and specificity. However, MRI scanning may not be desirable in all patients or available in all hospitals. Furthermore, the exact contribution of imaging modalities in the early stages of necrotizing fasciitis is still under debate and should always be correlated with the clinical presentation. In more advanced cases treatment should not be delayed for imaging. Taken together, clinical suspicion should outweigh both laboratory and imaging adjuncts for the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis, especially in the early stages of the disease, where the therapeutic yield of debridement is the greatest. Clinical suspicion can be supported by fresh frozen section and Gram staining during incisional biopsy and might result in more timely identification of this life threatening condition.

Necrotizing fasciitis

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a particular form of soft-tissue infections that involves the deep fasciae. It is usually rapidly fatal, unless promptly recognized and surgically treated by extensive debridement. Distinguishing NF from non-NF based on clinical and biological results is difficult. The definite diagnostic criterion is surgical exploration that demonstrates necrotic fat with brownish color and lack of resistance to manual debridement along the deep fascial plane. The diagnosis of NF is difficult and often delayed because of variability in symptoms and signs. NF can be initially difficult to differentiate from cellulitis and other superficial infections of the skin. In fact, only 15 to 34% of patients with NF have an accurate diagnosis at admission. The course is generally acute with a rapid progression of the clinical manifestations, but it can also be subacute, merely in elderly patients and diabetics, requiring careful clinical follow-up. Imaging tests play a questionable role in the diagnosis of NF and their performance should in no way delay operative management. At MRI, the main abnormality found in NF is thickening of the deep fasciae, with high signal intensity on fluid-sensitive sequences and heterogeneous enhancement after contrast material injection resulting from fluid accumulation and hyperhemia along the necrotic fasciae (Fig. 10). Muscle changes may also occur, generally in a superficial and limited manner probably due to endomysium infiltration (Fig. 11). Several authors attempted to provide a more detailed description of the MRI features observed in NF in comparison with those observed in non-necrotizing fasciitis (non-NF). In a nutshell, no single criterion was highly accurate. Kim et al. showed that several features of the deep intermuscular fascia were found more frequently in NF than in non-NF including (a) abnormal high signal intensity measuring 3 mm or more in thickness, (b) extensive involvement at distance from the deep fascia, and (c) involvement of three or more compartments. Low signal intensity areas visible on all sequences and suggestive of gas were not found in non-NF and were present in 43% of case of NF. Anyway, MRI is less sensitive than CT scan which is the method of choice for the detection of gas in the soft tissues. Focal or diffuse absence of post-contrast signal enhancement within the fascial abnormalities were seen in 26% of non-NF and in 86% of NF. There is considerable discrepancy in the MRI evaluation of NF. Several key points deserve emphasis: (a) the absence of MRI abnormalities of the deep intermuscular fascia and connective tissue of the muscles rules out NF, (b) presence of gas along the deep fasciae is highly specific but not sensitive, (c) extensive thickening of the intermuscular fasciae with an appearance suggesting incomplete vascularization supports the diagnosis of NF, (d) presence of alterations confined to the peripheral deep fascia and to limited portions of the adjacent intermuscular fasciae is of borderline significance.

### The role of burn centers in the treatment of necrotizing soft-tissue infections: a nationwide Dutch study [^114byawk]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Besides comorbidity status being independently associated with misdiagnosis, pain was less frequently reported as presenting symptom in charts of patients who were initially misdiagnosed. Although pain is often present, and extreme pain requiring analgesics is accepted as indicative for the presence of NSTI, pain is not always severe and may even be absent. This is supported by findings of a recent study, in which severe pain requiring analgesics upon presentation was noted in less than half of the patients (42%) with NSTI. In our study, pain (of any intensity) was reported in 82% of the patients, indicating not all patients with NSTI experience (extreme) pain.

Though not found to be significantly different between those correctly diagnosed and misdiagnosed, some findings are relevant to discuss. First, fever (> 38.5 °C) is often absent in NSTI. Although NSTI are severe bacterial infections, which may lead clinicians to expect fever, only 21% of the patients in this study had fever upon presentation. This is in line with previous reports in which only 40% of patients with NSTI had a temperature of > 37.5 °C. Therefore, clinicians should realize the absence of fever cannot rule out the diagnosis NSTI. This is also true for the presence of a portal of entry; in approximately one in five patients in this study, no portal of entry was observed. This is in concordance with the up to half of the patients with GAS NSTI in which no portal of entry is present. In these patients, NSTI may be associated with blunt trauma, which was present in 11% in this study, or follow sport-related muscle injuries, or without clear local trauma or injury. The LRINEC score, which is intended as a tool to help differentiating between patients with a high risk and low risk of NSTI, was found to have a considerable false negative rate in this current study of 30%. Therefore, when using this score in practice, clinicians should be aware that it cannot be used to rule out NSTI. The same is true for ultrasound, which had a false negative rate of > 40% in our study. CT scans and MRI scans do perform better, which was also true in this study. These imaging modalities may therefore be valuable in case of low suspicion in stable patients, as well as for operative planning in anatomically challenging areas (pelvic area, neck). However, these imaging studies are time-consuming, and should not lead to delay of emergency surgical treatment, which also remains the golden standard for the diagnosis of NSTI.

### Soft-tissue infections and their imaging mimics: from cellulitis to necrotizing fasciitis [^113np78m]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

Infection of the musculoskeletal system can be associated with high mortality and morbidity if not promptly and accurately diagnosed. These infections are generally diagnosed and managed clinically; however, clinical and laboratory findings sometimes lack sensitivity and specificity, and a definite diagnosis may not be possible. In uncertain situations, imaging is frequently performed to confirm the diagnosis, evaluate the extent of the disease, and aid in treatment planning. In particular, cross-sectional imaging, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, provides detailed anatomic information in the evaluation of soft tissues due to their inherent high spatial and contrast resolution. Imaging findings of soft-tissue infections can be nonspecific and can have different appearances depending on the depth and anatomic extent of tissue involvement. Although many imaging features of infectious disease can overlap with noninfectious processes, imaging can help establish the diagnosis when combined with the clinical history and laboratory findings. Radiologists should be familiar with the spectrum of imaging findings of soft-tissue infections to better aid the referring physician in managing these patients. The aim of this article is to review the spectrum of soft-tissue infections using a systematic anatomic compartment approach. We discuss the clinical features of soft-tissue infections, their imaging findings with emphasis on cross-sectional imaging, their potential mimics, and clinical management. © RSNA, 2016.

### Musculoskeletal infection: role of CT in the emergency department [^114v1SHF]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal infection is commonly encountered in the emergency department and can take many forms, depending on the involvement of the various soft-tissue layers, bones, and joints. Infection may manifest as superficial cellulitis, necrotizing or nonnecrotizing fasciitis, myositis, a soft-tissue abscess, osteomyelitis, or septic arthritis. Because clinical parameters for the detection of musculoskeletal infection generally lack sensitivity and specificity, computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the assessment of potential musculoskeletal infections in the emergency department. CT provides an analysis of compartmental anatomy, thereby helping to distinguish among the various types of musculoskeletal infection and to guide treatment options. Specific imaging features exist that help identify the numerous forms of infection in the bones and soft tissues, and CT is invaluable for detecting deep complications of cellulitis and pinpointing the anatomic compartment that is involved by an infection. Although all patients with musculoskeletal infection will require treatment with antibiotics, CT helps guide therapy toward emergency surgical débridement in cases of necrotizing fasciitis and toward percutaneous drainage in cases of abscess formation.

Conclusions

In summary, we developed the MLRINEC score using a retrospective design. The risk stratification score demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in the differential diagnosis of NF and other soft-tissue infectious and may be useful in providing necessary information for reasonable suspicion of NF. The validity of the MLRINEC score still needs to be confirmed by further studies.

### Retroperitoneal fasciitis: spectrum of CT findings in the abdomen and pelvis [^112ddpjh]. Radiographics (2015). Low credibility.

Retroperitoneal fasciitis is a rare but potentially lethal complication of infection. Early diagnosis is crucial and is usually made when there is a high degree of clinical suspicion combined with characteristic imaging findings leading to early surgical intervention. Computed tomography (CT) can play a central role in demonstrating early findings, assessing the extent of disease to help determine the best surgical approach, identifying the primary source of infection, and evaluating the treatment response. The possible presence of retroperitoneal fasciitis should be considered in patients presenting with symptoms of sepsis, including pain that is disproportionate with the clinical abnormality. When retroperitoneal fasciitis is suspected, emergency CT can facilitate early diagnosis and evaluation of the extent of disease. Common findings at CT include fascial thickening and enhancement, muscular edema, fat stranding, fluid collections, and abscess formation. Gas tracking along fascial planes in the retroperitoneum is the hallmark of retroperitoneal fasciitis but is not seen in all cases. Another important clue to the diagnosis is asymmetric involvement of the retroperitoneal fascial planes and deep tissues. Fasciitis in the retroperitoneum may originate from infected retroperitoneal organs or from infection that spreads along indirect and/or direct pathways from a primary source elsewhere in the body. Findings of indirect tracking and transgression of fascial planes may indicate more severe infection associated with the necrotizing form of retroperitoneal fasciitis. Despite aggressive antibiotic treatment, early and repeated surgical débridement may be required to remove nonviable tissue in patients with the necrotizing form of retroperitoneal fasciitis. Awareness of the anatomy of the retroperitoneum, potential routes of spread of infection, and the spectrum of CT findings in retroperitoneal fasciitis is needed to achieve prompt diagnosis and guide treatment.

### Imaging of necrotizing fasciitis [^117NTk8r]. Clinical Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing Fasciitis (NF) is a rare, but highly lethal, rapidly progressive necrotic infection of the soft-tissue fascia. More common in immunocompromised patients, NF typically affects the extremities, perineal area, genital area (Fournier gangrene), and less commonly the torso. Although classically a clinical diagnosis, imaging is a powerful adjunct to facilitate early diagnosis in equivocal cases. The key features of NF of radiography, ultrasound, CT, and MRI are reviewed, as are the inherent limitations of NF diagnosis for each modality. With a high level of sensitivity, specificity, and soft tissue contrast, MRI remains the gold standard imaging method for evaluation of NF.

### The diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis [^1168y8wi]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A delay in the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of necrotizing fasciitis has clearly been demonstrated to increase mortality. However, paucity of specific cutaneous signs makes early recognition extremely difficult. This review highlights recent developments in the approaches to the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis.

Recent Findings

A clinical staging of necrotizing fasciitis is proposed to better define the progression of the disease. Several clinical subtypes of necrotizing fasciitis have been described recently with hyperacute and sub-acute variants. Imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging and frozen section biopsies, have been reported to be of value in the early recognition of necrotizing fasciitis. However availability and cost limit the routine use of these tests. Several diagnostic adjuncts that have been developed recently to help in early recognition will be discussed. These include the fasciitis LRINEC (laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis) score and transcutaneous tissue oxygen saturation monitoring. Some may have the potential for widespread application in the assessment of severe soft tissue infections.

Summary

Delayed recognition, with consequent massive soft tissue loss and sepsis, remains a deadly pitfall in the management of necrotizing fasciitis. With a better understanding of the clinical manifestations and the potential use and limitations of various diagnostic adjuncts available for the assessment of equivocal cases of soft tissue infections, it is hoped that a clear and logical approach to the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis may be developed.

### Multiple skip incision skin-sparing debridement for perianal necrotizing fasciitis: a retrospective study [^116LnuJt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

In the imaging examination for diagnosing PNF, CT is preferred and superior to conventional X-ray radiography. Although MRI offers higher soft-tissue resolution, it has greater sensitivity in identifying deep fascial involvement, which might lead to overestimation of deep-tissue involvement. Additionally, MRI requires more time and costs compared to CT scans, and it is not recommended to delay surgical management for MR when CT is available. For patients who cannot undergo CT or MRI scans, ultrasound examination may be considered. However, ultrasound might require repeated direct compression of the lesion, which may not be tolerated, and it has a relatively limited field of view and is operator dependent. In our study, all cases underwent CT examination, which typically showed fat deposition, fluid accumulation, and gas along the fascial planes of the involved soft tissues. However, the absence of gas detection by CT did not completely rule out early NF, as the sensitivity of CT for detecting gas was low, while its specificity was high, and gas appeared relatively late.

Once PNF was diagnosed, surgical debridement had to be performed early and thoroughly. Delaying treatment beyond 6–12 h or inadequately performing the initial surgical debridement can lead to higher rates of complications and mortality. Similarly, early surgical exploration is the best approach when there is uncertainty. All cases in our study underwent debridement surgery within 6 h of admission. Early thorough debridement and drainage, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, nutritional support, monitoring of vital signs, and repeated assessment of the condition are considered the main principles of treatment for NF. However, traditional surgical debridement methods often leave large anatomical defects, necessitating complex and prolonged postoperative reconstructive Surgeries. Although various reconstructive surgical techniques, including skin grafts, local advancement flaps, and muscle flaps, are currently available, the optimal reconstruction method remains debated, and there is a lack of objective data on patient satisfaction, functional recovery, and esthetics following reconstruction. Additionally, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that flaps result in better outcomes compared to skin grafts, and vice versa.

### Can necrotizing soft tissue infection be reliably diagnosed in the emergency department? [^112JmoCK]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

NSTI can rapidly progress to a life-threatening septic process, unless its evolution is curtailed by aggressive surgical debridement. Key to this is prompt diagnosis which can be straightforward in typical cases where patients present with classical features, but mimics and occult disease can confuse diagnostic accuracy. Several scoring systems which can be practicably applied in the ED, have been proposed, based on laboratory indices and cross-sectional imaging, but no test is infallible. Clinicians need to exercise a high threshold for considering the diagnosis of NSTI, use scoring systems judiciously, but fundamentally, surgical exploration remains the diagnostic gold standard.

### Multifocal necrotising fasciitis: an overlooked entity? [^114wnKTg]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study is to report a case of multi-focal necrotising fasciitis, review research on this subject to identify common aetiological factors and highlight suggestions to improve management.

Context

Necrotising fasciitis is a severe, life-threatening soft tissue infection that typically arises from a single area, usually secondary to a minor penetrating injury. Multi-focal necrotising fasciitis, where there is more than one non-contiguous area of necrosis, is much less commonly reported. There are no guidelines specific to the management of multi-focal necrotising fasciitis, and its under-reporting may lead to missed management opportunities.

Design

A systematic literature review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE, OLD MEDLINE and the Cochrane Collaboration was performed from 1966 to March 2011 using 16 search terms.

Data Extraction

All articles were screened for genuine non-contiguous multi-focal necrotising fasciitis. Of the papers that met this criterion, data on patient demographics, likely inciting injury, presentation time-line, microbial agents, sites affected, objective assessment scores, treatment and outcome were extracted.

Data Synthesis

A total of 31 studies met our inclusion criteria and 33 individual cases of multi-focal necrotising fasciitis were included in the quantitative analysis. About half (52%) of cases were type II necrotising fasciitis; 42% of cases had identifiable inciting injuries; 21% of cases developed multi-focal lesions non-synchronously, of which 86% were type II. Nearly all (94%) of cases had incomplete objective assessment scores. One case identified inflammatory imaging findings prior to clinical necrosis.

Conclusions

Multifocality in necrotising fasciitis is likely to be associated with type II disease. We postulate that validated objective tools will aid necrotising fasciitis management pathways that will identify high-risk groups for multifocality and advise early pre-emptive imaging. We recommend the adoption of regional multi-focal necrotising fasciitis registers.

13) In unstable patients ultrasound may be useful to differentiate simple cellulitis from necrotizing fasciitis (Recommendation 2 C).

Computed tomography (CT) has a higher sensitivity than plain radiography in identifying early necrotizing fasciitis. Findings consistent with necrotizing fasciitis are fat stranding, fluid and gas collections that dissect along fascial planes, and gas in the involved soft tissues. Additionally, fascial thickening and non-enhancing fascia on contrast CT suggests fascial necrosis.

In 2010 a case series study about CT for the diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections was published. Of 67 patients with study inclusion criteria, 58 underwent surgical exploration, and necrotizing soft tissue infection was confirmed in 25 (43%). The remaining 42 patients had either non-necrotizing infections during surgical exploration (n = 33) or were treated non-operatively with successful resolution of the symptoms (n = 9). The sensitivity of CT to identify NSTI was 100%, specificity was 81%, positive predictive value was 76%, and negative predictive value was 100%.

Magnetic resonance imaging has been the imaging modality of choice for necrotizing fasciitis. The patients with NF have usually a significantly greater frequency of the following MR findings: thick (≥ 3 mm) abnormal signal intensity on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images, low signal intensity in the deep fascia on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images, a focal or diffuse non-enhancing portion in the area of abnormal signal intensity in the deep fascia, extensive involvement of the deep fascia, and involvement of three or more compartments in one extremity.

Schmid et al. found MRI to be 100% sensitive and 86% specific and have a diagnostic accuracy of 94% for diagnosing necrotizing fasciitis. However, the authors noted that MRI imaging tends to overestimate the extent of deep fascial involvement. Therefore, treatment should be based on a combination of clinical findings and MRI results.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1151HDCN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis — diagnosis and microbiology emphasize polymicrobial involvement and tissue-based confirmation. Numerous different anaerobic and aerobic organisms can be cultured from the involved fascial plane, with an average of 5 pathogens in each wound, and most originate from bowel or genitourinary flora. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may show edema along the fascial plane, but sensitivity and specificity are ill defined, and in practice, clinical judgment is the most important element in diagnosis. A definitive bacteriologic diagnosis is best established by culture and Gram stain of deep tissue obtained at operation or by positive blood cultures; Gram-positive cocci in chains suggest Streptococcus and large gram-positive cocci in clusters suggest S. aureus. If there is no necrosis on exploratory incision, the procedure can be terminated with very little risk or morbidity, and while biopsy for frozen section analysis may be used, gross inspection usually suffices and biopsy alone may produce a false-negative result.

Figure 1
Postoperative view of Fournier's gangrene and necrotizing fasciitis of the abdominal wall with closed divergent colostomy.

NF of the AW and RS, even today, presents a challenging surgical issue. Skin incision must be performed in the longitudinal direction along the muscle-fascial layers of the inner AW until healthy fascia adherent to the overlying subcutaneous tissue and muscle is encountered. It is not indicated to perform two, three or more parallel incisions or any perpendicular incisions, because the bridges of skin and skin islands will usually not survive. Postoperative wound management on the AW consists of serial dressing changes during the next 24 h to 48 h, until the wound is free of recurrent or ongoing infection. When infection progresses across the deep fascial plane of the AW or a necrotic area on the skin appears, aggressive surgical debridement should be repeated. In our case with NF of the AW and RS we usually performed two to five debridement procedures to stabilize the wound conditions. The primary defect on the AW is usually large and it is repaired with advancement flaps using an abdominoplasty technique, biological mesh or skin grafts. These days, after the primary surgery of NF we can also use the topical negative pressure therapy (TNP), artificial skin (Integra), synthetic prosthetics and bio-prosthetic (biologic) mesh. In our particular case with caecum perforation during inguinal hernia repair, fecal peritonitis and septic shock were present. We performed explorative laparotomy via midline incision and found diffuse peritonitis, ischemia of small bowel and right colon, and NF of the RS. Published reports point out that ultrasound, native abdominal x-ray films or CT scanning are very useful preoperative diagnostic methods for bowel perforation with diffuse peritonitis, but the exact condition is always discovered intraoperatively. We decided to apply a combination of antimicrobial therapy that covers aerobes and anaerobes. After we received the results of microbiological analysis, we ordered antibiotics for each causative organism. During the first operation we performed an extensive surgical debridement of the RS, right hemicolectomy, diverting colostomy on the left colon and multiple drainages of the infected intra-abdominal fluid collections. There is still controversy about the optimal surgical management of colonic perforation complicated with peritonitis. Hartmann's resection has been considered the procedure of choice in cases with diffuse peritonitis and remains a safe technique for colectomy in a perforated colon, especially in elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities. More recently, some have suggested that primary resection with anastomosis is a modern approach, even in the presence of diffuse peritonitis. After the wound is stabilized with fresh granulation tissue, we could perform a second reconstruction of the AW defects, primarily with advanced flaps and skin grafts. The diverting colostomy was closed in a third operation.

### Point-of-care ultrasound diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis missed by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging [^1125exHX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare but deadly disease. Diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections can be challenging for a variety of reasons. Point-of-care (POC) ultrasound (US) has been described as a diagnostic tool to help the acute care clinician make the early diagnosis that is imperative to optimize outcomes.

Objective

To report a case of Group A Streptococcus NF recognized with POC US, and subsequent negative findings on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Case Report

A 54-year-old diabetic woman presented to the Emergency Department with atraumatic right foot and lower leg pain associated with fever. Examination was concerning for NF, and a POC US was performed, which showed thickened deep fascia and fluid tracking along the deep fascial plane, with fluid pockets measuring 6 mm in depth, consistent with NF. Surgical consultation was obtained. Per request, CT and MRI of the patient's lower extremity were performed; both were interpreted by the radiologist as showing changes consistent with cellulitis. Septic shock and multisystem organ failure ensued; the patient was eventually taken to the operating room, where operative findings were consistent with NF. Operative cultures grew Streptococcus pyogenes.

Conclusion

NF is a surgical emergency. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical to ensure the necessary aggressive management needed to optimize outcomes. This case illustrates the utility of POC US to make the prompt diagnosis of NF, particularly in light of subsequently negative CT and MRI.

### Foot pain and swelling after minor traumatic injury [^111522rG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare bacterial infection of the fascia and surrounding soft tissue, which carries a mortality rate as high as 20%, even in well-appearing patients [1]. Classically, this diagnosis must be made with computed tomography or magnetic resonance, but recent literature shows that ultrasonography, readily available in the emergency department, may be adequate for diagnosis [2]. We present a case of a 48-year-old man who presented with a painful rash. We used his clinical presentation and ultrasound to make the diagnosis, which was later corroborated with plain radiograph findings. He was taken immediately to the operating room for extensive debridement. He was discharged 8 days later in good condition.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113MEu1L]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis — surgical and antimicrobial management centers on urgent debridement, broad coverage for aerobes including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and targeted therapy for group A streptococcus. Surgical intervention is the primary therapeutic modality and is indicated when infection is confirmed or suspected, and most patients should return to the operating room 24–36 hours after the first debridement and then daily until no further debridement is needed. In the absence of definitive trials, antimicrobial therapy should continue until further debridement is unnecessary, the patient has improved clinically, and fever has been absent for 48–72 hours. For polymicrobial infections, treatment should cover both aerobes, including MRSA, and anaerobes, using vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin combined with one of piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem (imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, and ertapenem), ceftriaxone plus metronidazole, or a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole, with coverage modified once microbiology is known. Necrotizing fasciitis and/or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by group A streptococcus should be treated with both clindamycin and penicillin; clindamycin suppresses streptococcal toxin and cytokine production and observational studies suggest greater efficacy than β-lactams. Reported macrolide resistance in group A streptococci is < 5.0% in the United States, 8.2% in Germany, and 18.3% in Spain, and no resistance to clindamycin was found from invasive strains in Chicago.

### Fournier gangrene: role of imaging [^112goTU7]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

Fournier gangrene is a rapidly progressing necrotizing fasciitis involving the perineal, perianal, or genital regions and constitutes a true surgical emergency with a potentially high mortality rate. Although the diagnosis of Fournier gangrene is often made clinically, emergency computed tomography (CT) can lead to early diagnosis with accurate assessment of disease extent. CT not only helps evaluate the perineal structures that can become involved by Fournier gangrene, but also helps assess the retroperitoneum, to which the disease can spread. Findings at CT include asymmetric fascial thickening, subcutaneous emphysema, fluid collections, and abscess formation. Subcutaneous emphysema is the hallmark of Fournier gangrene but is not seen in all cases. Compared with radiography and ultrasonography, CT provides a higher specificity for the diagnosis of Fournier gangrene and superior evaluation of disease extent; however, diagnosis and evaluation can also be performed with these other modalities. The administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive surgical débridement of the nonviable tissue are both essential for successful treatment. An awareness of the CT features of Fournier gangrene is imperative for prompt diagnosis and effective treatment planning.

### Periorbital necrotizing fasciitis: the manchester experience [^113NwiYk]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have also advocated the use of CT scanning to support the diagnosis of PONF. Signs of NF on CT scanning include fascial thickening, fat stranding, gas tracking along fascial planes and abscesses. With none of our cases demonstrating gas on their initial CT scan, our results suggest that gas on the CT scan may not be a sensitive marker of PONF. CT scanning, however, is still useful in cases of suspected severe periocular infection to assess the extent of the infection and assist in surgical planning.

It is well-recognised that PONF has a more favourable mortality rate than the same infection elsewhere in the body. It has been postulated that the reason for the superior prognosis in PONF is the earlier presentation, given that the periocular region is highly visible, and swelling may lead to a reduction in vision. Secondly, antibiotics may have improved penetration to the periocular area, given the extensive blood supply of this region. This may result in more rapid uptake by tissues surrounding the necrotic areas, leading to slower dissemination of the infection. Finally, the orbital septal integrity may prevent or delay posterior orbital spread following pre-septal infection. In our study, we found a mortality rate of 0%, which was lower than that of some similar UK studies. This observation may be related to the fact that a number of patients with multiple risk factors, including trauma and drug or alcohol misuse, were excluded from the study as they were uncontactable to provide consent, leaving a potentially healthier cohort with fewer comorbidities.

### Ultrasound for the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis: a systematic review of the literature [^116xAVuM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a deadly disorder that can be challenging to diagnose on history and examination alone. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is widely available and has been increasingly used for diagnosing skin and soft tissue infections. We performed a systematic review to determine the accuracy of POCUS for diagnosing NF with subgroup analyses of the accuracy of specific POCUS examination components.

Methods

PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, the Cochrane databases, Google Scholar, and bibliographies of selected articles were assessed for all retrospective, prospective, and randomized control trials evaluating the accuracy of POCUS for diagnosing NF. Data were dual extracted into a predefined worksheet and quality analysis was performed with the QUADAS-2 tool. Data were summarized and an overall summary was completed.

Results

We identified three papers (n = 221 patients; 33% NF) that met our inclusion criteria. The overall sensitivity ranged from 85.4%-100% while the specificity ranged from 44.7% to 98.2%. Fluid accumulation along the fascial plane was the most sensitive (85.4%; 95% CI 72.2% - 93.9%), while subcutaneous emphysema was the most specific (100%; 95% CI 92.5% - 100%).

Conclusions

POCUS has good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of NF. POCUS should be considered as an adjunct to the initial clinical decision making for the diagnosis of NF.

### Determining optimum management of descending necrotizing mediastinitis with CT; experience with 32 cases [^1157ZbFs]. Emergency Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

To determine the value of helical computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis, management and outcome of patients suspected of having descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM). Thirty-two patients with suspected DNM were submitted to contrast-enhanced single detector-row helical CT, four detector-row CT and 16 detector-row CT of the neck and chest. In 10/32 patients (group 1) no abnormality was observed in the neck or in the chest spaces on CT scan. These patients were all treated non-operatively. In 12/32 patients (group 2) CT showed the presence in the neck spaces of fluid collections, fasciitis, cellulitis, myositis, jugular vein thrombosis and lymphadenopathy; in all these patients the chest was unaffected. A cervical drainage was performed in ten patients. In the remaining ten patients (group 3), the neck infection involved the mediastinal spaces in all the cases and the pleural and pericardial spaces; CT findings included mediastinal cellulitis and fluid collections, pleural and pericardial effusions, venous thrombosis and lymphadenopathy. In these patients, a cervico-mediastinal drainage was performed and antibiotics were administered. The CT provides a highly accurate depiction of the presence and the spread of DNM. The CT findings and the extension of disease are important factors in order to predict for patient management and outcome.

Subsequent evaluation of the LRINEC score has demonstrated conflicting results. Several studies have assessed the utility of LRINEC for the early diagnosis of necrotizing infections.

Recent evidence has demonstrated that it lacks the sensitivity to be a useful adjunct for the diagnosis of necrotizing infections.

The diagnosis of necrotizing infection is primarily a clinical diagnosis. However, radiologic imaging may be able to provide useful information when the diagnosis is uncertain. A plain X-ray should not be used to rule-out necrotizing infection (recommendation 1B).

In unstable patients, ultrasound may be useful to differentiate simple cellulitis from necrotizing fasciitis (recommendation 2C).

Imaging studies should not delay surgical consultation and intervention (recommendation 1A).

Frequently, plain radiographs are normal or with increased soft-tissue thickness and opacity, unless the infection and necrosis are advanced. The characteristic finding is gas in the soft tissues, but subcutaneous gas is present only in few cases of necrotizing infection and is not present in pure aerobic infections such as those caused by S. pyogenes.

Additionally, subcutaneous gas may not be present in earlier stages of the disease process and only become manifest as the patient's condition deteriorates.

Computed tomography (CT) has a higher sensitivity than plain radiography in identifying early NSTIs. Findings consistent with necrotizing infections are fat stranding, fluid and gas collections that dissect along fascial planes, and gas in the involved soft tissues. Additionally, fascial thickening and non-enhancing fascia on contrast CT suggests fascial necrosis.

In 2010, a case series study analyzing the use of CT scanning for the diagnosis of NSTIs was published. Of 67 patients with study inclusion criteria, 58 underwent surgical exploration, and NSTIs was confirmed in 25 (43%). The remaining 42 patients had either non-necrotizing infections during surgical exploration (n = 33) or were treated non-operatively with successful resolution of the symptoms (n = 9). The sensitivity of CT to identify NSTI was 100%, specificity was 81%, positive predictive value was 76%, and negative predictive value was 100%.

### Chance to cut: defining a negative exploration rate in patients with suspected necrotizing soft tissue infection [^113J4i4F]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) are rare, aggressive soft tissue infections with significant mortality if not appropriately diagnosed and expeditiously treated surgically. There are 500–1500 cases diagnosed annuallywith an incidence of 0.04 per 1000 person-years, which continues to increase.NSTIs remain challenging to diagnose given their rarity and wide range of clinical presentations that result in a lack of specific diagnostic criteria.

Multiple predictive models have been proposed to assist with distinguishing NSTI from other soft tissue infections. Although initially promising, subsequent studies have struggled to validate these models. Several authors acknowledge the key to diagnosis is a high index of suspicion. Due to the increased mortality associated with delay in surgical debridement, recent guidelines recommend operative debridement within 12 hours of diagnosis.

We recognized that despite using predictive models and having a mature experience with this disease process, a subset of patients taken to the operating room for the diagnosis of NSTI did not have one at exploration. We hypothesized that patients with negative operative explorations were clinically indistinguishable from those patients with an NSTI. The purpose of this study was to compare patients with and without a diagnosis of NSTI at surgical exploration and to describe a rate of negative exploration for this disease.

### Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI): pearls and pitfalls for the emergency clinician [^111MDT6m]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Skin and soft tissue infections are common emergency department (ED) presentations. These infections cover a wide spectrum of disease, from simple cellulitis to necrotizing fasciitis. Despite the commonality, a subset of skin and soft tissue infections known as necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) can cause significant morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review evaluates the current evidence regarding the presentation, evaluation, and management of NSTI from the ED perspective.

Discussion

NSTIs are commonly missed diagnoses. History and physical examination findings are inconsistent, and the risk factors for this high mortality disease are common amongst ED populations. Laboratory evaluation and the Laboratory Risk in Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score is helpful but is insufficient to rule out the disease. Imaging modalities including ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are highly sensitive and specific, but may delay definitive management. The gold standard for diagnosis includes surgical exploration. Surgical intervention and empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage are the foundations of treatment. Adjuvant therapies including hyperbaric oxygen and intravenous immunoglobulin have not yet been proven to be beneficial or to improve outcome.

Conclusion

NSTIs are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Knowledge of the history, examination, evaluation, and management is vital for emergency clinicians.

### Can necrotizing soft tissue infection be reliably diagnosed in the emergency department? [^112FUt58]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

NSTI cannot be reliably diagnosed in the ED (abridged summary)

Dr Sharon Henry MD, Professor of Surgery, R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center

The optimum method of diagnosing an NSTI is surgical exploration and direct inspection of the tissue, leading to the aggressive surgical debridement of dead and devitalized tissue as appropriate. Although the concept of a diagnostic algorithm that can be undertaken in the ED is conceptually attractive, no scoring system is sufficiently sensitive or specific to risk application in this disease process. Moreover, scoring systems risk introducing delays, although tests are performed and can confuse practitioners by generating decision paralysis.

When considering laboratory indices, numerous tests have been evaluated. A WCC > 14 achieves a diagnostic sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 76% for NSTI, but will still miss an unacceptable proportion of NSTI diagnoses. The LRINEC score attempts to address this shortcoming by evaluating several laboratory tests, but even a high score (> 6) attains a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 96% by the describing authors but has not been replicated in the follow-up studies.

Imaging has similar issues, with plain radiography demonstrating a less than 25% accuracy in identifying subcutaneous gas. Furthermore, the absence of gas does not permit the exclusion of NSTI. CT scanning achieves a sensitivity of 80%, which can be raised to 86% by assessing multiple features. MRI is reported to attain a 100% sensitivity and 86% specificity; however, this is a scarce resource and takes time to acquire the images.

Surgical exploration remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of NSTI. Laboratory and imaging tests can demonstrate the extent of disease and quantify physiological compromise, but patients with suspected NSTI belong in the operating room (OR). Clinicians must be judicious in their application of further tests in a disease whose mortality is time dependent.

### Getting it right the first time: frozen sections for diagnosing necrotizing soft tissue infections [^112ySZs6]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Imaging, such as plain radiographs or computed tomography (CT), has also been proposed for diagnosing (ambivalent) NSTIs; however, it is not part of the diagnostic work-up at our institute and remains controversial in the current literature. The use of CT-scans might be beneficial for certain patients, such as patients with a suspected intra-abdominal source of the infection. A few studies have evaluated the diagnostic value of CT scans, all reporting high specificity, but widely variable sensitivity results. Martinez et al. proposed diagnosing NSTIs by assessing CT-scans using four criteria, resulting in a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 98%. On the other hand, McGillicuddy et al. reported a sensitivity of 43% for diagnosing NSTI based on fascial air (specificity 98%) and a sensitivity of 39% for diagnosing NSTIs based on fluid tracking on CT-scans (specificity 85%), both criteria (with low sensitivity in the literature) were used in the criteria by Martinez et al. Furthermore, CT scans cannot be performed in hemodynamically unstable patients (which is upon presentation frequent the case in NSTI patients) and could cause a significant delay in the surgical treatment of NSTIs.

This study is limited by its small sample size, which constrained us to a descriptive analysis. One of the biggest arguments made against using frozen sections for diagnosing NSTIs is that it requires a pathologists with frozen section expertise. Fortunately, we had the benefit of an experience pathologist who specializes in skin and soft tissues to re-assess all samples. With our protocolled assessment, we aimed to simplify the assessment, maintain generalizability and applicability of our results, and provide some sort of quantitative assessment of the samples and thus recommendations. During the retrospective scoring and assessment of the samples by the pathologist, the conclusion made did not differ from the conclusion reported in the first pathology report. The retrospective assessment only resulted in more details. We acknowledge that the implementation of frozen sections for diagnosing NSTI is affected by a hospital resources and regional collaborations, which requires the appropriate logistics for assessing frozen sections in emergency setting.

### Necrotizing fasciitis and its mimics: what radiologists need to know [^117LZwxd]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review the imaging features of necrotizing fasciitis and its potential mimics. Key imaging features are emphasized to enable accurate and efficient interpretation of variables that are essential in appropriate management.

Conclusion

Necrotizing fasciitis is a medical emergency with potential lethal outcome. Dissecting gas along fascial planes in the absence of penetrating trauma (including iatrogenic) is essentially pathognomonic. However, the lack of soft-tissue emphysema does not exclude the diagnosis. Mimics of necrotizing fasciitis include nonnecrotizing fasciitis (eosinophilic, paraneoplastic, inflammatory (lupus myofasciitis, Churg-Strauss, nodular, or proliferative), myositis, neoplasm, myonecrosis, inflammatory myopathy, and compartment syndrome. Necrotizing fasciitis is a clinical diagnosis, and imaging can reveal nonspecific or negative findings (particularly during the early course of disease). One should be familiar with salient clinical and imaging findings of necrotizing fasciitis to facilitate a more rapid and accurate diagnosis and be aware that its diagnosis necessitates immediate discussion with the referring physician.

### Severe necrotizing soft-tissue infection-associated mortality: have a look at the computed tomography! [^116uN5xe]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing soft-tissue infection (NSTI) is a life-threatening pathology, and the cornerstone treatment is based on early diagnosis, surgical source control and antimicrobial therapy. Even if the diagnosis remains essentially clinical, computed tomography (CT) could be helpful in the diagnosis but remains controversial. To date, there are no data screening the criteria for the place of initial CT-scan and patient outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between CT signs and the outcome of severe NSTI patients.

We retrospectively collected data for 100 patients with severe NSTI hospitalized in our intensive care unit (ICU) between 2009 and 2019 and whose diagnoses were surgically confirmed. Methods of this cohort have been previously published. Patients who were clinically suspected of having NSTI benefited from urgent surgical exploration. CT was performed prior to surgery at the discretion of the clinician if the diagnosis of NSTI was uncertain or to assess the extent of the damage.

Four criteria for CT were evaluated according to previous guidelines:
Gas in the soft tissues,
Multiple fluid collections,
Absence or heterogeneity of tissue enhancement by IV contrast,
Significant inflammatory changes of the fascia and under.

The presence of these criteria was compared between survivors and nonsurvivors at day-90.

Of the 100 patients, 54 underwent CT before surgical exploration. Table 1 shows the comparison of general characteristics between the patients with and without CT. The median (IQR) delay between CT and the surgical procedure was 5 [2–20] hours. Table 2 shows the clinical and CT characteristics according to the survival or death status at day-90. In the multivariate analysis, in addition to the surface parameter (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.34, p = 0.01), the criterion for inflammatory changes of the fascia was associated with mortality at day-90 (OR 8.09, 95% CI 63.5, p = 0.015). Inflammatory changes of the fascia parameter had a sensitivity of 60% (32–84), specificity of 92% (79–98), positive predictive value of 75% (43–95) and negative predictive value of 86% (71–95).

### Clinical and imaging factors associated with severe complications of cervical necrotizing fasciitis [^116w7oG2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Cervical necrotizing fasciitis (CNF) is a severe and debilitating disease that requires intensive care unit (ICU) management and prompt surgical treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence and factors associated with severe complications of CNF.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records of consecutive patients hospitalized in an ICU from 2007 to 2012. The data were collected retrospectively; initial cervical and thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans, performed on admission, were reviewed by an experienced and blinded radiologist to determine CNF complications.

Results

A cohort of 160 patients admitted for CNF was included. The following complications of CNF were found: bilateral extension of CNF (28%), internal jugular vein thrombosis (21%), descending necrotic effusion (14%), mediastinitis (24%), and mortality (4%); 53% had at least one complication, and 48% had at least one cervical complication. On the basis of a univariate analysis, the significant independent factors are odynophagia, dyspnea, oral glucocorticoids intake before admission, and pharyngeal source. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug intake before admission does not have any impact. The initial CNF complications increased both the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of stay in the ICU. On the basis of a multivariate analysis, the independent factors for severe complications are pharyngeal CNF and oral glucocorticoid intake before admission.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrated that an initial cervico-thoracic CT scan revealed a high incidence of cervical and mediastinal CNF complications that all needed immediate management. Those severe complications might be avoidable as they were associated, at least partially, with prehospital oral glucocorticoid intake.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: strategies for diagnosis and management [^114Fjoqz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Necrotising fasciitis (NF) is a rare soft tissue infection, primarily involving the superficial fascia and resulting in extensive undermining of the surrounding tissues. If untreated, it is invariably fatal, and thus a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis is required. Mortality remains still high in NF despite use of modern powerful antimicrobial drug regimens and advances in the care of the critically ill patients. Overall mortality ranges from 25 percent to 73 percent in the published literature. The disease's manifestation can range from a fulminant presentation to a subtle and insidious development.

Imaging

The diagnosis of NSTIs is primarily clinical. However, radiologic imaging may be able to provide useful information when the diagnosis is uncertain. A plain X-ray should not be used to rule out NSTI. However, it is important that if clinical suspicion of NSTI is high, radiologic imaging must neither delay nor deter surgery, because in this setting an early surgical debridement is essential to decrease mortality.
CT

US

CT has a higher sensitivity than plain radiography in identifying early NSTIs. Findings consistent with necrotizing infections are fat stranding, fluid and gas collections that dissect along fascial planes, and gas in the involved soft tissues. Additionally, fascial thickening and non-enhancing fascia on contrast CT suggests fascial necrosis

MRI has been considered the imaging modality of choice for necrotizing fasciitis. However, MRI may be difficult to perform under emergency conditions and is not recommended as the first-choice imaging technique.

US has the advantage of being rapidly performed at the bedside and may help differentiate simple cellulitis from NSTIs, but again is not considered highly accurate nor definitive in most settings. Point-of-care US (POCUS) can improve diagnose accuracy for NSTI when used in combination with clinical evaluation as it is increasingly available, fast and can be performed at the bedside. The main ultrasound findings are summarized in loss of the normal tissue architecture to a "cobblestone" appearance, with irregularity and thickening of the fascia, abnormal fluid collections along the fascia, seen as hypoechogenic zones, and, in more advanced cases, the presence subcutaneous air, defined by hyperechogenic foci with a posterior dirty acoustic shadowing.

Moreover, POCUS can show evidence of gas in the soft tissue, indicative of advanced disease and a marker of worse prognosis. The presence of a thickened fascia can make it difficult to differentiate the underlying structures. Yet, there is always the possibility of comparing with another similar unaffected structure, usually the other limb. Ultrasound can also be helpful to guide fluid drainage if a collection is present and rule out deep vein thrombosis.

### Can necrotizing soft tissue infection be reliably diagnosed in the emergency department? [^112kza2p]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

NSTI can be reliably diagnosed in the ED (abridged summary)

Dr Kimberly Davis MD, MBA, Professor of Surgery, Yale School of Medicine

NSTIs represent an infrequently encountered, but rapidly progressive soft tissue infection, which requires prompt diagnosis and aggressive surgical debridement. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, as delays in treatment are associated with greater morbidity. Although clinical signs can be varied, several clinical tests have been used to generate predictive tools for NSTI.

Wong and colleagues have proposed the 'laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis' (LRINEC) score. This involves the assessment of C-reactive protein (CRP), white cell count (WCC), hemoglobin, sodium, creatinine and glucose and the assignment of a score, depending on the level of the variable. A score of > 6 is highly suggestive of an NSTI.

The strength of this score appears to be in identifying patients where there is a very high or low suspicion of NSTI. Although this has some obvious practical significance, it leaves a middle group of patients where the diagnosis remains uncertain. This is where imaging can play a significant role.

Radiology has traditionally had a limited role to play in NSTI diagnosis, but the advent of widely accessible cross-sectional imaging has changed this paradigm. Although MRI offers high-resolution soft tissue imaging, CT is timely, widely available and amenable to rapid interpretation by non-radiologists, until formal reporting.

A CT scoring system has been described for use in patients with equivocal physical and laboratory findings based on the presence of fascial air, edema, fluid tracking and lymphadenopathy. A score greater than 6, generated a high sensitivity and specificity for NSTI.

In summary, diagnosis of NSTI requires a high index of suspicion and early surgical exploration is required; however, in equivocal cases, laboratory and imaging scoring systems can be used in the ED to assess the likelihood of the need for debridement.

### Diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections by computed tomography… [^113mGPo6]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions A negative CT result reliably excludes the diagnosis of NSTI. A positive CT result correctly identifies the disease with a high likelihood. Similarly, patients with unclear symptoms who were taken to the operating room without undergoing CT and who had undergone surgical exploration that revealed no NSTI were excluded. All patients had their NSTIs correctly diagnosed by CT scanning, and there were no false-negative test results. All 25 had abnormally enhanced soft tissues, indicative of inflammation and necrosis; 9 also had gas across tissue planes, and 7 had fluid collections. One patient had an initially equivocal scan result; therefore, another scan was performed 12 hours later and showed signs of NSTI. Our findings suggest that a negative CT result can reliably exclude NSTI in patients with soft tissue infections and thus prevent unnecessary surgical explorations with their associated complications.

When the CT result is positive, it correctly identifies the disease with a likelihood of 76%. In their study, CT scanning identified fascial thickening and fat stranding in 80%, gas in 55%, and abscesses in 35% of the patients. Three patients had none of these findings, and 6 had only 1 finding. No information was available on false-positive results. Becker et al13 described 16 patients with necrotizing fasciitis of the head and neck who were admitted to 3 hospitals during a 6-year period before 1997. Computed tomography with a 16- or 64-section scanner is the most rapid and reliable test that can be performed in patients with suspected NSTI. Distinguishing between cellulitis and NSTI is often hard on the basis of clinical signs. Early detection is crucial to achieve optimal outcomes.

Findings from CT, such as asymmetrical thickening of the fascia and muscle, nonenhancing tissues indicating necrosis, fluid collections, and gas across tissue planes, can be detected in all patients with NSTI according to our study. None of the examined factors in our study was able to distinguish between patients with true- and false-positive CT results. It seems that the presence of necrotic tissue or gas on CT unequivocally indicates NSTI. However, the other 2 criteria that we used in our study are subject to interpretation and could lead to a negative surgical exploration result. Correlation with clinical symptoms is of the utmost importance for the decision to perform a surgical exploration.

### Triple diagnostics for early detection of ambivalent necrotizing fasciitis [^115DPcTc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

With improved awareness, a challenge arises with the early and correct identification of necrotizing fasciitis. Signs and symptoms might be absent or misleading, as prominent skin marks might not be the place of fascial necrosis. This emphasizes the importance of adequate algorithms and treatment protocols for all medical specialties that might encounter necrotizing fasciitis. Identification and debridement as soon as possible and aggressive enough are the major contributors for survival. Therefore, triple diagnostics which include a fresh frozen section and Gram staining might be an important adjunct in early ambivalent stages of suspected necrotizing fasciitis.

### Can necrotizing soft tissue infection be reliably diagnosed in the emergency department? [^116Udhq5]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are associated with a high mortality and require prompt recognition and treatment, consisting of aggressive surgical debridement and critical care support. Diagnosis is a key step, which is generally made in the operating room (OR), but the decision to debride requires guidance. This is frequently made on clinical grounds, but NSTI can be occult in presentation and several other infective processes can mimic NSTI. It is unknown whether the various scoring systems described in the literature can enable clinicians to reliably diagnose NSTI in the emergency department, rather than the OR. The topic was debated at the 36thAnnual Point/Counterpoint Acute Care Surgery Conference and the following article summarizes the discussants points of view along with a summary of the evidence.

### CT in necrotizing soft tissue infection: diagnostic criteria and comparison with LRINEC score [^112WWxis]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate which computed tomography (CT) criteria are most useful in diagnosing necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) and how CT performs with respect to the Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score.

Methods

Patients who underwent CT for suspected NSTI were eligible for inclusion. LRINEC score was assessed. CT scans were evaluated for subcutaneous edema, fluid along superficial fascia, fluid along deep fascia, blurring of intermuscular fat planes, fluid collection, and air in the soft tissues. Surgical findings or clinical follow-up served as reference standard.

Results

Fourteen patients with NSTI and 34 patients with non-NSTI were included. LRINEC score was significantly higher in patients with NSTI (median of 7.5 vs. 6, p = 0.039). Fluid along the deep fascia was significantly more frequently present in patients with NSTI (46.2% vs. 5.9%, p = 0.001). In multiple logistic regression analysis, presence of fluid along the deep fascia was significantly associated with NSTI (odds ratio [OR] = 10.28, 95% CI: 1.57 to 67.18, p = 0.015), whereas the LRINEC score was not significantly associated with NSTI (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.74, p = 0.146). Using presence of fluid along the deep fascia as diagnostic criterion for NSTI, sensitivity was 46.2% (95% CI, 23.2 to 70.9%) and specificity was 94.1% (95% CI, 80.9 to 98.4%).

Conclusion

Fluid along the deep fascia was the only CT criterion which was significantly associated with NSTI and appeared more useful than the LRINEC score. In the right clinical setting, presence of this CT finding is highly suggestive for NSTI. Its absence, however, does not rule out NSTI.

Key Points

- The presence of fluid along the deep fascia at CT is highly suggestive for NSTI in suspected patients. Its absence, however, does not rule out NSTI. '• The use of fluid along the deep fascia as a criterion appears to be more useful than the LRINEC score in diagnosing NSTI.

### Necrotizing soft tissue infection: diagnostic accuracy of physical examination, imaging, and LRINEC score: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113oRyfC]. Annals of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

We sought to summarize accuracy of physical examination, imaging, and Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score in diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) in adults with a soft tissue infection clinically concerning for NSTI.

Summary Of Background Data

NSTI is a life-threatening diagnosis. Delay to diagnosis and surgical management is associated with increased mortality.

Methods

We searched 6 databases from inception through November 2017. We included English-language studies reporting diagnostic accuracy of testing or LRINEC Score. Outcome was NSTI confirmed by surgery or histopathology. Two reviewers screened all citations and extracted data independently. Summary measures were obtained from the Hierarchical Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic model.

Results

From 2,290 citations, we included 23 studies (n = 5982). Of physical examination signs, pooled sensitivity and specificity for fever was 46.0% and 77.0% respectively, for hemorrhagic bullae 25.2% and 95.8%, and for hypotension 21.0% and 97.7%. Computed tomography (CT) had sensitivity of 88.5% and specificity of 93.3%, while plain radiography had sensitivity of 48.9% and specificity of 94.0%. Finally, LRINEC ≥ 6 had sensitivity of 68.2% and specificity of 84.8%, while LRINEC ≥ 8 had sensitivity of 40.8% and specificity of 94.9%.

Conclusions

Absence of any 1 physical examination feature (eg, fever or hypotension) is not sufficient to rule-out NSTI. CT is superior to plain radiography. LRINEC had poor sensitivity, and should not be used to rule-out NSTI. Given the poor sensitivity of these tests, a high clinical suspicion warrants early surgical consultation for definitive diagnosis and management.

In this study involving 100 severe ICU NSTI patients, we found that even if CT is not a diagnostic tool, it can nevertheless provide some information on the patient's outcome. It is well established that the contribution of CT for an NSTI diagnosis is not only unreliable but can also delay the management of the patient, which is why in most cases, the diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical examinations and operative findings. Our work partly confirms these elements since, when comparing patients who had a CT-scan versus those who did not, no difference according to the initial severity was found.

There are many diagnostic studies in which changes in the fascia (thickness, presence of edema, nonenhancement) can help in the diagnosis, but to our knowledge, our study is the first to evidence a link between fascia imaging and prognosis. Nevertheless, as the fascia is a key structure in the spread of infection, our findings seem quite consistent.

Our study has limitations, including its monocentric design with only 100 NSTI patients and a long cohort period. Of course, almost half of the patients in the cohort did not have a CT-scan, which is an undeniable source of bias. A multicenter prospective larger cohort study has to be performed to confirm these results.

### The role of computed tomography in the diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections [^114azqJR]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The exact role of IV contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) has not yet been established. We aimed to explore the role of CT in patients with clinical suspicion of NSTI and assess its sensitivity and specificity for NSTI.

Methods

The medical records of patients admitted between 2009 and 2016, who received IV contrast-enhanced CT to rule out NSTI, were reviewed. CT was considered positive in case of: (a) gas in soft tissues, (b) multiple fluid collections, (c) absence or heterogeneity of tissue enhancement by the IV contrast, and (d) significant inflammatory changes under the fascia. NSTI was confirmed only by the presence of necrotic tissue during surgical exploration. NSTI was considered absent if surgical exploration failed to identify necrosis, or if the patient was successfully treated non-operatively.

Results

Of the 184 patients, 17 had a positive CT and hence underwent surgical exploration with NSTI being confirmed in 13 of them (76%). Of the 167 patients that had a negative CT, 38 (23%) underwent surgical exploration due to the high clinical suspicion for NSTI and were all found to have non-necrotizing infections; the remaining 129 (77%) were managed non-operatively with successful resolution of symptoms. The sensitivity of CT in identifying NSTI was 100%, the specificity 98%, the positive predictive value 76%, and the negative predictive value 100%.

Conclusions

A negative IV contrast-enhanced CT scan can reliably rule out the need for surgical intervention in patients with initial suspicion of NSTI.

### MRI of acute neck infections: evidence summary and pictorial review [^111YYvW6]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Mediastinal extension

Severe infections can spread to the mediastinum, either posteriorly from the retropharyngeal space, or anteriorly through visceral and anterior cervical spaces. Subtle reactive edema (ME) should not be mistaken for treatable mediastinal disease. Accurate delineation of mediastinal abscesses is important (Fig. 28). Although small mediastinal abscesses may be treated conservatively, especially wide-spread abscesses may require surgery after a clinical multidisciplinary evaluation. Extending the imaging field of view from the neck to the mediastinum is straightforward with contrast-enhanced CT but requires more time and effort with MRI because sequences may need to be specifically tailored for the mediastinum. This requires more scanning time and radiologist supervision. In the chest area, susceptibility effects caused by interfaces between soft tissues and air cause artifacts that may degrade diagnostic performance.

Necrotizing fasciitis

Necrotizing fasciitis of the head and neck is a rapidly progressing and life-threatening infection caused by bacteria. The infected tissue becomes necrotic as a process involving vasculitis with microthrombosis and edema of the subcutaneous tissues progresses, leading to severe systemic toxicity in the later stages. Necrotizing fasciitis of the head and neck is a rare condition, given that the incidence of 2 per 1,000,000 inhabitants per year has been reported in Denmark. Patients with necrotizing fasciitis usually present with pain, swelling, crepitation, and erythema; typically, the pain is out of proportion to the swelling or erythema. Comorbidities include diabetes and liver cirrhosis. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention are key determinants of prognosis. In an uncertain case, early surgical exploration may be the best approach.

Generally, findings of necrotizing versus non-necrotizing fasciitis may overlap. On MRI, necrotizing fasciitis in the neck is suggested by widespread edema, fluid collections along the fascial planes, and gas formation (Fig. 29).

### Sonographic findings in necrotizing fasciitis: two ends of the spectrum [^116iNVEp]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but serious disease, and early diagnosis is essential to reducing its substantial morbidity and mortality. The 2 cases presented show that the key clinical and radiographic features of necrotizing fasciitis exist along a continuum of severity at initial presentation; thus, this diagnosis should not be prematurely ruled out in cases that do not show the dramatic features familiar to most clinicians. Although computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are considered the most effective imaging modalities, the cases described here illustrate how sonography should be recommended as an initial imaging test to make a rapid diagnosis and initiate therapy.

### Multiple skip incision skin-sparing debridement for perianal necrotizing fasciitis: a retrospective study [^114uiUqm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Early diagnosis and treatment of PNF are crucial to reduce mortality. Alahmad MS et al. found that timely diagnosis within 6 h was essential for improving the prognosis of NF, highlighting the importance of optimizing early identification and diagnosis in the emergency room to reduce delays and improve patient outcomes. However, early clinical diagnosis of the disease remains challenging. NF initially infects the fascia and subcutaneous tissue, with the overlying soft tissues often appearing inconspicuous or presenting as simple cellulitis, which could mislead clinicians about the extent of infection and might lead them to miss or misdiagnose this rapidly progressive condition in its early stages. Currently, several scoring systems are used in clinical practice to predict the risk of NF, severity of the disease, and outcomes. Wong et al. first introduced the LRINEC score in 2004 to help doctors differentiate NF from other soft tissue infections. The variables used for this score include routine laboratory tests after admission based on six serum parameters at presentation: C-reactive protein, total white blood cell count, hemoglobin, serum sodium, creatinine, and glucose. A LRINEC score ≥ 6 indicates suspected NF, while an LRINEC score ≥ 8 strongly suggests NF; this is considered a simplified bedside diagnostic tool for early diagnosis and predicting the outcome of patients with NF. However, in our study, only five cases (22.75%) with a LRINEC score of ≥ 6 were diagnosed with PNF. In such cases, the LRINEC score was considered to have low sensitivity; therefore, when diagnosing suspected PNF, the LRINEC score should be combined with a careful review of suggestive clinical symptoms and signs, as well as imaging examinations such as CT.

### Can necrotizing soft tissue infection be reliably diagnosed in the emergency department? [^115bRac8]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Efforts have been made to enhance diagnostic confidence with the use of laboratory indices; however, no single value has been found to reliable. The LRINEC score was developed to overcome these shortcomings by incorporating several weighted values. These investigators used data from 89 patients with a confirmed NSTI and 225 patients with non-NSTI cutaneous sepsis to develop a regression model of factors predictive of NSTI. Ultimately, they included WCC, hemoglobin, sodium, glucose creatinine and CRP level. Patients with a score higher than six are at high risk of NSTI, with the original authors presenting a positive predictive value (PPV) of 92.0%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.0% and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.976.

This score has been evaluated in several settings which has yielded a spread of predictive values ranging from a PPV of 57%–92% and an NPV of 86%–92%. This variation is likely reflective of the differing rates of NSTI in the studied cohorts which generally used a convenience sample of non-necrotizing infections. This scoring is not infallible and appears to work best where the clinical features are ambiguous and there is time to obtain laboratory investigations. A recent re-examination of this score suggested that the historical description of 'pain out-of-proportion' along with a CRP greater than 150 mg/L was comparable to the LRINEC score.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^115KSn6w]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

How can necrotizing infections be diagnosed?

Clinical signs of NSTI include pain out of proportion, edema extending beyond the erythema, and fever. A rapidly progressive soft-tissue infection should always be suspected as a necrotizing infection (recommendation 1C).

The initial differential diagnosis between a cellulitis and a necrotizing infection that requires prompt operative intervention may be difficult. Most cases of NSTI are initially diagnosed and begin as cellulitis. However, since time to operative debridement is an important determinant of outcome in necrotizing infections, timely diagnosis is essential.

Patients with NSTI usually present with severe pain which is out of proportion to the physical findings.

Typical local signs are as follows:
Edema
Erythema
Severe and crescendo pain out of proportion
Skin bullae or necrosis (at later stage)
Swelling or tenderness
Crepitus

Systemic signs are as follows:
Fever
Tachycardia
Hypotension
Shock

Laboratory tests are not highly sensitive or specific for NSTIs. A rapidly progressive soft-tissue infection should be treated as a necrotizing infection, from the beginning. The clinical picture may worsen very quickly, sometimes during a few hours.

In order to predict the presence of NSTI, the Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing infection (LRINEC) score was proposed. LRINEC score assigns points for abnormalities in six independent variables: serum C-reactive protein level (> 150 mg/L), white blood cell (WBC) count (> 15,000/μL), hemoglobin level (< 13.5 g/dL), serum sodium level (< 135 mmol/L), serum creatinine level (> 1.6 mg/dL [142 mmol/l]), and serum glucose level (> 180 mg/dL [10 mmol/l]). With a score of 8 or higher, there is a 75% risk of a NSTI.

### Chance to cut: defining a negative exploration rate in patients with suspected necrotizing soft tissue infection [^112Th2W6]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study emphasizes that despite best surgical judgment and the use of predictive models, there are a number of patients who will not have an NSTI at the time of surgical exploration. Our study is unique in that our patients all went to operation with a working diagnosis of NSTI — that is, the diagnosis of cellulitis or abscess occurred at the time of operation (and not pre-emptively). Our study adds to existing literature that the differences between patients with NSTI and non-NSTI can be extremely subtle, and we propose that there may be an acceptable rate of negative exploration for this disease process. For us it was 20%.

Previous work corroborates the difficulty in expediently diagnosing NSTI. Only 14% to 39% of necrotizing fasciitis is correctly identified at initial presentation. Our study is unique in that we expanded our study group beyond necrotizing fasciitis to all NSTI. Further, our study indicates that even experienced clinical judgment can be wrong. Other surgical disease processes with diagnostic challenges, such as appendicitis, have been extensively studied with a historical negative appendectomy rate of approximately 15%. Over time, groups at increased risk of negative appendectomy such as women and children have been identified, and the overall rate of negative appendectomy has declined to 3% to 4%. Our study establishes an overall negative exploration rate of 20%, which with time may be validated or refuted and improved by subsequent research.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114VCaMV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis, including Fournier gangrene — evaluation and treatment — should prioritize urgent surgery and broad empiric antibiotics: prompt surgical consultation is recommended for patients with aggressive infections associated with signs of systemic toxicity or suspicion of necrotizing fasciitis or gas gangrene (strong, low); empiric antibiotic treatment should be broad (eg, vancomycin or linezolid plus piperacillin-tazobactam or plus a carbapenem, or plus ceftriaxone and metronidazole) because the etiology can be polymicrobial or monomicrobial (group A Streptococcus, community-acquired MRSA) (strong, low); and penicillin plus clindamycin is recommended for documented group A streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis (strong, low). Necrotizing SSTIs differ from the milder, superficial infections and these deep infections involve the fascial and/or muscle compartments and are potentially devastating due to major tissue destruction and death.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of LRINEC score for predicting upper and lower extremity necrotizing fasciitis [^114QxSND]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

This review and meta-analysis aims to assess the prognostic value of the Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score for detecting necrotizing fasciitis in the extremities. The LRINEC score has been validated in multiple studies as a clinical tool for differentiating necrotizing fasciitis from non-necrotizing infections however many studies do not specify the location of infection. As the prevalence of diabetes and diabetic foot infections continues to rise, the utility of LRINEC scores in these populations becomes of increased importance. Four databases were reviewed for citations between January 2010 and December 2020. English, full text articles reporting the diagnostic effects of LRINEC were utilized in the systematic review portion of this paper. Further inclusion of 2 × 2 tables and discussion specific to the extremities were applied for citations implemented in the meta-analysis. Of the 111 results, 12 citations (n = 932) were included in this review. The diagnostic sensitivity of the LRINEC score ranged from 36% to 77% while specificity ranged from 72% to 93%. Cumulative odds ratio for LRINEC ≥ 6 among the 4 studies assessing extremity necrotizing fasciitis was 4.3 with p value of < .05. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value was 49.39%, 83.17%, 34.91%, and 89.99%, respectively. Accuracy, the classification by whether a patient was correctly classified, was 77.95%. LRINEC score is effective at distinguishing necrotizing fasciitis from other soft tissue infections however the LRINEC's score greatest clinical application may be its ability to rule out necrotizing fasciitis while its ability to accurately identify the presence of infection remains suboptimal.

### Chance to cut: defining a negative exploration rate in patients with suspected necrotizing soft tissue infection [^113B5mU4]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Physical examination findings and predictive lab models fail to identify every patient with NSTI. The clinical differences between patients who have an NSTI and those who do not are subtle — they present similarly, grow common causative organisms, and have equivalent mortality rates. Surgical exploration remains the gold standard for diagnosis and should not be delayed if there is a high index of suspicion. Our institution found a 20% negative exploration rate. As some negative explorations later progressed to NSTI, we recommend ongoing vigilance by the surgical team until clinical improvement is seen. We advocate for future multi-institutional studies to validate an acceptable negative exploration rate in patients suspected to have an NSTI.

### Downstaging chemotherapy and alteration in the classic computed tomography / magnetic resonance imaging signs of vascular involvement in patients with pancreaticobiliary malignant tumors… [^116QoxEA]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Criteria for exploration after DCTx were CT/MRI evidence of tumor shrinkage and/or change in signs of vascular involvement, cancer antigen 19–9 decrease, and good functional status. None had progressive disease. At operation, we resected tumors in 34 of 41 patients, and 6 had persistent vascular involvement. Surprisingly, CT/MRI scan was only 71% sensitive and 58% specific to detect vascular involvement after DCTx. "Involvement" on imaging was often from tumor fibrosis rather than viable cancer. Radiographic decrease in tumor size also did not predict resectability. Patients with tumors that were resected had a median 87% decrease in cancer antigen 19–9 during DCTx. The median follow-up was 31 months, and disease-specific survival was 52 months for patients with resected tumors. With improved high-resolution CT/MRI scans, most patients with unresectable tumors are now diagnosed on the basis of imaging results.

In our series, 19 of 21 patients whose condition was diagnosed before 2005 underwent initial exploration. In contrast, 14 of 20 patients whose condition was diagnosed in 2005 or later were deemed unresectable on the basis of CT/MRI findings alone. Thus, we examined the accuracy of CT/MRI to predict persistent vascular involvement by viable tumor. In our series of 41 patients, there was a subset of 32 patients who had clear documentation of both CT/MRI and intraoperative findings after completing downstaging treatment. The sensitivity and specificity of CT/MRI after downstaging treatment to detect viable tumor were 71% and 58%, respectively. Furthermore, the positive and negative predictive values were 31% and 88%, respectively. A high-resolution CT/MRI is obtained as part of the evaluation in all patients with pancreaticobiliary malignant tumors.

The CT/MRI not only detects the presence of the tumor in most cases but also shows the tumor's relation to the nearby blood vessels when intravenous contrast is administered and arterial and venous phases are captured. 13–21 The radiologist often indicates that there is a "fat plane" between the tumor and blood vessel, which suggests that the 2 can be separated at operation to complete an R0 resection.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^116k6zni]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been the imaging modality of choice for necrotizing fasciitis. Patients with necrotizing fasciitis usually have a significantly greater frequency of the following MRI findings: thick (≥ 3 mm) abnormal signal intensity on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images, low signal intensity in the deep fascia on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images, a focal or diffuse non-enhancing portion in the area of abnormal signal intensity in the deep fascia, extensive involvement of the deep fascia, and involvement of three or more compartments in one extremity. However, MRI may be difficult to perform under emergency conditions and is not recommended as the first-choice imaging technique.

Ultrasound has the advantage of being rapidly performed at bedside and may be helpful in differentiating simple cellulitis from necrotizing fasciitis. In a prospective observational study of 62 patients with clinically suspected necrotizing fasciitis, ultrasound had a sensitivity of 88.2%, specificity of 93.3%, positive predictive value of 95.4%, negative predictive value of 95.4%, and diagnostic accuracy of 91.9%. The authors considered the findings of diffuse subcutaneous thickening accompanied by fluid accumulation of > 4 mm in depth along the deep fascial layer predictive of necrotizing fasciitis.

Rapid performance of frozen-section soft-tissue biopsy, early in the evolution of a suspect lesion, may provide a definitive and life-saving diagnosis. Triple diagnostics which include an incisional biopsy over the most suspected area, a fresh frozen section and Gram staining might be an important adjunct in early stages of suspected necrotizing infections (recommendation 1C).

Early frozen-section diagnosis should be limited to those cases in which the clinical or radiographic findings are not diagnostic (recommendation 1C).

Fascial biopsy with frozen section has been suggested as a means to achieve earlier diagnosis of NSTIs. However, frozen-section biopsy is not very practical and requires availability and experience of the pathologists, and the time taken to carry out and analyze the sample could be used for debridement. The Finger test is another adjunct method described for diagnosing NSTIs. It is performed under local anesthesia. A 2-cm incision is made down to the deep fascia. Minimal tissue resistance to finger dissection (positive Finger test), the absence of bleeding, presence of necrotic tissue, and/or murky and grayish ("dishwater") fluid following incision, all suggest the diagnosis of NSTI.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: classification, diagnosis, and management [^114TTtw9]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF), a life-threatening rare infection of the soft tissues, is a medical and surgical emergency. It is characterized by subtle, rapid onset of spreading inflammation and necrosis starting from the fascia, muscles, and subcutaneous fat, with subsequent necrosis of the overlying skin. Once suspected, immediate and extensive radical debridement of necrotic tissues is mandatory. Appropriate antibiotics and intensive general support avoid massive systemic diffusion of the infective process and are the key for successful treatment. However, early diagnosis is missed or delayed in 85% to 100% of cases in large published series: because of the lack of specific clinical features in the initial stage of the disease, it is often underestimated or confused with cellulitis or abscess. Mortality rates are still high and have shown no tendency to decrease in the last 100 years. Unfortunately, the prevalence of the disease is such that physicians rarely become sufficiently confident with NF to be able to proceed with rapid diagnosis and management. This review covers the literature published in MEDLINE in the period 1970 to December 31, 2010. Particular attention is given to the clinical and laboratory elements to be considered for diagnosis. A wide variety of diagnostic tools have been described to facilitate and hasten the diagnosis of NF, but the most important tool for early diagnosis still remains a high index of clinical suspicion.

Necrotizing fasciitis — definition, clinical features, and bacteriology are detailed. Necrotizing fasciitis is "an aggressive subcutaneous infection that tracks along the superficial fascia", and "it is the superficial fascia that is most commonly involved". The initial presentation "is that of cellulitis", progressing with "systemic toxicity, often including high temperatures, disorientation, and lethargy", and a distinguishing feature is "the wooden-hard induration of the subcutaneous tissues". In the monomicrobial form, pathogens "are S. pyogenes, S. aureus, V. vulnificus, A. hydrophila, and anaerobic streptococci (Peptostreptococcus)", with most infections "community acquired and present in the limbs, with approximately two-thirds in the lower extremities". Cases after varicella or trivial injuries are "usually due to S. pyogenes", and in group A streptococcal disease with hypotension and organ failure, mortality is "ranging from 30% to 70%". Among S. pyogenes cases, "Nearly 50%" have "no portal of entry" and instead develop deep infection at a site of nonpenetrating trauma. Polymicrobial infection is "most commonly associated with 4 clinical settings" including perianal/abdominal sources, decubitus ulcers, injection sites in illicit drug users, and spread from genital sites.

### Factors associated with the mediastinal spread of cervical necrotizing fasciitis [^112kNnEg]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

We conducted a study to determine factors associated with the occurrence of mediastinitis in patients hospitalized for cervical necrotizing fasciitis (CNF).

Methods

We reviewed the medical records of 130 consecutive patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of CNF. Two radiologists reviewed cervical and thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans to determine the source and extension of the infection in each patient.

Results

Among the cohort of 130 patients with CNF, 37 (28%) had mediastinitis at the time of their admission (which in 13 cases was superior, or above the aortic arch, and in 24 cases inferior). Cervical necrotizing fasciitis complicated by mediastinitis resulted in a longer stay in the ICU than did CNF without mediastinitis, of a mean of 29 days (range, 18 to 39 days) versus 14 days (range, 9 to 19) days, respectively (p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of mediastinitis was associated with oral intake of glucocorticoids before admission (odds ratio [OR], 2.17; range, 0.99 to 4.76), a pharyngeal focus of CNF (OR, 2.17; range, 1.04 to 4.53), or gas seen on an initial CT scan (OR, 4.49; range, 2.15 to 9.38). Both a pharyngeal focus of fasciitis and the presence of gas were strong independent predictors of inferior mediastinitis (OR, 15.1; range, 4.9 to 46.4; p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

The present study is the first to describe three independent factors associated with extension of cervical fasciitis to the thoracic cavity, including glucocorticoid intake before admission, and confirms previous reports of a high incidence of mediastinitis in patients with CNF.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for necrotizing fasciitis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, SIS-E/WSES 2018 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining diagnostic imaging to provide useful information when the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis is uncertain
while not delaying surgical consultation and intervention.

### Three Ds for diagnosing necrotizing fasciitis by front-line clinicians [^117S8oaV]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a life-threatening infection and a surgical emergency. Not all clinicians have the experience or resources to detect NF in its early stages.

Objective

To develop a diagnostic algorithm for primary care and emergency physicians to identify patients with possible NF, including an initial approach to triaging such individuals.

Methods

Medline was searched to identify studies of validated algorithms for NF diagnosis and/or cohort or case series providing clinical and diagnostic features of NF. Candidate algorithms were validated via application to 3 published cases of initially misdiagnosed NF. We retrospectively reviewed NF cases between 2011 and 2022 at our center to validate our algorithm.

Results

The search yielded 540 articles; 109 were included following a review of abstracts. No published validated diagnostic algorithm was identified. Using the reported clinical and diagnostic features of NF, we generated an algorithm of the "3Ds" of NF: Disproportionate pain, Dermatological findings, and Disorganized physiology. A larger number of Ds indicated a greater level of suspicion for NF and prioritization for urgent surgical consultation. In 3 published cases of missed NF, the 3Ds algorithm successfully identified all as having possible NF. On reviewing our cases, we identified 56 patients with NF during an 11 year period. 66% of whom had the 3Ds at their initial presentation.

Discussion

The 3Ds algorithm, a simple and easy-to-remember tool can be easily applied in a primary or emergency care setting, and may improve the early diagnosis of NF. Retrospective analysis of NF cases allows for validation of this algorithm. However, this algorithm requires prospective validation.
