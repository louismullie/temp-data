## Question

Should varicocele surgery be performed for infertility?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether varicocele surgery should be performed for infertility, and under what circumstances it is indicated or not indicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the couple's fertility profile. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for pregnancy and semen outcomes after varicocelectomy. Next, I will review guideline-based indications and exclusions, including special populations like nonobstructive azoospermia and adolescents. After that, I should weigh surgical technique choices and expected timing of benefit. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and counsel on alternatives, while double-checking for pitfalls in interpretation of older trials and meta-analyses.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because the decision hinges on it: we need a documented infertility in the couple, a clinically palpable varicocele in the male partner, and at least one abnormal semen parameter, while excluding men with nonpalpable (subclinical) varicoceles and men with normal semen analyses, since those are not indications for surgery per major guidelines. I should also ensure the female partner's fertility status is considered, as good ovarian reserve strengthens the indication for varicocele repair to improve natural conception chances [^1161pqe3] [^116wZzTn] [^112SRK2q].

> Next, I should review the quality of evidence on pregnancy outcomes. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions because older Cochrane reviews found no significant benefit on pregnancy, likely due to inclusion of men with normal semen, subclinical varicoceles, and low-quality trials, whereas more recent RCTs and meta-analyses focused on men with palpable varicoceles and abnormal semen show improved spontaneous pregnancy, with odds ratios around 2–3 and number needed to treat roughly 5–7, suggesting clinically meaningful benefit in appropriately selected men [^114RS7Le] [^1124mnZk] [^11365rg1] [^116noWGn].

> I will now examine semen parameter changes, because even when pregnancy does not occur, improvement in total motile sperm count can meaningfully alter the ART pathway. Meta-analyses consistently show significant increases in sperm concentration and motility after varicocelectomy, typically in the range of 10–12 million/mL and about 10% improvement in motility, and many men experience an "upgrade" allowing IUI or natural conception instead of IVF/ICSI, which is a practical advantage even before considering pregnancy outcomes [^115bn5XR] [^1123biXX] [^111uVTTy].

> But wait, what about men with nonobstructive azoospermia? I need to check the guidance carefully, because evidence is mixed and guidelines are cautious. AUA/ASRM recommends informing couples that there is no definitive high-quality evidence that varicocele repair improves outcomes in NOA and advises against routine repair solely to improve ART outcomes, while acknowledging small series showing return of sperm to ejaculate in a subset and potential improvement in sperm retrieval rates. Shared decision-making is key, with counseling that surgery may defer ART by 6+ months and that the likelihood of avoiding surgical sperm retrieval is limited [^1161pqe3] [^116y33zg] [^112ftWux] [^111XdLiX].

> I should confirm that subclinical varicoceles and normal semen analyses are exclusions. Both AUA/ASRM and EAU advise against treating nonpalpable varicoceles detected only by imaging, as benefits have not been demonstrated and overtreatment risks outweigh potential gains, so observation or proceeding to ART as indicated is preferred in these scenarios [^116uW1o2] [^116wZzTn] [^113wyW76].

> Now, let me consider surgical technique, because outcomes vary by approach. Microscopic subinguinal varicocelectomy is associated with lower recurrence and slightly higher pregnancy rates compared with other surgical methods, and meta-analytic data suggest it probably improves pregnancy rates versus nonmicroscopic techniques, which supports choosing microsurgery when feasible, though laparoscopic or percutaneous embolization remain acceptable alternatives depending on expertise and patient preference [^1124mnZk].

> I need to ensure I address timing and expectations. Semen parameters typically improve by 3 months and plateau by 6 months after surgery, so couples should be counseled to reassess at 3–6 months and plan next steps accordingly. In older men, improvements still occur, so age alone should not be a contraindication if other indications are present, though realistic counseling about magnitude of benefit is prudent [^115hHMA9] [^113wN7Y5].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios. In couples with recurrent pregnancy loss or failed ART where sperm DNA fragmentation is elevated, EAU suggests considering varicocelectomy to reduce DNA fragmentation, which may improve ART outcomes, although the strength of evidence is evolving and this should be individualized with reproductive endocrinology input [^117K3UgQ] [^112vimUm] [^116j8s5S].

> For adolescents, I should double-check indications. Repair is considered when there is ipsilateral testicular hypotrophy or progressive testicular dysfunction, with the rationale of preserving future fertility potential, but the evidence for direct fertility benefit is indirect and based on testicular growth and semen improvements rather than paternity outcomes, so observation remains appropriate for many unless clear risk factors are present [^111ubZHf] [^116hzAgH] [^113tq5Nc].

> Let me synthesize the decision framework and make sure it aligns with guidelines: varicocele repair is appropriate when the couple has documented infertility, the varicocele is palpable, the semen analysis is abnormal, and the female partner has reasonable ovarian reserve. It is not indicated for subclinical varicoceles, normal semen analyses, or solely to enhance ART outcomes in NOA without a compelling rationale. Technique selection favors microscopic subinguinal repair, and expectations should be set for reassessment at 3–6 months to determine next steps, including ART if pregnancy has not occurred [^1161pqe3] [^112SRK2q] [^1124mnZk].

> Finally, I should counsel on alternatives and the ART pathway. If surgery is declined or contraindicated, couples can proceed with IUI, IVF, or ICSI based on semen parameters and female factors, noting that some data suggest improved IUI outcomes and potential for reduced DNA fragmentation after repair, which may modestly shift the ART strategy, but shared decision-making should incorporate cost, time, and patient preferences, including the trade-off of surgical recovery time versus immediate ART in selected cases [^1162C4dq] [^1174R2AA] [^111Pz32W].

Varicocele surgery should be offered to men with **palpable varicoceles**, **abnormal semen parameters**, and **otherwise unexplained infertility** [^1161pqe3], as it improves semen quality and increases spontaneous pregnancy rates [^115bn5XR] [^11365rg1]. It is not recommended for **subclinical varicoceles** [^116wZzTn], **normal semen analysis** [^113wyW76], or **non-obstructive azoospermia without proven testicular sperm production** [^112Ka39t] [^1161pqe3]. Microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy is the **preferred technique** [^1124mnZk] due to lower recurrence and complications [^116Dv6uU]; couples should be counseled that surgery may reduce the need for ART [^112EAbVs] [^111uVTTy] but does not guarantee pregnancy [^116RDrQo].

---

## Indications for varicocele surgery in infertility

According to the American Urological Association (AUA) and American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) guidelines, **varicocele surgery is recommended** for the following clinical scenarios:

- **Palpable varicocele**: Clinically palpable varicoceles in men with abnormal semen parameters and otherwise unexplained infertility [^112SRK2q].

- **Abnormal semen parameters**: Men with abnormal semen analysis (e.g. oligospermia, asthenospermia, teratozoospermia) [^1161pqe3] and a palpable varicocele [^112SRK2q].

- **Unexplained infertility**: Couples with unexplained infertility, where the female partner has a good ovarian reserve and no identifiable female factors [^notfound].

Conversely, **varicocele surgery is not recommended** in the following situations:

- **Subclinical varicocele**: Non-palpable varicoceles detected solely by imaging [^116wZzTn] [^116uW1o2].

- **Normal semen analysis**: Men with normal semen parameters [^113wyW76] [^116wZzTn].

- **Non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA)**: Men with NOA without evidence of testicular sperm production, as there is no definitive evidence supporting varicocele repair in this population [^112Ka39t] [^112sWNLx].

---

## Evidence supporting varicocele surgery

Several studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated the **beneficial effects** of varicocele surgery on male fertility:

- **Improvement in semen parameters**: Varicocelectomy significantly improves sperm concentration, motility, and morphology [^115bn5XR] [^115BtPYL].

- **Increased spontaneous pregnancy rates**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have shown that varicocele repair increases spontaneous pregnancy rates compared to observation or no treatment [^11365rg1] [^1124mnZk].

- **Reduction in sperm DNA fragmentation**: Varicocelectomy reduces sperm DNA fragmentation, which is associated with improved fertility outcomes [^111Pz32W] [^1179zeiY].

- **Decreased need for assisted reproductive technology (ART)**: Varicocele repair may reduce the need for more invasive ART procedures, such as IVF or ICSI, by improving semen quality [^112EAbVs] [^111uVTTy].

---

## Surgical techniques and outcomes

Several **surgical techniques** are available for varicocele repair, including microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy, inguinal varicocelectomy, laparoscopic varicocelectomy, and percutaneous embolization. Microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy is considered the **gold standard** [^116Dv6uU] due to its low recurrence rate (1–2%), minimal complication rate, and superior outcomes in terms of semen improvement and pregnancy rates [^1124mnZk].

| **Attribute** | **Microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy** | **Other surgical techniques** |
|-|-|-|
| Recurrence rate | 1–2% | Higher (5–15%) |
| Complication rate | Low | Higher |
| Semen improvement | Significant | Variable |
| Pregnancy rate | Higher | Lower |

---

## Potential risks and complications

Varicocele surgery is **generally safe**, but potential risks and complications include:

- **Recurrence**: Persistent or recurrent varicocele occurs in approximately 1–2% of cases with microsurgical techniques [^1124mnZk].

- **Hydrocele formation**: Fluid accumulation around the testicle occurs in 1–3% of cases.

- **Infection**: Rare, occurring in less than 1% of cases.

- **Testicular atrophy**: Rare, particularly with microsurgical techniques that preserve arterial blood supply [^1136MkNE].

---

## Alternative treatments

If varicocele surgery is not indicated or declined, **alternative treatments** include observation with continued attempts at natural conception and ART (IUI, IVF, ICSI) [^114WWaot]. ART may be recommended for couples with prolonged infertility, advanced female age, or significant male factor infertility [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Varicocele surgery is **beneficial** for selected infertile men with palpable varicoceles and abnormal semen parameters, leading to improved semen quality, increased spontaneous pregnancy rates, and reduced need for ART [^1161pqe3] [^112SRK2q]. It is not recommended for subclinical varicoceles, normal semen analysis, or non-obstructive azoospermia without proven testicular sperm production [^116wZzTn] [^113wyW76] [^1161pqe3]. Microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy is the **preferred surgical technique** due to its low recurrence and complication rates [^1124mnZk]. Patients should be thoroughly counseled regarding potential benefits, risks, and alternatives before proceeding with surgery [^111QMFrT].

## References

### Correlation of 17-OH progesterone changes with semen parameters and pregnancy outcomes in hypogonadal and eugonadal patients after varicocelectomy [^117ByFVe]. Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of varicocele repair on serum 17-OH progesterone (17-OHP) levels and investigate its relationship with semen parameters and pregnancy outcomes in hypogonadal and eugonadal patients. Additionally, to address the unclear association between varicocele and serum 17-OHP levels in male infertility.

Methods

This prospective study included 135 men who underwent microscopic subinguinal varicocelectomy. Pre-operative and post-operative (3–6 months) hormone levels, including follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, total testosterone (TT), and 17-OHP, and semen parameters, such as total motile sperm count (TMS) and sperm morphology, were analyzed. Patients were categorized as hypogonadal (TT < 300 ng/dL) or eugonadal (TT ≥ 300 ng/dL). Pregnancy outcomes were recorded over a 12-month follow-up period.

Results

Significant increases in TT and 17-OHP levels were observed only in hypogonadal men, while TMS and sperm morphology improved in both groups. In hypogonadal men, changes in serum 17-OHP levels (Δ-17-OHP) positively correlated with TMS improvement (r = 0.388, P = 0.009). Furthermore, in hypogonadal patients, although not statistically significant, Δ-17-OHP were higher in men whose partners achieved pregnancy compared to those whose partners did not.

Conclusion

Varicocele repair improves semen parameters in both hypogonadal and eugonadal men. In hypogonadal men, increases in Δ-17-OHP are linked to TMS improvements, highlighting its potential as a clinical biomarker. Further studies are warranted to validate 17-OHP as a predictor of pregnancy outcomes.

### The impact of microsurgical repair of subclinical and clinical varicoceles on total motile sperm count: is there a difference? [^111yuZm7]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if subclinical varicocele repair produces similar results to palpable varicocele repair.

Methods

Retrospective review was performed on 190 infertile men who underwent a microsurgical varicocele repair by two surgeons from 2009 to 2017. Improvement in total motile sperm count (TMC) that enables men limited to in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intrauterine insemination (IUI) to undergo IUI or natural conception (upgrade) is clinically meaningful. Using TMC, men were grouped into three pre- and postoperative categories: IVF, (TMC < 5 million), IUI (TMC 5–9 million), or natural pregnancy (TMC > 9 million). Changes in category after varicocele repair were assessed. We compared the proportion of men in each category with clinical varicoceles to those with subclinical varicoceles.

Results

Men with clinical and subclinical varicoceles had improvements in TMC after surgery (change in TMC of 9.3 ± 19.5, 7.7 ± 22.6 million, P < 0.001 for both, respectively). There was no difference in TMC improvement between men with clinical and subclinical varicoceles (P = 0.66). Of men initially limited to IVF, 11% improved to IUI, and 38% to natural pregnancy. Of patients starting in IUI category, 22% transitioned to natural pregnancy category. No difference exists in the proportion of men who "upgraded" between palpable or subclinical varicoceles.

Conclusion

Men with subclinical varicoceles have similar, clinically meaningful improvement in TMC after varicocele repair compared with men with palpable varicoceles.

### Undergoing varicocele repair before assisted reproduction improves pregnancy rate and live birth rate in azoospermic and oligospermic men with a varicocele: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1174R2AA]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate how varicocele repair (VR) impacts pregnancy (PRs) and live birth rates in infertile couples undergoing assisted reproduction wherein the male partner has oligospermia or azoospermia and a history of varicocele.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

Azoospermic and oligospermic males with varicoceles and in couples undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) with IUI, IVF, or testicular sperm extraction (TESE) with IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

Intervention(S)

Measurement of PRs, live birth, and sperm extraction rates.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Odds ratios for the impact of VR on PRs, live birth, and sperm extraction rates for couples undergoing ART.

Result(S)

Seven articles involving a total of 1,241 patients were included. Meta-analysis showed that VR improved live birth rates for the oligospermic (odds ratio [OR] = 1.699) and combined oligospermic/azoospermic groups (OR = 1.761). Pregnancy rates were higher in the azoospermic group (OR = 2.336) and combined oligospermic/azoospermic groups (OR = 1.760). Live birth rates were higher for patients undergoing IUI after VR (OR = 8.360). Sperm retrieval rates were higher in persistently azoospermic men after VR (OR = 2.509).

Conclusion(S)

Oligospermic and azoospermic patients with clinical varicocele who undergo VR experience improved live birth rates and PRs with IVF or IVF/ICSI. For persistently azoospermic men after VR requiring TESE for IVF/ICSI, VR improves sperm retrieval rates. Therefore, VR should be considered to have substantial benefits for couples with a clinical varicocele even if oligospermia or azoospermia persists after repair and ART is required.

### Natural history of varicocele management in the era of intracytoplasmic sperm injection [^114WWaot]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the outcomes of infertile couples with varicocele.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

University infertility clinic.

Patient(S)

Six hundred ten consecutive infertile couples in whom the man was found to have a clinical varicocele.

Intervention(S)

Microsurgical varicocelectomy and assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs; intrauterine insemination and intracytoplasmic sperm injection).

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Clinical characteristics, pregnancy rates, and ART utilization in two subgroups of couples (those who elected to undergo varicocelectomy and those who did not).

Result(S)

Sixty percent of the couples (363/610) opted for varicocele repair. The surgical and nonsurgical groups had comparable ages and duration of infertility. However, sperm concentration and motility were significantly lower in the surgical group, compared with in the observation one. As well, the surgical group had a significantly higher prevalence of primary infertility (80% vs. 71%) and had significantly smaller testicles bilaterally. Utilization of ART was significantly higher in the observation group compared with the surgical group (54% vs. 38%). Overall pregnancy rates (spontaneous + assisted pregnancies) in the observation and surgical group were not significantly different.

Conclusion(S)

This study suggests that men with poorer baseline characteristics are more likely to opt for varicocele repair. Furthermore, couples electing not to repair the varicocele are more likely to undergo ART procedures to improve their chances of conception.

### Influence of varicocele embolization on the choice of infertility treatment [^117CqpnK]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether embolization of a varicocele improves semen quality and enables use of less-invasive modes of assisted reproductive technology (ART) in infertile men with a physically palpable varicocele confirmed by phlebography.

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

University infertility clinic.

Patient(S)

Fifty patients with varicoceles that were treated with embolization and 11 patients with untreated varicoceles (control group). In both groups the clinical varicoceles had been phlebographically confirmed.

Intervention(S)

Phlebography and embolization.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Semen characteristics and mode of ART before and after treatment.

Result(S)

Median improvements of semen parameters, such as concentration and motility after processing, were significantly greater in the embolization group than in the untreated group. In the embolization group, semen samples improved to levels requiring less-invasive modes of ART in significantly more patients than in the untreated group. Deterioration of semen samples, requiring more invasive techniques, was significantly more frequent in the untreated group than in the embolization group.

Conclusion(S)

Embolization of a varicocele in infertile men significantly improved semen, such that much more often a less-invasive form of ART than was planned before treatment became feasible. Embolization of a varicocele might even prevent further deterioration of semen samples to levels requiring more-invasive ART.

### Microsurgical treatment of persistent or recurrent varicocele [^1136MkNE]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the effectiveness of subinguinal microsurgical varicocelectomy in the treatment of persistent or recurrent varicocele.

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Urban, tertiary care, academic teaching hospital.

Patient(S)

Fifty-four men who presented for treatment of persistent or recurrent varicocele.

Intervention(S)

A single surgeon using an artery and lymphatic sparing subinguinal microsurgical technique with delivery of the testis repaired all varicocele.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Preoperative to postoperative changes in semen parameters (volume of ejaculate, sperm concentration, percent motility, percent morphologically normal sperm, total motile sperm concentration), serum hormone levels, and testicular volume. Pregnancy rates and surgical complications were documented.

Result(S)

Postoperative mean serum T and mean testicular volume increased significantly from prevaricocelectomy levels. Median sperm concentration, percent motility, and total motile sperm per ejaculate improved significantly following recurrent varicocelectomy. Among patients with follow-up over 24 weeks (65%, 35 out of 54), the overall pregnancy rate was 40% (14 out of 35), including 23% (8 out of 35) of pregnancies achieved through natural intercourse, 9% (3 out of 35) with IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and 9% (3 out of 35) with IUI. Complications such as hydrocele, hematoma, wound infection, and testicular atrophy were not observed during the follow-up period.

Conclusion(S)

Treatment of persistent or recurrent varicocele using an artery and lymphatic sparing subinguinal microsurgical technique with delivery of the testis improves semen parameters, serum T levels, and testicular volume from preoperative levels without a significant risk of postoperative complications.

### Surgical or radiological treatment for varicoceles in subfertile men [^1124mnZk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Varicoceles are associated with male subfertility; however, the mechanisms by which varicoceles affect fertility have yet to be satisfactorily explained. Several treatment options exist, including surgical or radiological treatment, however the safest and most efficient treatment remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of surgical and radiological treatment of varicoceles on live birth rate, adverse events, pregnancy rate, varicocele recurrence, and quality of life amongst couples where the adult male has a varicocele, and the female partner of childbearing age has no fertility problems.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 4 April 2020: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. We also searched the trial registries and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) if they were relevant to the clinical question posed and compared different forms of surgical ligation, different forms of radiological treatments, surgical treatment compared to radiological treatment, or one of these aforementioned treatment forms compared to non-surgical methods, delayed treatment, or no treatment. We extracted data if the studies reported on live birth, adverse events, pregnancy, varicocele recurrence, and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of abstracts and full-text publications, alongside data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment, were done dually using the Covidence software. When we had sufficient data, we calculated random-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) meta-analyses; otherwise, we reported results narratively. We used the I 2 statistic to analyse statistical heterogeneity. We planned to use funnel plots to assess publication bias in meta-analyses with at least 10 included studies. We dually rated the risk of bias of studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified 1897 citations after de-duplicating the search results. We excluded 1773 during title and abstract screening. From the 113 new full texts assessed in addition to the 10 studies (11 references) included in the previous version of this review, we included 38 new studies, resulting in a total of 48 studies (59 references) in the review providing data for 5384 participants. Two studies (three references) are ongoing studies and two studies are awaiting classification. Treatment versus non-surgical, non-radiological, delayed, or no treatment Two studies comparing surgical or radiological treatment versus no treatment reported on live birth with differing directions of effect. As a result, we are uncertain whether surgical or radiological treatment improves live birth rates when compared to no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 2.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 26.93; 2 RCTs, N = 204; I² = 74%, very low-certainty evidence). Treatment may improve pregnancy rates compared to delayed or no treatment (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.26; 13 RCTs, N = 1193; I² = 65%, low-certainty evidence). This suggests that couples with no or delayed treatment have a 21% chance of pregnancy, whilst the pregnancy rate after surgical or radiological treatment is between 22% and 48%. We identified no evidence on adverse events, varicocele recurrence, or quality of life for this comparison. Surgical versus radiological treatment We are uncertain about the effect of surgical versus radiological treatment on live birth and on the following adverse events: hydrocele formation, pain, epididymitis, haematoma, and suture granuloma. We are uncertain about the effect of surgical versus radiological treatment on pregnancy rate (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.70; 5 RCTs, N = 456, low-certainty evidence) and varicocele recurrence (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.08; 3 RCTs, N = 380, low-certainty evidence). We identified no evidence on quality of life for this comparison. Surgery versus other surgical treatment We identified 19 studies comparing microscopic subinguinal surgical treatment to any other surgical treatment. Microscopic subinguinal surgical treatment probably improves pregnancy rates slightly compared to other surgical treatments (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.36; 12 RCTs, N = 1473, moderate-certainty evidence). This suggests that couples with microscopic subinguinal surgical treatment have a 10% to 14% chance of pregnancy after treatment, whilst the pregnancy rate in couples after other surgical treatments is 10%. This procedure also probably reduces the risk of varicocele recurrence (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29, 0.79; 14 RCTs, N = 1565, moderate-certainty evidence). This suggests that 0.4% to 1.1% of men undergoing microscopic subinguinal surgical treatment experience recurrent varicocele, whilst 1.4% of men undergoing other surgical treatments do. Results for the following adverse events were inconclusive: hydrocele formation, haematoma, abdominal distension, testicular atrophy, wound infection, scrotal pain, and oedema. We identified no evidence on live birth or quality of life for this comparison. Nine studies compared open inguinal surgical treatment to retroperitoneal surgical treatment. Due to small sample sizes and methodological limitations, we identified neither treatment type as superior or inferior to the other regarding adverse events, pregnancy rates, or varicocele recurrence. We identified no evidence on live birth or quality of life for this comparison. Radiological versus other radiological treatment One study compared two types of radiological treatment (sclerotherapy versus embolisation) and reported 13% varicocele recurrence in both groups. Due to the broad confidence interval, no valid conclusion could be drawn (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.16 to 6.20; 1 RCT, N = 30, very low-certainty evidence). We identified no evidence on live birth, adverse events, pregnancy, or quality of life for this comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the limited evidence, it remains uncertain whether any treatment (surgical or radiological) compared to no treatment in subfertile men may be of benefit on live birth rates; however, treatment may improve the chances for pregnancy. The evidence was also insufficient to determine whether surgical treatment was superior to radiological treatment. However, microscopic subinguinal surgical treatment probably improves pregnancy rates and reduces the risk of varicocele recurrence compared to other surgical treatments. High-quality, head-to-head comparative RCTs focusing on live birth rate and also assessing adverse events and quality of life are warranted.

### Improvement in the fertility rate after placement of microsurgical shunts in men with recurrent varicocele [^1169hUZS]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of microsurgical shunts for secondary varicocele repair after ligation-like procedures, focusing on long-term functional outcomes.

Design

Long-term survey (mean follow-up, 8.5 years) of infertile men after secondary microsurgical reconstructive varicocelectomy.

Setting

University-based medical center.

Patient(S)

Thirty-four infertile men (group A, < 30 years of age; and group B, > 30 years) with recurrent palpable varicocele after varicocelectomy, according to Ivanissevich (n = 28), or after angiographic vein occlusion (n = 6). Ten patients presented bilateral recurrence.

Intervention(S)

Microsurgical shunts between spermatic vein and inferior epigastric vein.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Sperm count, pregnancy rate, and ultrasound evaluation of varicosity.

Result(S)

Complete disappearance of varicosity was achieved in 97.06% of patients, while in 2.94%, a consistent reduction in size was observed. In patients with severe infertility, a significant postoperative increase in seminal parameters was observed. Pregnancy rates were 43.75% in group A and 22.22% in group B.

Conclusion(S)

Microsurgical drainage in patients with recurrent varicocele after ligation-like procedures was shown to be an effective minimally invasive treatment, with immediate hemodynamic recovery of testicular venous outflow and excellent long-term results in patients with left or bilateral recurrences.

### Is varicocelectomy useful for subfertile men with isolated teratozoospermia? [^114ewKf5]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of microsurgical varicocelectomy on sperm morphology in subfertile men with isolated teratozoospermia and a clinically palpable varicocele.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review was performed of men with isolated teratozoospermia who had undergone microsurgical varicocelectomy. Semen analyses following varicocelectomy were performed at 2- to 3-month intervals. Responders to the varicocelectomy were defined as those who fulfilled the following criteria in semen analysis: (1) an improvement in percentage of normal forms to ≥ 4% and (2) normal results for all other semen parameters.

Results

A total of 80 patients underwent unilateral varicocelectomy (n = 49) or bilateral varicocelectomy (n = 31) (mean age of 36 ± 0.4 years, range 24–44). After a mean postoperative follow-up period of 6.8 months, the mean percentage of normal sperm forms increased from 0.9% to 3.5% (P < .001), and the mean sperm motility improved from 50.5% to 56.6% (P = 0.004). The number of responders to the surgery was 16 (20%), and their mean percentage of normal forms increased from 1.3% to 9.1%. The mean preoperative and postoperative semen volume and sperm concentration were not different (P > .05). No differences were observed in age, current smoking status, body mass index, or grade of varicocele between responders and nonresponders.

Conclusion

Varicocelectomy might be an option for treating subfertile patients with isolated teratozoospermia and a clinically apparent varicocele. However, patients should be advised that the surgery helps in limited patients only because more patients did not benefit from the surgery.

### Older age is associated with similar improvements in semen parameters and testosterone after subinguinal microsurgical varicocelectomy [^113wN7Y5]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

It is generally accepted that men with clinically palpable varicocele are at high risk for a progressive decrease in fertility and testosterone levels with time. Varicocelectomy is thought to improve testicular function or at least halt the accelerated decrease in testicular function associated with varicocele. Substantial controversy exists as to whether varicocelectomy is effective in older men, possibly due to irreversible testicular damage or limited potential for recovery from varicocele induced damage.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of men who underwent microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy, as done by a single surgeon. Demographics, patient questionnaires, operative notes, charts, testosterone and semen analysis were reviewed. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on age at surgery, including less than 30, 30 to 39 and 40 years or greater.

Results

A total of 272 men met study inclusion criteria. In all 3 age groups we noted similar testosterone and baseline semen analysis parameters. There were significant increases in sperm concentration and total sperm count in all age groups. When analysis was restricted to men with baseline testosterone 400 ng/dl or less, there was a mean 110, 133 and 136 ng/dl increase in 21 men who were 40 years old or older, in 30 who were 30 to 39 years old and in 21 who were younger than 30 years, respectively.

Conclusions

Microsurgical varicocelectomy resulted in significant increases in sperm concentration, total sperm count and testosterone in all age groups studied, including men in the fifth and sixth decades of life. Microsurgical varicocelectomy should be offered to older men for infertility and/or hypogonadism.

### Current management principles for adolescent varicocele [^115WwBHi]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

The authors review the current approach to management of the adolescent varicocele which has evolved over the past two decades. Principles of observational, surgical and adjunctive management are discussed relative to significant clinical findings. A selective approach to surgical intervention is advocated with the goal of preserving fertility potential.

### Effect of subinguinal varicocelectomy on sperm parameters and pregnancy rate: a two-group study [^114gufWT]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the changes in semen parameters and pregnancy rates after varicocelectomy.

Methods

We evaluated the results of surgery in 146 men with primary infertility and palpable left varicoceles, compared with 62 men who refused surgery and were treated with tamoxiphene. Patients were selected with strict criteria in order to exclude any other infertility factor in the couple. They were followed up for at least 1 year after treatment. Statistical analyses were performed with the Wilcoxon signed rank test, Kolmogov-Smirnof two-sample test and paired samples t test.

Results

After 1 year, the differences in the median values were significant for all parameters. The partners of 62 of the operated men (46.6%) and 8 of the nonoperated (12.9%) became pregnant within 1 year (p < 0.001). Thus, the difference between the true 1-year pregnancy rates was 33.7%. Overall, 83.2% of the operated men improved their semen parameters compared to 32.3% of the nonoperated.

Conclusions

Varicocelectomy improves all semen parameters and pregnancy rates significantly. Palpable varicoceles should be operated upon when found in infertile couples.

### Successful adolescent varicocelectomy improves total motile sperm count [^113c9BbK]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of the adolescent varicocele focuses on optimizing fertility potential, but to date there is limited data on the success of varicocelectomy on optimizing semen parameters for individual adolescent patients. We reviewed our database of over 1600 adolescent varicocele patients to find those with pre- and postoperative semen analyses to determine the impact of varicocele correction.

Methods

15 Tanner stage V patients with unilateral clinically apparent left-sided with pre- and postoperative semen analyses were identified. Mixed models were used to compare semen parameters pre- and post-varicocelectomy in patients with successful management.

Results

Complete elimination of the varicocele was achieved in 12/15 (80%) patients. Three patients had persistent varicocele (with down-grading in two) and declined further intervention. Median time between pre- and postoperative semen analyses was 24.2 months. For those with successful varicocele correction, total motile sperm count (TMSC) improved in all but one (Figure 1), with an average increase of 44.0 million (95% CI: 18.7–69.3) in post-varicocelectomy analyses compared to pre-varicocelectomy (p = 0.0016). Mean percent improvement was 649.2%. It went from abnormal to normal (≥ 20 million/cc) in 55.6% (5/9). For the three patients with persistent varicocele, one had improved TMSC from abnormal to normal range, one had worsening within normal range, and one had effectively no change.

Conclusion

Successful correction of adolescent varicocele may improve TMSC. In over half of our institution's cases, an abnormal value normalized. Surgical intervention may be considered for adolescent varicoceles associated with abnormal semen parameters.

### Treatment of varicocele in subfertile men: the cochrane review – a contrary opinion [^113VGMct]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

A recent Cochrane meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) concluded that surgical or radiological treatment of varicocele in men from couples with otherwise unexplained subfertility cannot be recommended. The aim of the present study is to address criticisms of this review carrying out a critical analysis of all available RCTs.

Materials and Methods

The eight randomised clinical trials selected in the last Cochrane Library systematic review have been evaluated. All RCTs including patients either with normal semen analysis or subclinical varicocele have been excluded. Inclusion criteria, number and clinical characteristics of randomised patients, and outcomes reported in terms of pregnancy rate one year after randomisation have been described in the remaining studies.

Results

Only 3/8 RCTs included patients with abnormal semen analysis and palpable varicocele. Overall 120 patients in the treatment group and 117 in the control group were randomised. The studies turned out to be heterogeneous in terms of inclusion criteria and clinical characteristics of the analysed patients. Their methodological quality and statistical power have to be considered poor. Moreover, the "as treated" cumulative analysis showed a significant increase in pregnancy rate in patients who underwent varicocele treatment (36.4%) compared with the control group (20%) (p = 0.009).

Conclusions

The RCTs included in the last Cochrane review concerning the efficacy of varicocele treatment in subfertile couples were heterogeneous and methodologically poor. The pooling of these studies cannot result in a good quality meta-analysis. The Cochrane meta-analysis conclusions should not support guidelines recommendation against varicocele treatment in subfertile patients. Data from ongoing studies should provide more information in this topic.

### Varicocelectomy before assisted reproductive technology: are outcomes improved? [^112EAbVs]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical varicoceles have been associated with impaired semen parameters and male-factor infertility. Varicocele repair can improve live birth rates for men with clinical varicocele. Varicocelectomy is often combined with assisted reproductive techniques (ART) such as intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Here we review the literature examining varicocelectomy before ART to evaluate whether improved pregnancy outcomes are realized. Although insufficient evidence exists to determine if correcting a varicocele improves IUI outcomes, a clinical benefit is observed when correcting a clinical varicocele in oligospermic and nonobstructed azoospermic men before IVF/ICSI. In couples seeking fertility with the use of ART, varicocele repair may offer improvement in semen parameters and may decrease the level of ART needed to achieve successful pregnancy.

### Paternity after adolescent varicocele repair [^111snbhd]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Varicocelectomy has long been a therapeutic modality used in the treatment of male infertility. In the past decade, adolescent varicocelectomy has become a frequent procedure to preserve testicular growth and to help prevent future infertility. Because our clinical population includes a large portion of orthodox Jews who traditionally marry early and are forbidden to use birth control by religious law, we thought that by studying our patients, we might be able to accelerate our follow-up regarding paternity. In addition, we wanted to learn whether adolescent varicocelectomy might have any negative impact.

Methods

Questionnaires inquiring as to the marital and paternity status, postoperative course, and complications were sent to 50 patients who had undergone a unilateral or bilateral varicocele repair during adolescence and who were at least 21 years old at the time of this review. In addition, a careful chart review was performed to examine the perioperative and postoperative parameters of each respondent.

Results

Of the 43 responses (86% response rate), 18 of 18 patients who had attempted to father a child were successful. The remaining 25 were not married or had never attempted to father a child. In the paternity group, 10 of the fathers had undergone an Ivanissevich repair; the remaining 8 had a Palomo repair. Sixteen of the 18 had unilateral varicocelectomies, and 2 underwent bilateral repairs. Of those with a unilateral varicocele, the indication for surgery in 10 was a grade 2 to 3 varicocele associated with a > 20% volume difference when compared with the right testicle. Three had 10% to 20% volume loss, whereas the remaining three had unusually large grade 3 varicoceles without concurrent volume difference.

Conclusions

Varicocelectomy in the adolescent population has been proposed as a therapeutic intervention to preserve both fertility and testicular growth. Although not showing a cause-and-effect relationship, it is our contention that varicocelectomy in adolescence at worst does no harm and at best preserves fertility.

### Pregnancy after varicocelectomy: impact of postoperative motility and DFI [^1179zeiY]. Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine clinical and laboratory variables to determine which, if any, predict improved semen parameters and pregnancy after varicocelectomy.

Methods

Surgical logs were reviewed for men who underwent varicocele ligation for a fertility concern. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data was obtained through medical chart review and paired with postoperative reproductive outcomes obtained through chart review and survey.

Results

Eighty-three subjects met inclusion criteria of which 63 and 24 completed both preoperative and postoperative basic and advanced semen testing, respectively. There was a statistically significant improvement in semen concentration, total motile count, sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI), and total normal sperm count (TNSC) after varicocelectomy. Motility improved significantly in patients with preoperative asthenospermia. Concentration and motility demonstrated mean increases of 5.2 M/mL and 18%, respectively. DFI decreased from a preoperative mean of 40.8% to a postoperative mean of 24.5%. Fifty-one percent of couples were able to conceive using natural conception, intrauterine insemination, or in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Pregnancy, regardless of the method used to conceive, was associated with a higher postoperative motility. The mean postoperative DFI in couples who reported a spontaneous pregnancy was 34%, which was statistically higher than the mean DFI of 17.5% in couples who reported a pregnancy with IVF/ICSI (P = 0.04).

Conclusion

Varicocele ligation improves multiple semen parameters. An increase in motility was the only variable associated with postoperative pregnancy irrespective of the method by which pregnancy was obtained. Mean DFI in couples able to achieve spontaneous pregnancy was above 30% and statistically higher than couples who reported pregnancy via IVF/ICSI.

### EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health [^116GTVzX]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for varicocele, more specifically with respect to indications for varicocelectomy, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to treat infertile men with a clinical varicocele, abnormal semen parameters, and otherwise unexplained infertility in a couple where the female partner has a good ovarian reserve to improve fertility rates.

### Nomogram for predicting spontaneous pregnancy after microscopic varicocelectomy in infertile men with normal hormone [^113eLbgb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

The study has several limitations. First, it uses a retrospective design. Second, some potential predictors are not included, such as anti-sperm antibodies; however, they are not widely accepted in clinical practice. Third, laparoscopic or open techniques were not included. This was because microscopic surgery is the gold standard in varicocelectomy. Fourth, the inability to obtain accurate data on the health condition of female partners because this information was completed by men in the survey. Fifth, there was a brief follow-up period (6–12 months). However, current evidence indicates that the average time to improve semen parameters is approximately two spermatogenic cycles, with SP occurring between six and 12 months post varicocelectomy. This is the first nomogram for predicting the SP in infertile men post MSV by adjusting extensive confounding factors (including the age of female partners, life habits, surgical approach, and the number of ligation veins) based on a large cohort. This nomogram was successfully validated. Further largescale multi-center prospective studies are necessary to validate this predictive model and confirm its generalizability and clinical applicability.

### Nomograms for predicting changes in semen parameters in infertile men after varicocele repair [^1131BPXH]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To formulate nomograms based on pre-repair characteristics to predict improvements in semen parameters after varicocele repair.

Design

Model using multivariable linear regression based on prospectively collected database, with performance was quantified by concordance correlation coefficient and Pearson correlation coefficient after internal validation with bootstrapping.

Setting

A male infertility specialty clinic.

Patient(S)

Men presenting for fertility evaluation from 2003–2012 having varicocele repair.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Semen parameters before and after varicocele repair.

Result(S)

Men undergoing varicocele repair (surgical or embolization) were identified via a prospectively collected database. The relationship of pre-repair semen and clinical characteristics to improvements in semen parameters was modeled using multivariable linear regression, then the model performance was quantified by concordance correlation coefficient and Pearson correlation coefficient after internal validation with bootstrapping. A total of 376 men who had undergone varicocele repair had data available for analysis. After varicocelectomy, the total motile count (TMC) varied depending on the initial left varicocele grade, ejaculate volume, sperm concentration, and motility. The final sperm concentration depended on the initial left varicocele grade, sperm concentration, and motility. The postvaricocelectomy sperm motility varied depending on the patient's age, left varicocele grade, sperm motility, morphology, and TMC. The final percentage of normal forms depended on the prevaricocelectomy sperm morphology, age, right varicocele grade, normal morphology, and TMC. Nomograms using prevaricocelectomy semen parameters and clinical features were developed to predict postvaricocelectomy TMC, sperm concentration, motility, and morphology. The concordance correlation coefficients were 0.45, 0.47, 0.65, and 0.36, respectively.

Conclusion(S)

Clinical factors provide substantial ability to predict postvaricocele repair semen parameters. These nomograms may be used by clinicians to predict postvaricocele repair semen parameters.

### Adult varicocele [^113QTyF9]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Adult varicocele presents a challenge for male reproductive specialists. We have yet to fully elucidate the pathophysiology of varicocele. The enigma of the varicocele, although a source of frustration for clinicians, has been a siren call for researchers as attested to by the substantial, if flawed body of literature on the topic. We critically review recent publications on varicocele.

Recent Findings

Although yielding mixed results, studies this year have explored the potential relationship between oxidative stress and varicocele-associated infertility. In clinically focused research, one group tackled the contentious question of efficacy of surgical varicocele management. Building on the errors of prior meta-analyses, this study takes a fresh view on an old but vital topic. Finally, it is becoming clearer that varicocele affects Leydig cell function as well as seminiferous tubular function, and is a risk factor for androgen deficiency.

Summary

With exceptions, recent studies support a role for varicocelectomy in the management of infertile couples. In addition, evidence is accumulating that early repair of varicoceles, especially large varicoceles, may be effective in preventing future infertility and may be an effective treatment for androgen deficiency.

### Microsurgical varicocele ligation: surgical methodology and associated outcomes [^116Dv6uU]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). Medium credibility.

The impact of clinical varicoceles on semen parameters and male infertility has long been established. In the era of assisted reproduction, clinical discussion has questioned the role of varicocelectomy, offering the potential to bypass, rather than treat, varicocele-associated male infertility. However, current literature supports improved semen parameters and reproductive outcomes following repair. This article presents the stepwise operative approaches to microsurgical varicocelectomy and discusses the recent publications on outcomes.

### Varicocele management strategies and resulting paternity rates in a cohort of young adults [^111PU3DV]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the paternity rate in a large cohort of asymptomatic adult varicocele patients undergoing nonsurgical management and surgery.

Methods

The study population included 1845 men with varicocele and 9286 healthy controls. All data were retrospectively obtained from the Israeli Defense Forces medical database. Patients were divided according to the management strategy: 1758 (95.2%) were followed up nonsurgically, 63 (3.4%) had preventive surgery (patients without known infertility), and 24 (1.4%) had secondary surgery (patients with varicocele and primary infertility) as young adults. The primary outcome was the live birth rate.

Results

The live birth rate was similar in the preventive surgery and control groups. Both preventive surgery and control groups had higher live birth rate than the nonsurgical group. Finally, the secondary surgery group had the lowest live birth rate of all groups.

Conclusion

Preventive surgery for asymptomatic varicocele provides similar fertility outcomes to control groups, whereas nonsurgical strategy provides inferior outcomes and may be overutilized.

### Beneficial effects of microsurgical varicocelectomy on semen parameters in patients who underwent surgery for causes other than infertility [^1164wUvd]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate whether clinical varicoceles are associated with abnormal semen parameters and whether varicocelectomy could improve the parameters in patients with causes other than infertility.

Methods

A total of 268 adult men with clinical varicocele underwent microsurgical varicocelectomy resulting from causes other than infertility. A retrospective analysis of total sperm count, total motile sperm count, sperm concentration, motility, and morphology were performed.

Results

Of 268 patients, at least 1 abnormal parameter (concentration, motility, or morphology) was found on preoperative semen analysis in 169 (63.1%) patients for whom 121 postoperative analyses were available. Abnormal sperm concentration was observed in 49 (40.5%) patients, motility in 112 (92.6%) patients, and morphology in 82 (67.8%) patients. Total sperm count, total motile sperm count, sperm concentration, and motility showed statistically significant improvement after microsurgical varicocelectomy, however, sperm morphology did not. Subgroup analysis of patients with oligospermia, asthenospermia, or teratospermia showed significant improvement in all semen parameters after varicocelectomy. The highest improvement rate was observed in sperm concentration of patients with oligospermia when a greater than 20% change in preoperative value was defined as improvement or deterioration in semen parameters. Overall, 92 (76.0%) patients showed improvement in at least 1 semen parameter.

Conclusions

The majority of varicocele patients with causes other than infertility had abnormal semen parameters, and most semen parameters showed significant improvement after microsurgical varicocelectomy. Therefore, regardless of the chief complaint, semen analysis should be performed in men with clinical varicocele.

### Nomogram for predicting spontaneous pregnancy after microscopic varicocelectomy in infertile men with normal hormone [^115qGBBF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our findings indicated that younger female partners, larger diameter of veins, higher initial and increased total progressively motile sperm count were significant predictors of spontaneous pregnancy in infertile men, post microscopic varicocelectomy. This nomogram may assist in individual decision-making on the treatment strategy of varicocele preoperatively and improve the treatment outcome.

### Beneficial effect of microsurgical varicocelectomy is superior for men with bilateral versus unilateral repair [^1132soZb]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Varicocele represents the most common correctable cause of male infertility, and most reports indicate that varicocelectomy has a beneficial effect on male fertility and pregnancy outcome. Little is known about the differential effect of bilateral, compared to unilateral varicocelectomy, on male fertility potential.

Materials and Methods

A total of 369 consecutive varicocelectomies were performed for male factor infertility between July 1996 and July 2002. The outcomes measured include postoperative changes in semen parameters, pregnancy rates (assisted and unassisted) and use of assisted reproductive technology (intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection).

Results

There were 157 men who underwent bilateral and 212 who underwent unilateral left varicocelectomy. Both groups had comparable male and female ages, and baseline semen parameters. Semen parameters improved significantly after surgery in the bilateral and unilateral groups. Moreover, the improvement in percent motility was significantly greater in the bilateral compared to the unilateral group (8.0% ± 1.7% compared to 4.4% ± 1.5% improvement, respectively, p < 0.01). In addition, the spontaneous pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the bilateral compared to the unilateral group (49% vs 36%, respectively, p < 0.05). Assisted reproductive technology was comparable in the unilateral and bilateral groups (64% vs 51%, respectively, p > 0.05).

Conclusions

Our data indicate that bilateral varicocelectomy (for clinically palpable bilateral varicoceles) is associated with a significantly greater improvement in sperm quality (motility) and male fertility potential than unilateral varicocelectomy. The greater improvement in semen parameters and pregnancy outcome associated with bilateral varicocelectomy support the concept of a detrimental dose-effect of varicocele on male fertility potential.

### Report on varicocele and infertility: a committee opinion [^111oF9fM]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for varicocele, more specifically with respect to indications for varicocelectomy, ASRM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider offering varicocele repair with surgical or percutaneous embolization techniques in young male patients not actively trying to conceive and having varicocele and objective evidence of reduced ipsilateral testicular size.

### Varicocele and male factor infertility treatment: a new meta-analysis and review of the role of varicocele repair [^115bn5XR]. European Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Varicocele is a common condition, found in many men who present for infertility evaluation.

Objective

To assess the effect of varicocelectomy on male infertility.

Evidence Acquisition

A literature search was performed using Embase and Medline. Literature reviewed included meta-analyses and randomized and nonrandomized prospective (controlled and noncontrolled) studies. In addition, a new meta-analysis was performed.

Evidence Synthesis

Four randomized controlled trials reporting on pregnancy outcome after repair of clinical varicoceles in oligozoospermic men were identified. Using the random effect model, the combined odds ratio was 2.23 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86–5.78; p = 0.091), indicating that varicocelectomy is moderately superior to observation, but the effect is not statistically significant. We identified 22, 17, and 5 prospective studies reporting on sperm concentration, total motility, and progressive motility, respectively, before and after repair of clinical varicocele. The random effect model combined improvement in sperm concentration was 12.32 million sperm per milliliter (95% CI, 9.45–15.19; p < 0.0001). The random effect model combined improvement in sperm total and progressive motility were 10.86% (95% CI, 7.07–14.65; p < 0.0001) and 9.69% (95% CI, 4.86–14.52; p = 0.003), respectively. These results indicate that varicocelectomy is associated with a significant increase in sperm concentration as well as total and progressive motility. Prospective studies also show that varicocelectomy reduces seminal oxidative stress and sperm DNA damage as well as improving sperm ultramorphology. Studies indicate that a microsurgical approach to a varicocele repair results in less recurrence and fewer complications than other techniques.

Conclusions

Although there is no conclusive evidence that a varicocele repair improves spontaneous pregnancy rates, varicocelectomy improves sperm parameters (count and total and progressive motility), reduces sperm DNA damage and seminal oxidative stress, and improves sperm ultramorphology. The various methods of repair are all viable options, but microsurgical repair seems to be associated with better outcomes.

### Report on varicocele and infertility: a committee opinion [^113tV5Cr]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for varicocele, more specifically with respect to indications for varicocelectomy, ASRM 2014 guidelines recommend to recognize that varicocele repair improves semen parameters (approximately in 3–6 months) and fertility and is associated with a low risk of complications.

### The contemporary role of varicocele repair: why operate when in-vitro fertilization results are so good? [^113ucpFc]. Current Opinion in Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A male factor is either the primary cause or is contributory in at least half of all couples with infertility. Currently, many male factor problems may be disregarded, as reproductive technology has advanced so much that in-vitro fertilization (IVF)/Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) allows the use of even a single sperm to achieve pregnancy.

Recent Findings

Varicocele is the most commonly diagnosed correctable cause. Microsurgical repair is considered the gold standard for repair. Research has shown that varicocele repair can impact the outcome of reproductive management and upgrade male infertility from adoption or donor sperm only to IVF/ICSI and microTESE, or IVF/ICSI with ejaculated sperm, or from IVF/ICSI to intrauterine insemination (IUI) or often naturally conceived.

Summary

Varicocele diagnosis and repair is an essential part of infertility evaluation. Not only does it potentially impact antiretroviral therapy choices, but it can also increase testosterone levels benefiting long-term male health.

### Varicocele repair for nonobstructive azoospermia [^112ftWux]. Current Opinion in Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To evaluate the role of varicocelectomy in the management of patients with varicoceles and nonobstructive azoospermia and to review predictors of successful outcomes.

Recent Findings

Several small, retrospective, noncontrolled studies have documented return of sperm to the ejaculate in up to 56% of men with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) following varicocele repair. Additionally, a recent meta-analysis has reported a 6% spontaneous pregnancy rate in amongst NOA patients who underwent varicocele repair, regardless of surgical technique. Although these observations are promising, evidence for whether or not varicocele repair significantly improves spermatogenesis within an impaired testicle is conflicting. No clear predictors of success following varicocele repair have been identified, but a certain level of spermatogenesis on testicular biopsy appears to be necessary for a desirable outcome after varicocele repair.

Summary

The role of varicocelectomy for the treatment on NOA is controversial. Prospective, controlled studies are needed in order to define the true benefit of varicocele repair in men with NOA, in terms of improvement in semen parameters, testicular sperm retrieval rates, and pregnancy outcomes.

### Does varicocele repair improve male infertility? An evidence-based perspective from a randomized, controlled trial [^11365rg1]. European Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) addressing varicocele treatment are scarce and have conflicting outcomes.

Objective

To determine whether varicocele treatment is superior or inferior to no treatment in male infertility from an evidence-based perspective.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prospective, nonmasked, parallel-group RCT with a one-to-one concealed-to-random allocation was conducted at the authors' institution from February 2006 to October 2009. Married men 20–39 yr of age who had experience infertility ≥ 1 yr, had palpable varicoceles, and with at least one impaired semen parameter (sperm concentration < 20 million/ml, progressive motility < 50%, or normal morphology < 30%) were eligible. Exclusions included subclinical or recurrent varicoceles, normal semen parameters, and azoospermia. Sample size analysis suggested 68 participants per arm.

Intervention

Participants were randomly allocated to observation (the control arm [CA]) or subinguinal microsurgical varicocelectomy (the treatment arm [TA]). Semen analyses were obtained at baseline (three analyses) and at follow-up months 3, 6, 9, and 12. The mean of each sperm parameter at baseline and follow-ups was determined.

Measurements

We measured the spontaneous pregnancy rate (the primary outcome), changes from baseline in mean semen parameters, and the occurrence of adverse events (AE-the secondary outcomes) during 12-mo follow-up; p < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results and Limitations

Analysis included 145 participants (CA: n = 72; TA: n = 73), with a mean age plus or minus standard deviation of 29.3 ± 5.7 in the CA and 28.4 ± 5.7 in the TA (p = 0.34). Baseline characteristics in both arms were comparable. Spontaneous pregnancy was achieved in 13.9% (CA) versus 32.9% (TA), with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.04 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33–6.95) and a number needed to treat (NNT) of 5.27 patients (95% CI, 1.55–8.99). In CA within-arm analysis, none of semen parameters revealed significant changes from baseline (sperm concentration [p = 0.18], progressive motility [p = 0.29], and normal morphology [p = 0.05]). Conversely, in TA within-arm analysis, the mean of all semen parameters improved significantly in follow-up versus baseline (p < 0.0001). In between-arm analysis, all semen parameters improved significantly in the TA versus CA (p < 0.0001). No AEs were reported.

Conclusions

Our RCT provided level 1b evidence of the superiority of varicocelectomy over observation in infertile men with palpable varicoceles and impaired semen quality, with increased odds of spontaneous pregnancy and improvements in semen characteristics within 1-yr of follow-up.

Surgical varicocelectomy.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Spontaneous pregnancy outcome.

Result(S)

The odds of spontaneous pregnancy after surgical varicocelectomy, compared with no or medical treatment for palpable varicocele, were 2.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33–6.20) with use of a random-effects model or 2.63 (95% CI, 1.60–4.33) with use of a fixed-effects model. The number needed to treat was 5.7 (95% CI, 4.4–9.5).

Conclusion(S)

Surgical varicocelectomy in infertile men with palpable lesions and at least one abnormal semen parameter improves the odds of spontaneous pregnancy in their female partners. Five studies were included (two randomized, three observational). All were scored for bias. Our study suggests that varicocelectomy in selected patients does indeed have beneficial effects on fertility status.

### Microsurgical varicocelectomy for isolated asthenospermia [^115N9Ffp]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Varicocele represents the most common cause of male infertility, and most reports indicate that varicocelectomy has a beneficial effect on male fertility and pregnancy outcome. We evaluated the clinical outcomes of infertile couples with varicocele and isolated asthenospermia who chose to undergo varicocelectomy as well as those who chose not to undergo the procedure.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective review of 118 consecutive infertile couples in whom the man presented with clinical varicocele and isolated asthenospermia (less than 50% motile sperm). All couples were presented with possible treatment options (observation, varicocelectomy, assisted reproductive technologies). The clinical characteristics and outcomes of 2 subgroups of men — those who elected to undergo surgery (varicocelectomy, 69) and those who did not (49) — were examined and compared.

Results

Mean male and female patient age, duration of infertility and baseline total motile sperm count were not significantly different in the control and surgery groups. The mean total motile sperm count increased significantly after varicocelectomy (29.6 million preoperatively vs 39.0 million postoperatively, p < 0.05). The spontaneous pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the surgery group compared to the control group (65% vs 32%, respectively, p < 0.01). The combined spontaneous and intrauterine insemination pregnancy rate was also significantly higher in the surgery group compared to the control group (74% vs 36%, respectively, p < 0.01). Use of in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection was significantly higher in the control group compared to the surgery group (32% vs 11%, respectively, p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Our data support the practice of varicocelectomy for the treatment of clinical varicocele and isolated asthenospermia.

### The effect of prior varicocelectomy in patients with nonobstructive azoospermia on intracytoplasmic sperm injection outcomes: a retrospective pilot study [^115KFEb9]. Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine our retrospective data on the outcomes of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and to determine whether a history of varicocele repair in men with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) undergoing an ICSI cycle was optimizing or not.

Methods

This retrospective study was conducted on Baskent University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, IVF Unit, and Department of Urology. Infertile couples suffering from NOA scheduled to an ICSI cycle, which was controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with a gonadotropin or gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-agonist protocol, selected for the study were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (n = 31) included NOA patients who had undergone prior varicocele repair, and group 2 (n = 65) included NOA patients who had not undergone varicocele repair.

Results

There was a significant difference between the 2 groups considering the sperm retrieval rate, which was higher in the varicocele repair group (sperm retrieval rate 60.81% and 38.46% respectively, P = 0.01). The clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate were significantly higher in the varicocelectomy group (74.2% vs 52.3% and 64.5% vs 41.5%, respectively, P < .05).

Conclusions

Varicocele repair in NOA might be considered in patients undergoing ICSI cycle.

### Varicocelectomy improves intrauterine insemination success rates in men with varicocele [^1162C4dq]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined whether varicocele treatment before intrauterine insemination significantly affects intrauterine insemination success rates.

Materials and Methods

A total of 58 infertile couples, of whom the women had normal evaluations and men had abnormal semen analyses and a history of varicocele, were included in this study. They were identified after reviewing the charts of all women undergoing intrauterine insemination for male factor infertility at our center. Of the men 24 participated in 63 intrauterine insemination cycles without varicocele treatment, while in the remaining 34 varicocele was treated before a total of 101 intrauterine insemination cycles. Variables associated with pregnancy or live birth were analyzed using repeat measures logistic regression with generalized estimating equation techniques. An initial stepwise generalized estimating equation was performed without including varicocele treatment status. Subsequently varicocele treatment status and the significant associated factors were included in analysis. The semen characteristics of untreated and treated varicocele groups were compared with repeat measures analysis of variance.

Results

On pre-wash semen analysis patients with untreated varicocele had significantly higher mean motility plus or minus standard error than patients whose varicoceles were treated (48.6% ± 2.3% versus 38.1% ± 1.8%, p = 0.02). However, no statistically significant difference was noted in the mean post-wash total motile sperm count in the treated and untreated groups (7.2 ± 1.0 versus 14.8 ± 2.6, p = 0.1). Despite these findings the pregnancy and live birth rates per cycle were significantly higher in patients in whom varicocele was treated than in those without varicocele treatment (11.8% versus 6.3%, p = 0.04 and 11.8% versus 1.6%, p = 0.007, respectively).

Conclusions

Varicocele treatment may not improve semen characteristics in all men but it appears to improve pregnancy and live birth rates among couples undergoing intrauterine insemination for male factor infertility. A functional factor not measured on routine semen analysis may affect pregnancy rates in this setting. Men should be screened for varicocele before intrauterine insemination is initiated for male factor infertility.

### Treatment of varicocele in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112RhJ5R]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of varicoceles is as high as 15% in children and adolescents. Optimal management of varicoceles has not been consolidated. Options include observation, radiological intervention, or surgical varicocelectomy.

Objective

Herein, we aim to assess the outcomes of radiological and surgical interventions for varicocele in children and adolescents evaluated by RCTs.

Study Design

The study subjects were children and adolescents up to 21 years old, diagnosed with varicocele and allocated to receive either "surgical or radiological intervention" or "no treatment".

Materials and Methods

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (Ovid platform), Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for RCTs reporting on varicocele treatment in children and adolescents up to June 23, 2016. Only RCTs with patients aged under 21 years were included. Main outcomes of interest included changes in testicular size, semen analysis parameters, surgical adverse events and failures.

Results

Nine eligible studies were included in the systematic review. Meta-analysis based on available outcomes data demonstrated an improvement in testicular volume (mean difference 3.18 mL, 95% CI 1.94–4.42) and in sperm count (mean difference 25.54 × 10 6 /mL, 95% CI 12.84–38.25) in patients who underwent radiological or surgical treatment compared with conservative management.

Conclusions

Based on current available randomized controlled trials, there is low to moderate level of evidence that radiological or surgical treatment of adolescent varicocele is associated with improved testicular size/growth and sperm concentration. The ultimate effects on fertility and paternity rates are not known.

### Varicoceles… [^115wszk2]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

A varicocele is an enlargement of veins above the testicles. Varicoceles are present in 20% of men, often develop during puberty, and can grow larger with age. A varicocele develops from veins that carry blood away from the testicles and toward the heart. Normally, valves in these veins help blood move in the right direction. If there is a problem with these valves, a backup of blood can occur. This causes the veins near the testicle to dilate and swell, resulting in a varicocele. A person's genes affect how likely they are to develop a varicocele. Men are more likely to have a varicocele if their father or brother has had one. Varicoceles are more commonly found on the left side of the testicles. Varicoceles are the most common cause of male infertility. A major function of the veins surrounding the testicles is to draw heat away from the testicles. A varicocele can cause the testicles to overheat, which negatively affects sperm production.

This can result in decreased sperm quantity and quality, as well as lower testosterone levels. If a person does not have discomfort and fertility is not affected, treatment is usually unnecessary. For individuals with pain, sometimes an ultrasound is done and shows a varicocele, but it is important to rule out other sources of pain such as infection and trauma before addressing the varicocele. For individuals with decreased fertility and/or pain due to a varicocele, multiple treatment options are available and should be discussed with a male infertility specialist and/or urologist. Treatment options include open surgery, laparoscopic surgery, embolization, or a type of surgery called microsurgical subinguinal varicocele repair, which uses a surgical microscope. The goal of all treatments is to tie off or block the veins involved in a varicocele and return testicle function to normal.

For men with pain, varicocelectomy is effective 80% to 90% of the time. For men concerned about fertility, 70% of those who have their varicoceles treated have improvement in sperm production in as little as 3 to 6 months. In addition, success with assisted reproduction such as intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization may be improved after repair.

### Surgery or embolisation for varicocele in subfertile men [^113xk4wW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

A varicocele is an, almost exclusively left-sided, varicosity of the pampiniform plexus of the spermatic cord, forming a tangle of distended blood vessels in the scrotum. Although the concept that varicocele causes male subfertility and therefore varicocelectomy cures male subfertility has been around for almost fifty years now, the mechanisms by which varicocele would affect fertility have not yet been satisfactorily explained, and neither have the mechanisms by which varicocelectomy would resolve subfertility. Furthermore, it has been questioned whether a causal relation exists at all between the distension of the pampiniform plexus and impairment of fertility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of varicocele treatment on pregnancy rate in subfertile couples.

Search Strategy

Relevant trials were identified in the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's specialised register of controlled trials. A MEDLINE search, using the group's search strategy, was performed for the period 1966–2000. Also, hand searching was performed of 22 specialist journals in the field from their first issue till 2000. Cross references and references from review articles were checked.

Selection Criteria

RCTs were included if they were relevant to the clinical question posed, if they reported pregnancy rates as an outcome measure, and if they reported data in treated (surgical ligation or radiological embolization of the internal spermatic vein) and untreated groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

Six studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. One (Nieschlag 1995/1998) was an extension of a previously published study (Nieschlag 1995/1998), which left five studies for analysis (Nilsson 1979; Breznik 1993; Madgar 1995; Yamamoto 1996; Nieschlag 1995/1998). The results of a WHO megatrial are awaited but as yet are unavailable. The WHO data will be added if and when they will have become available. All five only included men from couples with subfertility problems, one (Madgar 1995) excluded men with sperm counts < 5 mill/mL, three (Nilsson 1979; Breznik 1993; Yamamoto 1996) also included men with normal semen analysis. One study (Yamamoto 1996) specifically addressed only men with subclinical varicoceles as diagnosed by thermography. Potentially relevant trials were screened independently by two authors (JE and JC). Any differences of opinion were resolved by consensus meeting (none occurred for this review). Studies were excluded from meta-analysis if they made comparisons other than those specified above.

Main Results

One trial (Madgar 1995) reported a statistically significant improvement in pregnancy rate following high ligation of the left spermatic vein. None of the other four studies showed individually a significant effect on pregnancy rates of varicocele treatment over no-treatment (Nilsson 1979; Breznik 1993; Yamamoto 1996), or over counseling only (Nieschlag 1995/1998). The combined RR (Relative Risk; random effects method) of the five studies is 1.06 (95%CI 0.57–1.94), the Peto OR (Odds Ratio) is 1.15 (95%CI 0.73–1.83).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Insufficient evidence exists that treatment of varicocele in men from couples with otherwise unexplained subfertility does improve the couple's spontaneous pregnancy chances.

### The impact of varicocelectomy on sperm parameters: a meta-analysis [^115BtPYL]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined the impact of 3 surgical techniques (high ligation, inguinal varicocelectomy and the subinguinal approach) for varicocelectomy on sperm parameters (count and motility) and pregnancy rates.

Materials and Methods

By searching the literature using MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library with the last search performed in February 2011, focusing on the last 20 years, a total of 94 articles published between 1975 and 2011 reporting on sperm parameters before and after varicocelectomy were identified. Inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis were at least 2 semen analyses (before and 3 or more months after the procedure), patient age older than 19 years, clinical subfertility and/or abnormal semen parameters, and a clinically palpable varicocele. To rule out skewing factors a bias analysis was performed, and statistical analysis was done with RevMan5(®) and SPSS 15.0(®).

Results

A total of 14 articles were included in the statistical analysis. All 3 surgical approaches led to significant or highly significant postoperative improvement of both parameters with only slight numeric differences among the techniques. This difference did not reach statistical significance for sperm count (p = 0.973) or sperm motility (p = 0.372). After high ligation surgery sperm count increased by 10.85 million per mL (p = 0.006) and motility by 6.80% (p < 0.00001) on the average. Inguinal varicocelectomy led to an improvement in sperm count of 7.17 million per mL (p < 0.0001) while motility changed by 9.44% (p = 0.001). Subinguinal varicocelectomy provided an increase in sperm count of 9.75 million per mL (p = 0.002) and sperm motility by 12.25% (p = 0.001). Inguinal varicocelectomy showed the highest pregnancy rate of 41.48% compared to 26.90% and 26.56% after high ligation and subinguinal varicocelectomy, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.035).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis suggests that varicocelectomy leads to significant improvements in sperm count and motility regardless of surgical technique, with the inguinal approach offering the highest pregnancy rate.

### Adolescent varicocele [^113ozwou]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The evaluation and management of adolescents with varicoceles continue to evolve. Current recommendations for repair are based on the findings of impaired testicular growth or spermatogenesis; however, with early evaluation and selective treatment, clinicians should be able to reduce the potential for future fertility problems significantly in adolescents with varicoceles.

### Varicocele repair in patients with nonobstructive azoospermia: a meta-analysis [^111XdLiX]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Multiple small case series have reported sperm in the ejaculate and spontaneous pregnancies in patients with nonobstructive azoospermia after varicocele repair. We hypothesized that men with favorable testicular histopathology on testis biopsy such as maturation arrest or hypospermatogenesis would have a higher probability of success than those with more ablative pathology, eg Sertoli-cell-only.

Materials and Methods

A review of the literature on varicocele repair in patients with nonobstructive azoospermia was performed and 11 publications from the previous 20 years were evaluated. Histopathological data were presented in 8 publications, and were categorized as Sertoli-cell-only, maturation arrest and hypospermatogenesis. Maturation arrest was further differentiated by 4 publications. Early maturation arrest was defined as maturation ending at the secondary spermatocyte and late maturation arrest was defined as maturation ending at the spermatid without spermatozoa present. Success after repair was defined as having sperm in the ejaculate or spontaneous pregnancy.

Results

A total of 233 patients were analyzed. After varicocele repair 91 (39.1%) patients had motile sperm in the ejaculate and 14 spontaneous pregnancies were reported. Success rates in patients with maturation arrest (42.1%) or hypospermatogenesis (54.5%) were significantly higher than in those with Sertoli-cell-only (11.3%, p < 0.001 in both groups). Patients with late maturation arrest had a higher probability of success (45.8%) than those with early maturation arrest (0%, p = 0.007).

Conclusions

Infertile men with nonobstructive azoospermia can have improvement in semen analysis and achieve spontaneous pregnancy after repair of clinical varicoceles. This meta-analysis demonstrates that men with late maturation arrest and hypospermatogenesis have a higher probability of success and, therefore, histopathology should be considered before varicocele repair in men with nonobstructive azoospermia.

### Varicocele and male infertility [^116RDrQo]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2017). Medium credibility.

The link between varicoceles and male infertility has been a matter of debate for more than half a century. Varicocele is considered the most common correctable cause of male infertility, but some men with varicoceles are able to father children, even without intervention. In addition, improvements in semen quality after varicocelectomy do not always result in spontaneous pregnancy. Studies regarding possible pathophysiological mechanisms behind varicocele-induced infertility have tried to address these controversies. Oxidative stress seems to be a central mechanism; however, no single theory is able to explain the differential effect of varicoceles on infertility. As a consequence, careful patient selection for treatment based on couple fertility status, varicocele grade, and semen quality is critical for achieving a chance of a subsequent pregnancy. A substantial amount of data on the effects of varicocelectomy has been gathered, but inadequate study design and considerable heterogeneity of available studies mean that these data are rarely conclusive. Current evidence suggests a beneficial effect of varicocelectomy on semen quality and pregnancy outcomes in couples with documented infertility only if the male partner has a clinically palpable varicocele and affected semen parameters.

### There is more than meets the eye with varicoceles: current and emerging concepts in pathophysiology, management, and study design [^112TosTV]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Varicoceles are known to be associated with male infertility, but the mechanism of infertility and the true effect of varicocele repair remain controversial due to a lack of proper studies and the difficulty of performing proper studies. Other than infertility treatment, varicocele repairs also may performed for a variety of reasons, including testicular pain, hypogonadism, and in adolescents who are not yet trying to conceive.

### Evaluation and management of the adolescent varicocele [^113tq5Nc]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Varicocele is one of the most common genital conditions referred to pediatric urologists. Most adolescents with varicocele are asymptomatic and their fertility future (and surgery benefit) is largely unknown. This review assesses varicocele evaluation, management and indications for repair, as well as types and success of varicocelectomy.

Materials and Methods

A systematic literature review was performed on Embase™, PubMed® and Google Scholar™ for adolescent varicocele. Original research articles and relevant reviews were examined, and a synopsis of these data was generated for a comprehensive review of clinical adolescent varicocele management.

Results

The prevalence of adolescent varicocele is similar to the adult population. While ultrasound is the most sensitive method for determining testicular volumes, orchidometer measurement may be adequate to gauge significant discordance. Significant hypotrophy of the affected testis with poor total testicular volume may indicate a testis at risk and warrant surgical repair. Similar findings have been noted with an associated high peak retrograde venous flow. Testicular hypotrophy often resolves following surgery but may also improve spontaneously if followed through adolescence. Continued scrotal pain despite adequate support or serial abnormal semen analysis in Tanner stage V boys is an indication for varicocelectomy. Artery and lymphatic sparing techniques (microscopic subinguinal or laparoscopic) are associated with the lowest risk of recurrence and complications.

Conclusions

Overtreatment and under treatment are medically and financially costly. Abnormal serial semen analysis with or without testicular hypotrophy is an indication for varicocele repair. If observation remains the treatment, followup with an adult urologist should be encouraged until paternity is achieved.

### Supernumerary minute ring chromosome 14 in a man with primary infertility and left varicocele [^1127iPAy]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case of supernumerary minute ring chromosome (SMRC) in an infertile man, with the concurrent finding of a left varicocele.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Urologic infertility clinic in a university hospital.

Patient(S)

Male patient presenting with primary infertility.

Intervention(S)

Karyotyping, genetic counseling, and microsurgical left varicocelectomy.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Sperm concentration and motility, chromosomal number and structure.

Result(S)

Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealing SMRC 14. Sperm concentration and motility improved after left varicocele repair.

Conclusion(S)

A karyotype should be included in the evaluation of severe oligospermia. Although SMRC 14 may be associated with fertility problems, repair of a coexisting varicocele should be considered in these patients.

### Nomogram for predicting spontaneous pregnancy after microscopic varicocelectomy in infertile men with normal hormone [^114BYsc6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The exact association between varicocele and reduced male fertility is unknown. Several hypotheses attempted to provide an explanation, such as hypoxia and hemostasis, increased scrotal temperature, autoimmunity, adrenal metabolite reflux, and increased oxidative stress. However, it remains unclear why a minimum of one-third infertile men do not report improvement in semen parameters, and more than half of them do not experience fertility recovery post varicocelectomy, and which patients can benefit from varicocelectomy. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for predicting SP post MSV in infertile men with abnormal semen parameters, based on a large cohort. Our findings suggest that younger female partners, larger diameter of veins, higher initial TPMSC, and increased TPMSC were significant predictors of SP in infertile men post MSV.

TPMSC was a combined indicator calculated from total sperm count × ratio progressively motile. This study found that baseline TPMSC positively correlated with SP post MSV. The baseline TPMSC was significantly higher in patients who reported SP than in those who did not recover from infertility (13.48 million vs. 9.32 million, p < 0.001). These findings were supported by Wang et al. who conducted a meta-systemic study of nine studies, which showed that the SP rate was higher in patients who presented a higher baseline TMSC post varicocelectomy. SP rate was the highest (55.4%) in the TMSC > 20 million group, and lowest in the TMSC < 1.5 million group (16.0%). Another critical predictor for fertility recovery is the increase of TPMSC post MSV. Shomarufov et al. who conducted a retrospective study on 93 infertile men with varicocele and pathozoospermia who underwent MSV, also identified that postoperative increase in TPMSC were predictors of SP post surgery. Furthermore, they found that 50% of the treated patients had an increase in TPMSC by 12.5 million. However 81% of patients who reported pregnancy achieved the same result. Therefore, the combined indicator of TPMSC should be used when assessing the predicted SP of planned varicocelectomies.

### Youth varicocele and varicocele treatment: a meta-analysis of semen outcomes [^115SxJXc]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To study youth who have a varicocele or are undergoing varicocele treatment, in relation to changes in semen, as measured by semen analysis (SA).

Design

Meta-analysis of studies identified via a search of PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane Library covering the last 40 years.

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

Youth from studies that assessed the presence and/or treatment of varicocele with SA.

Intervention(S)

Selected studies were analyzed in two separate meta-analyses: one for the effect of varicocele on semen, as measured by SA (hypothesis #1), the other for the effect of treatment on semen, as measured by SA (hypothesis #2).

Main Outcome Measure(S)

A random-effects model was used to calculate weighted mean difference (WMD) of semen outcomes. Heterogeneity was calculated. Bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger's test.

Result(S)

The initial literature search returned 1,180 potentially relevant articles. For hypothesis #1, 10 studies with a total of 357 varicocele and 427 control subjects were included. Sperm density, motility, and morphology were significantly decreased when associated with a varicocele, with a WMD of -24.0×10(6)/mL (95% confidence interval [CI; -39.5 to -8.6]), -7.5% (95% CI [-12.3% to -2.7%]), and -1.7% (95% CI [-2.4% to -1.1%]), respectively. Another 10 studies with 379 treated and 270 untreated subjects were analyzed for hypothesis #2. Sperm density and motility were significantly improved following treatment, with a WMD of 14.6×10(6)/mL (95% CI [7.1–22.1]) and 6.6% (95% CI [2.1%-11.2%]), respectively.

Conclusion(S)

The presence of varicocele in youth appears to negatively affect sperm density, motility, and morphology. Treatment appears to result in moderate improvement of sperm density and mild improvement in sperm motility.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part II [^116y33zg]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

AUA/ASRM male infertility — clinical varicocele repair outcomes report calculated pregnancy rates by surgical approach and caution for nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). Pregnancy rates without treatment were assumed to be 17%, while rates were calculated to be 42% (95% CI 26% to 61%) with subinguinal microsurgical varicocelectomy, 35% (95% CI 21% to 50%) with inguinal microvaricocelectomy, 37% (95% CI 22% to 58%) with inguinal open (non-microsurgical) surgery, and 37% (95% CI 19% to 61%) with laparoscopic surgery; a systematic review for subclinical varicocele reported no demonstrable benefit. In NOA, return of adequate motile sperm to the ejaculate sufficient to avoid surgical sperm retrieval only occurred in 9.6% after clinical varicocele repair, and extended sperm search found up to 35% of men thought to be azoospermic had at least rare sperm detectable; since studies lacked a control group, there are no high-quality data to support repair of varicoceles in men with NOA, and varicocele repair defers treatment with ART for at least six months.

### Medical and surgical management male infertility [^112w5URY]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Male infertility is the result of a variety of highly treatable conditions. The critical step in treating male infertility is to evaluate properly every male partner of an infertile couple and to generate the proper treatment strategy. There are many medical and surgical options that can help most couples overcome male factor infertility. Male infertility can most easily be broken down into problems of sperm production (testicular dysfunction) and problems of sperm transport (obstruction). When applicable, medical therapies are used as an initial strategy to improve sperm production or as a preliminary therapy to boost production transiently in anticipation of a surgical sperm retrieval attempt. A range of surgical options is available to correct varicoceles, reconstruct the obstructed system, or retrieve sperm for assisted reproduction.

### Nomogram for predicting spontaneous pregnancy after microscopic varicocelectomy in infertile men with normal hormone [^115DD5Jy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Varicocele is characterized by abnormal dilatation of testicular veins in the pampiniformis plexus form and is caused by impaired venous drainage. It can progressively affect male fertility, testicular growth, and lead to symptoms of scrotal pain and discomfort, even hypogonadism. Varicocele is present in 15% of men with normal semen quality, 25% with abnormal semen quality, and 35–40% of infertile men.

Varicocelectomy is the most frequently performed procedure. Recent RCTs and meta-analyses revealed that varicocelectomy could improve semen parameters, spontaneous pregnancy (SP) rates, and the results of assisted reproductive technologies. Several techniques were used, including microscopic, laparoscopic and open surgery, and interventional embolization. The ideal varicocele treatment strategy should combine excellent efficacy and safety with minimally invasive techniques. Therefore, microscopic varicocelectomy (MSV) has gradually become the preferred surgical option due to its advantages which include meticulous ligation of the veins while sparing the arterial branches, lower postoperative recurrence rate, fewer complications, higher postoperative semen quality and postoperative fertility rate. MSV can be performed using either the inguinal or the subinguinal approach; both are effective methods for repairing varicocele in infertile men. Subsequent to improving semen parameters, SP is considered the best indicator of a successful varicocelectomy. However, varicocelectomy improves semen parameters in 60–70% of patients only and fertility in 40–60%. The current challenge is determining which patients could benefit most from surgery.

### Bilateral spermatic cord en bloc ligation by laparoendoscopic single-site surgery: preliminary experience compared to conventional laparoscopy [^113B9dY5]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Varicocele is considered one of the most important causes of male infertility and prepubertal testicular hypotrophy. The most common indications for varicocelectomy are subfertility and chronic orchialgia. Many clinical trials report a beneficial effect of varicocele repair on male reproduction with improvement in semen parameters, but some show the contrary.

The ideal method of varicocele treatment is a controversial issue. Several methods have been used, including open surgical ligation of the spermatic vein, retrograde or antegrade sclerotherapy, and laparoscopic and microsurgical varicocelectomy. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages, and conflicting results have been achieved in different studies.

The role of laparoscopic varicocelectomy is still controversial. According to our experience, the laparoscopic approach should be considered mostly in patients requiring bilateral varicocelectomy, since it appears to be a sensible alternative to 2 groin incisions. Also laparoscopic approach has short operative time and offers an easier postoperative course.

LESS has been developed in an attempt to further reduce the multiple ports morbidities and scarring associated with laparoscopic surgery. In many studies, LESS varicocelectomy was reported to have acceptable feasibility, high patient satisfaction, and good postoperative outcomes. Our study is in correspondence with these previous studies. It demonstrates that bilateral LESS varicocele ligation provides the best results comparison with those of the conventional laparoscopic technique.

The mean operative time was shorter in LESS group than in conventional laparoscopic group (45.4 minutes vs 88.3 minutes). The longer operative time in conventional laparoscopy group may be related to multiple numbers of access and performance of selective varicocelectomy in 5 of these patients. Dong Hyuk Kang et al. compared postoperative outcomes in patients treated with selective and non-selective LESS varicocele ligation. Mean operative time in non-selective group was similar to ours (48.6 minutes) while the mean operative time of selective group is shorter than that we found in conventional laparoscopy (60.7 minutes). This finding clarifies that the longer operative time in conventional laparoscopy may be related principally to multiple numbers of access.

### Varicocele repair ineffective in restoring fertility… [^114Eyvu3]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Does repairing varicoceles restore fertility. Setting: Various Study Design: Systematic review Synopsis: These authors conducted an exhaustive search of the literature — MEDLINE, registry of controlled trials, meeting programs, hand searches of surgical journals, etc. — looking for randomized controlled studies of varicocele repair in subfertile couples. The authors independently screened potential articles and had planned to resolve discrepancies by consensus, but report that none occurred. The authors do not state whether the data were extracted independently. Seven studies ultimately were included. The interventions were primarily surgical ligation, but one study used radiologic embolization. Generally, the methods of the included trials were poor.

Markers that traditionally bias the data in favor of the intervention group were common; these included poor description of randomization process, lack of intention-to-treat analysis, and lack of blinding. Nonetheless, the data are intriguing. Among 281 treated couples, 61 women became pregnant, while 50 of 259 women in the control couples became pregnant. For this to be a meaningful difference, the studies would have needed more than 3, 000 couples in each group. The combined studies had enough power to detect at least a 10 percent absolute difference in the proportion of pregnancies. Bottom Line: Even using studies that appear biased in favor of the intervention groups, this systematic review suggests that repairing varicoceles in subfertile couples is ineffective for restoring fertility.

### Surgery or embolisation for varicocele in subfertile men [^116x9ckb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

A varicocele is a meshwork of distended blood vessels in the scrotum, usually left-sided, due to dilatation of the spermatic vein. Although the concept that varicocele causes, and varicocelectomy cures, male subfertility has been around for almost fifty years, the mechanisms by which varicocele would affect fertility have not yet been satisfactorily explained, and neither have the mechanisms by which varicocelectomy would restore fertility. Furthermore, it has been questioned whether a causal relation exists at all between the distension of the pampiniform plexus and impairment of fertility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of varicocele treatment on pregnancy rate in subfertile couples.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched 12 Sept 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2004), EMBASE (January 1985 to May 2004) and reference lists of articles. In addition, we hand searched 22 specialist journals in the field from their first issue until 2004. We also checked cross references, references from review articles, and contacted researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

RCTs were included if they were relevant to the clinical question posed, if they reported pregnancy rates as an outcome measure, and if they reported data in treated (surgical ligation or radiological embolization of the internal spermatic vein) and untreated groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

Nine studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. One was an extension of a previously published study (Nieschlag 1995/1998), which left eight studies for analysis (Nilsson 1979; Breznik 1993; Madgar 1995; Yamamoto 1996; Nieschlag 1995/1998; Grasso 2000; Unal 2001; Krause 2002). All eight only included men from couples with subfertility problems, one (Madgar 1995) excluded men with sperm counts < 5 mill/mL, one (Krause 2002) men with sperm counts < 2 mill/mL and/or progressive motility < 10%, two trials involving clinical varicoceles included some men with normal semen analysis (Nilsson 1979; Breznik 1993). Three studies (Yamamoto 1996; Grasso 2000; Unal 2001) specifically addressed only men with subclinical varicoceles. Two authors independently screened potentially relevant trials. Any differences of opinion were resolved by consensus (none occurred for this review). Studies were excluded from meta-analysis if they made comparisons other than those specified above.

Main Results

The combined Peto odds ratio (OR) of the eight studies is 1.10 (95%CI 0.73 to 1.68), indicating no benefit of varicocele treatment over expectant management in subfertility couples in whom varicocele in the man is the only abnormal finding.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is no evidence that treatment of varicocele in men from couples with otherwise unexplained subfertility improves the couple's chance of conception.

### Varicocele and infertility… [^117CeE8m]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Varicocele, even when it is found on one side, may be a causative factor in infertility. When indicated, varicocelectomy results in improvement of semen quality in about 60% of the men so treated. However, the presence of a varicocele is not an incontrovertible indication for an operation. Other causes may be more directly related, the varicocele having developed as a coincidence. Detailed investigation is therefore indicated before varicocelectomy is advised. The pathogenesis of subfertility associated with varicocele has not yet been clarified. When the patient is erect, incompetence of the valves of the left spermatic vein results in reflux of blood toward the testis. This has been demonstrated by cineradiography with selective catheterization of the left renal and spermatic veins. An attempt to relate the depressed spermatogenesis to increased adrenal steroid concentration has not proved successful. Charny CW, Baum S. Varicocele and Infertility.

### Nomogram for predicting spontaneous pregnancy after microscopic varicocelectomy in infertile men with normal hormone [^113sWvzR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The current challenge for the treatment of varicocele is identifying patients who could benefit the most from surgery. We aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for predicting spontaneous pregnancy following microscopic varicocelectomy in infertile men, based on a large cohort.

Methods

Two hundred eighty-two consecutive patients who underwent microscopic varicocelectomy from January 2018 to December 2020 were enrolled as participants in the study. Xiang Hua center (206 patients) as a development cohort. Hu Nan center (76 patients) as a validation cohort. Patient clinicopathologic data were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression was used to build a predictive model with regression coefficients. Then, backward stepwise selection was applied, and the likelihood ratio test with Akaike's information criterion was used as the stopping rule. The performance of this predictive model was assessed for discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness.

Results

Predictors of this model included the age of female partners, diameter of veins, initial and increased total progressively motile sperm count. The model demonstrated good discrimination with an AUROC of 0.925 (p < 0.001) and calibration (Unreliability test, p = 0.522) in the validation cohort. Furthermore, the model was clinically useful, according to decision curve analysis.

Conclusions

Our findings indicated that younger female partners, larger diameter of veins, higher initial and increased total progressively motile sperm count were significant predictors of spontaneous pregnancy in infertile men, post microscopic varicocelectomy. This nomogram may assist in individual decision-making on the treatment strategy of varicocele preoperatively and improve the treatment outcome.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (12 Sept 2003 and October 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004 and Issue 4, 2007), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2007), EMBASE (January 1985 to October 2007) and reference lists of articles. In addition, we handsearched specialist journals in the field from their first issue until 2007. We also checked cross-references, references from review articles and contacted researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they were relevant to the clinical question posed, if they reported pregnancy rates as an outcome measure, and if they reported data in treated (surgical ligation or radiological embolisation of the internal spermatic vein) and untreated groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

Nine studies met the inclusion criteria for the original review. One was an extension of a previously published study, which left eight studies for analysis. All eight only included men from couples with subfertility problems; one excluded men with sperm counts less than 5 million per mL and one men with sperm counts less than 2 million per mL, with or without progressive motility of less than 10%. Two trials involving clinical varicoceles included some men with normal semen analysis. Three studies specifically addressed only men with subclinical varicoceles.

### A fifteen-year retrospective analysis of varicocele embolization: evaluating success, recurrence rates and embolic agents [^116epF1G]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study also highlighted the success of embolization in patients with prior failed surgical interventions. All seven patients with previous unsuccessful surgeries (including one patient who had undergone two attempted surgical repairs) were successfully treated by IR without recurrence. This finding is particularly important as it underscores the value of embolization as a salvage therapy for patients who have failed conventional surgical treatments.

Fertility outcomes are a critical consideration in varicocele treatment, particularly given the association between varicoceles and male infertility. Of the 37 patients in whom fertility was the primary concern, 51.35% achieved successful fertility (live birth) post-procedure. Nabi et al. previously demonstrated successful fertility rates of 40%; however, the follow-up in this study was only 3.6 years. In our study, 6.9% of patients continued to have fertility issues. Improvement in semen parameters following varicocele embolization is well documented. A Cochrane review published in 2004 indicated that the number needed to treat (NNT) for varicocele repair to improve fertility outcomes is 7. Our study demonstrated higher successful fertility rates than previous studies; however, this may be affected by our longer follow up period.

In conclusion, our data confirms that varicocele embolization is a highly effective and durable treatment option with a low complication rate, even in patients who have undergone prior failed surgical intervention. The high success rate in improving fertility in sub-fertile men also reinforces embolization as a valuable intervention in this patient population. The choice of embolic material did not significantly influence any assessed outcomes, suggesting no added benefit from adding a sclerosing agent to coil embolization.

### Adolescent varicoceles and infertility [^114uutpA]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Varicoceles are associated with testicular atrophy and abnormal spermatogenesis. Varicocele-related testicular damage is thought to be progressive in nature. Adult varicoceles are common in men with infertility, and varicocele repair in this population has demonstrated improved semen parameters and paternity outcomes. However, without solid objective endpoints (reproducible semen analyses, paternity), the indications for adolescent varicocele repair remain controversial. Given the controversy surrounding adolescent varicocele management, it is not surprising that surveys of pediatric urologists have revealed a lack of consensus on diagnostic approaches, treatment decisions, and operative approaches.

### Assessment of efficacy of varicocele repair for male subfertility: a systematic review [^114RS7Le]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Varicocele repair is a widely used treatment for subfertility. Our aim was to identify and combine the results from randomised controlled trials published to ascertain whether the pregnancy rates after varicocele repair are higher than those with no treatment.

Methods

We did a systematic review of seven studies identified by searching Medline and a register of controlled trials. We also searched the contents of specialist journals and the annual meeting programmes of relevant societies by hand. Inclusion criteria were treatment of varicocele in subfertile couples, random allocation to treatment and control groups, and pregnancy or livebirth rates as an outcome measure. We pooled data by use of fixed and random effects models.

Findings

None of seven eligible studies published between 1979 and 2002 described a strategy for concealment of the allocation sequence. There were 61 pregnancies among 281 treated couples and 50 pregnancies among 259 controls. The overall relative benefit of treatment was 1.01 (95% CI 0.73–1.40) by the fixed effects model and 1.04 (0.62–1.75) by the random effects model. The overall risk difference was 0.2% (-7 to 7) and 3% (-7 to 14), respectively. In subgroup analyses, varicocele treatment was not effective in trials restricted to male subfertility with clinical varicocele, or in those that included men with subclinical varicocele or normal semen analysis. However, this systematic review, done with a meta-analytical method, might have had insufficient power to detect small effects because of the small number of patients in some subgroups.

Interpretation

Varicocele repair does not seem to be an effective treatment for male or unexplained subfertility.

### Surgery or embolization for varicoceles in subfertile men [^114jP5qe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A varicocele is a meshwork of distended blood vessels in the scrotum, usually left-sided, due to dilatation of the spermatic vein. Although the concept that a varicocele causes male subfertility has been around for more than 50 years now, the mechanisms by which a varicocele would affect fertility have not yet been satisfactorily explained. Neither is there sufficient evidence to explain the mechanisms by which varicocelectomy would restore fertility. Furthermore, it has been questioned whether a causal relation exists at all between the distension of the pampiniform plexus (a network of many small veins found in the human male spermatic cord) and impairment of fertility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of varicocele treatment on live birth and pregnancy rate in subfertile couples where the male has a varicocele.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (12 September 2003 to January 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2012), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2012), EMBASE (January 1985 to January 2012), PsycINFO (to Week 1 2012) and reference lists of articles. In addition, we handsearched specialist journals in the field from their first issue until 2012. We also checked cross-references, references from review articles and contacted researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they were relevant to the clinical question posed. If they reported pregnancy rates or live birth rates as an outcome measure, and if they reported data in treated (surgical ligation or radiological embolization of the internal spermatic vein) compared to untreated or placebo groups. Two authors independently screened potentially relevant trials. Any differences of opinion were resolved by consensus (none occurred for this review).

Data Collection and Analysis

Ten studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. For one study we had only data from a published abstract. All ten studies only included men from couples with subfertility problems; one excluded men with sperm counts less than 5 million per mL and one excluded men with sperm counts less than 2 million per mL, with or without progressive motility of less than 10%. Two trials involving clinical varicoceles included some men with normal semen analysis. Three studies specifically addressed only men with subclinical varicoceles. Studies were excluded from meta-analysis if they made comparisons other than those specified above.

Main Results

The meta-analysis included 894 men. No studies reported live birth. The combined fixed-effect odds ratio (OR) of the 10 studies for the outcome of pregnancy was 1.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 2.05, very low quality evidence), favouring the intervention. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome was 17, suggesting benefit of varicocele treatment over expectant management for pregnancy rate in subfertile couples in whom varicocele in the man was the only abnormal finding. Omission of the studies including men with normal semen analysis and subclinical varicocele, some of which had semen analysis improvement as the primary outcome rather than live birth or pregnancy rate, was the subject of a planned subgroup analysis. The outcome of the subgroup analysis (five studies) also favoured treatment, with a combined OR 2.39 (95% CI 1.56 to 3.66). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome was 7. The evidence was suggestive rather than conclusive, as the main analysis was subject to fairly high statistical heterogeneity (I(2) = 67%) and findings were no longer significant when a random-effects model was used or when analysis was restricted to higher quality studies.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence suggesting that treatment of a varicocele in men from couples with otherwise unexplained subfertility may improve a couple's chance of pregnancy. However, findings are inconclusive as the quality of the available evidence is very low and more research is needed with live birth or pregnancy rate as the primary outcome.

### Varicocelectomy to "upgrade" semen quality to allow couples to use less invasive forms of assisted reproductive technology [^111uVTTy]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the magnitude of improvement in semen parameters after a varicocelectomy and the fraction that have improvements such that couples needing IVF or IUI are "upgraded" to needing less invasive assisted reproductive technology (ART).

Design

Retrospective review of prospectively collected data.

Setting

Academic medical centers.

Patient(S)

Men presenting for a fertility evaluation with a clinical varicocele.

Intervention(S)

Varicocele repair (surgical or embolization).

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Total motile sperm count (TMSC) before and after repair, and the proportion of men considered candidates for: natural pregnancy (NP) > 9 million, IUI 5–9 million, or IVF < 5 million.

Result(S)

A total of 373 men underwent varicocele repair. The TMSC increased from 18.22 ± 38.32 to 46.72 ± 210.92 (P = 0.007). The most pronounced increase was with baseline TMSC < 5 million, from 2.32 ± 1.50 to 15.97 ± 32.92 (P = 0.0000002); 58.8% of men were upgraded from IVF candidacy to IUI or NP. For baseline TMSC 5–9 million, the mean TMSC increased from 6.96 ± 1.16 to 24.29 ± 37.17 (P = 0.0004), allowing 64.9% of men to become candidates for NP. For baseline TMSC of > 9 million, TMSC increased from 36.26 ± 52.08 to 81.80 ± 310.83 (P = 0.05).

Conclusion(S)

Varicocele repair has an important role in the treatment of infertility. Even for low TMSCs, a varicocelectomy may reduce the need for IVF. Varicocele repair (by embolization or microsurgery) potentially reduces the need for IVF and IUI.

The varicocele is the most common cause of male infertility world wide. Varicoceles have been found in 15% of the normal male population and in up to 40% of patients with male infertility. In approximately 70% of patients with secondary infertility, a varicocele is an underlying cause. Understanding of the pathophysiology, treatments, and outcomes of a varicocele and varicocele repair has evolved significantly over the past several decades. Our goal is to discuss the approach to its diagnosis and treatment that has evolved.

### The adolescent varicocele: to treat or not to treat [^111R1xhR]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Whether to treat adolescents with varicocele is controversial because over 80% of adult varicoceles are not associated with infertility. Most physicians agree that treating all adolescents with varicocele and subjecting boys to unnecessary surgery is inappropriate, costly, and not without ethical considerations. Waiting until patients present as adults with potentially irreversible infertility, however, is equally unacceptable. Pediatricians and urologists must determine which adolescents are at greatest risk for future fertility problems and warrant early intervention. This article reviews the current literature surrounding adolescent varicocele and offers recommendations for identifying individuals who would most benefit from treatment.

### The effect of body mass index on the outcomes of varicocelectomy [^116jJfuM]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Obesity is recognized as a potential contributor to male factor infertility. There are no studies to date to our knowledge that have examined the success of varicocelectomy in obese men. We determined if body mass index significantly affects the outcome of varicocelectomy.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective chart review was performed for all patients who underwent varicocelectomy from September 2003 to December 2009. Patients were placed into 3 groups based on body mass index, and categorized as normal weight (group 1–38 patients, body mass index 18.5 to 24.9), overweight (group 2–59 patients, body mass index 25 to 29.9) or obese (group 3–46 patients, body mass index 30 or greater). Significant improvement was defined as a greater than 50% increase in the total motile per ejaculate parameter on postoperative semen analysis.

Results

A total of 143 patients were available for analysis. There were no significant differences among patients in the 3 groups except for body mass index. Significant improvement in total motile/ejaculate on semen analyses was 71.1% (group 1), 61.0% (group 2) and 58.7% (group 3). Pregnancy rates were 43.8% (group 1), 43.5% (group 2) and 46.3% (group 3). There were no significant differences in improvement in total motile per ejaculate (p = 0.21, p = 0.17) or pregnancy rate (p = 0.60, p = 0.51) between the normal body mass index group, and the overweight and obese groups.

Conclusions

Varicocelectomy for men with clinically palpable varicoceles has a significant chance of improving semen parameters and pregnancy rates regardless of preoperative body mass index. The outcomes of varicocelectomy in overweight and obese patients were similar to those of normal weight men. Therefore, varicocelectomy can be performed effectively and safely in overweight and obese men.

This scoring system was developed to adjust and quantify for various potential sources of bias, including selection bias, follow-up bias, confounding bias, information or detection bias, and other types of bias, such as misclassification. Of 136 studies identified through the electronic and hand search of references, only 17 studies met our inclusion criteria. The study population was infertile men with clinically palpable unilateral or bilateral varicocele and at least one abnormal semen parameter who had undergone surgical varicocelectomy (high ligation or inguinal microsurgery). Only those studies that had at least three semen analyses (ie, sperm count, motility, and morphology) per patient, before and after surgical varicocelectomy, were included.

Results

The combined analysis demonstrated that the sperm concentration increased by 9.71 x 10(6)/mL (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.34 to 12.08, P < 0.00001) and motility increased by 9.92% (95% CI 4.90 to 14.95, P = 0.0001) after microsurgical varicocelectomy. Similarly, the sperm concentration increased by 12.03 x 10(6)/mL (95% CI 5.71 to 18.35, P = 0.0002) and motility increased by 11.72% (95% CI 4.33 to 19.12, P = 0.002) after high ligation varicocelectomy. The improvement in World Health Organization sperm morphology was 3.16% (95% CI 0.72 to 5.60, P = 0.01) after both microsurgery and high ligation varicocelectomy.

Conclusions

Surgical varicocelectomy significantly improves semen parameters in infertile men with palpable varicocele and abnormal semen parameters.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline PART II [^116CEsgX]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for male infertility, more specifically with respect to patients with varicocele, ASRM/AUA 2021 guidelines recommend to inform couples about the absence of definitive evidence supporting varicocele repair in patients with clinical varicocele and non-obstructive azoospermia before ART.

### The role of varicocele repair in nonobstructive azoospermia must be evaluated with controlled trials rather than observational studies [^112a9Lhc]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Certainly, varicoceles can have a substantive effect on sperm production in infertile males. In addition, varicocele repair may optimize sperm production. However, additional studies and evaluation of the role of varicocele repair in men with this condition (nonobstructive azoospermia) are warranted.

### Fate of recurrent or persistent varicocele in the era of assisted reproduction technology: microsurgical subinguinal redo varicocelectomy versus observation [^112pD1Xx]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare sperm parameters, serum hormone levels, and pregnancy and miscarriage rates between the infertile men with recurrent or persistent varicocele who underwent microsurgical subinguinal redo varicocelectomy or had observation only.

Materials and Methods

The study included 217 primary infertile men with recurrent or persistent varicocele. The patients were divided into 2 groups: 120 men underwent microsurgical subinguinal redo varicocelectomy, and 97 had observation only. Differences in total motile sperm count and serum hormone levels, and pregnancy and miscarriage rates were compared between the 2 groups.

Results

The mean total motile sperm count increased from 20.93 ± 2.87 to 45.54 ± 6.28 million in the microsurgical redo varicocelectomy group, and decreased from 16.62 ± 2.75 to 15.6 ± 2.81 million in the control group, revealing significant difference between the 2 groups (P = 0.000). Increase in total testosterone level was significantly higher in the microsurgical redo varicocelectomy group (+1.36 ± 0.32ng/mL) than in the control group (-0.23 ± 0.1ng/mL) (P = 0.000). Of the couples, 63 achieved pregnancy in the microsurgical redo varicocelectomy group (52.5%), and 38 had pregnancy in the control group (39.2%) (P < .05). Spontaneous pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the microsurgical redo varicocelectomy group (39.7%) than in the control group (15.8%) (P < .01). Use of assisted reproductive technology to achieve pregnancy was significantly lower in the microsurgical redo varicocelectomy group (60.3%) than in the control group (84.2%) (P < .01).

Conclusion

Microsurgical subinguinal redo varicocele repair improves postoperative sperm parameters, serum total testosterone level, and spontaneous pregnancy rates compared with the controls. It also decreases need for use and level of assisted reproductive technology.

### The great debate: varicocele treatment and impact on fertility [^111Sy4y2]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the current literature on the impact and potential mechanisms of varicocele repair on male fertility.

Design

Pertinent articles were identified through computer PubMed search on varicocele repair and male factor infertility. References of selected articles were hand searched for additional citations.

Conclusion(S)

Varicocele repair has been shown to reverse a spectrum of effects contributing to men with impaired fertility. Clinical studies on the intervention have illustrated variable effects on postoperative sperm parameters and pregnancy rates (PR). Studies with conflicting results suffer from a significant number of confounding variables such as variable repair technique or lack of controls. Additional studies are warranted on the role of modern microsurgical varicocelectomy given the improvements in assisted reproductive technologies (ART).

### Effect of varicocelectomy on sperm deoxyribonucleic acid fragmentation rates in infertile men with clinical varicocele: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Pz32W]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of varicocelectomy on sperm deoxyribonucleic acid fragmentation (SDF) rates in infertile men with clinical varicocele.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

Infertile men with clinical varicocele subjected to varicocelectomy.

Intervention(S)

Systematic search using PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane's central database, Scielo, and Google Scholar to identify relevant studies published from inception until January 2021. We included studies comparing SDF rates before and after varicocelectomy in infertile men with clinical varicocele.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The primary outcome was the difference between the SDF rates before and after varicocelectomy. A meta-analysis of weighted data using random-effects models was performed. Results were reported as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses were performed on the basis of the SDF assay, varicocelectomy technique, preoperative SDF levels, varicocele grade, follow-up time, and study design.

Result(S)

Nineteen studies involving 1,070 patients provided SDF data. Varicocelectomy was associated with reduced postoperative SDF rates (WMD -7.23%; 95% CI: -8.86 to -5.59; I² = 91%). The treatment effect size was moderate (Cohen's d = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.77 to 0.60). The pooled results were consistent for studies using sperm chromatin structure assay, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling, sperm chromatin dispersion test, and microsurgical varicocele repair. Subgroup analyses showed that the treatment effect was more pronounced in men with elevated vs. normal preoperative SDF levels, but the impact of varicocele grade remained equivocal. Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that SDF decreased after varicocelectomy as a function of preoperative SDF levels (coefficient: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.39).

Conclusion(S)

We concluded that pooled results from studies including infertile men with clinical varicocele indicated that varicocelectomy reduced the SDF rates. The treatment effect was greater in men with elevated (vs. normal) preoperative SDF levels. Further research is required to determine the full clinical implications of SDF reduction for these men.

### Sperm chromatin condensation in infertile men with varicocele before and after surgical repair [^112PW8UK]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess sperm chromatin integrity in infertile men with varicocele before and after surgical repair.

Design

Prospective.

Setting

Academic setting.

Patient(S)

Seventy-two infertile men with varicocele compared with 20 healthy fertile men.

Intervention(S)

History taking, genital examination, semen analysis, sperm chromatin condensation assessment by aniline blue stain before and 3 months after varicocelectomy.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Stained sperm heads (abnormal chromatin condensation) before and 3 months after varicocelectomy.

Result(S)

The mean percentage of aniline blue-stained sperm heads was significantly higher in infertile men with varicocele compared with fertile controls. The mean percentage of stained sperm heads was significantly decreased in infertile men with varicocele 3 months after surgery compared with the preoperative data. There was a significant negative correlation between percentage of stained sperm heads and normal morphology where nonsignificant correlation was elicited regarding sperm count and sperm motility.

Conclusion(S)

There is a significant increase of abnormal sperm chromatin condensation in infertile men with varicocele that is markedly improved after varicocelectomy.

### Are varicoceles the holy grail of andrology? [^116xPMFG]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Varicoceles are a common condition affecting up to 15% of men in the general population, and up to 40% of men with infertility. A varicocele is an abnormal dilation of the veins within the scrotum, which can lead to reduced sperm production and testicular damage, resulting in infertility. Despite the prevalence of varicoceles, much remains to be discovered about their diagnosis, treatment, and long-term impact. Varicoceles are considered the 'holy grail' of Andrology because they represent a complex, multifactorial condition that requires a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and treatment. While surgical repair of varicoceles has been shown to improve fertility outcomes in some cases, there is still debate about the best approach to diagnosis and treatment, and long-term outcomes are not well understood. Advances in diagnostic imaging, such as color Doppler ultrasound, have improved our ability to identify varicoceles, but more research is needed to fully understand the impact of this condition on male fertility and overall health. As such, varicoceles represent an ongoing area of investigation in Andrology with much progress to be made in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and long-term impact.

### Varicocele repair for infertility: what is the evidence? [^113pALrP]. Current Opinion in Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Considering the persistent controversy concerning the impact of varicocele repair on fertility, we decided to perform an update of the review of the literature with the aim to evaluate whether the most recent research in this field gives us more evidence about the indications to treat or not to treat varicocele in dyspermic or infertile men.

Recent Findings

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective studies evaluating semen parameters before and after varicocelectomy clearly demonstrate that varicocele repair is associated with a significant improvement of sperm concentration, motility and normal morphology. Moreover, some recent studies highlighted the potential role of varicocelectomy in reduction of seminal oxidative stress and sperm DNA damage. One recent RCT showed a statistically significant advantage in favor of varicocelectomy in comparison with observations in terms of spontaneous pregnancy rate. Meta-analysis including this study confirmed the heterogeneity of pooled studies and showed a significant trend in favor of varicocele repair. This trend has become statistically significant when an 'as-treated' analysis is performed (odds ratio 2.69, 95% confidence interval 1.16–6.24). The advantages in favor of varicocele treatment were also observed in a recent RCT analyzing couples with first-term recurrent miscarriage.

Conclusion

Varicocele repair must be proposed in young adult men with impairment of seminal parameters and not yet interested in pregnancy. Men of infertile couples should be adequately counselled concerning the high possibility of attaining a significant improvement in seminal parameters after varicocele repair. This condition can be associated with a spontaneous pregnancy rate of 30%. The main alternative remains the use of artificial reproductive techniques.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part II [^111QMFrT]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Summary of male infertility management principles: "Evaluation and management of men in a couple with infertility involves a step-wise process of evaluation and consultation regarding treatment options". Effective interventions include "varicocele repair, correction of identifiable hormonal abnormalities, microsurgical reconstruction of obstructive conditions, and surgical relief of ejaculatory duct obstruction". "Use of ART is an effective intervention for fertility and a critical component for treatment of some couples, such as men with CBAVD or NOA who also require surgical sperm retrieval", and "Evaluation should proceed in parallel for both male and female members of a couple to optimize treatment success".

### Time for improvement in semen parameters after varicocelectomy [^115hHMA9]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

While there are a number of studies documenting a positive effect of varicocelectomy on semen parameters, the length of time required following varicocelectomy for semen quality to improve is not well established. Therefore, in this study we identified the changes with time in semen parameters after varicocelectomy.

Materials and Methods

The records and database of 304 patients who underwent varicocele repair for subfertility were reviewed retrospectively. All men had at least 2 preoperative semen analyses as well as semen testing at 3 and 6 months postoperatively.

Results

For the 100 patients who met the study inclusion criteria mean sperm counts increased significantly by 3 and 6 months after varicocelectomy (by 53% and 38% by 3 and 6 months, p = 0.0003 and 0.001, respectively). By 3 and 6 months the combined groups had a mean 2.5 and 1.5-fold higher total motile count compared to the preoperative total motile count, respectively. There was no further improvement in semen parameters in those men followed for more than 6 months. There were no statistically significant differences in the improvement in semen volume, motility, count or total motile count comparing the results at 3, 6 and more than 9 months postoperatively.

Conclusions

Sperm parameters improve by 3 months after varicocele repair and then do not improve further. This finding should allow physicians to decide quickly if varicocelectomy has been effective and, then, if required, plan on the use of other therapies to manage the couples' infertility.
