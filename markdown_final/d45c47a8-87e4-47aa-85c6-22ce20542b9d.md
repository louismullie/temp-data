## Question

What is the relationship between amyloid beta and tau protein?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between amyloid-beta and tau in Alzheimer's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical amyloid cascade hypothesis and its core claims. Then, I should verify the temporal and spatial patterns of Aβ and tau accumulation in humans. Next, I will examine mechanistic links between Aβ and tau, including synaptic and inflammatory pathways. After that, I need to review biomarker data that distinguish soluble p-tau from insoluble tangle pathology. I will then consider genetic and network-level modifiers, including APOE and connectivity. Finally, I should integrate these into a refined model and draw therapeutic and diagnostic implications, while double-checking areas of uncertainty and controversy.

> Let me first confirm the foundational framework. The amyloid cascade hypothesis posits that Aβ accumulation is an early, upstream event that triggers downstream tau hyperphosphorylation, aggregation, synaptic dysfunction, and neurodegeneration, with strong support from autosomal dominant AD genetics and early biomarker sequences in familial disease, though I should be careful not to overgeneralize to sporadic AD without qualification [^113ngaLz] [^112YQ7bJ] [^115xtRG5].

> Wait, let me verify the temporal sequence in humans across the spectrum. In dominantly inherited AD, Aβ changes can precede tau by roughly a decade, and site-specific phosphorylation of tau (for example p-tau217) rises in tandem with Aβ accumulation, supporting a causal upstream role for Aβ in that context, whereas in sporadic AD, age-related tau in the medial temporal lobe often appears before overt Aβ deposition, creating a tau-first appearance that complicates a universal Aβ-first model [^111SBCcJ] [^114nhFo1] [^1176Nbxg].

> Hold on, I should verify the spatial patterns to avoid jumping to conclusions. Aβ tends to accumulate first in neocortical association areas and posterior cingulate, whereas tau pathology originates in the transentorhinal/entorhinal cortex and follows a stereotyped spread through limbic and association cortices. This spatial disconnect has long been cited as a challenge to a purely local Aβ-to-tau model, but emerging work suggests network-mediated interactions can reconcile this topography [^112kzGdE] [^1114XJME] [^114nhFo1].

> I will now examine mechanistic links that could bridge Aβ and tau. Let me consider synaptic mechanisms first: Aβ oligomers can dysregulate excitatory–inhibitory balance and engage dendritic tau via kinases such as Fyn, linking Aβ toxicity to tau-dependent synaptic failure. This provides a plausible route for Aβ to amplify tau-mediated network dysfunction even without direct colocalization of plaques and tangles [^113V8yqk] [^115xtRG5] [^116insi1].

> Next, I should review inflammatory pathways. Activation of microglial NLRP3 inflammasome by Aβ can modulate tau kinases and phosphatases, accelerating tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation; this positions neuroinflammation as a key mediator of Aβ–tau crosstalk and helps explain why Aβ perturbation can propagate tau pathology in some models [^115nf4vN].

> But wait, what about direct seeding at plaque interfaces. Experimental in vivo seeding studies show that Aβ plaques create a permissive microenvironment that accelerates the amplification of tau seeds into neuritic plaque tau, followed by NFTs and neuropil threads, indicating a multistep mechanism whereby plaques facilitate tau aggregation and spread without requiring transgenic tau overexpression [^114jTxGh].

> I need to check the biomarker distinctions carefully. Early-rising soluble p-tau species such as p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231 correlate tightly with Aβ-PET and decline when Aβ plaques are reduced by anti-amyloid therapy, consistent with an Aβ-driven soluble tauopathy. In contrast, MTBR-tau243 and p-tau205 track tau-PET and NFT burden and are less responsive to Aβ-lowering, reflecting a later, aggregation-dominant phase of disease [^116BWY9B] [^11486jq1] [^115xSicg].

> Let me reconsider the clinical correlation side of this. While Aβ accumulation is an early biomarker, tau burden correlates more strongly with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline across stages. This supports a model in which Aβ sets the stage, but tau propagation and aggregation are more proximate drivers of clinical symptoms, reinforcing the need to consider both proteins therapeutically [^113ngaLz] [^112rvzcy].

> I should confirm genetic and network-level modifiers. APOE ε4 increases Aβ accumulation and appears to potentiate the relationship between Aβ and tau, suggesting a synergistic, not merely additive, interaction. Additionally, tau spreads preferentially along anatomically connected networks, and regions with high Aβ burden show accelerated tau propagation, indicating that connectivity and Aβ jointly shape the spatiotemporal evolution of tau [^116LiEPi] [^1114XJME] [^113upH7p].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about exclusivity. Evidence from sporadic AD and PART-like observations indicates that tau pathology can develop in the absence of significant Aβ, and some data suggest tau may modulate APP processing or Aβ generation, implying bidirectional or parallel pathways in certain contexts. This argues against a strictly linear cascade in all cases and supports disease heterogeneity [^1176Nbxg] [^112PrqYR] [^114nhFo1].

> Let me synthesize a refined model that integrates these strands. Aβ and tau can initiate independently in some brains, but when both are present, Aβ accelerates tau propagation and aggregation via synaptic, inflammatory, and seeding mechanisms, producing a synergistic toxicity that exceeds the sum of either alone. Clinically, the combination of Aβ and tau, rather than either in isolation, best predicts progression and cognitive decline, aligning with a "two-hit" or synergistic model rather than a purely linear cascade [^113x3v1k] [^112BafMi] [^112BafMi].

> I should double-check therapeutic implications before concluding. Given the distinct biology of soluble p-tau versus insoluble tangles, early intervention with Aβ-lowering therapy may reduce soluble p-tau and delay downstream tau spread, whereas later-stage disease may require direct tau-targeting to curb NFT accumulation. This staged, combination strategy is increasingly viewed as more plausible than monotherapy against a single protein [^116BWY9B] [^112BafMi] [^112enUsm].

> Finally, I need to ensure diagnostic framing aligns with current standards. Contemporary frameworks define AD biologically by the presence of both Aβ and tau pathologies detected by Core 1 biomarkers, with clinical symptoms reflecting the burden and distribution of these proteinopathies. This biological definition supports early detection and staging while acknowledging modifiers such as cognitive reserve and co-pathologies [^112cCr5F].

Amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau are **independent but synergistic** pathologies in Alzheimer's disease (AD): Aβ accumulates extracellularly and can **accelerate tau hyperphosphorylation and spread** [^113x3v1k], while tau aggregates intracellularly and correlates more closely with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline [^113ngaLz]. Aβ likely acts as a **trigger** [^115xtRG5] that facilitates tau propagation [^114jTxGh], but tau pathology can also emerge without Aβ, especially in aging [^114P7KZa]. Their interaction is bidirectional and **synergistic** [^112BafMi], not purely linear, and both are required for full AD pathogenesis [^113V8yqk]; thus, effective therapies may need to target both proteins [^112BafMi].

---

## Biological roles and normal functions

### Amyloid beta (Aβ)

Amyloid beta (Aβ) is a **cleavage product** of amyloid precursor protein (APP) [^113ngaLz], generated by β- and γ-secretases; under normal conditions it is present at low levels and has roles in synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival [^notfound]. In AD, Aβ misfolds and aggregates into extracellular plaques, disrupting synaptic function and triggering inflammation [^112YQ7bJ].

---

### Tau protein

Tau is a **microtubule-associated protein** that stabilizes neuronal microtubules and supports axonal transport [^117KtvSz]; in AD, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, detaches from microtubules, and aggregates into paired helical filaments, forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that impair neuronal function and viability [^113ngaLz].

---

## Temporal and spatial relationship in Alzheimer's disease

### Temporal sequence

Aβ pathology typically appears **earlier** than tau pathology, often decades before clinical symptoms [^116srW5S], consistent with the amyloid cascade hypothesis [^113ngaLz]. Tau pathology emerges later and correlates more strongly with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline [^113ngaLz] [^112cCr5F].

---

### Spatial distribution

Aβ pathology begins in neocortical regions (e.g. posterior cingulate, precuneus) and spreads diffusely across the cortex [^112kzGdE]. Tau pathology originates in the **medial temporal lobe** (entorhinal cortex, hippocampus) and spreads sequentially to limbic and neocortical regions, closely matching clinical progression [^1114XJME].

---

## Mechanistic interactions between Aβ and tau

### Aβ-induced tau pathology

Aβ oligomers can **induce tau hyperphosphorylation** via activation of kinases (e.g. GSK-3β, CDK5), promoting tau aggregation and NFT formation [^11629bgL] [^111pTCB2]. Aβ pathology also facilitates tau propagation through neuronal networks, accelerating spread and exacerbating neurodegeneration [^114jTxGh] [^1114XJME].

---

### Tau-mediated Aβ toxicity

Tau is **required for Aβ-induced synaptic dysfunction** and cognitive impairment; in tau-deficient models, Aβ toxicity is attenuated, indicating tau mediates Aβ's harmful effects [^115xtRG5]. Tau pathology can also exacerbate Aβ-induced neuroinflammation and neuronal injury [^115nf4vN].

---

## Evidence from genetic and experimental studies

- **Genetic evidence**: Mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 increase Aβ production and cause familial AD with both Aβ and tau pathology, supporting Aβ as an upstream trigger [^113ngaLz].
- **Experimental models**: Aβ accumulation precedes and accelerates tau pathology in transgenic models; conversely, tau reduction mitigates Aβ toxicity, confirming a synergistic relationship [^115xtRG5] [^114jTxGh].
- **Human studies**: Biomarker and imaging studies show Aβ accumulation precedes tau, and tau correlates more strongly with cognitive decline and neurodegeneration [^111SBCcJ] [^113ngaLz].

---

## Clinical implications and therapeutic strategies

- **Synergistic toxicity**: The combination of Aβ and tau pathology accelerates cognitive decline more than either alone, underscoring the need for combined therapeutic strategies [^116dzzBD] [^112BafMi].
- **Therapeutic targeting**: Anti-Aβ therapies may reduce soluble tau species early in disease, but tau-targeting therapies are likely necessary to address later-stage neurodegeneration [^116BWY9B] [^112enUsm].
- **Biomarker-guided therapy**: Early detection of Aβ and tau pathology enables timely intervention, potentially improving outcomes [^117RuFvf].

---

## Controversies and unresolved questions

- **Initiating event**: While Aβ is often upstream, tau pathology can occur without Aβ (e.g. primary age-related tauopathy), suggesting alternative pathways [^114P7KZa] [^114nhFo1].
- **Bidirectionality**: Emerging evidence indicates tau can influence Aβ processing, indicating a more complex, bidirectional relationship than the linear cascade model [^112PrqYR] [^113x3v1k].
- **Therapeutic timing**: Optimal timing for targeting Aβ and tau remains unclear, and combined or sequential strategies may be required [^112BafMi] [^113QQzWj].

Amyloid beta and tau are **independent but synergistic** pathologies in AD: Aβ initiates and accelerates tau pathology, while tau mediates and amplifies Aβ toxicity [^113x3v1k]. Their interaction is bidirectional and synergistic, and both are required for full AD pathogenesis; therefore, effective therapies may need to target both proteins [^112BafMi].

Aβ 42 MONOMERS VS OLIGOMERS ON TAU AGGREGATION AND PHOSPHORYLATION

The causal relationship between 'plaques and tangles', i.e. whether and how Aβ induces the formation of intracellular altered and aggregated protein tau, is a crucial and a much-debated issue.

We investigated whether Aβ 42 could modify the conformation and/or the phosphorylation of tau protein to render it more prone to aggregate. Previous data reported three major mechanisms through which Aβ peptides may induce tau aggregation: 1) Aβ phosphorylates tau through the activation of specific kinases and this event alters the ability of tau to bind tubulin; 2) Aβ interferes with proteasomal degradation of tau, thus increasing the free-state of the protein; 3) Aβ aggregates exert a nucleation effect on tau. The latter hypothesis is supported by the notion that tau pathology often co-exists with cerebral amyloidosis.

We demonstrated that Aβ 42 monomers, but not oligomers, intraventricularly injected in mice expressing wild type human tau, produce a pathological conformational change of tau protein. In the same experimental model, we also found that monomers induce phosphorylation of pathological tau epitopes activating GSK3β, JNK, and ERK kinases and that the inhibition of these kinases rescues the tau conformational change. Finally, we investigated whether the observed modification of tau mediated by Aβ monomers could be ascribed to an increase of tau protein levels. It is well known that the increase of total tau is a condition that favors phosphorylation and conformational change of tau, as demonstrated with mutant tau. We found that Aβ monomers inhibit its proteasomal degradation. Thus, Aβ monomers alter tau conformation through two different mechanisms: hyperphosphorylation and increase of protein levels.

1 BACKGROUND

The pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are amyloid‐β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, Aβ accumulation is the earliest pathological event, which can start decades before symptoms, and it is followed by tau accumulation and neurodegeneration. 1 In addition, recent studies have reported the involvement of many other downstream pathophysiological processes during the early stages of the Alzheimer's continuum, even in asymptomatic individuals, including neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction and neuronal injury. 2, 3

Recent advances in the development of novel biomarkers have enabled us and others to track some of these processes through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or plasma biomarkers. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Studying the early changes in these biomarkers and their relationship with the main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) would allow us to better understand the role of these processes in the progression of AD. Understanding these mechanisms, especially in the earliest stages, can also be informative on novel possible drug targets for the prevention of AD.

Introduction

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized at the molecular level by the accumulation of two specific protein-based pathologies within the brain: amyloid plaques, composed of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau protein. These pathologies combine to create a toxic environment that drives neurodegeneration via neuronal and synaptic loss, leading to cognitive impairment. While Aβ and tau have been recognized as the primary signature of Alzheimer's disease, the causal relationship between these two pathologies is not fully understood. The prevailing view set forth by the amyloid cascade hypothesis is that the accumulation of Aβ peptides is the main causative event triggering the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, with tau-based NFTs, neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment following as a result.

Importantly, the amyloid cascade hypothesis does not require that Aβ occurs first in all Alzheimer's disease cases. Tau-based NFTs are well known to accumulate within the medial temporal lobe (MTL; includes entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala) in most individuals by their fifth or sixth decade in an age-related process that is independent of Aβ. Therefore, rather than occurring first, Aβ is thought to facilitate the spread of tau beyond the MTL. How this occurs is not well understood due to the spatial disconnection between Aβ accumulation, which usually begins in the parietal, cingulate and frontal regions in the neocortex, and age-related tau accumulation in the MTL. These pathologies may initiate independently and only interact when Aβ eventually spreads to the MTL. It is also possible that tau in the MTL somehow initiates neocortical Aβ, although a recent study in genetically identical twins supports the causal effect of Aβ on tau rather than the opposite. A third possibility is that tau spreads beyond the MTL in some casesand may interact locally with neocortical Aβ, which then amplifies tau. Taken together, these possibilities suggest that there may be two basic subtypes of pathology progression in Alzheimer's disease: an 'amyloid-first' variant, in which widespread Aβ plaques precede neocortical NFTs, and a 'tau-first' variant, in which early neocortical NFTs precede widespread Aβ.

### The amyloid cascade hypothesis [^113jeYeq]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2008). Low credibility.

The amyloid deposits in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease have attracted attention and are now considered not only an essential requirement for pathological diagnosis but also an important clue to the pathogenesis of the disease. This article looks critically at the basis of the "amyloid cascade hypothesis" to conclude that there are many issues that need to be resolved since they are inconsistent with the hypothesis.

### Neocortical variation of abeta load in fully expressed, pure Alzheimer's disease [^1176AuBU]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2010). Low credibility.

The relationship between amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and tau-related neurofibrillary changes is a key issue in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate the extent and cortical distribution of Abeta and tau pathology, their mutual links and their correlation with the duration of the disease in thirty-nine patients with fully expressed AD. By tau immunohistochemistry, we identified different patterns of distribution of neurofibrillary changes that were ascribed to Braak stage V and VI. The disease duration was longer in patients at Braak stage VI than in those at V. Morphometric analysis carried out in several neocortical areas demonstrated that Abeta load was not uniform among individuals and also varied in the same patient throughout the neocortex, showing decreased severity from associative fields in the premotor and primary motor areas. Abeta load was higher at Braak stage VI than at stage V and correlated positively with disease duration in primary motor cortex and in superior temporal gyrus. Overall, we documented a marked heterogeneity in the extent of Abeta deposition even in AD brains at final stages of disease that cannot be completely explained by a simple, regular build up of this pathologic protein in the cerebral cortex during the course of the disease. This study may be relevant for the correct evaluation of therapeutic strategies for AD that specifically address Abeta pathology.

Future directions for Alzheimer's disease criteria and research — Observational studies and clinical trials should be conducted with more representative cohorts, with true epidemiological and real-world studies of biomarker properties in representative groups to ascertain relationships valid at the population level. Standardization of biofluid assays, tau positron emission tomography (PET) quantification methods, and cutpoints is needed, and the exact thresholds for abnormality may evolve over time as additional data inform prognostic value. Improved understanding of various posttranslational modifications of tau may enhance fluid-based biological staging, and with improved understanding of immune/inflammatory processes, microglia, and astrocyte biology in AD pathogenesis, a more prominent role for I biomarkers in biological characterization and prognosis is envisioned, especially if brain-specific changes can be detected in blood. As clinical trials targeting mechanisms other than anti-Aβ immunotherapy are performed, the effects of these interventions on biomarkers and clinical outcomes should be included in future criteria.

### A soluble phosphorylated tau signature links tau, amyloid and the evolution of stages of dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease [^111SBCcJ]. Nature Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Development of tau-based therapies for Alzheimer's disease requires an understanding of the timing of disease-related changes in tau. We quantified the phosphorylation state at multiple sites of the tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid markers across four decades of disease progression in dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease. We identified a pattern of tau staging where site-specific phosphorylation changes occur at different periods of disease progression and follow distinct trajectories over time. These tau phosphorylation state changes are uniquely associated with structural, metabolic, neurodegenerative and clinical markers of disease, and some (p-tau217 and p-tau181) begin with the initial increases in aggregate amyloid-β as early as two decades before the development of aggregated tau pathology. Others (p-tau205 and t-tau) increase with atrophy and hypometabolism closer to symptom onset. These findings provide insights into the pathways linking tau, amyloid-β and neurodegeneration, and may facilitate clinical trials of tau-based treatments.

### Synergistic interaction between amyloid and tau predicts the progression to dementia [^116dzzBD]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recent literature proposes that amyloid β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) synergism accelerates biomarker abnormalities in controls. Yet, it remains to be answered whether this synergism is the driving force behind Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia.

Methods

We stratified 314 mild cognitive impairment individuals using [18 F]florbetapir positron emission tomography Aβ imaging and cerebrospinal fluid p-tau. Regression and voxel-based logistic regression models with interaction terms evaluated 2-year changes in cognition and clinical status as a function of baseline biomarkers.

Results

We found that the synergism between [18 F]florbetapir and p-tau, rather than their additive effects, was associated with the cognitive decline and progression to AD. Furthermore, voxel-based analysis revealed that temporal and inferior parietal were the regions where the synergism determined an increased likelihood of developing AD.

Discussion

Together, the present results support that progression to AD dementia is driven by the synergistic rather than a mere additive effect between Aβ and p-tau proteins.

### Tau aggregation and its interplay with amyloid-β [^112hFEFb]. Acta Neuropathologica (2015). Low credibility.

The amyloid-β peptide

Sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretase results in the generation of a range of Aβ peptides from 39 to 43 amino acid residues in length, although Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 are the predominant species in vivo. The hydrophobic nature of the peptides, particularly Aβ 1–42 and Aβ 1–43, allows them to self-aggregate and form a myriad of species from dimers to small molecular weight oligomers, to protofibrils, to fibrils, ultimately leading to their deposition as amyloid plaques (Fig. 1). Furthermore, Aβ peptides can also undergo pyroglutamate modification at amino acid position three (Aβ3(pE)); this increases the stability, aggregation propensity and neurotoxicity compared to full-length, unmodified Aβ. Mutations in the genes encoding APP and the γ-secretase components, PSEN1 and PSEN2, lead to rare, early-onset familial forms of AD (FAD) by increasing the overall production of Aβ or shifting γ-secretase cleavage to produce more of the amyloidogenic Aβ 1–42. The mechanism by which excessive Aβ accumulation occurs in sporadic AD remains unclear. Reduced Aβ clearance or small increases in Aβ production over a long period of time are potential mechanisms that result in the accumulation of Aβ in the brain.

### NLRP3 inflammasome activation drives tau pathology [^115nf4vN]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta in plaques, aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles and neuroinflammation, together resulting in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline 1. The NLRP3 inflammasome assembles inside of microglia on activation, leading to increased cleavage and activity of caspase-1 and downstream interleukin-1β release 2. Although the NLRP3 inflammasome has been shown to be essential for the development and progression of amyloid-beta pathology in mice 3, the precise effect on tau pathology remains unknown. Here we show that loss of NLRP3 inflammasome function reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation by regulating tau kinases and phosphatases. Tau activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and intracerebral injection of fibrillar amyloid-beta-containing brain homogenates induced tau pathology in an NLRP3-dependent manner. These data identify an important role of microglia and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the pathogenesis of tauopathies and support the amyloid-cascade hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease, demonstrating that neurofibrillary tangles develop downstream of amyloid-beta-induced microglial activation.

### What is Alzheimer's disease? An analysis of nosological perspectives from the 20th and 21st centuries [^1141ws4A]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Evolution of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) concept, definition, and diagnostics among the key players involved in nosography in the three key periods of AD history (1900s–1910s, 1960s–1980s, and 2010s–2020s).

The historical debates between Alzheimer and Fischer regarding the significance of extended tau pathology and the unitary neuritic plaque are still relevant in discussions of AD neuropathological features today. In the 1960s–1980s, it was discovered that high levels of NFTs and neuritic plaques, along with neuronal loss, are correlated characteristics of early‐ and late‐onset AD using more sensitive staining, quantitative, and correlative approaches. A consensus emerged that high levels of these neuropathological features were paralleling characteristic neuropathological lesions of AD. However, there is still ongoing debate about the relative importance of β‐amyloid and tau pathology, as well as low and intermediate levels of pathology for disease classification. On the one hand, the β‐amyloid cascade hypothesis, proposed since 1992, centers on a deterministic biological model of AD, which received numerous supporting evidence. This model impacted the NIA–AA 2012 neuropathological criteria, where the presence of neuritic plaques without NFTs represents the first levels of AD neuropathological changes. Some authors still prefer to refer to a different nosological category (pathological aging) for these cases. It is important to note that some dimensions of parenchymal β‐amyloid pathology (diffuse plaques) are not considered a defining AD neuropathological characteristic. Conversely, the lack of specificity of NFTs limits its usefulness as the sole defining feature of AD, and numerous limitations of the β‐amyloid cascade hypothesis have emerged. This led to alternative probabilistic models, including but not limited to β‐amyloid, especially for sporadic AD. Current neuropathological and PET findings also highlight that tau pathology, more than β‐amyloid pathology, is a better correlate of neurodegeneration and symptoms, and a better stratifier of clinical prognosis in cognitively unimpaired individuals. Neuropathologists have been debating the nosological classification of isolated NFTs: some argue that it is part of AD, while others suggest it may be a distinct condition called primary age‐related tauopathy. The 2023 AA β‐amyloid‐centered definition of AD aligns with the β‐amyloid cascade hypothesis and departs from previous views from Alzheimer, Roth, and Terry, who emphasized the importance of tau pathology or the combination of β‐amyloid and tau pathology at high levels as characteristic neuropathological features of AD. A distant parallel can be drawn with Fischer's sphaerotrichia, which focused on neuritic plaques. However, Fischer emphasized the clinical features of sphaerotrichia and the low frequency of neuritic plaques in asymptomatic individuals (6%) to classify it as a disease.

### Synergy between amyloid-β and tau in Alzheimer's disease [^113x3v1k]. Nature Neuroscience (2020). High credibility.

Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) present with both extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. For many years, the prevailing view of AD pathogenesis has been that changes in Aβ precipitate the disease process and initiate a deleterious cascade involving tau pathology and neurodegeneration. Beyond this 'triggering' function, it has been typically presumed that Aβ and tau act independently and in the absence of specific interaction. However, accumulating evidence now suggests otherwise and contends that both pathologies have synergistic effects. This could not only help explain negative results from anti-Aβ clinical trials but also suggest that trials directed solely at tau may need to be reconsidered. Here, drawing from extensive human and disease model data, we highlight the latest evidence base pertaining to the complex Aβ-tau interaction and underscore its crucial importance to elucidating disease pathogenesis and the design of next-generation AD therapeutic trials.

### Perspectives on the amyloid-beta cascade hypothesis [^1139fTjk]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2004). Low credibility.

For the better part of the past two decades, studies on the molecular, biochemical and cellular mechanisms of Alzheimer disease have focused on amyloid-beta protein, the major proteinaceous component of senile plaques. In fact, the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis has come to dominate the field both in terms of proposed disease mechanism as well as potential for therapeutic intervention. In this review, we look at the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis from the perspective of pathology, cell biology, and genetics. In all cases, alternate interpretations of old data as well as new evidence indicates that amyloid-beta, far from being the harbinger of disease, actually occurs secondary to more fundamental pathological changes and may even play a protective role in the diseased brain. These findings bring into serious doubt the validity of the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis as the central cause of Alzheimer disease and, consequently, the potential usefulness of therapeutic targets against amyloid-beta.

### Amyloid-β and tau – a toxic pas de deux in Alzheimer's disease [^113XV6RR]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2011). Medium credibility.

Amyloid-β and tau are the two hallmark proteins in Alzheimer's disease. Although both amyloid-β and tau have been extensively studied individually with regard to their separate modes of toxicity, more recently new light has been shed on their possible interactions and synergistic effects in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we review novel findings that have shifted our understanding of the role of tau in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease towards being a crucial partner of amyloid-β. As we gain a deeper understanding of the different cellular functions of tau, the focus shifts from the axon, where tau has a principal role as a microtubule-associated protein, to the dendrite, where it mediates amyloid-β toxicity.

### Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: more to come? [^116zBe2U]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2013). Low credibility.

The past decades have witnessed an enormous expansion of the literature on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is now clear that a triplet of CSF biomarkers (total-tau, phospho-tau, and the 42 amino acid fragment of amyloid-β) reflects core neuropathological features of AD and contributes diagnostically relevant information if measured in a proper manner. Here, we discuss what is needed for these biomarkers to become generally implemented in the clinical routine. We also discuss novel CSF biomarkers, the challenge of differential diagnosis-making in diseases with shared pathologies, and if CSF biomarkers will survive in the long run, given the advancements in molecular neuroimaging and ultra-sensitive blood tests.

### Alzheimer's disease beyond amyloid: strategies for future therapeutic interventions [^112BafMi]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Thirdly, amyloid β and tau protein may synergistically and simultaneously cause pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid β enhances phosphorylation, truncation, and aggregation of tau protein, whereas tau protein further induces the production of amyloid β species. The effective suppression of only one of these two factors is probably insufficient to produce a clinical benefit. Thus an approach targeting them simultaneously or sequentially may be necessary to affect the course of the disease.

Finally, although the amyloid hypothesis and tau pathology are supported by considerable genetic and biomarker studies, the data from failed clinical trials suggest that other potential targets should be explored.

### Tau aggregation and its interplay with amyloid-β [^1179M2Sj]. Acta Neuropathologica (2015). Low credibility.

Future strategies

It has been well demonstrated that Aβ and tau are at the heart of AD pathogenesis and their interplay in the disease is slowly becoming more evident. Theoretically, based on what we know thus far, targeting one of the two molecules in AD should reduce the neurotoxicity of the other. Due to the complexity of AD and the inability to diagnose and treat it early, anti-Aβ immunotherapeutic strategies have generated less than desired results. Therapies targeting tau, or a combination of both anti-Aβ and anti-tau therapies, may be more effective, as it is tau that has been shown to drive Aβ synaptotoxicity. To increase the efficacy of tau immunotherapeutics one might need to consider enhancing their cell-penetrating ability, which could be achieved through the use of antibody engineering.

### Amyloid-beta and phosphorylated tau accumulations cause abnormalities at Synapses of Alzheimer's disease neurons [^116c3Zs7]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Amyloid-beta (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau are hallmark lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the loss of synapses and dysfunctions of neurotransmission are more directly tied to disease severity. The role of these lesions in the pathoetiological progression of the disease remains contested. Biochemical, cellular, molecular, and pathological studies provided several lines of evidence and improved our understanding of how Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation may directly harm synapses and alter neurotransmission. In vitro evidence suggests that Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau have both direct and indirect cytotoxic effects that affect neurotransmission, axonal transport, signaling cascades, organelle function, and immune response in ways that lead to synaptic loss and dysfunctions in neurotransmitter release. Observations in preclinical models and autopsy studies support these findings, suggesting that while the pathoetiology of positive lesions remains elusive, their removal may reduce disease severity and progression. The purpose of this article is to highlight the need for further investigation of the role of tau in disease progression and its interactions with Aβ and neurotransmitters alike.

### Cascading network failure across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum [^117MmupD]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Why do systems degenerate?

Several terms have been used to describe the predilection of neurodegenerative diseases to target large-scale brain networks [i.e. systems neurodegenerations, network-based neurodegenerations and molecular nexopathies]. Theories attempting to explain the selective vulnerability of large-scale brain systems to neurodegenerative disease commonly invoke a molecularly driven conceptualization of the pathophysiology. These types of theories hold that aggregated misfolded proteins are the inciting event in neurodegenerative diseases, and explain the selective vulnerability of large-scale systems via a mechanism of prion-like spreading of these neurotoxic proteins along structural connections within brain networks. However, ashave noted, these theories do not capture the 'complexity of [Alzheimer's disease] pathology which, in contrast to all other diseases studied…, features two co-occurring major molecular pathologies (amyloid-β and tau)'. On the other hand, it is also possible to espouse a systems-level conceptualization of neurodegenerative pathophysiology that designates the functional activity within large-scale brain networks as the consequence of the cellular changes, with those changes in functional activity being the driving force of both the expanding nature of the neurodegeneration and the clinical manifestations of the disease. Such a mechanism would predict system-level disruptions prior to characteristic spread of molecular pathology and naturally explain spatiotemporal gaps between molecular-level disease hallmarks (i.e. neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques), given that distributed system-level changes do not require local physical proximity. It would also predict characteristic network disruptions heralding known patterns of clinical progression and neurodegeneration. However, these dynamic relationships are currently unknown, given that the spatiotemporal evolution of typical Alzheimer's disease-related large-scale brain system changes are not as clearly defined as the well-known sequence of clinical, molecular, structural, and metabolic changes seen with Alzheimer's disease.

### The relationship of soluble tau species with Alzheimer's disease amyloid plaque removal and tau pathology [^1175fKng]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

BACKGROUND

Tau‐derived cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers correlate with amyloid‐beta (Aβ) plaques or tau tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study assessed the effects of long‐term anti‐Aβ antibodies on amyloid plaques, tau tangles, and CSF tau species to determine the relationships between them.

METHODS

A post‐hoc analysis of the DIAN‐TU‐001 trial (NCT01760005) examined 142 participants at risk for dominantly inherited AD randomized to solanezumab (n = 50), gantenerumab (n = 52), or placebo (n = 40). High‐resolution mass spectrometry quantified CSF tau species over four years.

RESULTS

Phosphorylated tau (p‐tau) species (153, 181, 217, 231) increased early in preclinical AD but were reduced with gantenerumab‐mediated Aβ plaque reduction. Nearly a decade later, MTBR‐tau243 and p‐tau205 increased, showing no association with Aβ reduction, aligning with tau tangle pathology progression.

DISCUSSION

Initially changing soluble p‐tau species track Aβ plaque reduction, while ptau205 and MTBR‐243 reflect tau tangle pathology, informing different pathways of therapeutic strategies.

Highlights

p‐tau217 and p‐tau231 correlate with Aβ‐PET and respond to Aβ‐plaque lowering therapies.
Aβ immunotherapy trials support a direct link between p‐tau changes and Aβ plaques
Gantenerumab reduces Aβ plaques but does not affect tau NFT‐related biomarkers.
Blood‐based p‐tau217 assays may provide a non‐invasive tool to monitor Aβ therapies.
MTBR‐tau243 strongly correlates with tau PET and tracks NFT pathology progression.
Further studies are needed to validate tau biomarkers for tracking NFT‐targeting therapies.

### Update on neuroimaging in Alzheimer's disease [^115CYXnh]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review was to discuss the contribution of the most recent neuroimaging studies to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease.

Recent Findings

Studies have applied cross-sectional and longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET), structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to primarily investigate (1) how Alzheimer's disease pathological hallmarks like tau and amyloid-beta build up and spread across the brain at different disease stage and in different disease phenotypes and (2) how the spreading of these proteins is related to atrophy, to neuronal network disruption and to neuroinflammation.

Summary

The findings of these studies offer insight on the mechanisms that drive the pathological and clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease, highlighting their multifactorial nature, which is a crucial aspect for the development of disease-modifying therapeutics and can be captured with multimodal imaging approaches.

### Plasma amyloid beta levels are associated with cerebral amyloid and tau deposition [^117RuFvf]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2019). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease associated with aging. AD affects 5.7 million individuals in the United States, a number that is expected to rise to nearly 14 million by 2050. Early detection is increasingly considered critical, in that interventions designed to slow or stop disease progression during early stages are likely to be most effective. To identify individuals at risk for progression to AD, numerous biomarkers are being investigated, including neuroimaging measures, sensory measures, digital biomarkers, blood levels of target proteins, and many others.

Recent advances in blood-based assays have suggested that levels of amyloid beta (Aβ) can be precisely measured and are associated with levels of Aβ in the brain, making them good potential biomarkers for AD-risk screening and early detection. Specifically, previous studies have suggested that plasma levels of Aβ, tau, and other target proteins, such as neurofilament light, amyloid precursor protein, and others, are altered in patients with AD and those in the prodromal stage of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A number of studies have suggested that plasma Aβ42 and Aβ40 measures, as well as the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 are reduced in patients with AD and MCI and that these plasma biomarkers can predict the presence of AD and MCI and progression from normal to impaired cognition. However, other studies have shown that higher plasma Aβ measures are associated with AD and conversion to AD. Still, others have found no significant relationship. Reduced plasma Aβ has also been linked to poorer cognition. In addition, some studies have suggested that plasma levels of Aβ42 and Aβ40 are associated with the levels of cerebral Aβ on positron emission tomography (PET), cerebrospinal fluid levels of Aβ and tau, and AD-like brain atrophy, while others have not seen such an association. These conflicting results may be due to the type of plasma markers measured and the methodologies used to extract these values. For example, owing to its hydrophobicity, Aβ peptides interact with many proteins of the plasma matrix such as albumin, α2-macroglobulin, or lipoproteins among others. This could cause epitope masking, hindering the recognition of up to 50% of these amyloid peptides in the immunoassays. This matrix effect could affect the reliability of Aβ peptide quantifications in an individual. To deal with this, we decided to measure both the free and total amount of these peptides in plasma in the present study. Another factor that may influence the relationship between plasma Aβ analyte levels and other outcomes is the role of genetic variation, particularly apolipoprotein E (APOE). Finally, a recent study also showed a significant association of the tau/Aβ42 ratio with tau PET in a largely cognitively normal (CN) Korean sample.

### Soluble amyloid β-protein is increased in frontotemporal dementia with tau gene mutations [^112PrqYR]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2004). Low credibility.

The relationship between senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the main pathologic lesions of Alzheimer's disease, is not completely understood. We addressed this issue examining the type and amount of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) associated with the soluble and insoluble tissue fractions in the frontal cortex of 8 cases with frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism caused by mutations of the Tau gene (FTDP-17), in which the intracellular accumulation of polymerised tau is definitely the primary cause of neurodegeneration. As control, we examined 7 cases with frontotemporal dementia lacking distinctive histopathology (DLDH) as well as 8 pathologically normal subjects. In all cases the presence of Abeta deposits was ruled out using immunocytochemistry on sections adjacent to those used for biochemical analysis. ELISA analysis showed a 2.7 and 2.1 fold (p < 0.01) increase of soluble Abeta42 and Abeta40 in FTDP-17, compared to normal and DLDH brains, both of which had comparable levels of Abeta species. Furthermore, the immunoreactivity of the intracellular Abeta42 was significantly increased in cortical neurons of subjects affected with FTDP-17. The results demonstrate that the aggregation of tau protein produces an accumulation of Abeta, which, however, does not reach the critical concentration needed for Abetaplaques formation.

### Therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease [^115KtuYv]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2002). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and ultimately fatal neurological disorder for which there is no effective treatment at present. The disease is characterized pathologically by cerebral plaques that contain the amyloid-beta peptide and thread-like neuronal structures composed of the microtubule-associated protein TAU. Both amyloid-beta and TAU are thought to be crucial to pathogenesis, but compelling evidence supports amyloid-beta as the 'prime mover'. The main efforts for developing therapeutics are therefore focused on preventing amyloid-beta production, aggregation or downstream neurotoxic events. The progress of these and other approaches raises the hope that effective agents for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease will be available in the near future.

### Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease [^117S9j3F]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease leading to dementia worldwide. While neuritic plaques consisting of aggregated amyloid-beta proteins and neurofibrillary tangles of accumulated tau proteins represent the pathophysiologic hallmarks of AD, numerous processes likely interact with risk and protective factors and one's culture to produce the cognitive loss, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and functional impairments that characterize AD dementia. Recent biomarker and neuroimaging research has revealed how the pathophysiology of AD may lead to symptoms, and as the pathophysiology of AD gains clarity, more potential treatments are emerging that aim to modify the disease and relieve its burden.

### Genetic forms of tauopathies: inherited causes and implications of Alzheimer's disease-like TAU pathology in primary and secondary tauopathies [^114FVbJ3]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondary tauopathies

The distinction between primary and secondary tauopathy is determined by whether the abnormal changes in TAU protein are the predominant pathology and likely the driver of disease or a co-pathology and possibly secondary to a TAU-independent disease cause. If pathological TAU formation develops in response to other pathogenic events and is not considered the driver of the disease, the term secondary tauopathy is used. In many tauopathies considered secondary tauopathies, TAU is the most important co-pathology and may be critical to the developing neurodegeneration, e.g. for AD, which makes a clear distinction in some cases disputable. The genetic factors leading to TAU pathology as well as the pathomechanistic connections between the primary pathology and TAU in secondary tauopathies are often not fully understood. This section provides an overview of the most relevant secondary tauopathies and the state of the art on the relationship between genetic predispositions and TAU pathology in the respective diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD)

The classification of primary and secondary tauopathies can be challenging, as it is the case for Alzheimer's disease. There are two main hypotheses behind the pathophysiology of the disease: the Amyloid hypothesis and the TAU hypothesis. The former hypothesis posits that the accumulation of Aβ oligomers is the main driver of the disease. Mutations in the Amyloid precursor protein (APP), the precursor molecule whose proteolysis generates Aβ, or in Presenelin-1 or Presenelin-2, which comprise the catalytic domain of APP-protease γ-secretase, lead to increased or aberrant production and accumulation of Aβ-42. This is assumed to trigger a cascade leading to senile plaque formation, synaptic injury, oxidative stress, and altered cellular/enzymatic activities. The hypothesis suggests that imbalance between Aβ production and clearance triggers TAU hyperphosphorylation and accumulation into NFTs. According to the Aβ hypothesis, AD should be classified as a secondary tauopathy, since NFT formation is downstream of Amyloid pathology.

### Amyloid-associated increases in soluble tau relate to tau aggregation rates and cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's disease [^112rvzcy]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

For optimal design of anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) and anti-tau clinical trials, we need to better understand the pathophysiological cascade of Aβ- and tau-related processes. Therefore, we set out to investigate how Aβ and soluble phosphorylated tau (p-tau) relate to the accumulation of tau aggregates assessed with PET and subsequent cognitive decline across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. Using human cross-sectional and longitudinal neuroimaging and cognitive assessment data, we show that in early stages of AD, increased concentration of soluble CSF p-tau is strongly associated with accumulation of insoluble tau aggregates across the brain, and CSF p-tau levels mediate the effect of Aβ on tau aggregation. Further, higher soluble p-tau concentrations are mainly related to faster accumulation of tau aggregates in the regions with strong functional connectivity to individual tau epicenters. In this early stage, higher soluble p-tau concentrations is associated with cognitive decline, which is mediated by faster increase of tau aggregates. In contrast, in AD dementia, when Aβ fibrils and soluble p-tau levels have plateaued, cognitive decline is related to the accumulation rate of insoluble tau aggregates. Our data suggest that therapeutic approaches reducing soluble p-tau levels might be most favorable in early AD, before widespread insoluble tau aggregates.

### Accumulated amyloid-beta peptide and hyperphosphorylated tau protein: relationship and links in Alzheimer's disease [^115vnUbT]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2009). Low credibility.

The neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of extracellularly neuritic plaques, intracellularly neurofibrillary tangles and the loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. The neuritic plaque is composed of a core of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) while the neurofibrillary tangles contain phosphorylated tau protein, and, as such, both Abeta and tau are important molecules associated with AD. In healthy human bodies, clearance mechanisms for Abeta are available; yet if clearance fails, Abeta accumulates, increasing the risk of neurotoxicity in the brain. Tau, one of the main microtubule-associated proteins, will be hyperphosphorylated and lose the ability to bind microtubules when the homeostasis of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is disturbed in neurons. Accumulated Abeta and hyperphosphorylated tau are thought to be coexistent. Research on the pathological changes in AD indicates that accumulated Abeta in vivo may initiate the hyperphosphorylation of tau. Also, the signal transduction pathways of tau hyperphosphorylation may be related to accumulated Abeta. In this review, we will discuss how Abeta accumulates, how tau protein is hyperphosphorylated, and how accumulated Abeta initiates hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in AD.

### Amyloid-beta modulates the association between neurofilament light chain and brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease [^112cCr5F]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by the presence of amyloid and tau pathologies that lead to neuronal injury or neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Although the exact aetiology of AD is still being debated, the most widely accepted amyloid cascade hypothesis rests on amyloid-beta (Aβ) as the initiating event leading to a cascade of AD pathophysiological processes. This hypothesis has gained strong support based on the multitude of biomarker-based evidence suggesting that Aβ abnormality occurs decades before the onset of AD. This evidence suggests that the Aβ pathology correlates only weakly with neuronal injury or neurodegeneration but its downstream tau pathology is more strongly associated with neurodegeneration and consequently cognitive decline. As such, the new NIA-AA research framework A/T/(N) focuses on measurable neuropathologic biomarkers to define and track patients along the AD continuum for staging purposes. Following this framework, A (aggregated Aβ) and T (aggregated tau) define AD and can be measured using positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, while N (neuronal injury or neurodegeneration) is not specific to AD but provides staging of AD pathophysiological processes and can be measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), [18 F]FDG-PET, and CSF total tau (T-tau). Effectively, the biomarkers of N allow predicting cognitive decline or conversion for clinical trial enrichment.

### The preclinical phase of the pathological process underlying sporadic Alzheimer's disease [^114FV4c9]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Abnormal tau lesions (non-argyrophilic pretangle material, argyrophilic neuropil threads, neurofibrillary tangles) in select types of neurons are crucial for the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Ongoing formation of these tau lesions persists into end-stage Alzheimer's disease and is not subject to remission. The early pretangle disease phase is a focus of increasing interest because only abnormal forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau are involved at that point and, in contrast to late-stage disease when amyloid-β deposition is present, this phase is temporally closer to the prevailing conditions that induce the pathological process underlying Alzheimer's disease. Extracellular and aggregated amyloid-β may only be produced under pathological conditions by nerve cells that contain abnormal tau. One potential trigger for tau protein hyperphosphorylation and conformational change in Alzheimer's disease may be the presence of a non-endogenous pathogen. Subsequently, a predictable regional distribution pattern of the tau lesions develops in phylogenetically late-appearing and ontogenetically late-maturing neurons that are connected via their axons. It is hoped that hypotheses drawn from these considerations, as well as from recent tau dissemination models, from studies of variant tau conformers, and from tau imaging will encourage the development of new preventative and disease-modifying strategies.

### In vivo patterns of tau pathology, amyloid-β burden, and neuronal dysfunction in clinical variants of Alzheimer's disease [^115eYSD4]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease is not reflected in the rather diffuse cortical deposition of amyloid-β. We assessed the relationship between clinical symptoms, in vivo tau pathology, amyloid distribution, and hypometabolism in variants of Alzheimer's disease using novel multimodal PET imaging techniques. Tau pathology was primarily observed in brain regions related to clinical symptoms and overlapped with areas of hypometabolism. In contrast, amyloid-β deposition was diffusely distributed over the entire cortex. Tau PET imaging may thus serve as a valuable biomarker for the localization of neuronal injury in vivo and may help to validate atypical subtypes of Alzheimer's disease.

### Amyloid-β plaques enhance Alzheimer's brain tau-seeded pathologies by facilitating neuritic plaque tau aggregation [^114jTxGh]. Nature Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular tau inclusions. However, the exact mechanistic link between these two AD lesions remains enigmatic. Through injection of human AD-brain-derived pathological tau (AD-tau) into Aβ plaque-bearing mouse models that do not overexpress tau, we recapitulated the formation of three major types of AD-relevant tau pathologies: tau aggregates in dystrophic neurites surrounding Aβ plaques (NP tau), AD-like neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuropil threads (NTs). These distinct tau pathologies have different temporal onsets and functional consequences on neural activity and behavior. Notably, we found that Aβ plaques created a unique environment that facilitated the rapid amplification of proteopathic AD-tau seeds into large tau aggregates, initially appearing as NP tau, which was followed by the formation and spread of NFTs and NTs, likely through secondary seeding events. Our study provides insights into a new multistep mechanism underlying Aβ plaque-associated tau pathogenesis.

### Inducers and modulators of protein aggregation in Alzheimer's disease-critical tools for understanding the foundations of aggregate structures [^1173ch9H]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Amyloidogenic protein aggregation is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). As such, this critical feature of the disease has been instrumental in guiding research on the mechanistic basis of disease, diagnostic biomarkers and preventative and therapeutic treatments. Here we review identified molecular triggers and modulators of aggregation for two of the proteins associated with AD: amyloid beta and tau. We aim to provide an overview of how specific molecular factors can impact aggregation kinetics and aggregate structure to promote disease. Looking toward the future, we highlight some research areas of focus that would accelerate efforts to effectively target protein aggregation in AD.

### Origins of Alzheimer's disease: reconciling cerebrospinal fluid biomarker and neuropathology data regarding the temporal sequence of amyloid-beta and tau involvement [^113i1muX]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to address the temporal sequencing of involvement of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and reconcile apparently conflicting neuropathologic and biomarker data.

Recent Findings

Although neuropathologic studies show that limbic system tau disease occurs ubiquitously in middle-aged individuals before the appearance of amyloid plaques, biomarker studies in living individuals suggest that Aβ disease is the initiating event in Alzheimer's disease and precedes cerebrospinal fluid tau changes. Evidence from neuropathologic, biomarker, genetic and cellular/mouse studies shows that tau accumulation in limbic regions occurs slowly with age and does not induce widespread neurodegeneration, but that Aβ interacts with tau in some way to accelerate neurofibrillary disease and induce neurodegeneration.

Summary

Aβ aggregation is the key initial trigger of Alzheimer's disease pathologic changes and interacts with tau to exacerbate age-related tauopathy and induce neurodegeneration.

### Testing the amyloid cascade hypothesis: prevention trials in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease [^114quFad]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) has been increasingly challenged. Here, we aim to refocus the amyloid cascade hypothesis on its original premise that the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide is the primary and earliest event in AD pathogenesis as based on current evidence, initiating several pathological events and ultimately leading to AD dementia.

Background

An ongoing debate about the validity of the amyloid cascade hypothesis for AD has been triggered by clinical trials with investigational disease-modifying drugs targeting Aβ that have not demonstrated consistent clinically meaningful benefits.

Updated Hypothesis

It is an open question if monotherapy targeting Aβ pathology could be markedly beneficial at a stage when the brain has been irreversibly damaged by a cascade of pathological changes. Interventions in cognitively unimpaired individuals at risk for dementia, during amyloid-only and pre-amyloid stages, are more appropriate for proving or refuting the amyloid hypothesis. Our updated hypothesis states that anti-Aβ investigational therapies are likely to be most efficacious when initiated in the preclinical (asymptomatic) stages of AD and specifically when the disease is driven primarily by amyloid pathology. Given the young age at symptom onset and the deterministic nature of the mutations, autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) mutation carriers represent the ideal population to evaluate the efficacy of putative disease-modifying Aβ therapies.

Major Challenges For The Hypothesis

Key challenges of the amyloid hypothesis include the recognition that disrupted Aβ homeostasis alone is insufficient to produce the AD pathophysiologic process, poor correlation of Aβ with cognitive impairment, and inconclusive data regarding clinical efficacy of therapies targeting Aβ. Challenges of conducting ADAD research include the rarity of the disease and uncertainty of the generalizability of ADAD findings for the far more common "sporadic" late-onset AD.

Linkage To Other Major Theories

The amyloid cascade hypothesis, modified here to pertain to the preclinical stage of AD, still needs to be integrated with the development and effects of tauopathy and other co-pathologies, including neuroinflammation, vascular insults, synucleinopathy, and many others.

### Relationships between flortaucipir PET tau binding and amyloid burden, clinical diagnosis, age and cognition [^1111vWN2]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Because of its central role in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, the tau protein has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target. It has been argued that anti-tau therapeutics may be more efficacious than anti-amyloid approaches because tau is more closely associated with cell death in Alzheimer's disease. Anti-tau therapeutic approaches have included attempts to restore the normal function of the tau protein by inhibition of tau phosphorylation and tau aggregation. Other therapeutic strategies have focused on reducing accumulation or spread of tau aggregates. Recently, infusion of an anti-tau antibody was shown to block propagation of tau pathology and improve cognition in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.

The amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests the appearance of tau pathology is downstream from the deposition of amyloid-β plaques. This hypothesis is supported both by findings that mutations increasing amyloid-β are sufficient to produce a genetic form of Alzheimer's disease, characterized by the presence of both neuritic plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, whereas mutations increasing tau may result in dementia, but do not produce an Alzheimer's disease clinical or neuropathological phenotype. It is also supported by CSF biomarker data suggesting changes in CSF amyloid-β can be observed earlier in the disease course than changes in CSF tau. More recently it has been suggested that tau and amyloid-β pathology may develop independently and that amyloid-β may accelerate pre-existing tau pathology. This hypothesis is supported both by clinical and pathological observations that tau aggregates may be found in ageing individuals in the absence of amyloid-β and may itself produce mild amnestic cognitive changes (a phenomenon dubbed a primary age-related tauopathy, PART). Further, numerous experiments show in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo manipulations that increase amyloid-β load enhance or enable both production and spread of tau pathology. Thus, an understanding of the interaction of tau and amyloid-β in Alzheimer's disease may be critical both to understanding the course of the disease and the development of effective therapies.

### Tau aggregation and its interplay with amyloid-β [^116zmERe]. Acta Neuropathologica (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Recent studies have demonstrated a strong interplay between soluble Aβ and tau in the AD pathocascade, prior to their deposition as plaques and NFTs, respectively, with tau acting downstream of Aβ. Consistent with this idea, anti-Aβ therapies have demonstrated the ability to reduce tau pathology in animal models of disease, and to some extent in clinical trials. It is too early to determine whether the reverse is true for anti-tau therapies. As we continue to learn more about the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD, novel therapeutic targets will be identified, which, when targeted as well, might enhance the effectiveness of current tau and Aβ therapeutics.

### Alzheimer's disease [^113aMzDY]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Research advances have enabled detailed understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of the hallmarks of the disease — ie, plaques, composed of amyloid beta (Abeta), and tangles, composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. However, as our knowledge increases so does our appreciation for the pathogenic complexity of the disorder. Familial Alzheimer's disease is a very rare autosomal dominant disease with early onset, caused by mutations in the amyloid precursor protein and presenilin genes, both linked to Abeta metabolism. By contrast with familial disease, sporadic Alzheimer's disease is very common with more than 15 million people affected worldwide. The cause of the sporadic form of the disease is unknown, probably because the disease is heterogeneous, caused by ageing in concert with a complex interaction of both genetic and environmental risk factors. This seminar reviews the key aspects of the disease, including epidemiology, genetics, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment, as well as recent developments and controversies.

### Epilepsy and amyloid: the plot thickens… so will the brain thin? [^114NohFF]. Epilepsy Currents (2025). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Persons with epilepsy are at risk of accelerated aging and cognitive decline. Longitudinal neuroimaging studies show accelerated patterns of atrophy, and epidemiologic studies indicate a fourfold increased risk of developing dementia. Studies of surgical specimens from epilepsy patients provided some clues with regard to the pathophysiology, showing elevated levels of amyloid beta and its precursor proteins. Similarly, rat models of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) exhibit activation of amyloidogenic pathways and tau hyperphosphorylation, similar to those seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This evidence suggests a close link between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative proteins amyloid and tau. We now know that this relationship consists of a vicious cycle with seizures begetting amyloid and tau, which in turn contribute to hyperexcitability.

To date, studies exploring this relationship have been limited to either surgical specimens or cohorts with late-onset epilepsy. The implications of this relationship for individuals with early onset epilepsy were previously unknown, which is where the two new studies of interest come in.

### Amyloid-β and tau: the trigger and bullet in Alzheimer disease… [^115xtRG5]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

The soluble building blocks of these structures are amyloid-β peptides for plaques and tau for tangles. Amyloid-β peptides are proteolytic fragments of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein, whereas tau is a brain-specific, axon-enriched microtubule-associated protein. The behavioral symptoms of AD correlate with the accumulation of plaques and tangles, and they are a direct consequence of the damage and destruction of synapses that mediate memory and cognition. mutant that causes frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism–17, plaque deposition in PDAPP mice, which overexpress the human APPV717F mutant that causes familial early-onset AD, and PS19: PDAPP hybrids revealed that the hybrids had accelerated tangle deposition, but plaque formation was unaffected. 7 Together, these studies demonstrated enhanced tau pathology caused by Aβ in the absence of any demonstrable effects on Aβ caused by excess mutant tau.

Thus, Aβ was concluded to function upstream of tau, albeit by pathways that remained to be defined. Evidence that tau pathology is not just an epiphenomenon of Aβ pathology, but instead that tau is required for Aβ toxicity in vivo, emerged from crossing tau knockout mice with hAPPJ20 mice that overexpress human APP containing 2 mutations, either of which causes familial early-onset AD on its own. Plaque accumulation in hybrid mice that were either tau null or contained 1 tau gene was identical to the parental APP strain that contained 2 tau genes. Remarkably, loss of either 1 or 2 tau genes protected hybrids against the learning and memory deficits and excitotoxicity characteristic of the parental APP strain. 8 These results imply that Aβ initiates a pathway that leads to tau-dependent synaptic dysfunction. Moreover, they raise the possibility that the cognitive and memory loss associated with AD can be prevented or decelerated by reducing the level of tau in the brain.

One protein that functionally connects Aβ to tau is fyn. This nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that positively regulates N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activity was recently shown to be targeted to postsynaptic sites in dendrites by tau, 10 which binds fyn directly. 18 Fyn was correctly targeted to dendrites in wild-type mice that expressed their endogenous tau genes, but not in otherwise identical mice that overexpressed a truncated tau that binds fyn and is excluded from dendrites or whose tau genes were eliminated.

### An agnostic reevaluation of the amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis: the role of APP homeostasis [^115reKc9]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To reassess the role of amyloid beta (Aβ) and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) system in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Background

APP is a cell adhesion molecule that has been highly conserved over the course of phylogeny that has critical roles in brain development, synaptic plasticity, and the brain's intrinsic immune system. The amyloid cascade hypothesis describes a relatively linear, deterministic sequence of events triggered by a gain of Aβ peptide fragment toxicity that results in neurodegeneration and cognitive loss, yet well designed immunotherapy and beta secretase inhibitor trials that have successfully targeted Aβ have failed to have any consistent effects on the steady decline of cognition.

New/Updated Hypothesis

Mutations of the APP and presenilin genes not only alter the ratio of longer to shorter Aβ fragments (resulting in a gain of Aβ toxicity), but also disrupt the normal homeostatic roles of their respective proteins. The evolutionary history, physiological importance, and complexity of the APP and presenilin systems, as well as other critical components including tau and apolipoprotein E (APOE) imply that altered function of such systems could have severe consequences that include but need not be limited to a gain of Aβ toxicity and would more generally result in altered homeostasis of APP-related functions.

Major Challenges Addressed By Our Hypothesis

Challenges that a loss of APP homeostasis addresses better than the more limited gain of Aβ toxicity model include the topographic mismatches between Aβ and tau pathology, the profile and chronology of cognitive and biomarker changes that precede the clinical expression of mild cognitive impairment and dementia, and the disappointments of Aβ targeted therapeutics among others.

Linkage To Other Major Theories

The importance of APP, α- and β-secretases, the presenilins and γ-secretase, as well as tau was recognized by the authors of the amyloid cascade hypothesis, and has since led multiple investigators to propose alternative, more balanced hypotheses including reduced homeostasis and frank loss-of-function of key components that include but go beyond the currently envisioned linear model of Aβ toxicity.

### Alzheimer disease pathology as a host response [^115LKUdW]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Identification of amyloid-beta and tau as the major protein components of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, respectively, led to an exponential increase in investigations of these proteins and their corresponding metabolic pathways in Alzheimer disease (AD). The presumptions inherent in most studies and in the dogma of the amyloid cascade concept are that these hallmark lesions in AD brains contain molecules that drive the disease process, and that the proteinaceous accumulations are themselves toxic. On the other hand, the lesions of AD are, by definition, end-stage, and their relationship to the clinical disease is inconsistent; this has long been known but, generally, has not been acknowledged until relatively recently. Some recent attempts to address the etiology and pathogenesis of AD discard the pathology and focus on the interplay between invisible toxic intermediates, that is, amyloid-beta oligomers and the synapse. The concept that the hallmark lesions may be nontoxic (something we have long suggested) is slowly gaining acceptance. We favor the interpretation that senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles represent a host response to an upstream pathophysiologic process, and that the therapeutic targeting of lesions, including toxic intermediates, will succeed only in the event that the host response is directly deleterious. Therefore, renewed efforts aimed at elucidating fundamental age-related processes such as oxidative stress and/or inflammatory mediators are warranted.

### APOE ε 4 potentiates the relationship between amyloid-β and tau pathologies [^116LiEPi]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The mechanisms by which APOEε4 imposes a genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease are not fully understood. While early work linked APOEε4 with both amyloid-β and tau pathologies, much of the focus of the role of APOEε4 has been in relation to amyloid-β. The APOEε4 allele is associated with increased production as well as diminished clearance of cerebral amyloid-β. Individuals with the APOEε4 genotype also demonstrate increased amyloid-β PET uptake, with amyloid positivity beginning earlier in life in APOEε4 carriers than noncarriers.

Together, these findings are interpreted to suggest that the mechanism through which the APOEε4 allele confers risk for Alzheimer's disease is by leading to increased cerebral amyloid-β burden, considered to be the central pathological event in Alzheimer's disease. However, recent work has demonstrated that the APOEε4 allele is also related to inflammation and neurodegeneration in mouse models, as well as faster disease progression in humans. Furthermore, previous observational studies have reported that the APOEε4 allele modifies the relationship between amyloid-β and cognitive decline, though the precise mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear.

Given its close association with cognitive deficits, aggregation of tau pathology presents a potential mechanism for APOEε4 modifying the relationship between amyloid-β and cognitive decline. While recent tau-PET studies have reported inconsistent effects of APOEε4 on tau-PET uptake, no studies have assessed whether APOEε4 potentiates the relationship between amyloid-β and tau pathologies. Thus, we aimed to determine if tau pathology depends on the synergistic interaction between APOEε4 and amyloid-β, rather than the sum of their independent effects. We hypothesize that APOEε4 synergistically interacts with amyloid-β to drive tau aggregation.

### Role of amyloid-β and tau proteins in Alzheimer's disease: confuting the amyloid cascade [^116zDqLy]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The "Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis" has dominated the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field in the last 25 years. It posits that the increase of amyloid-β (Aβ) is the key event in AD that triggers tau pathology followed by neuronal death and eventually, the disease. However, therapeutic approaches aimed at decreasing Aβ levels have so far failed, and tau-based clinical trials have not yet produced positive findings. This begs the question of whether the hypothesis is correct. Here we have examined literature on the role of Aβ and tau in synaptic dysfunction, memory loss, and seeding and spreading of AD, highlighting important parallelisms between the two proteins in all of these phenomena. We discuss novel findings showing binding of both Aβ and tau oligomers to amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP), and the requirement for the presence of this protein for both Aβ and tau to enter neurons and induce abnormal synaptic function and memory. Most importantly, we propose a novel view of AD pathogenesis in which extracellular oligomers of Aβ and tau act in parallel and upstream of AβPP. Such a view will call for a reconsideration of therapeutic approaches directed against Aβ and tau, paving the way to an increased interest toward AβPP, both for understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and elaborating new therapeutic strategies.

### The relationship of soluble tau species with Alzheimer's disease amyloid plaque removal and tau pathology [^112sURau]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The co‐development of effective Aβ‐plaque lowering therapies and methods for comprehensively measuring soluble tau proteins has provided the opportunity to validate recent natural history studies linking the two canonical pathologies of AD (Aβ‐plaques and tau tangles). Specifically, interventional studies like this provide key information to move from association to causal relationships. In this study, we assessed the effects of both Aβ‐plaque targeting and soluble Aβ‐monomer targeting therapies on multiple CSF tau biomarkers. Our findings clearly indicate that increased phosphorylation of specific regions of the tau protein correlate with Aβ‐PET in the setting of DIAD; they are temporally linked to the initial rise in Aβ‐PET and decrease as Aβ‐PET is pharmacologically reduced. In contrast, we confirmed the relationship between selected tau tangle‐related CSF tau biomarkers, particularly MTBR‐tau243 and p‐tau205, and tau PET, but not amyloid PET. These findings demonstrate that amyloid‐related CSF tau biomarkers phosphorylated at tau residues 181, 217, and 231 indicate the amount and change in amyloid plaques, while p‐tau205 and MTBR‐tau243 are biomarkers of tau NFT pathology measured by tau PET. The combination of biofluid and PET biomarkers of Aβ and tau, along with the selective Aβ‐plaque reduction from gantenerumab, provides strong experimental support for recent natural history studies that suggest state dependent tau changes in AD.

Pathology

Alzheimer's disease is characterised by progressive memory decline and deficits in at least one other cognitive domain that significantly impairs normal occupational and social function. Pathologically, in addition to neuronal and synaptic loss, the disease is defined by pathological hallmarks — namely, amyloid β accumulation as diffuse and neuritic plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the form of neurofibrillary tangles.

Amyloid β peptide was first sequenced in 1984 and later identified as the main component of neuritic plaques. Amyloid β is a product of the larger transmembrane amyloid precursor protein. Acting together, β-secretase and γ-secretase break down and slice amyloid precursor protein into smaller fragments. Amyloid β monomers are formed by backbone hydrogen bonds between their β strands. These monomers are prone to misfolding and are considered critical to the neurodegenerative process. The misfolded proteins trigger production of further misfolded proteins, which accumulate into aggregates or plaques.

Human genetic studies on autosomal dominant early onset familial Alzheimer's disease have shown that mutations in one of the three genes encoding amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1, or presenilin 2 result in increased production of amyloid β. Apolipoprotein E ɛ4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease. It increases the risk of the disease by three to four times in heterozygotes and by around 12 times in homozygotes. The apolipoprotein E ɛ4 allele has been shown to reduce the clearance, and increase the seeding, of amyloid β. These data from human genetic studies led to the hypothesis of the amyloid cascade. Evidence from transgenic amyloid β mouse models provided mechanistic support for the hypothesis, in which amyloid β accumulation is the critical initial step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid β triggers subsequent hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of tau protein, neuronal and synaptic loss, and, ultimately, results in clinical symptoms.

Additionally, Alzheimer's disease is a tauopathy as shown by abnormal levels of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The pathological aggregation of these proteins lead to neurofibrillary tangles. The non-pathological tau protein is involved in stabilising microtubules, which make up the cytoskeleton of the cell. When the tau protein is hyperphosphorylated, it induces the breakdown of microtubules and the formation of insoluble aggregates of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. In Alzheimer's disease, neurofibrillary tangles emerge from the internal brain structures to more distal regions — namely, from the transentorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and then the neocortex. Cognitive impairment is evident only after tau pathology manifests in the neocortex. In contrast to amyloid β, tau pathology has shown a strong correlation with declining cognitive performance based on longitudinal pathological and imaging studies.

### The amyloid-β pathway in Alzheimer's disease [^112YQ7bJ]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

The Toxicity of the Aβ Pathway

Biomarker-based studies conducted in EOAD and LOAD have shown a temporal sequence between incipient Aβ pathophysiology, spreading of Aβ aggregation species and plaques through brain areas, and eventually increase of tau and neurodegeneration-based biological signatures. Although no causal effect has been established between Aβ pathophysiology and AD-related pathophysiological changes taking place at different temporal scales, a body of experimental and in-human studies indicates that Aβ aggregation species may exert a permissive/facilitating role on other pathophysiological pathways and/or unfold synergistically with them.

Aβ pathophysiology and tauopathy

The spatial-temporal relationship between the Aβ pathway and tau pathophysiology in AD, at both the molecular and macroscale, is critical to understanding AD pathogenesis and pathophysiological progression, and has gained momentum recently with the validation of several biomarkers charting different biological levels. The currently most accepted model indicates that Aβ pathophysiology may be an upstream pathophysiological event in AD and may function as a trigger/facilitator of downstream molecular pathways, including tau misfolding, tau-mediated toxicity, accumulation in tangles, and tau spreading that leads to cortical neurodegeneration (see Fig. 5). Genetic studies support biomarker-based observations and experimental studies which indicate a temporal Aβ–tau synergy where there is a pathophysiological sequence between aggregation of Aβ and tau-mediated toxicity.

### Tau aggregation and its interplay with amyloid-β [^116s6FSu]. Acta Neuropathologica (2015). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the formation of insoluble protein aggregates as well as the loss of neurons and synapses. This causes a progressive decline in memory and other cognitive functions that ultimately results in dementia; however, the processes leading to protein aggregation and neurodegeneration are only incompletely understood. AD was first described in 1907 by Alois Alzheimer who reported two pathological hallmarks in the brain: amyloid plaques in the extracellular milieu and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) within neurons. It was not until eight decades later that the major proteinaceous components of these lesions were identified. Amyloid plaques consist primarily of aggregates of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), whereas the main constituent of neurofibrillary tangles is the protein tau in a hyperphosphorylated form. To this day, Aβ and tau remain the major therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD.

According to the 2010 World Alzheimer Report, it is estimated that there are presently 35.6 million people living with AD and related disorders, and this figure is expected to increase to 115 million by 2050 due to an increasingly aged population. As current treatments are purely for modest symptomatic relief, there is an urgent need for an effective therapeutic for the disease.

### Tau aggregation and its interplay with amyloid-β [^115zDZne]. Acta Neuropathologica (2015). Low credibility.

Neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques constitute the hallmark brain lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Tangles are composed of fibrillar aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau, and plaques comprise fibrillar forms of a proteolytic cleavage product, amyloid-β (Aβ). Although plaques and tangles are the end-stage lesions in AD, small oligomers of Aβ and tau are now receiving increased attention as they are shown to correlate best with neurotoxicity. One key question of debate, however, is which of these pathologies appears first and hence is upstream in the pathocascade. Studies suggest that there is an intense crosstalk between the two molecules and, based on work in animal models, there is increasing evidence that Aβ, at least in part, exerts its toxicity via tau, with the Src kinase Fyn playing a crucial role in this process. In other experimental paradigms, Aβ and tau have been found to exert both separate and synergistic modes of toxicity. The challenge, however, is to integrate these different scenarios into a coherent picture. Furthermore, the ability of therapeutic interventions targeting just one of these molecules, to successfully neutralize the toxicity of the other, needs to be ascertained to improve current therapeutic strategies, such as immunotherapy, for the treatment of AD. Although this article is not intended to provide a comprehensive review of the currently pursued therapeutic strategies, we will discuss what has been achieved by immunotherapy and, in particular, how the inherent limitations of this approach can possibly be overcome by novel strategies that involve single-chain antibodies.

### Current thinking on the mechanistic basis of Alzheimer's and implications for drug development [^117RSzL4]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by the aggregation and accumulation of two proteins in the brain, amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau. Aβ and tau begin to buildup 15–20 years before the clinical onset of AD dementia. Increasing evidence suggests that preventing or decreasing the amount of aggregated forms of both Aβ and tau in the brain can serve as potential disease-modifying treatments for AD.

### The unexpected role of a β 1–42 monomers in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease [^116ER9Sx]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) has been proposed as a biomarker and a drug target for the therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The neurotoxic entity and relevance of each conformational form of Aβ to AD pathology is still under debate; Aβ oligomers are considered the major killer form of the peptide whereas monomers have been proposed to be involved in physiological process. Here we reviewed some different effects mediated by monomers and oligomers on mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis such as autophagy and tau aggregation. Data reported in this review demonstrate that Aβ monomers could have a major role in sustaining the pathogenesis of AD and that AD therapy should be focused not only in the removal of oligomers but also of monomers.

### Questions concerning the role of amyloid-β in the definition, aetiology and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease [^112cPWK3]. Acta Neuropathologica (2018). Low credibility.

How can the relatively poor spatial correlation of amyloid plaques to NFTs, synapse loss and neurodegeneration be explained in a theory maintaining amyloid is primary in aetiology? One theory, with growing support, holds that Aβ deposition may trigger prion-like seeding and propagation of tau pathology in functionally connected areas. However, the spreading of aggregated tau does not necessarily require the presence of amyloid deposits, and tau may enhance the deposition and toxicity of Aβ. Theoretically AD could begin through self-propagation of Aβ aggregates via a prion-like seeding mechanism, followed by propagation of disease through the aforementioned mechanisms (e.g. Aβ could be the 'trigger' and tau the 'bullet'). Other possible explanations are discussed in Supplementary Material 1.3.

Several caveats accompany theories seeking to explain Aβ's role in these complex ways. Most involve Aβ pathology appearing before other AD-associated pathologies, which is not yet definitive (see next section). Additionally, much of the debate has shifted to the relationship of soluble oligomeric Aβ and tau to disease, rather than insoluble species, questioning the aetiological relevance of insoluble protein deposits. As mentioned earlier, theories regarding soluble Aβ and tau await a better understanding of their nature in vivo. Otherwise, a major caveat is the lack of in vivo investigation of other possible markers of the clinical AD phenotype, beyond Aβ and tau. We discuss promising alternatives below and under Question 4.

We also note that Aβ deposition occurs in the cerebrovasculature (cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)) as well as in the brain parenchyma. CAA is present in up to 85–95% of individuals with AD, with 25% of AD brains having moderate-to-severe CAA. Importantly, some cortical atrophy in AD may be a consequence of CAA, suggesting CAA may be an independent contributor to cognitive and pathological alterations in AD, despite it often being left out of the aetiological discussion. CAA is discussed in more detail in Supplementary Material 1.3.

### The existence of primary age-related tauopathy suggests that not all the cases with early braak stages of neurofibrillary pathology are Alzheimer's disease [^114P7KZa]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

The distinction between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Primary Age-Related Tauopathy (PART) is a hotly debated issue. As most lines of evidence support the tenet that tau pathology occurs downstream of amyloid-β deposition, it seems reasonable to consider PART as a separate disease process not necessarily related to Aβ and hence AD. Following this view, the early stages of neurofibrillary pathology may not always be the forerunner of diffuse neurofibrillary changes and AD. The ongoing debate further enhances the need for greater caution against any future predictions using tau cerebrospinal fluid and imaging biomarkers.

### Imaging tau and amyloid-β proteinopathies in Alzheimer disease and other conditions [^116srW5S]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Most neurodegenerative disorders are associated with aggregated protein deposits. In the case of Alzheimer disease (AD), extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles are the two neuropathological hallmarks of the disease. Aβ-PET imaging has already been approved for clinical use and is being used in clinical trials of anti-Aβ therapies both for patient recruitment and as an outcome measure. These studies have shown that Aβ accumulation is a protracted process that can extend for more than 2 decades before the onset of clinical AD. This Review describes how in vivo brain imaging of Aβ pathology has revolutionized the evaluation of patients with clinical AD by providing robust and reproducible statements of global or regional brain Aβ burden and enabling the monitoring of disease progression. The role of selective tau imaging is discussed, focusing on how longitudinal tau and Aβ imaging studies might reveal the various effects (sequential and/or parallel, independent and/or synergistic) of these proteins on progression, cognition and other disease-specific biomarkers of neurodegeneration. Finally, imaging studies are discussed in the context of elucidating the respective roles of Aβ and tau in AD and in advancing our understanding of the relationship and/or interplay between these two proteinopathies.

### Correlation between elevated levels of amyloid β-peptide in the brain and cognitive decline… [^113fURDS]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Context Alzheimer disease is characterized neuropathologically by the presence of amyloid β-peptide –containing plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of abnormal tau protein. Considerable controversy exists as to whether the extent of accumulation of Aβ correlates with dementia and whether Aβ alterations precede or follow changes in tau. cognitive decline. Of particular interest, in the frontal cortex, Aβ was elevated before the occurrence of significant tau pathology. These results support an important role for Aβ in mediating initial pathogenic events in AD dementia and suggest that treatment strategies targeting the formation, accumulation, or cytotoxic effects of Aβ should be pursued. distinguishing feature of AD. Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of tau, a protein involved in microtubule formation. 7 By the use of conformation- and phosphorylation-sensitive antibodies, it has been demonstrated that the tau in NFTs is abnormally folded and phosphorylated.

Changes in the conformation and phosphorylation of tau are early events in. neurofibrillary lesions and result in a loss of the microtubule-binding properties of tau. 7 The connection between cognitive impairment and observed neuropathology associated with AD is a key issue in defining the molecular mechanisms responsible for functional loss. The role of different pathogenic molecules, such as Aβ. and clinical criteria for definite AD, 20 and levels of both peptides were robustly increased in definite AD cases compared with elderly controls without dementia.

The mean level of Aβx-40 was higher in the group with neuritic MC1 staining;. however, the increase reached statistical significance only in the group with fully developed tau pathology. It appears then, at least in the frontal cortex, that increases in both Aβ peptides, and in particular Aβx-42, precede the formation of the other main lesion in AD, the NFT, and these increases occur before clinical AD criteria are.

Question 4: Is the temporal appearance of Aβ pathology the first biological sign of disease onset?

Answer: It is not yet conclusive that Aβ pathology is the first putative AD biomarker to emerge along the disease 'continuum'

A widely held idea has been that anti-Aβ clinical trials have failed simply because treatments were commenced too late in the disease process. The conceptual development of 'preclinical' and 'prodromal ' states of AD has been a significant step forward in aiming to overcome this limitation. The hunt has therefore been on to identify biomarkers capable of predicting disease development during these early phases. Much of the focus has been on Aβ, which makes sense if looking to target Aβ removal early in the disease process. However, as discussed below, this has come at the cost of meaningful focus on what other biomarkers may objectively predict cognitive decline.

The most prominently tested markers to date include CSF Aβ measurements (as proxies for cerebral Aβ deposition), cerebral PET amyloid imaging, CSF total and phosphorylated tau measurements (as proxy markers of cerebral NFTs), cerebral metabolism using FDG PET (as a proxy marker of neuronal activity) and measurements of cerebral atrophy using MRI. A framework for the temporal sequence of these putative AD biomarkers has been proposed and novel data are often compared to it. This hypothetical sequence predicts the appearance of Aβ pathology precedes other AD-associated pathologies. The validity of this hypothesis is assessed below.

Is Aβ pathology the first biomarker to become abnormal in autosomal dominant AD mutation carriers?

Carriers of autosomal dominant AD mutations (in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2) provide a useful group to test hypothetical biomarker sequences. Nevertheless, despite suggestions these populations have provide support for hypothetical models (that amyloid biomarkers become abnormal first), the raw data can be unconvincing. For instance, the case was made that increased CSF Aβ42 levels are present up to 30 years in advance of clinical onset in mutation carriers, and then begin declining 25 years prior, preceding changes in other biomarkers. However, although showing a trend, CSF Aβ42 levels were not statistically different compared to non-carriers at these time points. Instead, statistically significant changes occurred just 10 years before predicted onset, temporally after statistically significant changes in CSF tau, hippocampal volume, cerebral Aβ deposition and plasma Aβ at 15 years prior. A follow-up study again found statistically significant differences in CSF Aβ42 (at 10 years prior to predicted onset) were preceded by changes in other CSF markers including tau markers and a neuronal death marker VILIP-1.

### Genetically identical twin-pair difference models support the amyloid cascade hypothesis [^1164Pvok]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The amyloid cascade hypothesis has provided the leading framework for investigating and understanding Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. This hypothesis has been modified several times but the basic premise is that the deposition of amyloid-β in the brain initiates a cascade of downstream events, which includes the aggregation of hyper-phosphorylated tau in the neocortex, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss and eventually cognitive impairment and dementia. In vivo support for this hypothesis has come from studies on participants with autosomal dominant mutations in genes involved in amyloid-β metabolism leading to familial Alzheimer's disease, as well as from prospective cohort studies on sporadic Alzheimer's disease, showing a temporal emergence of biomarker abnormality in line with the amyloid cascade sequence. For example, whereas it is relatively common to observe amyloid-β pathology in the absence of neocortical tau pathology, it is rare to observe neocortical tau pathology in the absence of amyloid-β pathology. However, although the amyloid cascade hypothesis has strongly impacted the research agenda and clinical trial designs over the past decades, precisely how amyloid-β deposition initiates hyperphosphorylation of neocortical tau pathology remains unclear. The association between amyloid-β and tau is further complicated by both a spatial and temporal paradox. Whereas amyloid-β is often observed first in posterior cingulate and orbitofrontal regions ∼20 years before symptom onset, tau neurofibrillary tangles are first observed in the (trans)entorhinal cortex and the spread of tau outside of the medial temporal lobe occurs in close proximity to symptom onset. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility of a shared upstream process simultaneously driving amyloid-β and tau in an independent (yet correlated) manner instead of there being a causal relationship between amyloid-β and tau. Previous studies have suggested several biological pathways, including cholesterol metabolism, microglial immune activation and apolipoprotein E (APOE), which may drive both amyloid-β and tau pathology through shared but independent pathways. Moreover, we have previously shown that genetically identical twins show substantial similarities in both amyloid-β load and tau load, and therefore some genetic factors that influence amyloid-β may overlap with the genetic factors that also, independently, influence tau, which could potentially result in an association between amyloid-β and tau that is actually confounded by genetic variation. Gaining a better understanding into whether the relationships between key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease may actually be causal (as suggested by the amyloid cascade hypothesis) is of utmost importance for clinical trial designs.

### Path from discovery to recovery: therapeutic and diagnostic advances in Alzheimer's dementia [^113QQzWj]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cumulative memory loss, cognitive decline and maladaptive behaviour. Despite being a leading cause of death, it has no currently widely available treatment to prevent, slow or stop disease progression. It has been estimated that the number of people expected to die from AD is predicted to quadruple by 2040 unless there are advances in clinically meaningful diagnostic and therapeutic discoveries.

An initial theory on the underlying pathogenesis of AD was proposed by Alois Alzheimer in 1906, and is known as "the amyloid cascade hypothesis". It proposes that beta-amyloid plaques outside of neurons not only act as neurotoxins but also trigger abnormal phosphorylation and aggregation of tau proteins, which form neurofibrillary tangles inside neurons. The combined effect of those two deposits ultimately leads to neurodegeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. Over the last 3 decades, researchers have focussed on pharmacological therapies that target beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein, albeit without much success. Developing a clinically meaningful therapy has been challenging for several reasons including; flawed timing of intervention in the AD Continuum, inadequate target engagement within the blood–brain barrier, the complexity of the underlying pathogenesis, lack of universally acceptable study design, patient selection and safety concerns. However, despite these delays and difficulties, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved Aducanumab, the first disease-modifying therapy for AD.

In this month's journal club, we review two recent clinical trials that target beta-amyloid plaques and Tau protein in early AD. In addition, we discuss a report of novel imaging methodology that may allow the identification of processes that precede neuronal death and therefore offer possibilities for very early diagnosis.

### The relationship of soluble tau species with Alzheimer's disease amyloid plaque removal and tau pathology [^115xSicg]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiple natural history studies of DIAD and sAD, have identified correlations between the development of Aβ‐pathology and the increase in multiple CSF phospho‐tau levels, particularly p‐tau217 and p‐tau231. Likewise, Aβ‐lowering immunotherapy trials in sAD have demonstrated decreases in plasma measurements of p‐tau181 and 217, in parallel with reductions in Aβ‐PET. Our current results, along Aβ‐plaque lowering trials in sAD, validate increases in p‐tau217 as a marker of Aβ‐plaque pathology as measured by PET. Although this does not mechanistically prove Aβ‐plaques cause the elevation of amyloid‐related CSF tau biomarkers, the unique association of these changes of p‐tau in AD and not other proteinopathies, the temporal links with Aβ‐plaque changes, and now the clear associations with an intervention that lowers Aβ‐plaques, but not tau NFTs, provides strong validation for a direct link of these initial stage CSF p‐tau measures and amyloid plaques. Our findings of a consistent negative association between the rate of change of amyloid‐related tau biomarkers and tau PET, Figure 3, reinforces the distinction between the tau biomarkers that first emerge with Aβ‐plaques and respond to therapies that lowers Aβ‐plaques but have minimal effect on tau PET. The difference in the magnitude of the negative associations of the amyloid related tau biomarkers may reflect differences in the concentrations, and thus variability, and/or could also reflect differences how these biomarkers change with NFTs. There is increasing evidence that pT217 has a more dynamic relationship based on the stage of disease ‐i.e. early elevation with Aβ‐plaques, but a greater association with tau PET at later stages of disease.

1 INTRODUCTION

What causes Alzheimer's disease (AD)? Theories regarding the etiology of the common, late‐onset, sporadic form of AD vary greatly, based in part on the very different methods used to probe the disease. Although evidence of both extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is needed to officially diagnose AD, there are longstanding arguments about which of these initiates the pathology, for example, with the genetics of autosomal dominant AD favoring the amyloid hypothesis, whereby the initial creation of Aβ 42 peptides subsequently "drives" tau pathology and neuronal degeneration, while the perspective from neuropathological studies of sporadic AD (sAD) document tau inclusions a decade before the appearance of amyloid deposition, countering this view. The current review aims to integrate multiple perspectives on AD etiology from divergent methodologies, including new data from fluid biomarkers and macaque models that are transforming our understanding of the earliest stages of sAD pathology.

The Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis as a Framework for Therapeutic Development in Alzheimer's Disease

The predominant mechanistic model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has emerged from the key observation that amyloid plaques are a constant neuropathological feature of the disease, as originally described by Alzheimer in early-onset cases and by Fischer in late-onset cases. Alzheimer and Fischer were careful not to attribute amyloid plaques a definitive causative role in the neurodegenerative process underlying the dementia cases they described. A notion that amyloid plaques cause AD emerged in the 1960s, after the rediscovery of their work, modern neuropathological studies at the time, and the recognition that cases of early and late-onset dementia both feature amyloid plaques neuropathology. This notion positioned amyloid plaques as a logical target for experimental therapies in AD. Although amyloid plaques may or may not be viewed as the ultimate cause of AD, preclinical studies and longitudinal clinical investigations have provided undisputable evidence that amyloid β 1–42 (Aβ) accumulation is a key early pathophysiological event in AD, in great part supported by the introduction of brain amyloid imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). The "amyloid cascade hypothesis" poses that Aβ accumulation is a central early pathogenic event in AD and leads to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment through its induction of aberrant accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. According to its original conception, a high rate of Aβ accumulation disrupts calcium homeostasis and induces tau hyperphosphorylation, which is highly neurotoxic and forms paired helical filaments that accumulate in the form of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles. In 2018, an NIH/NIA-commissioned working group led by experts in the field of AD experimental therapeutics introduced a contemporary view of the "amyloid cascade hypothesis", in which Aβ accumulation occurs slowly over years, which helps to explain the presence of Aβ without degeneration or cognitive impairment, as surprisingly found in early PET amyloid imaging studies in humans. This allows understanding AD as a sequential pathobiological process, not equivalent to a clinical syndrome or a neuropathological state. Thus, this contemporary view of the "amyloid cascade hypothesis" constitutes a pragmatic theoretical framework to maximize the chances of successfully identifying effective disease-modifying therapies, amenable to use even in prodromal or pre-symptomatic stages (Fig. 1). This view aligns with current available data, but alternate hypotheses of neurodegeneration in AD, in which amyloid an/or tau do not play a significant pathobiological role are possible.

### Amyloid-β and tau complexity-towards improved biomarkers and targeted therapies [^1174ncey]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Most neurodegenerative diseases are proteinopathies, which are characterized by the aggregation of misfolded proteins. Although many proteins have an intrinsic propensity to aggregate, particularly when cellular clearance systems start to fail in the context of ageing, only a few form fibrillar aggregates. In Alzheimer disease, the peptide amyloid-β (Aβ) and the protein tau aggregate to form plaques and tangles, respectively, which comprise the histopathological hallmarks of this disease. This Review discusses the complexity of Aβ biogenesis, trafficking, post-translational modifications and aggregation states. Tau and its various isoforms, which are subject to a vast array of post-translational modifications, are also explored. The methodological advances that revealed this complexity are described. Finally, the toxic effects of distinct species of tau and Aβ are discussed, as well as the concept of protein 'strains', and how this knowledge can facilitate the development of early disease biomarkers for stratifying patients and validating new therapies. By targeting distinct species of Aβ and tau for therapeutic intervention, the way might be paved for personalized medicine and more-targeted treatment strategies.

### Three dimensions of the amyloid hypothesis: time, space and' wingmen' [^114XSZkz]. Nature Neuroscience (2015). Medium credibility.

The amyloid hypothesis, which has been the predominant framework for research in Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been the source of considerable controversy. The amyloid hypothesis postulates that amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) is the causative agent in AD. It is strongly supported by data from rare autosomal dominant forms of AD. However, the evidence that Aβ causes or contributes to age-associated sporadic AD is more complex and less clear, prompting criticism of the hypothesis. We provide an overview of the major arguments for and against the amyloid hypothesis. We conclude that Aβ likely is the key initiator of a complex pathogenic cascade that causes AD. However, we argue that Aβ acts primarily as a trigger of other downstream processes, particularly tau aggregation, which mediate neurodegeneration. Aβ appears to be necessary, but not sufficient, to cause AD. Its major pathogenic effects may occur very early in the disease process.

### Amyloid-beta, tau, and dementia [^1175scPy]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized as a progressive dementia starting with memory dysfunction and characterized pathologically as neurodegeneration accompanied by deposition of amyloid-beta, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. AD research has endeavored to explain the clinical symptoms of AD through pathological changes and to develop various therapies for AD. Fulfillment of these goals, however, remains on the horizon. In this article, I review the relationship between neuropathological changes that occur in the brain and clinical progression of AD, and propose a hypothesis that brain aging, characterized by neurofibrillary tangles in entorhinal cortex, is pre-requisite for development of AD.

### Hypothesis: tau pathology is an initiating factor in sporadic Alzheimer's disease [^1176Nbxg]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Medium credibility.

2 BACKGROUND

2.1 Historical evolution

The amyloid hypothesis has dominated the AD field and is based largely on the persuasive genetics of autosomal dominant AD and corroborative data from genetic mouse models, positing that Aβ accumulation initiates and drives the tau pathology, which disables and ultimately kills affected neurons. 1 This linear relationship, with Aβ as the trigger and tau the bullet, is compellingly simple and is likely true for some genetic forms of AD. However, there are important findings that disagree with this hypothesis, 2 including extensive neuropathological data from sAD brains, 3 as well as the limited success of anti‐amyloid treatments in sAD, 4 and thus there is now a search for additional etiological factors and therapeutic targets. 4

2.2 Rationale

Tau pathology accumulates intracellularly, as hyperphosphorylated tau fibrillates into the paired helical filaments that form neurofibrillary tangles, ultimately killing the neuron. In contrast, Aβps accumulate extracellularly from the aggregation and fibrillation of Aβ peptides that are released from neurons into the extracellular space.

Analyses of large numbers of human brains across the lifespan show that tau pathology begins about a decade before formation of Aβps (Figure 1). 3 The discovery of a woman with a rare, combined PS1/Christchurch apoE3 mutation, who did not develop dementia despite extensive formation of Aβps — but little tau pathology — reinforces the growing notion that abnormal tau may be a key etiological factor. 5 In addition, tau pathology, but not Aβ, correlates with progressive gray matter loss 6 and cognitive impairment. 7 Importantly, tau pathology exhibits a highly selective pattern and sequence of disease progression (Figure 2). 8

### Revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease: Alzheimer's association workgroup [^1113WAn5]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

Alzheimer's Association revised diagnostic and staging criteria — highlights define Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a biological process that begins with the appearance of AD neuropathologic change (ADNPC) while people are asymptomatic, with progression of the neuropathologic burden leading to later clinical symptoms. Early-changing Core 1 biomarkers, including amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), approved cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and accurate plasma biomarkers (especially phosphorylated tau 217), map onto either the amyloid beta or AD tauopathy pathway, and these are not tests of the presence of ADNPC more generally. An abnormal Core 1 biomarker result is sufficient to establish a diagnosis of AD and to inform clinical decision making throughout the disease continuum. Later-changing Core 2 biomarkers (biofluid and tau PET) can provide prognostic information and, when abnormal, will increase confidence that AD is contributing to symptoms. An integrated biological and clinical staging scheme is described that accommodates the fact that common comorbid pathologies, cognitive reserve, and resistance may modify relationships between clinical and biological AD stages, and the criteria are not intended to provide step-by-step clinical practice guidelines but rather serve as general principles to inform diagnosis and staging of AD.

### The amyloid cascade hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease: an appraisal for the development of therapeutics [^112a5NEs]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2011). Medium credibility.

The amyloid cascade hypothesis, which posits that the deposition of the amyloid-β peptide in the brain is a central event in Alzheimer's disease pathology, has dominated research for the past twenty years. Several therapeutics that were purported to reduce amyloid-β production or aggregation have failed in Phase III clinical testing, and many others are in various stages of development. Therefore, it is timely to review the science underpinning the amyloid cascade hypothesis, consider what type of clinical trials will constitute a valid test of this hypothesis and explore whether amyloid-β-directed therapeutics will provide the medicines that are urgently needed by society for treating this devastating disease.

### Tau aggregation and its interplay with amyloid-β [^115xBzim]. Acta Neuropathologica (2015). Low credibility.

Neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques constitute the hallmark brain lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Tangles are composed of fibrillar aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau, and plaques comprise fibrillar forms of a proteolytic cleavage product, amyloid-β (Aβ). Although plaques and tangles are the end-stage lesions in AD, small oligomers of Aβ and tau are now receiving increased attention as they are shown to correlate best with neurotoxicity. One key question of debate, however, is which of these pathologies appears first and hence is upstream in the pathocascade. Studies suggest that there is an intense crosstalk between the two molecules and, based on work in animal models, there is increasing evidence that Aβ, at least in part, exerts its toxicity via tau, with the Src kinase Fyn playing a crucial role in this process. In other experimental paradigms, Aβ and tau have been found to exert both separate and synergistic modes of toxicity. The challenge, however, is to integrate these different scenarios into a coherent picture. Furthermore, the ability of therapeutic interventions targeting just one of these molecules, to successfully neutralize the toxicity of the other, needs to be ascertained to improve current therapeutic strategies, such as immunotherapy, for the treatment of AD. Although this article is not intended to provide a comprehensive review of the currently pursued therapeutic strategies, we will discuss what has been achieved by immunotherapy and, in particular, how the inherent limitations of this approach can possibly be overcome by novel strategies that involve single-chain antibodies.

Alzheimer's disease is a neuropsychiatric disorder with devastating clinical and socioeconomic consequences. Since the original description of the neuropathological correlates of the disorder, neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles have been presumed to be critical to the underlying pathophysiology of the illness. The authors review the clinical and neuropathological origins of Alzheimer's disease and trace the evolution of modern biomarkers from their historical roots. They describe how technological innovations such as neuroimaging and biochemical assays have been used to measure and quantify key proteins and lipids in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood and advance their role as biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. Together with genomics, these approaches have led to the development of a thematic and focused science in the area of degenerative disorders. The authors conclude by drawing distinctions between legitimate biomarkers of disease and molecular targets for therapeutic intervention and discuss future approaches to this complex neurobehavioral illness.

### Alzheimer disease therapy – moving from amyloid-β to tau [^112enUsm]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer disease (AD) have focused mainly on reducing levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain. Some compounds have achieved this goal, but none has produced clinically meaningful results. Several methodological issues relating to clinical trials of these agents might explain this failure; an additional consideration is that the amyloid cascade hypothesis — which places amyloid plaques at the heart of AD pathogenesis — does not fully integrate a large body of data relevant to the emergence of clinical AD. Importantly, amyloid deposition is not strongly correlated with cognition in multivariate analyses, unlike hyperphosphorylated tau, neurofibrillary tangles, and synaptic and neuronal loss, which are closely associated with memory deficits. Targeting tau pathology, therefore, might be more clinically effective than Aβ-directed therapies. Furthermore, numerous immunization studies in animal models indicate that reduction of intracellular levels of tau and phosphorylated tau is possible, and is associated with improved cognitive performance. Several tau-related vaccines are in advanced preclinical stages and will soon enter clinical trials. In this article, we present a critical analysis of the failure of Aβ-directed therapies, discuss limitations of the amyloid cascade hypothesis, and suggest the potential value of tau-targeted therapy for AD.

### The relationship of soluble tau species with Alzheimer's disease amyloid plaque removal and tau pathology [^11486jq1]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Recent studies in dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD) and sporadic AD (sAD) suggest a sequence of changes in CSF and blood tau‐related measures that correlate with and bridge Aβ‐plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathologies. Relatively early increased phosphorylation of three specific sites (217, 231, and 181) correlates with Aβ‐PET positivity, followed after by increased phosphorylation of site 205 before symptom onset; later, levels of the microtubule binding region tau 243 fragment (MTBR‐tau243) and non‐phosphorylated tau increase near the time of clinical symptom onset, in parallel with tau‐PET signal increases.,

The initial rise of soluble phospho‐tau, decades before the expected onset of clinical symptoms and years before substantial neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are present, has generated uncertainty about the clinical and pathological meaning of the initial phospho‐tau species. Soluble p‐tau217, p‐tau231 and p‐tau181 species seem to correlate more closely with Aβ‐plaque pathology than with hyperphosphorylated NFT pathology. Related to this, Aβ‐plaque‐lowering therapies appear to reduce levels of some blood and CSF phospho‐tau species. Clearly, natural history and interventional studies suggest causal links between the increase in certain soluble phospho‐tau measures and Aβ‐plaque pathology. However, a comprehensive assessment of soluble phospho‐tau levels before and after removing aggregated Aβ is needed to validate which phospho‐tau isoforms are markers of Aβ‐plaque pathology vs. tau tangle pathology.

### Comparison of tau species with amyloid and tau PET, neurodegeneration, vascular, and cognitive outcomes… [^113Le91y]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Correlations across platforms were lower, with MSD p-tau217 and Simoa p-tau231 being lowest. This correlation was significantly lower than all correlations, with the exception of the correlation between MSD p-tau217 and Simoa p-tau181. Spearman correlations between each of the plasma p-tau measures and amyloid and tau PET are shown in Figure

1. MSD p-tau217 had the highest correlation and p-tau231 the lowest with amyloid PET. In direct comparisons, the correlation between Simoa p-tau 231 and amyloid PET was significantly lower than the correlations between MSD p-tau181 and amyloid PET and MSD p-tau 217 and amyloid PET, while all other correlation comparisons did not significantly differ. Overall, there were significant differences among all p-tau measures by amyloid and tau status.

In amyloid- and tau-positive participants, compared with amyloid-positive participants, the median Simoa p-tau181 was 40% higher, MSD p-tau181 was 43% higher, MSD p-tau217 was 57% higher, and Simoa p-tau231 was 25% higher. Each of the 4 p-tau measure was significantly higher in amyloid- and tau-positive participants than amyloid-positive participants. Increasing levels of Simoa p-tau181, MSD p-tau181, and MSD p-tau217, but not Simoa p-tau231, were significantly associated with higher WMH volumes and lower FA-Genu. MSD p-tau181 and p-tau217 were most strongly associated with amyloid PET SUVR and FA-HCB. -negative CU patients and amyloid-positive patients with AD were almost 4-fold higher, whereas other p-tau181 assays have historically shown only 2-fold higher results. 2 In this study, the difference in anti-tau antibody epitopes for the p-tau181 assays may contribute to the differences observed in the correlation analysis with p-tau217.

### Revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease: Alzheimer's association workgroup [^113H3VUb]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association convened three separate work groups in 2011 and single work groups in 2012 and 2018 to create recommendations for the diagnosis and characterization of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present document updates the 2018 research framework in response to several recent developments. Defining diseases biologically, rather than based on syndromic presentation, has long been standard in many areas of medicine (e.g., oncology), and is becoming a unifying concept common to all neurodegenerative diseases, not just AD. The present document is consistent with this principle. Our intent is to present objective criteria for diagnosis and staging AD, incorporating recent advances in biomarkers, to serve as a bridge between research and clinical care. These criteria are not intended to provide step-by-step clinical practice guidelines for clinical workflow or specific treatment protocols, but rather serve as general principles to inform diagnosis and staging of AD that reflect current science. HIGHLIGHTS: We define Alzheimer's disease (AD) to be a biological process that begins with the appearance of AD neuropathologic change (ADNPC) while people are asymptomatic. Progression of the neuropathologic burden leads to the later appearance and progression of clinical symptoms. Early-changing Core 1 biomarkers (amyloid positron emission tomography [PET], approved cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and accurate plasma biomarkers [especially phosphorylated tau 217]) map onto either the amyloid beta or AD tauopathy pathway; however, these reflect the presence of ADNPC more generally (i.e., both neuritic plaques and tangles). An abnormal Core 1 biomarker result is sufficient to establish a diagnosis of AD and to inform clinical decision making throughout the disease continuum. Later-changing Core 2 biomarkers (biofluid and tau PET) can provide prognostic information, and when abnormal, will increase confidence that AD is contributing to symptoms. An integrated biological and clinical staging scheme is described that accommodates the fact that common copathologies, cognitive reserve, and resistance may modify relationships between clinical and biological AD stages.

### Association of vascular risk factors with β-amyloid peptide and tau burdens… [^1169Ybv5]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures Principal analyses investigated associations of total, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and a combined vascular risk score with global β-amyloid peptide and entorhinal tau burden as measured by positron emission tomography. Potential moderating associations of use of vascular medications with these associations were examined. Secondary similar analyses considered cerebrospinal fluid Aβ1–42 and phosphorylated tau levels. Higher Framingham Coronary Risk Profile scores were associated with reduced tau burden among participants using vascular medications but not among participants not using vascular medications.

Conclusions and Relevance These findings corroborate previously reported associations of vascular risk factors with Aβ burden but not tau burden. However, these associations were found only among individuals who were not using vascular medications. These results suggest that medication use or other control of vascular risk factors should be considered in Alzheimer disease prevention trials. The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease include cerebral β-amyloid peptide plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau neurofibrillary tangles. Vascular risk factors, such as dyslipidemia and hypertension, are thought to modify AD risk by promoting both cardiovascular disease and Aβ accumulation. 1 While this dual vascular pathway hypothesis is attractive, results have been mixed.

A first-degree family history of AD is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk for AD, 18 making individuals with such a family history of AD ideal for studying mechanisms associated with AD at an asymptomatic stage, which is the optimal time for prevention. Our principal hypothesis was that an association between vascular risk factors and AD pathogenesis would be stronger among individuals who did not use any medications to treat vascular risk factors than in individuals using vascular medications. To test for the main association of vascular risk factors with AD brain pathogenesis as measured by Aβ or tau deposition, we performed multiple linear regression analyses in untreated and treated cohorts combined. Models included age, sex, vascular medication status, and time difference between vascular risk factor assessments and undergoing PET as covariates.

### An integrated view of the relationships between amyloid, tau, and inflammatory pathophysiology in Alzheimer's disease [^116yY9Ri]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

At the level of neuropathology, the PART hypothesis fails to acknowledge the implications of the early tau inclusions within the perforant path. Together with the hippocampal CA1 region and the subiculum as major sources of hippocampal output to specific subcortical nuclei and cortical association areas, the development of tau inclusions in the ERC and within the perforant path presages the coming deafferation of cortical input to the hippocampus in AD.

According to the PART hypothesis, "age‐related" NFTs in the medial temporal lobe that occur in the absence of Aβ deposition differ from AD‐related NFTs associated with Aβ deposition. At the molecular level, however, the intrinsic properties of tau aggregation are identical in the early and late NFT stages. At the structural level, the most potent evidence against the existence of PART as a distinct entity from AD has been provided by Shi et al.who demonstrated by electron cryo‐electron microscopy that tau filaments in three brains classified as PART shared the identical fold structure as those in the AD brain. This proves the AD tau fold can form in the absence of Aβ deposits. For example, tau hyperphosphorylation can also arise from inflammatory mechanisms that drive toxic calcium actions,(described in detail below), which likely plays a large role in pTau generation and seeding from the ERC in sporadic AD.

Initial plaque‐like deposits of fibrillated Aβ in the extracellular space usually appear in the inferior temporal neocortex in NFT stages II–IV (Aβ phase 1). During the pretangle stages a–c, 1a, 1b, NFT stage I, and frequently in NFT stages II–III, most tau inclusions develop in the absence of Aβ deposits (Figure 4C). Notably, fibrillated tau can be seen approximately a decade before there are any signs of Aβ deposition (Figure 3D), a finding that contradicts the hypothesis that Aβ 42 solely drives abnormal tau production. This "amyloid hypothesis" (AH) clearly is insufficient to explain the existence of the early tau inclusions. After Aβ ‐phase 1, the Aβ deposits rapidly increase in number and extend diffusely into the remaining cortical regions and then into diencephalic and mesencephalic regions, and finally the lower brainstem (Aβ phases 2–5). The pattern of Aβ deposition is consistent with the idea that Aβ may be released from the axons of tau‐afflicted neurons. It is likewise consonant with pTau seeding from the transentorhinal/entorhinal cortices through its excitatory connections to affect interconnected circuits, which then generate and release Aβ.

### A theoretical analysis of the synergy of amyloid and tau in Alzheimer's disease [^111Pyv61]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Amyloid plaques and Tau protein neurofibrillary tangles are considered the two most important pathogenic factors in Alzheimer's disease. The prevailing amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that amyloid-β (Aβ) elevation induces downstream Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal loss that ultimately results in cognitive impairment. Alternatively, the dual-pathway hypothesis suggests that Aβ and abnormal Tau are two independent factors that exert synergistic effects on synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. We hypothesize that the intrinsic interaction of Aβ and Tau would better predict cognitive impairment. Herein, we propose an Aβ-Tau interactive model based on a review of the medical literature, mathematic modeling, and analysis of our clinicopathological data.

### Mapping amyloid beta predictors of entorhinal tau in preclinical Alzheimer's disease [^112kzGdE]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, accounting for more than 50% of cases. The extracellular deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) and intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins stand as histopathological hallmarks of AD. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies illustrate that Aβ and tau spread systematically across the brain but exhibit distinctive propagation patterns. Aβ pathology spreads from the neocortex, particularly the medial frontal and parietal regions, to all cortex, limbic regions, and then brainstem and cerebellum. In contrast, tau pathology originates in the transentorhinal region in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and extends through limbic and association areas before reaching the primary regions.

The spatial–temporal relationship between the Aβ and tau plays a crucial role in comprehending the pathogenesis and progression of AD. The most accepted model suggests that Aβ pathophysiology initiates downstream events that could act as catalysts for subsequent molecular processes. These include tau misfolding, tau‐mediated toxicity, tangle formation, and the spread of tau, ultimately leading to cortical neurodegeneration. Cortical Aβ may create a permissive environment for the propagation of tau tangles from the MTL, which is closely linked to cognitive decline in AD. Evidence indicates that individuals with the highest levels of Aβ also exhibit elevated levels of tau. This idea is further supported by many studies showing the concomitant presence of Aβ and tau, rather than the presence of Aβ or tau in isolation, and is significantly associated with progression of AD, neurodegeneration, and subsequent cognitive decline. This suggests that the combination of Aβ and tau leads to a phenotype that is distinct from Aβ alone.

### Amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated tau synergy drives metabolic decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease [^117GbhxB]. Molecular Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

In addition to recent findings supporting the claim that the synergism between brain amyloidosis and neurodegeneration is associated with AD progression;, here we demonstrate that [18 F]florbetapir PET rather than CSF amyloid-β 1–42 — and CSF p-tau rather than total tau — better predict mesial temporal metabolic decline. The motivation to explore these effects using amyloid-PET in our study is derived from its close association with Aβ plaques load, whereas CSF total tau and p-tau may provide additional information regarding neurodegeneration and neurofibrillary tangles load, respectively. Therefore, our results support the concept that the interaction between brain amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles drives downstream neurodegeneration in early disease stages. In addition, the better prediction obtained with CSF p-tau as compared with total tau might be explained by the possible higher specificity of p-tau to AD pathophysiology. Although high concentrations of p-tau better characterize the AD pathological process, abnormal CSF total tau may be found in several brain disorders associated with axonal death and neuronal loss. Indeed, two previous studies conducted in ADNI participants also found that CSF p-tau, but not total tau, modulates the link between amyloid-β pathology and brain atrophy or cognitive decline. Although CSF amyloid-β 1–42 is considered an effective biomarker for representing disease status, direct measurements of brain amyloid-β deposition, as measured with amyloid-PET imaging, might be more strongly associated with eminent disease progression in early AD stages. Alternatively, the lack of association of CSF total tau and CSF amyloid-β 1–42 with metabolic decline may be due to the characteristics of the participants of the study population or the CSF assay.

### The amyloid-β pathway in Alzheimer's disease [^116GAoN8]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Breakthroughs in molecular medicine have positioned the amyloid-β (Aβ) pathway at the center of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. While the detailed molecular mechanisms of the pathway and the spatial-temporal dynamics leading to synaptic failure, neurodegeneration, and clinical onset are still under intense investigation, the established biochemical alterations of the Aβ cycle remain the core biological hallmark of AD and are promising targets for the development of disease-modifying therapies. Here, we systematically review and update the vast state-of-the-art literature of Aβ science with evidence from basic research studies to human genetic and multi-modal biomarker investigations, which supports a crucial role of Aβ pathway dyshomeostasis in AD pathophysiological dynamics. We discuss the evidence highlighting a differentiated interaction of distinct Aβ species with other AD-related biological mechanisms, such as tau-mediated, neuroimmune and inflammatory changes, as well as a neurochemical imbalance. Through the lens of the latest development of multimodal in vivo biomarkers of AD, this cross-disciplinary review examines the compelling hypothesis- and data-driven rationale for Aβ-targeting therapeutic strategies in development for the early treatment of AD.

### Hypothesis: tau pathology is an initiating factor in sporadic Alzheimer's disease [^1175Xs7f]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Medium credibility.

1 OBJECTIVE

Similarities between the autosomal dominant and sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease presume a shared etiology, but evidence indicates that sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) may have differing origins. We propose that tau pathology can be a key initiating factor in sAD and arises prior to the appearance of amyloid beta plaques (Aβps). This hypothesis rests on extensive neuropathological analyses of human brains across the lifespan and corroborating findings from non‐human primate models, where the earliest stages of tau pathology can be captured.
The etiology of the common, sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease (sAD) is not known
We hypothesize that tau pathology can initiate sAD in vulnerable neurons
Neuropathological data show that tau precedes amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition by ∼10 years
Monkey data show phosphorylated tau (pTau) trafficking early in association cortex
pTau traps amyloid precursor protein‐containing endosomes, which may increase Aβ and drive vicious cycles

### Tau aggregates: toxic, inert, or protective species? [^112zwZar]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease brains are characterized by extracellular aggregates of the amyloid-beta peptide and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, composed of aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The role of aggregated tau in neurodegeneration is still controversial, as evidence point to either a toxic or protective role in the disease. Here, we will first examine tau aggregation and its putative roles in Alzheimer's disease. We will then review the findings concerning different species of tau and their potential toxicity.

### The intersection of amyloid beta and tau at synapses in Alzheimer's disease [^116insi1]. Neuron (2014). Low credibility.

The collapse of neural networks important for memory and cognition, including death of neurons and degeneration of synapses, causes the debilitating dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We suggest that synaptic changes are central to the disease process. Amyloid beta and tau form fibrillar lesions that are the classical hallmarks of AD. Recent data indicate that both molecules may have normal roles at the synapse, and that the accumulation of soluble toxic forms of the proteins at the synapse may be on the critical path to neurodegeneration. Further, the march of neurofibrillary tangles through brain circuits appears to take advantage of recently described mechanisms of transsynaptic spread of pathological forms of tau. These two key phenomena, synapse loss and the spread of pathology through the brain via synapses, make it critical to understand the physiological and pathological roles of amyloid beta and tau at the synapse.

### Distinct manifestations of excitatory-inhibitory imbalance associated with amyloid-β and tau in patients with Alzheimer's disease [^113V8yqk]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Overwhelming evidence supports a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis requiring both amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau accumulation to provoke substantial cognitive decline. Aβ accumulation occurs early and involves much of the neocortex by the time the earliest neocortical tau is detected, subsequently followed by cognitive decline. Several recent fundamental discoveries have highlighted that excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) imbalance, among other critical cellular processes, plays an important intermediate pathogenic role in the early phase of AD, between Aβ accumulation and clinical disease. In AD mouse models, pathological forms of both Aβ and tau have been documented to alter E/I activity of neural circuits. For example, in Aβ overexpressing mice, human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) and its metabolites are implicated in increased firing of excitatory pyramidal neurons by suppressing glutamate reuptake, as well as impaired firing of inhibitory neurons by depleting their voltage-gated sodium channel subunit Nav1.1 –. Likewise, in tau deficient knock-in mice (MAPT –/–), reducing endogenous wild-type tau has been shown to increase the activity of inhibitory neurons, suggesting tau associated imbalance of E/I activity –. However, despite significant progress in the development of AD mouse models, none capture the full complexity of AD pathobiology and hence fall short of characterizing the relationship between E/I imbalance and AD pathophysiology in its entirety.

### Regional A β-tau interactions promote onset and acceleration of Alzheimer's disease tau spreading [^113upH7p]. Neuron (2022). Medium credibility.

Amyloid-beta and tau are key molecules in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, but it remains unclear how these proteins interact to promote disease. Here, by combining cross-sectional and longitudinal molecular imaging and network connectivity analyses in living humans, we identified two amyloid-beta/tau interactions associated with the onset and propagation of tau spreading. First, we show that the lateral entorhinal cortex, an early site of tau neurofibrillary tangle formation, is subject to remote, connectivity-mediated amyloid-beta/tau interactions linked to initial tau spreading. Second, we identify the inferior temporal gyrus as the region featuring the greatest local amyloid-beta/tau interactions and a connectivity profile well suited to accelerate tau propagation. Taken together, our data address long-standing questions regarding the topographical dissimilarity between early amyloid-beta and tau deposition.

### Brain amyloid-β oligomers in ageing and Alzheimer's disease [^111pTCB2]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease begins about two decades before the onset of symptoms or neuron death, and is believed to be caused by pathogenic amyloid-β aggregates that initiate a cascade of molecular events culminating in widespread neurodegeneration. The microtubule binding protein tau may mediate the effects of amyloid-β in this cascade. Amyloid plaques comprised of insoluble, fibrillar amyloid-β aggregates are the most characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease. However, the correspondence between the distribution of plaques and the pattern of neurodegeneration is tenuous. This discrepancy has stimulated the investigation of other amyloid-β aggregates, including soluble amyloid-β oligomers. Different soluble amyloid-β oligomers have been studied in several mouse models, but not systematically in humans. Here, we measured three amyloid-β oligomers previously described in mouse models-amyloid-β trimers, Aβ*56 and amyloid-β dimers-in brain tissue from 75 cognitively intact individuals, ranging from young children to the elderly, and 58 impaired subjects with mild cognitive impairment or probable Alzheimer's disease. As in mouse models, where amyloid-β trimers appear to be the fundamental amyloid-β assembly unit of Aβ*56 and are present in young mice prior to memory decline, amyloid-β trimers in humans were present in children and adolescents; their levels rose gradually with age and were significantly above baseline in subjects in their 70s. Aβ*56 levels were negligible in children and young adults, rose significantly above baseline in subjects in their 40s and increased steadily thereafter. Amyloid-β dimers were undetectable until subjects were in their 60s; their levels then increased sharply and correlated with plaque load. Remarkably, in cognitively intact individuals we found strong positive correlations between Aβ*56 and two pathological forms of soluble tau (tau-CP13 and tau-Alz50), and negative correlations between Aβ*56 and two postsynaptic proteins (drebrin and fyn kinase), but none between amyloid-β dimers or amyloid-β trimers and tau or synaptic proteins. Comparing impaired with age-matched unimpaired subjects, we found the highest levels of amyloid-β dimers, but the lowest levels of Aβ*56 and amyloid-β trimers, in subjects with probable Alzheimer's disease. In conclusion, in cognitively normal adults Aβ*56 increased ahead of amyloid-β dimers or amyloid-β trimers, and pathological tau proteins and postsynaptic proteins correlated with Aβ*56, but not amyloid-β dimers or amyloid-β trimers. We propose that Aβ*56 may play a pathogenic role very early in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

2. Strong relationships between cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β trimers, Aβ56, and tau in cognitively normal older adults. In cognitively normal older adults, strong relationships were observed between cerebrospinal fluid Aβ56, Aβ trimers, and total tau and phospho-tau 181, but not between Aβ1–42 and T-tau or p-tau181. DLU indicates densitometry light units. Results We observed that Aβ trimers and Aβ56 levels increased with age; within the unimpaired group, they were elevated in subjects with T-tau/Aβ1–42 ratios greater than a cutoff that distinguished the unimpaired group from subjects with AD. In the unimpaired group, T-tau and p-tau181 were found to correlate strongly with Aβ trimers and Aβ56, but not with Aβ1–42. The strong correlations were found to be attenuated in the impaired group.

Conclusions and Relevance In cognitively intact older adults, CSF Aβ trimers and Aβ*56 were elevated in individuals at risk for AD, and they showed stronger relationships with tau than did Aβ1–42, a surrogate for Aβ fibril deposition. These findings suggest that prior to overt symptoms, 1 or both of the Aβ oligomers, but not fibrillar Aβ, is coupled to tau; however, this coupling is weakened or broken when AD advances to symptomatic stages. Although the exact cause of AD is unknown, it is widely believed to be triggered by abnormal aggregates of amyloid-β, which collaborate with the microtubule-binding protein tau to produce widespread neuronal degeneration and dysfunction. The disease process begins 1 or 2 decades prior to the onset of neuron loss or overt symptoms.

2–4 There have been many investigations of various Aβ species present in end-stage AD, but our understanding of Aβ species in the initial stages of AD remains limited.

### Evidence for a novel neuronal mechanism driving Alzheimer's disease, upstream of amyloid [^116ZmDZa]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been the subject of intense research for decades, primarily with a focus on the β‐amyloid hypothesis, in which β‐amyloid accumulation initiates a cascade of neurodegeneration leading to the characteristic symptoms of memory loss, cognitive impairment and confusion. The presence of this marker is a major factor in the formal diagnosis of AD. However, the β‐amyloid pathological cascade itself, and closely associated changes, are recognized as highly complex, involving multiple mechanisms including tau phosphorylation, defective mitochondrial function, ionic imbalances, dysfunctional autophagy, synaptic loss, neuroinflammation and impaired brain energy metabolism.

This Perspective presents an alternative approach where we discuss a possible mechanism upstream of this multifactorial, but familiar, scenario and consider the properties of the interconnecting subcortical cell groups that have been increasingly recognized as the first to degenerate at the start of AD. Identification of the features that differentiate these neurons from the rest of the brain could provide valuable insight into the basic process underlying AD, and point the way to an eventual means of preventing the β‐amyloid cascade from being initiated.

### Spread of pathological tau proteins through communicating neurons in human Alzheimer's disease [^1114XJME]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In conclusion, our data support the notion that tau pathology itself, or information leading to the the expression of pathology, is transmitted from cell to cell in humans, principally through neuronal connections, and not extracellular space. Our findings further suggest that this phenomenon proceeds fairly ubiquitously in normal aging, and that the process is accelerated in specific brain regions demonstrating β -amyloid burden. While our cross-sectional, in vivo results cannot prove that tau spreads through neuronal connections, we show that more highly connected regions have a higher tendency to be affected sooner by tau along a specific network path cascading from the medial temporal lobe. Future models may be able to improve results by incorporating region-specific vulnerability factors, directional flow, and A β dynamics, though contributing such information in a parsimonious way presents a difficult challenge.

### Inducers and modulators of protein aggregation in Alzheimer's disease-critical tools for understanding the foundations of aggregate structures [^117KtvSz]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuropathology of two protein aggregate species in the form of plaques of amyloid beta (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) of tau. The localization and degree of accumulation of these aggregates has long been used as diagnostic markers to define stages of the disease. Moreover, there is significant correlation between Aβ plaque and NFT loads and neurodegeneration and cognitive decline measures. Importantly, amyloid beta (in the form of amyloid precursor protein) and tau are normally soluble in cells. Thus, there is great interest in understanding the molecular factors that promote and modulate their transition from soluble to various aggregated species with the goal of gaining insights into how to prevent or interrupt this process. More recently, there has been increasing evidence of other aggregating proteins in AD such as TDP-43 that have potential links to modulating disease phenotypes. For clarity, we will focus our discussion on the most well-characterized aggregating proteins in AD, Aβ and tau.

Tau and Aβ protein biochemistry and properties supporting aggregation

Microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT), or tau for short, can be expressed as six different isoforms, based on the alternative mRNA splicing of its exons 2, 3, and 10 that leads to combinations of the inclusion of zero (0N), one (1N), or two (2N) N-terminal inserts as well as either three (3R) or four (4R) microtubule binding repeats in the translated protein (Fig. 1 A). Tau is primarily expressed in neurons and in adults it is present in roughly equal proportions of 3R versus 4R isoforms, while 1N is more common than its 0N and 2N counterparts. As its name suggests, tau is normally an intrinsically disordered microtubule associated protein where it regulates microtubule stability and dynamics in the axons of neurons. The positively charged microtubule binding repeats facilitate tau's interaction with acidic patches primarily on α-tubulin. The role of the N-terminal inserts is unclear, but the N-terminal region has been proposed to play roles in mediating tau spacing on the microtubule through charge repulsion as well as interacting with other cytoplasmic proteins. In addition to its regulatory role for microtubules, tau also has prescribed functions in axonal transport, synaptic functioning, mitochondrial health and myelin regulation.

### Questions concerning the role of amyloid-β in the definition, aetiology and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease [^115MMPAa]. Acta Neuropathologica (2018). Low credibility.

Collectively therefore, these proposals appear to argue for the terms 'Alzheimer's continuum', 'Alzheimer's Disease' or 'at-risk for Alzheimer's' being used only when Aβ (and, in the case of the IWG, tau) pathology is detected, irrespective of a clinical diagnosis or age. In turn, without such evidence, it is proposed the label 'Alzheimer's' should not be applied.

Although these recommendations could be seen as merely a subtle extension of the neuropathological diagnostic principles that Aβ and tau pathology are the definitive neuropathological 'proof' of AD, they are in fact a radical departure from the traditional use of the label 'Alzheimer's' only when the AD cognitive phenotype is identified. Indeed, the publication by the workgroup runs the risk of formalising the idea that AD cannot be hypothetically explained without accounting for the presence of Aβ and tau pathology, as encapsulated in the following statement:

We emphasise though that A and T proteinopathies define AD as a unique disease among the many that can lead to dementia. As a consequence, disease models where A and T are not in the primary causal pathway must provide a mechanistic explanation for the development of both of these diagnostic proteinopathies, as well as neurodegeneration and clinical symptoms.

This statement presents two major problems. First, it ignores contradictory literature on the absolute validity of Assumptions 1 and 2 (Box 1), which we discuss below in Questions 1–5. Second, it ignores equally valid alternate hypotheses of disease aetiology that do not require an Aβ (and/or tau) basis. We therefore view the statement as an inaccurate representation of the current state of AD research.

We do not see the problem lying with the hypothesis that Aβ and tau biomarkers could predict disease — it is a valid and testable idea. Instead, the crux of the problem is that this statement perpetuates the idea " A and T proteinopathies " define AD dementia as a priori fact, when this remains uncertain. Potentially more worrying is that in labelling " A and T proteinopathies " under the Alzheimer's name in the absence of the cognitive phenotype, the inference is made that effective treatments for AD might now be defined by their ability to treat " A and T proteinopathies ", whether or not there is proven clinical benefit of such treatments.

### Amyloid beta binding partners in the brain tissue of older adults [^1115X42H]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the accumulation of extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits and soluble species and paired helical filament tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau inside neurons. The two pathologies are strongly related. The current amyloid hypothesis, posits that accumulation of Aβ deposits ignites widespread propagation of tau tangles, which causes neurodegeneration, cognitive decline, and subsequent dementia. An unresolved issue is what links Aβ deposits with tau tangles.

Multiple proteins are known to bind to different forms of Aβ through prior non‐human studies, including apolipoprotein E (APOE), low‐density lipoprotein receptor‐related protein 1 (LRP1), α7‐nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR), and prion protein (PrP C), which are suggested to act as Aβ receptors mediating Aβ effects. However, caveats are in order when it comes to generalizing animal studies' findings to humans. For example, the use of overproduction of Aβ in animal models does not mirror human sporadic AD or the difference between animal models and human Aβ species. Therefore, to determine relevance to AD, potential Aβ receptors should be validated using human data to complement preclinical models.

Here, we examined whether these putative Aβ binding partners could be identified in the human brain and whether they mediated the relationship between Aβ and tau tangles. We used post mortem pathological and proteomic data from the brains of participants in one of two longitudinal community‐based clinical pathological studies of aging, the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, collectively known as ROSMAP.

### Tracking the earliest pathologic changes in Alzheimer disease [^113jfrJZ]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

A current challenge in Alzheimer disease (AD) research is to identify the sequence of pathologic changes that occurs during preclinical stages of disease in advance of cognitive decline. The timing of appearance of the 2 pathologic hallmarks of AD-amyloid deposition and tau-mediated neurodegeneration-is a particular topic of debate, with researchers drawing on a broad range of genetic, neuroimaging, fluid biomarker, animal, and autopsy studies to piece together the series of events ultimately leading to the plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive deficits that define AD.

### Is tau aggregation toxic or protective? [^113txWvi]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Abnormal protein deposits are a common feature of many human diseases including Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, the appearance of tangles, composed of the microtubule associated protein tau, correlates with both cell death and symptom severity. However, are tau filaments simply markers of disease progression, or are they directly responsible for cell death? Due to conflicting findings from cell and animal models, it remains controversial whether tau polymers or smaller pre-fibrillar aggregates or tau monomers are the toxic species. Indeed, if monomeric or oligomeric species are mediators of disease, formation of larger tau filaments may prove beneficial to affected cells. This review will examine the findings regarding the toxicity of various tau species.

### Cerebrospinal fluid proteins in relation to longitudinal cognitive trajectories [^111B1Hvi]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by senile plaques and neurofibrillary tanglescomposed of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau proteins, two of the main hallmarks of AD. In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), Aβ42 reflects cortical amyloid plaque formation, while phosphorylated tau (p‐tau) represents pathological tau hyperphosphorylation. These CSF protein biomarkers have been extensively studied for their ability to reflect the pathological characteristics of AD. However, these core CSF proteins represent only a small fraction of the complex biological mechanisms underlying the disease. Therefore, it is necessary to identify a diverse range of AD biomarkers to reflect these underlying pathological changes.

Along with Aβ and tau proteins, cognitive decline is a typical feature of AD. Cognitive dysfunction reflects the pattern of pathological changes in AD, as neuropathological changes in the cerebral cortex and limbic system lead to deficits in learning, memory (MEM), language (LAN), and visuospatial skills. Several cognitive composite scores have been developed, and these measures can sensitively detect subtle cognitive decline during the preclinical phase of AD. In addition, the association between cognitive decline and Aβ and tau has been reported, along with the relationship between cognitive composite scores and these pathological markers.

Most demented elderly individuals exhibit more than one hallmark pathology of cognitive decline. The overlapping pathologies undermine the current diagnostic framework for dementia and highlight the need for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms. Thus, omics approaches have been emphasized to discover diverse AD biomarkers. Moreover, advancements in large‐scale sequencing technologies have led to a significant increase in the number of human AD proteomic studies in recent years. Proteins are the optimal markers for understanding diseases as they are most proximal to phenotypic changes. Recent studies have investigated protein alterations across different brain regions in AD, identifying differentially abundant proteins and their associated biological pathways. These findings provide important new insights into AD pathogenesis and highlight potential drug targets and biomarkers for the disease. In addition, network proteomics analysis has emerged as a valuable tool for organizing complex proteomic data into groups or "modules" of co‐expressed proteins, which reflect various biological functions linked to AD.

### An unsupervised learning approach for clustering joint trajectories of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers: an application to ADNI data [^114E2kdR]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Syndrome definition

We begin with a heuristic definition of a syndrome in terms of trajectories of a set of biomarkers, including clinical measurements, that characterize the pathway from healthy normal function to dementia. Such a collection of trajectories will be said to define a syndrome statistically if:
The biomarkers are all measured on a common scale; we will work with measures scaled from 0 (normal) to 100 (dementia), or rescaled to 0 to 1.
The trajectories are mapped on a time scale that is, anchored to one or more disease benchmarks, such as disease onset or clinical progression, rather than to chronological age; this allows people with different ages of onset to have the same syndrome.
The biomarker trajectories have a unique, consistent relationship to each other along this time scale.

The conceptual model proposed by Jack et al.for the amyloid cascade hypothesis exemplifies such a syndrome, as represented in the adapted representation of their work shown in Figure 1. The time scale is anchored by clinical disease stage (progression from clinically normal to MCI, and from MCI to dementia), not by chronological age. This model focuses on the hypothesis that pathological accumulations of fibrillar amyloid beta (Aβ) act as the root cause of classical AD and initiate its pathogenesis; we would call this an amyloid syndrome. A different syndrome is therefore analogous to a differing hypothesis or a different dementia etiology, for example, a hypothetical tau cascade hypothesis (tau syndrome) would be one where tau protein accumulations initiated the cascade. Differentiating syndromes by a biological ordering has important implications for early diagnosis or treatment. Just as the amyloid hypothesis has led to treatments that target amyloid accumulation, identifying alternative syndromes such as tau‐initiated brain pathology would suggest development of treatments targeting tau.

### The relationship of soluble tau species with Alzheimer's disease amyloid plaque removal and tau pathology [^116BWY9B]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tau-derived cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers correlate with amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques or tau tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study assessed the effects of long-term anti-Aβ antibodies on amyloid plaques, tau tangles, and CSF tau species to determine the relationships between them.

Methods

A post-hoc analysis of the DIAN-TU-001 trial (NCT01760005) examined 142 participants at risk for dominantly inherited AD randomized to solanezumab (n = 50), gantenerumab (n = 52), or placebo (n = 40). High-resolution mass spectrometry quantified CSF tau species over four years.

Results

Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species (153, 181, 217, 231) increased early in preclinical AD but were reduced with gantenerumab-mediated Aβ plaque reduction. Nearly a decade later, MTBR-tau243 and p-tau205 increased, showing no association with Aβ reduction, aligning with tau tangle pathology progression.

Discussion

Initially changing soluble p-tau species track Aβ plaque reduction, while ptau205 and MTBR-243 reflect tau tangle pathology, informing different pathways of therapeutic strategies.

Highlights

p-tau217 and p-tau231 correlate with Aβ-PET and respond to Aβ-plaque lowering therapies. Aβ immunotherapy trials support a direct link between p-tau changes and Aβ plaques Gantenerumab reduces Aβ plaques but does not affect tau NFT-related biomarkers. Blood-based p-tau217 assays may provide a non-invasive tool to monitor Aβ therapies. MTBR-tau243 strongly correlates with tau PET and tracks NFT pathology progression. Further studies are needed to validate tau biomarkers for tracking NFT-targeting therapies.
