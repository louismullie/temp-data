## Question

Hep A AB igM indeterminate

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage an indeterminate hepatitis A IgM antibody result. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "indeterminate" means on the assay and whether it reflects analytical uncertainty or a low-level true signal. Then, I should verify the pretest probability by anchoring on clinical and epidemiologic features and liver test patterns. Next, I will review the serologic kinetics of IgM and IgG responses to HAV and consider the window period. After that, I should outline a confirmatory testing strategy, including repeat serology, total anti-HAV/IgG, and HAV RNA. Finally, I will integrate results with clinical context, address public health implications, and summarize a practical decision pathway with clear thresholds and follow-up actions.

> Let me first confirm what "indeterminate" typically signifies on commercial HAV IgM assays. Most platforms report results as nonreactive, indeterminate/equivocal, or reactive, and an indeterminate result usually sits just above or below the assay cutoff, reflecting low-level reactivity that may be nonspecific, a very early or late IgM signal, or a false-positive, so I should not jump to conclusions about acute infection based on this alone [^112kMVB7] [^113HNQCv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the pretest probability by aligning symptoms, timing, and exposures with liver tests, because guidelines emphasize restricting IgM testing to patients with compatible clinical features or epidemiologic risk, and in low-prevalence settings false positives are more common, so an indeterminate IgM in an asymptomatic person with normal ALT is far more likely to be noise than disease [^114URhTh] [^116aSgs1] [^112EPaYt].

> I will now examine the clinical features that raise suspicion for acute HAV: discrete onset of symptoms, jaundice or dark urine, nausea, abdominal pain, fever, and marked aminotransferase elevations, often in the hundreds to thousands, with bilirubin elevation. ALT and AST typically rise 5–10 days before symptom onset and normalize within 2–3 months, so a compatible biochemical pattern strengthens the case for true acute infection and makes an indeterminate IgM more concerning [^113MN2fV] [^112fC6io].

> Wait, let me verify the serologic kinetics. IgM anti-HAV appears about 5–10 days after symptom onset, peaks around 1 month, and generally declines to undetectable within 6 months, but low-level or persistent IgM has been reported beyond 6 months and vaccination can transiently induce IgM, so timing relative to symptoms and vaccination matters greatly when interpreting a borderline result [^114URhTh] [^1121W6A4].

> Next, I should review the immediate confirmatory steps. If the patient is symptomatic with elevated ALT or has a credible exposure, I should repeat HAV IgM on a fresh sample in 1–2 weeks to document seroconversion or a rising signal, and concurrently obtain total anti-HAV or IgG anti-HAV to distinguish acute from past infection or vaccine-induced immunity, recognizing that isolated IgM without supportive total/IgG or clinical features is suspicious for a false-positive [^114URhTh] [^113HNQCv].

> But wait, what if the clinical stakes are high or the result remains equivocal? I should confirm with HAV RNA by NAAT because direct detection can resolve discordant serology, and studies show that most patients with true acute HAV have detectable RNA early in illness, whereas low-level IgM without RNA supports a false-positive or remote infection, so RNA testing is particularly useful when the IgM signal is weak or the epidemiology is atypical [^113HNQCv] [^1136idNU].

> Let me consider special contexts. In pregnancy with acute hepatitis, testing for HAV IgM is appropriate, and if acute HAV is confirmed within 2 weeks of delivery, neonatal postexposure prophylaxis with immune globulin is recommended, so I should maintain a lower threshold to repeat and confirm in this scenario given maternal–neonatal implications [^117R3Mdu].

> I should double-check for alternative diagnoses when the story is weak. False-positive HAV IgM has been reported with EBV and other acute viral illnesses and in settings of polyclonal activation, so if the patient has atypical features or another clear diagnosis, I need to ensure I am not over-calling HAV, and repeating the IgM or using RNA can prevent misclassification [^1131JoXd] [^112HAbqm].

> Next, I should review public health implications. If acute HAV is ultimately confirmed, I need to assess infectivity and counsel on hygiene, and if the patient is a food handler or in a high-risk congregate setting, I should coordinate with public health for contact tracing and potential postexposure prophylaxis for close contacts, aligning with surveillance case definitions that require both clinical and laboratory criteria [^112fC6io] [^116aSgs1].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway. If the patient is asymptomatic with normal ALT and no epidemiologic risk, I should treat the indeterminate IgM as likely false-positive, avoid further testing, and document immunity status with total anti-HAV or IgG when relevant. If symptomatic with compatible labs or exposure, I should repeat IgM in 1–2 weeks and add total anti-HAV/IgG, and if results remain equivocal or management hinges on confirmation, I should obtain HAV RNA. If ALT is markedly elevated and the clinical picture fits, I should proceed directly to RNA while repeating serology to capture the diagnostic window [^113HNQCv] [^114URhTh].

> In summary, I need to ensure that an indeterminate HAV IgM is never interpreted in isolation. Anchoring on pretest probability, leveraging repeat serology with total/IgG, and confirming with HAV RNA when necessary are the keys to avoiding both missed acute infections and unnecessary alarm from false positives, and this approach aligns with contemporary guidance to reserve IgM testing for patients with compatible clinical and epidemiologic features [^114URhTh] [^113HNQCv].

An indeterminate hepatitis A IgM result means the test is neither clearly positive nor negative, often due to **low-level antibodies** [^112kMVB7], nonspecific binding, or early/late infection. It is **not diagnostic** of acute HAV and should be interpreted with clinical context, liver enzymes, and epidemiologic risk [^114URhTh]. Repeat IgM in 2–4 weeks, add total anti-HAV/IgG [^114URhTh], and consider HAV RNA [^113HNQCv] if acute infection remains suspected. Most indeterminate results are not acute HAV [^112kMVB7]; avoid over-calling positives and base management on symptoms, ALT/AST, and risk [^116aSgs1].

---

## Clinical significance of indeterminate hepatitis A IgM results

Indeterminate IgM results **lack definitive diagnostic value** and should not be used alone to diagnose acute HAV. They may reflect:

- **Low-level antibodies**: Early or late infection [^114URhTh] with low IgM near the assay cutoff [^1136idNU].

- **Nonspecific binding**: Cross-reactivity or nonspecific binding, especially in low-prevalence settings [^113HNQCv] [^112HAbqm].

- **Assay variability**: Differences in assay sensitivity/specificity [^116tpYDs] and cutoff interpretation [^112kMVB7].

---

## Clinical scenarios associated with indeterminate hepatitis A IgM results

| **Clinical scenario** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Early infection | IgM not yet clearly positive; repeat testing may convert [^115hEJCB] |
| Late infection | IgM declining to low levels; may be indeterminate [^116PaMUw] |
| Nonspecific binding | Cross-reactivity or nonspecific binding, especially in low-prevalence settings [^113HNQCv] [^114qYwwz] |
| Assay variability | Differences in assay sensitivity/specificity and cutoff interpretation [^116tpYDs] |

---

## Recommended follow-up and confirmatory testing

Given the limited diagnostic value of indeterminate results, **targeted follow-up is recommended**:

- **Repeat IgM testing**: Repeat in 2–4 weeks to assess seroconversion or decline [^115hEJCB].

- **Total anti-HAV/IgG**: Test for total anti-HAV or IgG to distinguish acute from past infection or immunity [^114URhTh].

- **HAV RNA testing**: Consider HAV RNA [^113HNQCv] if acute infection remains suspected despite indeterminate IgM [^112kMVB7].

- **Clinical correlation**: Integrate symptoms, ALT/AST, and epidemiologic risk [^112EPaYt] to guide interpretation and management [^114URhTh].

---

## Clinical management and public health implications

Management should be guided by **clinical context and confirmatory testing**:

- **Symptomatic patients**: If acute HAV is suspected, manage supportively and apply infection control measures [^117R3Mdu] [^116tQyJC].

- **Asymptomatic patients**: Indeterminate results in asymptomatic patients are often false positives; avoid over-calling acute infection [^112kMVB7] [^116aSgs1].

- **Public health**: Indeterminate results should not trigger outbreak investigations or contact prophylaxis without confirmatory evidence [^112fC6io].

---

## Limitations and challenges of hepatitis A IgM testing

IgM testing has **important limitations**:

- **False positives**: Nonspecific binding and cross-reactivity can cause false positives, especially in low-prevalence settings [^113HNQCv] [^114qYwwz].

- **Persistence of IgM**: IgM may persist months after infection, complicating interpretation [^116PaMUw] [^114URhTh].

- **Assay variability**: Differences in assay performance and cutoff interpretation can lead to indeterminate results [^112kMVB7].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Indeterminate hepatitis A IgM results are **nondiagnostic** and require clinical correlation and targeted confirmatory testing. Repeat IgM, add total anti-HAV/IgG, and consider HAV RNA when acute infection remains suspected. Most indeterminate results are not acute HAV; avoid over-calling positives and base management on symptoms, liver enzymes, and epidemiologic risk [^112kMVB7] [^114URhTh].

### RNA testing for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis A during the 2017 outbreak in France [^1136idNU]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is based on the detection of anti-HAV IgM without testing for the pathogen itself. We evaluated the usefulness of HAV RNA testing for confirmation of acute hepatitis A and to provide indications about the level of HAV replication in HIV-positive and HIV-negative subjects during an unprecedented outbreak of HAV observed in France in 2017. HAV RNA was detected in 38 out of 41 (92.6%) subjects with a clinical diagnosis of acute hepatitis A, whereas nine cases tested positive for anti-HAV IgM in whom the diagnosis of acute hepatitis A was not retained were found negative for HAV RNA. All subjects in the control group were also tested negative for HAV RNA. HAV viremia was correlated to ALT peak (r = .64; P < .0001). HIV-infected patients have similar HAV RNA levels but were less likely to have prolonged international normalized ratio of prothrombin time when compared to the HIV-uninfected group (P = 0.016), suggesting a less severe course of acute hepatitis. HAV RNA was detected in the serum of most of the patients with acute hepatitis A, indicating that the direct detection of HAV can be used to confirm hepatitis A in patients tested positive for anti-HAV IgM antibodies. Nucleic acid tests should serve more broadly during the diagnosis workup of acute hepatitis A to improve the predictive values of HAV in vitro diagnostic tests and to confirm acute hepatitis A in patients tested positive with IgM with moderate or low S/CO values.

### Determination of potential biotin interference on accuracy of results of serologic assays for various viral hepatitis markers [^117WHQ6j]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

Biotin taken orally can interfere with some diagnostic immunoassays, including those for thyroid hormones, ferritin, and markers of infectious disease. Assays affected are ones that use streptavidin-biotin in their design. The goal of our study was to examine the effect of biotin concentrations of up to 1200ng/mL on three serological assays performed on VITROS 3600 system, Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV), total anti-HAV, and IgM antibodies to hepatitis B virus core antigen (anti-HBc), by spiking serum samples with variable amounts of biotin. No false-negative results were generated with either concentration of biotin for total anti-HAV (65/65). Likewise, biotin caused no false-positive IgM anti-HAV results (59/59) with either concentration of biotin; however, 6.7% false negativity was found for IgM anti-HAV when samples were spiked with 1200ng/mL of biotin. Conversely, 100% false positivity (30/30) was produced by biotin interference in total anti-HAV negative specimens with both concentrations of biotin. False negativity rate was 87.5% in IgM anti-HBc positive samples when biotin levels were at 1200ng/mL. These data show that individuals taking biotin-containing supplements may test false-positive in some serologic assays using streptavidin-biotin chemistries. Further studies are warranted to determine the extent of biotin interference resulting in false-positive and negative results and their impact, if any, on surveillance and diagnostic settings.

### Epidemiology of hepatitis A virus infections, Germany, 2007–2008 [^112HAbqm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The results of our study also provide information on specificity of surveillance data. Especially among older hospitalized patients, frequently without jaundice, IgM-positive serum samples were mostly negative for HAV RNA, which suggests false-positive serologic results. HAV IgM–positive samples that showed negative results by reverse transcription–PCR probably showed false-positive HAV IgM results for patients with persisting HAV IgM, cross-reactions in the test (e.g. in acute-phase infections with Epstein-Barr virus), or nonspecific polyclonal activation of memory cells. As a bias favoring stability, this overestimate of numbers of cases has limited consequences for surveillance purposes. However, for the individual patient, specificity of IgM in serum samples should be strongly considered.

The main conclusion of this study is that existing vaccination recommendations for travelers to areas endemic for hepatitis should be emphasized. Furthermore, immunization of travelers should be made more accessible to risk groups through information campaigns and removal of financial barriers (insurance payments for pretravel advice and vaccinations are not universal). If removal of these barriers to vaccination of all travelers is deemed unlikely, the general vaccination of children against HAV should be considered, given the high number of imported infections among children and the evidence of secondary autochthonous transmission.

Efforts to communicate recommendations to previously unaware population groups, especially, but not exclusively, persons with migration backgrounds, have the capacity to strongly reduce the number of HAV infections in Germany. However, as long as vaccination recommendations are applied only to travelers and overall immunity in the population remains low or decreases further, risk for secondary transmission of imported infections remains high.

HAV Biomarker Results for Donor F

One of 10 selected donors (donor F) had 1 HAV RNA-reactive donation on the basis of the Cobas DPX Assay but never showed seroconversion. All 13 tested donations from day –10 and day +40 were IgM/IgG negative, and efforts to determine the HAV genotype were not successful. We performed several follow-up analyses to assess whether the initial reactive NAT result (cycle threshold value 35.7) might have been a false-positive result. However, we found no such evidence. First, a second independent HAV RNA test confirmed the low-level reactive result for the donation in question. Second, analysis of 12 immune status markers for common pathogens showed matching results between the index sample and 2 other samples from the same donor. Therefore, a sample or donation mixup is highly unlikely. Finally, analysis of routine donation screening results of 54 HAV RNA-positive donors showed that at least 7 donors (13%) had a positivity pattern similar to that for donor F, who had a single, weak, positive donation among many negative donations. Further analyses are needed to clarify what is occurring in these examples.

Sera from 2,148 patients were tested with a third-generation microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA), a confirmatory assay, and a reverse transcription-PCR. Overall, 85.6% of reactivities were confirmed, 13.2% were shown to be unspecifically reactive, and 1.2% were indeterminate. The rate of confirmed MEIA reactivities clearly depended on the strength of the reactivity.

### Positive test results for acute hepatitis A virus infection among persons with no recent history of acute hepatitis – United States, 2002–2004 [^116aSgs1]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatitis A is a nationally reportable condition, and the surveillance case definition includes both clinical criteria and serologic confirmation. State health departments and CDC have investigated persons with positive serologic tests for acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection (i.e. IgM anti-HAV) whose illness was not consistent with the clinical criteria of the hepatitis A case definition. Test results indicating acute HAV infection among persons who do not have clinical or epidemiologic features consistent with hepatitis A are a concern for state and local health departments because of the need to assess whether contacts need postexposure immunoprophylaxis. This report summarizes results of three such investigations, which suggested that most of the positive tests did not represent recent acute HAV infections. To improve the predictive value of a positive IgM anti-HAV test, clinicians should limit laboratory testing for acute HAV infection to persons with clinical findings typical of hepatitis A or to persons who have been exposed to settings where HAV transmission is suspected.

During a 38-month period, 13 of 41 persons with test results positive for IgM antibody to hepatitis A virus did not meet the case definition for hepatitis A or have a clear indication for testing, which suggests that test results were falsely positive. No single testing platform or kit was used. Health care providers should restrict serologic testing for hepatitis A to patients with clinical or epidemiologic indications.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — hepatocellular or mixed injury evaluation includes excluding acute viral hepatitis (A, B, and C) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) with standard serologies and HCV RNA testing (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Anti-HEV IgM testing may be considered in selected patients with heightened clinical suspicion, noting that performance of available commercial tests is not clear (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend testing for acute cytomegalovirus, acute Epstein–Barr virus, or acute herpes simplex virus infection if classical viral hepatitis has been excluded or if atypical lymphocytosis and lymphadenopathy suggest such causes (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend evaluation for Wilson disease and Budd–Chiari syndrome when clinically appropriate (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

Interpretation of Serologic Markers and Diagnosis of HAV Infection

Hepatitis A cannot be differentiated from other types of viral hepatitis on the basis of clinical or epidemiologic features alone. Diagnosis of HAV infection requires the detection of either immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HAV in serum or HAV RNA in serum or stool. IgM anti-HAV, a marker of acute illness, becomes detectable within 5–10 days of the onset of symptoms in the majority of persons, usually peaks within 1 month of illness, and decreases to undetectable levels within 6 months after infection (,–) (Figure 2). However, positive tests for IgM anti-HAV in persons > 1 year after infection have been reported, as have likely false-positive tests in persons without evidence of recent HAV infection. Therefore, to reduce false-positive tests, persons should only be tested for IgM anti-HAV if they are symptomatic and suspected of having HAV infection. Total anti-HAV or immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-HAV testing is used in epidemiologic studies to measure the prevalence of previous infection or clinically to determine whether a person with an indication for preexposure prophylaxis is already immune. IgG anti-HAV is produced either in response to natural infection or after vaccination with HepA vaccine, appearing early in the course of infection, remaining detectable for the person's lifetime, and providing lifelong protection against the disease. The antibody test for total anti-HAV measures both IgG anti-HAV and IgM anti-HAV. Although assays for the detection of IgG anti-HAV are available, in the absence of an IgG anti-HAV test, a total anti-HAV–positive sample from a symptomatic person should be subsequently tested for IgM anti-HAV to establish the acute stage of HAV infection. Persons who test positive from a total anti-HAV test and negative from an IgM anti-HAV test are considered immune, either from past infection or vaccination.

### False-positive serologies for acute hepatitis A and autoimmune hepatitis in a patient with acute Epstein-Barr virus infection [^1131JoXd]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Acute hepatitis remains a diagnostic challenge, and numerous infectious, metabolic and autoimmune diseases need to be effectively excluded. We present a case of a young woman with malaise, fever, jaundice and deranged liver function tests. Testing for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) virus capsid antigen IgM/IgG was positive. Total IgG was elevated, along with positive serology for anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV)-IgM, antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and soluble liver antigen (SLA) leading to the differential diagnosis of acute hepatitis A and autoimmune hepatitis. No specific treatment was started and liver function gradually improved. At week 4, HAV IgG and IgM were negative. At month 4, ANA and SLA were negative and total IgG normalised; EBV nuclear antigen became positive. Testing for EBV is an investigation required at baseline in acute hepatitis and physicians should carefully evaluate serological results, including those for viral and autoimmune hepatitis that may be falsely positive in infectious mononucleosis.

RESULTS

Clinical Testing

Serum samples from 204 patients were investigated in a blinded fashion using mNGS, of which 187 (92%) were classified as indeterminate, 8 (4%) were positive controls, and 9 (4%) were negative controls (Table 1). The extent of primary clinical testing for hepatitis viruses at the study sites was variable, with HCV serology and HBV antigen testing being performed > 80% of the time, and HDV or HEV PCR testing < 10% of the time (Figure 1).

Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing Results

Serum samples collected at the earliest available time point after clinical presentation of ALF were analyzed (median, 7 days [range, 2–38 days] from symptom onset to sample collection; Table 2). A total of 151 individual or pooled sample libraries from 204 serum samples were sequenced across 10 Illumina HiSeq lanes, yielding 1.5 billion raw sequence reads. After preprocessing to remove low-complexity and low-quality sequences, 84% of the remaining preprocessed reads were classified as human and 1.0% as viral by SURPI+ (Supplementary Table 8). The 12 million viral reads included canonical hepatitis viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV, and HDV) and additional viruses rarely associated with hepatitis, such as HSV-1 and parvovirus B19 (Table 2). Reads from anelloviruses and/or human pegivirus 1, considered nonpathogenic flora, were identified in 135 of 151 (89.4%) sequencing libraries.

### Efficiency of the ortho VITROS assay for detection of hepatitis C virus-specific antibodies increased by elimination of supplemental testing of samples with very low sample-to-cutoff ratios [^111AtbFw]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

The clinical significance of specimens with low sample-to-cutoff (S/Co) ratios in the Ortho VITROS chemiluminescence assay (CIA) for detection of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV) was evaluated. In one study of 482 CIA-reactive samples, none of the 83 samples with S/Co ratios of < 5 was HCV RNA positive. In a subsequent study, 332 samples with S/Co ratios of between 1 and 20 were tested with the recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA). None of the 163 samples with S/Co ratios of < 5 was RIBA positive, 83% were RIBA negative, and 28 samples (18%) were RIBA indeterminate. HCV RNA and/or clinical evidence of hepatitis was not found in the 27 indeterminate cases examined. These results show that over 99% of samples with very low S/Co ratios (≤ 5) have no evidence of HCV infection. Therefore, we suggest that the HCV antibody testing algorithm for the VITROS assay might be modified to eliminate supplemental testing of samples with very low S/Co ratios.

### Epidemiology and clinical features of sporadic hepatitis E as compared with hepatitis a… [^113y5bt9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the epidemiology and clinical features of two enterically transmitted hepatitis, namely hepatitis E and hepatitis A.

Methods

We analyzed clinical features and risk factors of 105 cases of hepatitis A and 24 cases of hepatitis E admitted in 2002. All patients were tested positive for IgM antibody against either hepatitis A virus (HAV) or hepatitis E virus (HEV), and all patients were tested to be negative for IgM anti-HBV or IgG anti-HCV.

Results

Hepatitis A patients were significantly younger (median age = 27 yr) and most had a recent history of shellfish consumption, whereas hepatitis E patients were older (median age = 53 yr) and most had a recent travel history. Whereas hepatitis A was milder and recovery was uneventful, hepatitis E was more severe, associated with significant mortality and frequently complicated by protracted coagulopathy and cholestasis.

Conclusions

Hepatitis E is a more severe disease entity as compared with hepatitis A and significant proportion of them are imported cases from an endemic area.

### Window period of anti-hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M antibodies in diagnosing acute hepatitis a… [^115hEJCB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is made on the basis of the presence of anti-HAV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in patients with clinical features of acute hepatitis. Some patients show a negative serology at initial presentation, which may complicate the diagnosis of hepatitis A (HA). The aim of this study was to examine the characteristics of HA patients with an initially negative anti-HAV IgM test result.

Materials and Methods

Patients with symptomatic acute hepatitis who underwent IgM anti-HAV testing at a single center were enrolled consecutively, with tests repeated in patients with negative initial serology.

Results

A total of 684 patients with acute hepatitis were tested, of whom 620 patients were initially or eventually diagnosed with HA. Anti-HAV IgM was initially negative in 67 of the 620 HA patients (10.9%), but was later confirmed by subsequent retests. These patients had on average a shorter time lapse from the onset of symptoms to the initial test, a higher rate of fever, and lower alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin levels compared with those with a positive initial serology. Cutoff index (COI) values of anti-HAV IgM were correlated positively with the duration of time from the onset of symptoms to the initial test. Fever, lower bilirubin levels, and higher COI values were predictive of seroconversion to anti-HAV positivity in patients with a negative initial serology.

Conclusion

Taking into account the window period of HAV infection, anti-HAV IgM tests should be repeated, particularly in patients with features of the initial phase of hepatitis and a high COI value of anti-HAV IgM.

### Improving the accuracy of clinical interpretation of serological testing for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis A infection [^112kMVB7]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatitis A (HA) remains a common infection globally that results in a self-limiting hepatitis with gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms. Direct detection of the virus in blood or stool is often not possible once symptomatic. Serological testing is frequently performed to investigate abnormal liver function tests - and interpretation of equivocal and low-level positive anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgM is difficult even in the context of accurate epidemiological and clinical information.

Objectives

The aim of this project was to characterise the association between low-level reactive anti-HAV IgM results and clinical disease.

Study Design

Anti-HAV serology results recorded over 22 months were analysed. Equivocal and positive Architect anti-HAV IgM results were matched with available clinical and demographical data to identify confirmed and probable cases of acute HAV infection.

Results

Reactive anti-HAV IgM results were recorded for 88/7661 (1.15%) samples. Using clinical and laboratory data, 35 patients were confirmed to have acute HAV infection. Acute HA was associated with a mean Architect anti-HAV IgM value of 9.4 (SD 6.8–12.0). Cases of HA had a mean peak ALT value of 1920 (SD 682–3158). All confirmed cases (35/35) of acute HAV were associated with at least one clinical indicator, with 28/31 cases (90%) having a documented jaundice. All 35 (100%) cases of acute HAV infection had anti-HAV IgM > 4.0. A diagnosis other than acute HA was identified in 7/11 (63.6%) of low-level reactive anti-HAV IgM results (clinical data unavailable for further 4/11, 36.3%). Where clinical information was available, acute HA was excluded in all 31 patients with equivocal or low-level reactive anti-HAV IgM results.

Conclusions

The accuracy of reports sent out to the clinician showed room for improvement. An interpretive algorithm is proposed including a clinically significant cut-off value for anti-HAV IgM.

Initial HCV testing and follow-up — For initial screening, HCV-antibody testing with reflex HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing is recommended (I, A), and HCV-antibody testing using a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved assay (laboratory-based or point-of-care) is recommended. Among persons with a negative HCV-antibody test who were exposed to HCV within the prior 6 months, HCV-RNA or follow-up HCV-antibody testing 6 months or longer after exposure is recommended; HCV-RNA testing can also be considered for immunocompromised persons (I, C). Among persons at risk for reinfection after previous spontaneous or treatment-related viral clearance, HCV-RNA testing is recommended because a positive HCV-antibody test is expected (I, C). Persons with a positive HCV-antibody test and negative results for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction should be informed that they do not have evidence of current (active) HCV infection but are not protected from reinfection (I, A). Quantitative HCV-RNA testing is recommended prior to initiation of antiviral therapy to document the baseline level of viremia (i.e., baseline viral load) (I, A). HCV genotype testing may be considered for those in whom it may alter treatment recommendations (I, A).

Investigation and Results

Health care providers and clinical laboratories are mandated to report hepatitis A cases within one working day of identification. * DPH staff members investigate reported hepatitis A cases to determine whether they meet the national surveillance acute hepatitis A case definition. In 2018, a confirmed case of acute HAV infection was defined as illness occurring in a person with 1) a discrete onset of hepatitis symptoms, 2) jaundice or elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and 3) reactive anti-HAV immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibody. Patients with confirmed HAV infection are interviewed using a standard questionnaire to assess risk factors and to identify contacts who can be offered PEP.

On November 10, 2018, an acute hepatitis A case was reported to DPH in a person experiencing homelessness who used methamphetamines (patient A) (Table) (Figure). Medical records review indicated that patient A was transported to the emergency department of hospital A by ambulance from intersection X but left the hospital against medical advice and could not be located by DPH for interview. Patient A did not report nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain but did have left flank pain, fever, an elevated ALT and a positive anti-HAV IgM test result. Another person experiencing homelessness who reported methamphetamine use (patient B) was evaluated 3 days later at hospital B with a 3-day history of nausea and abdominal pain. The patient received a diagnosis of HAV infection, and the diagnosis was reported to DPH on November 14, 2018.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^1146p3dU]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing methods and confirmatory approach — The sensitivity and specificity of the lone FDA-approved point-of-care test are similar to laboratory-based assays, but a positive HCV-antibody test indicates current (active) HCV infection, a past resolved infection, or rarely a false-positive result, and a test to detect HCV viremia is necessary to confirm active HCV infection. Ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing, which requires a single blood collection and avoids a return visit for confirmatory testing. Collection of dried blood spots is an option for sequential HCV-antibody and reflex HCV-RNA testing, and dried blood spot collection can be accomplished with a fingerstick rather than venepuncture and transport does not require an intact cold chain, making this advantageous where phlebotomy is a testing barrier. An FDA-approved quantitative or qualitative HCV-RNA assay should be used; immunocompromised persons and those with possible HCV exposure in the prior 6 months may be HCV antibody–negative, and HCV-RNA testing is a consideration for these individuals. If clarification is needed to differentiate resolved infection from biologic false positivity, repeat testing with a different HCV-antibody assay can be undertaken, and a false positive result is more likely when the anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio is low.

Hepatitis B virus infection — diagnosis and screening in adults and adolescents with HIV: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends testing all people over the age of 18, including those with HIV, for chronic HBV infection. Initial testing should include a triple screening panel for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc total), and anti-HBs. In acute infection, HBsAg can be detected 4 weeks (range 1–9 weeks) after exposure, and anti-HBc immunoglobulin M (IgM) is usually detectable at the onset of symptoms. See CDC's Clinical Testing and Diagnosis for Hepatitis B for information on how to interpret laboratory results.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) evaluation in the setting of abnormal aminotransferases specifies when to test, core screening markers, and follow-up. Testing for hepatitis B should be performed in all patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT levels. Chronic hepatitis B infects ~1.5 million Americans and over 280 million individuals world-wide. Hepatitis B screening involves testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the hepatitis B core antibody total, and the hepatitis B surface antibody, which together indicate infection, prior exposure, or immunity (natural or vaccine-mediated). Chronic infection is confirmed by presence of the HBsAg and/or positive virion on a highly sensitive HBV DNA assay. Individuals confirmed to have chronic hepatitis B should be referred to physicians with expertise for further characterization and staging, including assessment of HBeAg, HBeAb and HBV DNA, and the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B is made by a positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) hepatitis B core antibody and HBsAg in the setting of an acute hepatitis.

### Introduction to the revised American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases position paper on acute liver failure 2011 [^116YH6gz]. Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) diagnosis and initial evaluation — The diagnosis of ALF hinges on identifying that the patient has an acute insult and is encephalopathic, and imaging in recent years has suggested "cirrhosis", but this is often an overcall by radiology, because a regenerating massively necrotic liver will give the same nodular profile as cirrhosis. It is vital to promptly get viral hepatitis serologies, including A-E as well as autoimmune serologies. For fulminant Wilson's disease, diagnosis can be made most effectively by looking for bilirubin level (very high) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP; very low), such that the bilirubin/ALP ratio exceeds 2.0, noting that ceruloplasmin levels can be low in half of all ALF patients. The availability of an assay that measures acetaminophen adducts has improved our clinical recognition of acetaminophen cases when the diagnosis is obscured by patient denial or encephalopathy, and any patient with very high aminotransferases and low bilirubin on admission with ALF very likely has acetaminophen overdose, with the one possible exception being those patients who enter with ischemic injury. Obtaining autoantibodies should be routine and a low threshold for biopsy in patients with indeterminate ALF should be standard, given that autoimmune hepatitis may be the largest category of indeterminate, after unrecognized acetaminophen poisoning.

Recommended Testing for Symptomatic Nonpregnant Patients

For nonpregnant persons with a clinically compatible illness, dengue and Zika virus NAATs should be performed on serum collected ≤ 7 days after symptom onset (Figure 1). Various NAATs also can be performed on plasma, whole blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or urine. For symptomatic persons with possible exposure to dengue and Zika virus, a positive NAAT result typically provides evidence of acute infection, and no antibody testing is indicated (Table). However, patients for whom the diagnosis has epidemiologic or clinical significance (e.g. first local transmission in area, new transmission mode, patient has an unusual clinical syndrome, or diagnosis will affect clinical management), a repeat NAAT should be performed on newly extracted RNA from the same specimen to rule out false-positive test results.

FIGURE 1
Dengue and Zika virus testing recommendations for nonpregnant persons with a clinically compatible illness and risk for infection with both viruses*

Abbreviations: IgM = immunoglobulin M; NAAT = nucleic acid amplification test; PRNT = plaque reduction neutralization test.

* **Specimen and test selection**: Dengue and Zika virus NAATs, IgM antibody testing, and PRNTs should be performed on serum. Some NAATs also can be performed on plasma, whole blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or urine, and some antibody tests can be performed on plasma, whole blood, or cerebrospinal fluid. Laboratories might choose to perform dengue and Zika virus NAATs and IgM antibody testing simultaneously rather than sequentially, or to perform dengue virus nonstructural protein-1 testing instead of dengue virus NAAT.

Indications to repeat assay(s): If the patient's illness has epidemiologic or clinical significance (e.g. first case of local transmission in area, new transmission mode, or unusual clinical syndrome), repeat a positive NAAT on newly extracted RNA from the same specimen. For indeterminate IgM antibody test results, repeat IgM antibody testing or perform PRNT on the same specimen. In areas where PRNTs are not performed, report the indeterminate results and request a second serum specimen for IgM antibody testing.

Detection of Anti-HAV after Vaccination

Correlate of protection. The correlate of protection is defined as an immune response (i.e. IgG anti-HAV titer) that is responsible for and statistically interrelated with protection. Anti-HAV levels are measured in comparison with a World Health Organization reference IG reagent and are expressed as milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). Seroconversion (response to vaccination) is defined as achieving a detectable and quantifiable postvaccination IgG anti-HAV level of ≥ 10 mIU/mL by standard assays. Seroprotection is considered a surrogate of clinical protection and persists when IgG anti-HAV levels remain higher than the correlate of protection.

The absolute lower limit of anti-HAV needed to prevent HAV infection has not been determined, although the limit is likely quite low because IG provides about 90% efficacy in preventing hepatitis A, and very low levels of anti-HAV are detected in IG recipients. The concentrations of anti-HAV achieved after passive transfer by IG or active induction by vaccination are tenfold to 100-fold lower than those produced in response to natural infection. Clinical studies have yielded limited data from which a minimum protective antibody level can be derived because vaccine-induced levels of antibody are usually high and few infections have been detected among vaccinated persons (i.e. vaccine failure). Antibody levels of 10–33 mIU/mL using different assays have been proposed as the threshold for protection from HAV infection in humans, although one study proposed that any detectable level of IgG anti-HAV might suggest protection. Because no absolute protective level has been defined, the lower limit of detection of the particular assay being used has generally typically been considered the protective level; postvaccination studies use ≥ 10 mIU/mL as the minimum protective level.

IgM anti-HAV after vaccination. HepA vaccination can induce detectable IgM anti-HAV, particularly if the test is conducted within a few weeks after vaccination. IgM anti-HAV has been detected 2–3 weeks after administration of 1 dose of vaccine in 8%–20% of adults (CDC, unpublished data, 1995). To reduce false-positive tests, persons should only be tested for IgM anti-HAV if they are symptomatic and suspected of having HAV infection.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111JH1PH]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV infection — testing recommendations and timing: HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing are recommended when acute HCV infection is suspected due to known exposure, clinical presentation, or elevated aminotransferase levels. HCV RNA typically becomes reliably detectable within 2–3 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibody typically occurs 2–3 months after exposure, on average; therefore, the best laboratory evidence is a positive HCV-RNA test in the setting of a negative HCV-antibody test or a positive HCV-antibody test after a prior negative anti-HCV test. When there has been a discrete, known, or suspected exposure, baseline HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing should be performed within 48 hours of the exposure; if baseline testing is negative, repeat testing for HCV antibody and HCV RNA is recommended, with frequency tailored to objectives (e.g., monthly testing to identify and treat acute infection).

Diagnosis of acute HCV — Interpretation of blood tests notes that the HCV antibody test may be negative during the first 6 weeks after exposure, seroconversion may be delayed or absent in immunosuppressed individuals, and presence of HCV antibody alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; HCV RNA may be transiently negative during acute HCV infection and presence of HCV RNA alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; and ALT findings include that fluctuating ALT peaks suggest acute infection, ALT may be normal during acute HCV infection, and ALT may be elevated due to other liver insults, such as alcohol consumption. If HCV antibody is positive but HCV RNA is undetectable, repeat HCV-RNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) testing is recommended to identify acute reinfection. Acute infection should be suspected if there is a rise in the ALT level without an alternative cause and also when there are low (especially < 10⁴ IU/mL) or fluctuating (> 1 log₁₀ IU/mL) HCV-RNA levels or spontaneous clearance during follow-up.

### Use of molecular epidemiology to inform response to a hepatitis A outbreak-los angeles county, California, October 2018-April 2019 [^112xVzuR]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

The findings in the report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the CA Cls A strain is a commonly identified cause of many national hepatitis A outbreaks, indicating that it might be an endemic strain. Therefore, it is possible that the outbreak-associated cases linked to the senior living campus represent a chain of transmission distinct from the cases among persons experiencing homelessness or using drugs. Second, HAV strain results must be interpreted in the context of the epidemiologic information. The interpretation of genotyping results from this investigation might have been limited by patients' not disclosing certain risk factors or exposures. Finally, the sensitivity of molecular testing for confirming hepatitis A can be reduced by improper specimen handling or if specimens are obtained after a substantial time has elapsed since symptom onset. Thus, it is possible that some anti-HAV IgM-positive cases were misclassified as false-positive case reports.

This outbreak response illustrates the value of using rapid HAV molecular testing to characterize an outbreak and guide the public health response to contain the outbreak. HAV genotyping can be helpful in identifying and interrupting the chain of transmission early in an outbreak when there are few cases. HAV genotyping in other contexts might provide additional insights into its optimal use for outbreak prevention and control.

Hepatitis A and E viruses (HAV/HEV) laboratory diagnosis notes that diagnosis of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is confirmed by detecting HAV IgM antibody, which may persist for up to 6 months after exposure. However, false-positive HAV IgM antibody results can occur in populations with low prevalence (eg, < 5%) of acute hepatitis A, and NAAT for HAV RNA may be necessary to confirm diagnosis. The presence of HAV IgG antibody indicates either past or resolved hepatitis A infection or immunity to this viral infection from vaccination, and the same hepatitis A status can be deduced by the presence of HAV total antibodies in an asymptomatic patient with normal liver tests and/or absence of HAV IgM antibody. Specimen handling in Table 58 includes EDTA tube, RT, ≤ 2 h; PPT tube, RT, ≤ 6 h; Clot or SST tube, RT, ≤ 2 h; and for HEV RNA, quantitative (viral load), SST tube, RT, ≤ 2 h.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnosis and screening — The diagnosis of HCV infection usually begins with an immunoassay for detection of HCV IgG or total antibodies in serum or plasma, but antibody may not be detectable until 6–10 weeks after the onset of clinical illness. Individuals with negative HCV antibody screening test results do not need further testing except in immunocompromised individuals, in whom development of HCV IgG antibody may be delayed for up to 6 months after exposure, or those suspected to have acute HCV infection. Those with positive initial HCV IgG or total antibody test results should undergo confirmatory or supplemental testing for HCV RNA with nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT); supplemental HCV IgG antibody assays can confirm antibodies but are not FDA-approved currently for clinical use in the United States. Per current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations, the following individuals should be screened for HCV infection: all adults aged > 18 years at least once, previously untested persons with risk factors, and pregnant women during each pregnancy except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is < 0.1%. HCV RNA can be detected soon after infection and NAAT can be qualitative or quantitative; highly sensitive molecular assays with a limit of detection of ≤ 25 IU/mL are necessary to monitor virologic response and to determine cure, and determination of HCV genotype and subtypes (ie, 1 to 6 and 1a vs 1b) is used to guide antiviral therapy choice and duration and to predict response.

Individuals with ≥ 3 months of HEV viremia are considered to have chronic hepatitis E, and quantification of HEV RNA in serum or plasma can be used to monitor disease progression and response to antiviral therapy; in the United States, only laboratory-developed immunoassays and NAAT are available for diagnosis or monitoring.

2.1 Patients and Samples

The study population consisted of individuals sequentially attended from October 2019 to May 2023 and were seeking care with clinical symptoms and signs suggestive of acute liver disease in a network of assistance to viral hepatitis, distributed throughout the five Brazilian regions: North, Northeast, South, Southeast, and Central West. They were sequentially attended from October 2019 to May 2023 and undergo tests for HAV (anti‐HAV IgG/IgM and PCR) from blood samples collected through the observational, prospective, and multicenter study entitled "Study of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of acute viral hepatitis in Brazilian healthcare services".

The eligibility criteria were defined as: (1) Symptomatic jaundice: sudden appearance of jaundice within 6 months before the start of the study, with or without additional symptoms such as fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, acholic stools, and dark urine; in laboratory investigations, the patient had an increase in aminotransferase levels ≥ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal‐ ULN); (2) Symptomatic non‐jaundice: participants without jaundice but presenting with one or more symptoms such as fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, myalgia; in laboratory investigations, they had an increase in aminotransferase levels ≥ 1.5 times the ULN); (3) Asymptomatic non‐jaundice: participants without jaundice or symptoms suggestive of acute hepatitis, but with a sudden increase in aminotransferase levels ≥ 1.5 times the ULN and/or participants with a known recognized close contact with a patient with confirmed viral hepatitis.

Blood samples collected by venipuncture, were properly identified with sequential labels provided and identified with the patients' full names and then centrifuged for serum or plasma separation. After collection, the samples were adequately processed, stored, and subsequently sent for analysis along with the completed documents to the Albert Einstein Clinical Pathology Laboratory in São Paulo, capital city of São Paulo State, Brazil.

This study was approved by the institutional research boards of all participating institutions (CONEP‐CAAE 00952818.4.1001.0071) and was previously described. The inclusion criteria were individuals aged ≥ 18 years who signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) or had their fingerprint collected in the ICF from illiterate patients. ICF was signed by a close relative if the patient was bedridden or unable to sign it. The study protocol conforms to the ethical guides of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki reflected in a priori approval by the institution´s human research committee.

Objectives

Diagnosing hepatitis E infection usually involves specific IgM testing, but sensitivity/specificity concerns mean many guidelines and practices include confirmatory tests. We studied whether additional information confirmatory tests provide justifies their use.

Methods

We examined 9131 records of anti-hepatitis E IgM assays, 7615 of IgG assays, and 1726 of RT-PCR assays from our regional laboratory, spanning October 2014-October 2018. We paired 495 IgM assay results with a RT-PCR result. We examined whether IgM results predicted PCR results, reviewed discrepant pairs, and investigated the correlation between IgG and PCR results in patients with strongly reactive IgM assays.

Results

Anti-hepatitis E IgM titres are bimodal. A high cut-off value optimises prediction of RNA detectability. 7/404 low-IgM samples had detectable RNA, 6 from immunosuppressed patients. 26/91 high-IgM samples did not have detectable RNA. In high-IgM samples, RNA detectability was not associated with IgG titre (one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.14).

Conclusions

In immunocompetent patients, tests beyond IgM seldom add clinically useful information. In patients with immunocompromise, IgM and RNA could contribute information. Additional tests' extra costs/intervention delays cannot be justified. IgM assay cut-offs should reflect titres' bimodal distribution, with values standardised using international units.

Abbreviations: ALT = alanine aminotransferase; HAV = hepatitis A virus; IgG = immunoglobulin G; IgM = immunoglobulin M.

Biochemical evidence of hepatitis includes elevated levels of serum bilirubin and serum hepatic enzymes, including ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. Elevations in AST and ALT levels usually occur 5–10 days before symptom onset. Serum bilirubin and aminotransferase levels usually return to normal by 2–3 months after illness onset.

Molecular epidemiologic technologies, when applied in combination with conventional epidemiologic methods, have been useful in investigating outbreaks and determining transmission links. The detection and sequencing of HAV RNA from water, food, and blood or stool of infected persons provide important information for tracing and characterizing HAV strains and identifying the source of water and foodborne hepatitis A outbreaks. HAV RNA can be detected using NAAT technologies in the blood and stool of the majority of persons during the acute phase of infection using NAAT technologies. HAV RNA in liver biopsies, cell cultures, or environmental samples can also be detected using various NAAT-based research methodologies. Growth of HAV in cell culture requires a long adaptation period and is associated with acquisition of various adaptive mutations in the viral genome. However, detection of serologic markers is sufficient for routine surveillance.

HBV/HIV screening and immunization in HCV — Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an FDA-approved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) assay and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with an FDA-approved HIV-antigen/antibody test is recommended; persons who test positive for HBsAg require additional monitoring during HCV treatment due to HBV reactivation risk, and anti-HBV therapy is another consideration for these patients. For persons who test negative for HBsAg but positive for hepatitis B core antibodies (with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies) have resolved HBV infection, and no further workup or additional monitoring is needed. Primary prevention measures for persons without coinfection include counseling about how to avoid contracting HIV and HBV and immunization against HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) as needed, and the CDC also recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all persons with chronic liver disease.

### Hepatitis E virus capsid antigen (HEV-Ag) – A practical diagnostic biomarker in the HEV outbreak scenario [^117PQkDz]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The increased global incidence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections, warrants accurate and affordable diagnostics across different geographical regions. The soluble and highly conserved HEV open reading frame 2 (ORF2) capsid antigen (HEV-Ag) is detectable in self-limited acute enteric hepatitis by HEV-Ag ELISA which is a promising serological assay in settings where HEV-RNA testing is not feasible. Our aim was to assess the HEV-Ag biomarker in an HEV outbreak in a low income country.

Methods

A prospective single center longitudinal study during HEV outbreaks in the Chittagong, Bangladesh region between October 2018 and October 2019 was conducted based on recruitment of acute jaundice cases with clinical signs and symptoms of suspect HEV infections. Acute HEV infection was defined as a positive test result for anti-HEV IgM antibodies.

Results

Forty four of the 51 enrolled enteric hepatitis cases (86%) were confirmed HEV by anti-HEV IgM ELISA at day 0 hospital entry. The anti-HEV-IgM and IgG were positive in all patients and did not reveal significant differences; neither between the time points day 0 and follow-up hospitalization on day 2–6 or day 7–10 nor between RNA-positive (n = 36) versus RNAnegative (n = 8) HEV groups. The HEV-Ag positivity was higher in viral RNA-positive (29/36, 81%) than the viral RNA-negative (1/8, 12%) group, p < 0.001 and the HEV-Ag levels positively correlated with viremia, r = 0.77, p < 0.0001. All non-HEV cases; n = 7 tested negative anti-HEV IgM and HEV-Ag and 5 of 7 (71%) tested anti-HAV IgM positive.

Conclusions

The HEV-Ag ELISA is a reliable and practical diagnostic tool in this acute HEV outbreak.

### Hepatitis B virus screening and management for patients with cancer prior to therapy: ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [^114XN4gN]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Interpretation of HBV serologies — test combinations map to infection status and assay caveats: For chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection the pattern across HBsAg, anti–hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), and anti–hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) is "Chronic HBV infection + + −"; for past HBV infection, patterns are "Resolved − + +" and "Isolated core − + −". The legend clarifies "(+) refers to a reactive (or positive) test result; (−) refers to a nonreactive (or negative) test result". Testing guidance specifies "Anti-HBc should be total immunoglobulin (Ig) or IgG test (not IgM, which if positive would indicate acute HBV infection)", and assay performance/caveat notes "Although the sensitivity and specificity of the anti-HBc test exceeds 99%, positive anti-HBc test results may, in rare cases, indicate a false-positive result (eg, after administration of intravenous Ig). As such, clinical assessment and evaluation may be warranted".

Table
Descriptive statistics of HAV infection and immune response in plasma donors, United States*

*Parameters listed were extracted based on donors who seroconverted (n = 9); donor F was excluded because of absence of seroconversion. For 4 cases, 1 additional donor was excluded from the analysis: donor B for ALT-related parameters (no visible ALT peak) and donor E for extrapolation of HAV doubling time (no early HAV RNA-positive sample available). ALT, alanine aminotransferase; HAV, hepatitis A virus; S/CO, signal-to-cutoff ratio. †Relative to day 0 (defined as collection date with first detectable HAV RNA).

The first HAV IgM-reactive plasma donations occurred a mean (± SD) of 21 (± 10) days from day 0; the first IgG-reactive donations were 25 (± 11) days from day 0. Day 0 is the first collection date that showed detectable HAV RNA. No clear association between key serologic and other parameters could be identified (e.g. higher HAV RNA titers were not associated with a faster IgM or IgG response). Analysis of IgM positivity patterns suggests that IgM remained reliably detectable for a median duration of 42 days (range 1–59 days) (Table) when measured by using the Abbot Architect HAVAb IgM assay. After this period, IgM might remain detectable (< 112 days after the first IgM-positive result), but not reliably, as suggested by IgM results fluctuating between positive, equivocal, and negative.

To assess whether liver function was affected during the course of asymptomatic/mild HAV infection, we measured ALT levels in all samples from donors who showed seroconversion. Only donor B lacked an ALT peak (Figure 4). For the other 8 donors, we found a median 27-fold increase in ALT over baseline (range 8- to 159-fold) and increased peak ALT titers (mean 452 IU/L, median 271 IU/L, range 40–1,262 IU/L) (Table). These data suggest that liver function is noticeably impacted during most infections, even if peak ALT levels in plasma donors were typically lower than those reported for cases of acute viral hepatitis in general (300–3,000 IU/L) and acute hepatitis A in particular (mean 2,000 IU/L and levels > 5,000 IU/L for 10% of cases). In several instances, ALT levels remained high for prolonged periods (donors G and J) or showed a second peak (donor C).

WHO recommends considering the introduction of hepatitis A vaccination for individuals aged 12 months or older based on the following criteria: transition from high to intermediate endemic level; an increasing trend of acute hepatitis, including severe disease among older children, adolescents or adults; and evidence of cost-effectiveness. Our survey findings indicate that most Indian states have intermediate endemicity of infection. We identified six studies in which patients with acute liver failure were tested for anti-HAV IgM and other hepatotropic viruses. The studies reported that HAV infection accounted for 21.4%–65.9% of acute liver failure cases. All the studies highlighted that HAV as one of the commonest causes of acute liver failure in both children and adults.,(Appendix p 19) However, these studies were limited to a few major cities, and there is a lack of data on the burden of symptomatic and severe disease across diverse geographic regions in India. There is a need for research to address this gap by generating evidence on the burden of symptomatic and severe HAV disease at the national level through existing surveillance systems and hospital-based data sources.

### Understanding the presence of false-positive antibodies in acute hepatitis [^116R7K5U]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Although false-positive antibodies (FPAs) have been well described in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), this has not been evaluated in acute viral hepatitis. Patients with acute viral hepatitis underwent antibody testing for other causes of liver disease and sexually transmitted diseases. Those with antibody positivity underwent confirmatory testing and monitoring. Patients with FPAs were compared with patients with acute hepatitis C infection without FPAs. In total 7 of 24 patients (29%) had FPAs. FPAs during acute viral hepatitis are associated with higher IgM levels and higher ESR in acute HCV. This has both mechanistic and clinical implications and should be evaluated further.

### Screening for hepatitis A and B antibodies in patients with chronic liver disease [^116NW3vx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is highly prevalent, and hepatitis C is one of the leading causes. Acute hepatitis A or B in patients with chronic hepatitis C can lead to more severe hepatic injury and a higher fatality rate than in patients without hepatitis C. Thus, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization recommend that persons with CLD be vaccinated against hepatitis A virus (HAV), and the ACIP and the National Institutes of Health recommend vaccination against both HAV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Because coinfection with HAV or HBV in patients with chronic hepatitis C or CLD is common, antibody screening prior to hepatitis A or B vaccination can identify patients who are already immune to these viruses and thus do not need to be vaccinated. Selective hepatitis A vaccination (i.e., vaccination of patients who test negative for either HAV antibody immunoglobulin G or total antibodies to HAV) is most cost-effective in areas where the local prevalence of hepatitis A is higher than the national prevalence and in populations with higher background rates of HAV exposure compared with the general population, such as older adults, foreign-born patients, African Americans, and persons with CLD or hepatitis C. Although not usually recommended for healthy adults or those with compensated CLD because of virtually 100% postvaccination seroconversion, serologic testing after hepatitis A vaccination is recommended in patients with decompensated or advanced end-stage liver disease because of the much lower seroconversion rates in these patients. Selective vaccination against HBV in patients with CLD or hepatitis C is also recommended. Testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is considered the most efficient and reasonably cost-effective method to screen for hepatitis B serologic markers because HBsAg identifies individuals with both acute and chronic HBV infection, and anti-HBs identify those who are immune secondary to vaccination or past infection. Testing for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen is needed to further distinguish between immunity due to vaccination and immunity due to past infection, but it is not recommended as the only screening test for HBV immunity. Postvaccination testing for hepatitis B seroconversion is recommended in all patients with CLD, especially in those with more advanced disease, because the rate of seroconversion is generally lower than in healthy adults. If patients with CLD are not adequately protected after a standard course of hepatitis B vaccination, a repeat course of vaccination using the standard schedule or an accelerated schedule (days 0, 7, and 21) should be considered.

### Dengue and zika virus diagnostic testing for patients with a clinically compatible illness and risk for infection with both viruses [^116BuTMa]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of results: Dengue and Zika virus IgM antibodies can be detected in serum for months following infection. The specific timing of infection cannot be determined. Data on the epidemiology of viruses known to be circulating at the location of exposure and clinical findings should be considered when interpreting the results of serologic diagnostic testing.

If both dengue and Zika virus NAATs are negative but either IgM antibody test is positive, confirmatory PRNTs should be performed against dengue, Zika, and other flaviviruses endemic to the region where exposure occurred. For indeterminate IgM antibody results, IgM antibody testing should be repeated on the same specimen or PRNTs performed. If IgM antibody results are positive for one virus but the assay for the other virus was not performed, the second assay should be performed to appropriately interpret results. If the second assay is not performed, the single positive result should be interpreted as "presumptive flavirivus infection". The interpretation for IgM and neutralizing antibody test results in a symptomatic pregnant woman is similar to that for nonpregnant patients; however, because dengue and Zika virus IgM antibodies can be detected in serum for months after an infection, the specific timing of infection cannot be determined, and other factors (e.g. epidemiologic and clinical findings) should be used to assess the likelihood that the current illness was due to either dengue or Zika virus and that exposure occurred during the pregnancy (Table). Pregnant women living in or returning from an area where there is an ongoing outbreak in which only one virus has been detected to be circulating should be tested by NAAT for evidence of infection with both dengue and Zika viruses; however, jurisdictions might elect to perform serologic diagnostic testing solely for the virus causing the outbreak.

Zika virus testing recommendations for asymptomatic pregnant women are unchanged. For asymptomatic pregnant women without ongoing risk for possible Zika virus infection, testing for Zika virus infection is not routinely recommended. However, testing should be considered using a shared decision-making model, in which patients and providers work together to make decisions about testing and care plans on the basis of patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced assessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's recommendations.

Clinical Question

What are the screening guidelines for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection for asymptomatic, nonpregnant adolescents and adults in the United States?

Bottom Line

Patients with a high risk of infection, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), who use injection drugs, or who live in a household where someone is infected with HBV; men who have sex with men; or patients who come from countries with a high prevalence of HBV infection, should be screened.

### Prevention of hepatitis B virus infection in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^111MkL5n]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Interpretation of Serologic Markers

Serologic markers for HBV infection include HBsAg, antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), immunoglobulin class M (IgM) antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc), and immunoglobulin class G (IgG) anti-HBc (IgG anti-HBc). At least one serologic marker is present during the different phases of infection. HBV DNA is a measure of viral load and reflects viral replication (Table 1). Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) can be detected in persons with acute or chronic HBV infection; the presence of HBeAg correlates with viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) correlates with the loss of replicating virus, although reversion to HBeAg positivity can occur.

Typical interpretation of test results for hepatitis B virus infection

Abbreviations: - = negative; + = positive; anti-HBc = antibody to hepatitis B core antigen; anti-HBs = antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen; HBsAg = hepatitis B surface antigen; HBV DNA = hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid; IgM = immunoglobulin class M.

### Accuracy assessment of total or IgG immunoglobulin to hepatitis A virus tests around immunity threshold [^116tpYDs]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) antibody titers at 20 IU/L are assumed to correlate with protection against HAV challenge.

Methods

We examined the accuracy and precision of currently in use immunoassays for total or anti-HAV IgG determination, by repeated testing of dilutions of the international anti-HAV standard, within a 10–50 IU/mL concentration range.

Results and Conclusion

Eight immunoassays were evaluated. All could confidently identify people who need to be vaccinated, or who might benefit from a booster vaccine: no positive interpretation for the 10 and 15 IU/mL concentrations. However, qualitative interpretation may differ from test to test in the 15–30 IU/mL range. This variation has to be taken into account when comparing seroprevalence data.

### Diagnosis of hepatitis E [^111iKE12]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis E, caused by infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV), is a common cause of enterically-transmitted acute hepatitis in developing countries. Occasional cases of sporadic hepatitis E have been increasingly recognized in developed countries over the past decade. These cases differ from those in developing countries in being possibly caused by zoonotic transmission, often affecting people with a suppressed immune system and occasionally leading to persistent HEV infection. The commonly used tests for HEV infection include detection of IgM and IgG anti-HEV antibodies and detection of HEV RNA. IgM anti-HEV antibodies can be detected during the first few months after HEV infection, whereas IgG anti-HEV antibodies represent either recent or remote exposure. The presence of HEV RNA indicates current infection, whether acute or chronic. Although several diagnostic assays for anti-HEV antibodies are available, they have undergone fairly limited testing and often provide discordant results, particularly for IgG antibodies. Thus, although the available antibody assays might be useful for case diagnosis in areas with high disease endemicity, their use for case diagnosis in areas with low endemicity and for seroprevalence studies remains problematic. Improved validation of existing anti-HEV antibody assays or development of new assays with superior performance characteristics is urgently needed.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^1161z9Un]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV diagnostic testing — limitations of the evidence supporting these recommendations include that evaluations of test performance were based on comparison with a composite standard consisting of a positive HIV-1 Western blot, the presence of HIV-1 RNA, or both, and clinical evidence from follow-up evaluations was rarely available to document true HIV status; therefore some false-positive test results might have gone undetected. Only two HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassays, one HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay, and one HIV-1 NAT were approved by the FDA for HIV diagnosis as of December 2012, and all performance evaluations were conducted with these assays, with additional evaluations required as new assays are introduced. Published studies document indeterminate results on the FDA-approved HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay in 0.8% to 1.4% of specimens with reactivity, and 11% to 15% of indeterminate specimens proved to be HIV-negative; no published follow-up data are available to definitively determine whether indeterminate results with detectable HIV-1 RNA represent an evolving antibody response or whether such results might persist during established infection. For HIV-2, little evidence exists for the timing of antibody development or the occurrence of acute HIV-2 infection in the United States, and no HIV-2 NAT is FDA-approved; 4th generation antigen/antibody combination assays detect IgM and IgG against both HIV-1 and HIV-2 as well as p24 antigen specific for HIV-1 but not p26/27, and the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay detects only IgG against HIV-1 and HIV-2.

### Diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and laboratory monitoring of its therapy [^112LHHUn]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Just after the identification and characterization of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 1989, tests for the detection of HCV antibodies or HCV RNA in serum were developed. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and confirmatory/supplemental analytical antibody tests were improved in sensitivity and specificity with the development of further generations of these assays. Application of molecular tests for detecting, quantifying, and characterization of the infecting virus became very important in management of HCV infection.

Objective and Design

This review summarizes the assays developed for the diagnosis and management of HCV infection. Strategies for the diagnosis and monitoring with the advantages and disadvantages of the assays based on the setting and goal are discussed according to data in the literature and our experience.

Results

Specific laboratory diagnostic tests for hepatitis C virus infection may be discussed under two titles: (i) Serological antibody tests which detect anti-HCV in serum or plasma; (ii) Molecular tests which detect HCV RNA genome, investigate viral load, and determine the characteristics of the genome. Strategies in different laboratory settings which screen populations with different HCV prevalences vary.

Conclusions

Anti-HCV positive result in a low-risk setting such as blood banks should be confirmed with an analytical antibody test. Then a HCV RNA test should be performed on serum of the person with a positive or indeterminate confirmatory test result. On the contrary, anti-HCV positive test result in high-risk population or a situation where HCV infection is suspected, it is likely to be true positive and confirmation with HCV RNA test will be significant. Quantitative HCV RNA test and genotyping should be performed if therapy is considered.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^113Vf5hB]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

HBsAg: The presence of HBsAg indicates HBV infection, either acute or chronic, except when it might be transiently positive shortly after a dose of HepB vaccine. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) defines chronic infection as the presence of HBsAg for at least 6 months.
Anti-HBs: The appearance of anti-HBs after a decline of HBsAg indicates recovery from HBV infection. Among immunocompetent persons never infected with HBV, anti-HBs at concentrations of ≥ 10 mIU/mL at 1–2 months after completion of a HepB vaccine series indicates immunity. Although certain persons might have anti-HBs of ≥ 10 mIU/mL after partial vaccination, whether this confers long-term protection is unknown. Among vaccine responders who completed a vaccine series, anti-HBs can decline over time to levels of < 10 mIU/mL; however, the majority are still immune and will mount an immune response to a vaccine challenge ≥ 35 years after vaccination. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) can provide anti-HBs for 4–6 months after administration; therefore, testing for anti-HBs ≤ 6 months after HBIG administration is not an accurate measure of a person's immune status.
Total anti-HBc: Total anti-HBc develops in all HBV infections, resolved or current, and typically persists for life. Persons whose immunity to HBV is from a vaccine do not develop anti-HBc. Assays for total anti-HBc detect both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to HBcAg; no test for IgG anti-HBc alone is commercially available. During the typical course of chronic infection, total anti-HBc and HBsAg will be present, whereas IgM anti-HBc will disappear (Figure 1). IgM anti-HBc should be ordered only when acute HBV infection is a concern.
Other markers (HBV DNA, HBeAg, and anti-HBe): HBV DNA is a measure of viral load. HBeAg is a marker for viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) can be used to monitor response to treatment and chronic HBV infection progression. After identifying a person with HBV infection, testing for HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA can provide information on the level of viral replication and infectivity and help guide clinical management.

Background information on HBV, including virus description, transmission, clinical features, natural history, and HepB vaccination seroprotection and coverage, is available (Supplementary Appendix 1).

### Active surveillance for acute viral hepatitis in rural villages in the nile delta [^116H9jMZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Acute viral hepatitis is less frequent in Egypt than serum antibody levels suggest. Because acute viral hepatitis has a wide clinical spectrum, we tested the hypothesis that many cases are undetected because of mild illness caused by initial, early-childhood exposure to hepatitis viruses.

Methods

During active case detection among 20,000 inhabitants of rural villages in Egypt, we screened 1715 symptomatic patients for serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Viral hepatitis markers were tested in 47 subjects who had ALT levels that were least twice the normal level.

Results

Of the 47 individuals tested, 4 children aged 3–5 years had immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV IgM). One also had a possible false-positive result to a test for IgM antibodies to hepatitis E virus. None had serological evidence of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, 33 of the remaining 43 had active HCV infection, having both antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) and HCV RNA. Four others anti-HCV without HCV RNA, and 2 others had seroconversion to anti-HCV during follow-up. Two patients who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen had chronic HBV infection. Only 3 with elevated ALT levels had no evidence of acute or chronic infections with known hepatitis viruses. Immunoglobulin G antibodies to hepatitis E virus was detected in 40 patients.

Conclusion

Active surveillance covering approximately 50,000 person-years detected only 4 cases of acute HAV infection. Almost all persons with mild symptoms and elevated ALT levels had serological evidence of chronic viral hepatitis, most often associated with HCV. Many of these cases were probably "flare-ups" of HCV infection or incidental illness in patients with chronic HCV infection, but some could have been caused by difficult-to-confirm initial HCV infections. Although serological evidence for exposures was highly prevalent, hepatitis viruses seldom caused acute viral hepatitis in these communities.

Supplemental Testing for HCV Antibody

If testing is desired to distinguish between true positivity and biologic false positivity for HCV antibody, then, testing may be done with a second HCV antibody assay approved by FDA for diagnosis of HCV infection that is different from the assay used for initial antibody testing. HCV antibody assays vary according to their antigens, test platforms, and performance characteristics, so biologic false positivity is unlikely to be exhibited by more than one test when multiple tests are used on a single specimen.

### Coexistence of IgM antihepatitis A virus and IgM antihepatitis E virus in acute viral hepatitis: a prospective, multicentre study in Korea [^111LeU3L]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2011). Low credibility.

This study investigated the clinical, serological and molecular characteristics of coexistence of both immunoglobulin M (IgM) antihepatitis A virus (HAV) and IgM antihepatitis E virus (HEV) in acute viral hepatitis using a prospective, multicentre design. Among a total of 771 symptomatic cases with acute viral hepatitis enrolled in a Korean city from September 2006 to August 2008, coexistence of IgM anti-HAV and IgM anti-HEV was found in 43 patients (A+E group; 6%), while the existence of IgM anti-HAV alone was found in 595 patients (A group; 77%) and that of IgM anti-HEV alone in 14 patients (E group; 2%). Clinical data analysis and measurement of IgM and IgG anti-HEV were performed using two different commercial kits, and HAV RNA and HEV RNA were detected in available serum or stool samples. The clinical features of the A+E group were similar to those of the A group. HAV RNA detection rates in the A+E and A group were similar, while HEV RNA was detected only in the stool samples of the E group, not in the A+E group. Comparative testing of anti-HEV using two different ELISA kits showed markedly discordant results for IgM anti-HEV positivity and consistently low positivity for IgG anti-HEV in the A+E group. Coexistence of IgM anti-HEV measured by the Genelabs ELISA kit in the setting of hepatitis A appears to yield false-positive results in nonendemic areas of HEV infection. Diagnosis of hepatitis E using IgM anti-HEV should be made with caution.

Hepatitis D virus (HDV) testing in the context of hepatitis B — In acute HDV superinfection of chronic hepatitis B, HDV antigen, HDV IgM, and total antibodies are detectable, and in acute hepatitis B and D coinfection these markers are present along with HBc IgM antibody; HDV total antibody testing followed by HDV NAAT for antibody-positive specimens is recommended for HBsAg-positive individuals at risk (including those with HIV infection, persons who inject drugs, those who have sex with men, and immigrants from areas of high HDV endemicity). Because HDV is an RNA virus, quantification of HDV RNA in plasma or serum has been used clinically to monitor progression and treatment response, and currently only laboratory-developed immunoassays and NAAT are available in the United States for the diagnosis or monitoring of hepatitis D.

### Diagnostic relevance of immunoglobulin G avidity for hepatitis A virus [^112sQUCT]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is based on the detection of HAV immunoglobulin M (IgM). However, IgM could be detected due to nonspecific polyclonal activation of the immune system. An avidity test for anti-HAV IgG was developed to distinguish acute infection, where low-avidity antibodies are detected, from immune reactivation. The assay was tested on 104 samples, including 11 sera from patients with past infection, 15 sera from patients with acute infection and 4 collected after recovery, 10 sera from vaccinated subjects, 4 sera from patients with suspected immune reactivation, and 60 unselected HAV-IgM positive sera, collected over 1 year in a routine laboratory. The avidity index (AI) was expressed as percentage. The results were provided as the mean ± one standard deviation. Patients with a history of prior infection had AIs of > 70% (mean, 86% ± 10), whereas the mean AI was 36% ± 16 during acute HAV infection (P < 0.001). Within the first month after the onset of hepatitis, avidity was either noncalculable due to a very low IgG titer or < 50%. In patients with immune reactivation, avidity was > 70% (88% ± 10%), a finding consistent with a prior infection. Among the 60 unselected sera, 35 (58%) had a noncalculable or < 50% avidity, and most of them had a detectable HAV RNA, confirming HAV infection. In contrast, 16 (27%) had an avidity of > 70%, and none was reverse transcription-PCR positive, suggesting immune reactivation. These 16 patients were significantly older than the others (50 ± 16 years versus 26 ± 14 years). The new anti-HAV IgG avidity assay we developed could improve HAV infection diagnosis, particularly in elderly patients.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnostic algorithm for current infection or reinfection — For diagnosis of current initial HCV infection, begin with HCV-antibody testing and for recurrent HCV infection, begin with HCV-RNA testing; ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing. Persons who have a reactive HCV-antibody test and a negative (not detected) HCV-RNA test should be informed that they do not have evidence of current HCV infection, with terminal pathways labeled "No Current HCV Infection" or "Additional Testing as Appropriate", whereas when infection is present the pathway labels "Current HCV Infection" and "Link to Care for Treatment or Retreatment". HCV-RNA testing is required to detect reinfection, and for persons who might have been exposed to HCV within the past 6 months or who are immunocompromised, testing for HCV RNA should be performed; repeat HCV-RNA testing if the person tested is suspected to have had HCV exposure within the past 6 months or has clinical evidence of HCV disease or if there is concern regarding the handling or storage of the test specimen.

### Seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against hepatitis – A infection among individuals aged 6–30 years in India, 2021: a nationwide population-based cross-sectional study [^11628d8s]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Procedures

We tested the serum samples using the ARCHITECT HAVAb-IgG assay (Abbott) for the presence of IgG anti-HAV. The presence of IgG antibodies indicates either a past infection or vaccination against HAV. The presence of IgG anti-HAV in the specimen was determined by comparing the chemiluminescent signal in the reaction (measured as relative light units (RLUs)) to the cutoff signal determined from an active calibration. Specimens with signal to cutoff (S/CO) values ≥ 1.00 are considered reactive, whereas S/CO values < 1.00 are non-reactive. The assay has a sensitivity of ≥ 98% and specificity of ≥ 99.2% (95% CI: 98.4%–99.6%). We randomly selected five percent of samples and retested them for quality control.

ALT alanine aminotransferase, ULN upper limit of normal, HEV hepatitis E virus, HBsAg hepatitis B surface antigen. * Hepatitis E-related laboratory testing was not completed for 80 events because of insufficient sample availability. Individuals exhibiting hepatitis-like symptoms (fatigue or loss of appetite) lasting for three or more consecutive days underwent ALT testing. Suspected hepatitis cases were defined as those with ALT levels at least 2.5 times the ULN, indicating acute hepatitis. Preliminary hepatitis typing tests, including assays for HBsAg, hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), hepatitis A virus IgM antibody, hepatitis C virus IgG antibody and anti-HEV IgM, was performed on the first serum sample from each suspected case. A second serum sample was required to be collected 2–6 weeks later and also tested for anti-HEV IgM. Any positive result for anti-HEV IgM in either of the two samples prompted regular follow-up sampling until ALT levels normalized or symptoms resolved. All serial serum samples were sent to a central laboratory for hepatitis E diagnosis. A positive diagnosis for hepatitis E was made if at least two acute HEV markers were present (i.e. HEV RNA, IgM anti-HEV, and a fourfold or greater increase in IgG anti-HEV).

### Evaluation of three commercially available hepatitis C virus antibody detection assays under the conditions of a clinical virology laboratory [^112a5sEv]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Most studies evaluating antibody detection assays are conducted on samples from healthy blood donors but not on samples of hospitalized patients which can show non-specific reactions.

Objectives

To compare the performance of three commercial automated assays for the detection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies, Monolisa anti-HCV Plus version 2, Axsym anti-HCV 3.0 and Vitros anti-HCV, on a population of hospitalized patients.

Study Design

The specificity of the assays was prospectively evaluated in 2020 routine serum samples. In order to assign the serostatus of each sample, those giving positive or discordant results were further tested by three immunoblots and by RT-PCR (Roche). Moreover, the sensitivity was evaluated on eight commercial HCV seroconversion panels.

Results

The Monolisa, Axsym and Vitros assays showed specificities of 99.64%, 99.12% and 99.33%, respectively. Concerning the sensitivity, among 49 samples, the number of positive results was 21, 24 and 24 for the Monolisa, Axsym and Vitros kits, respectively. The differences were not statistically significant at an alpha risk of 5%.

Conclusions

All assays appeared to be reliable for routine screening, but there were a surprising number of indeterminate samples that could not be resolved by confirmatory tests.

### Hepatitis E virus infection as a possible cause of acute liver failure in Europe [^115GVXgS]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

In Western countries, infection with the hepatitis E virus (HEV) is considered to be rare and imported from endemic regions. However, the prevalence of HEV infection has increased among adults in central Europe. HEV infection can cause acute liver failure (ALF), but there have been only a few confirmed cases of HEV-associated ALF in Europe. We investigated the number of cases of indeterminate ALF associated with HEV infection.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of 80 patients diagnosed with ALF or acute hepatitis at the University Hospital Essen in Germany from November 2006 through December 2013. Clinical data were collected from the hospital databases; archived sera were tested for IgG and IgM against HEV, as well as HEV RNA.

Results

Sera from 12 patients (15%) tested positive for IgG against HEV IgG; 7 of these samples did not test positive for HEV IgM or HEV RNA. Sera from 64 patients (80%) did not test positive for IgG or IgM against HEV or HEV RNA. Sera from 8 patients (10%) tested positive for HEV RNA (only 4 of these were positive for HEV IgG) and had clinical findings to support acute HEV infection.

Conclusions

In a hospital in Germany, approximately 10% to 15% of patients with ALF had evidence for HEV infection. Serologic tests for IgG against HEV are insufficient to identify or exclude HEV infection; tests for HEV RNA also should be performed on patients with ALF of ambiguous etiology.

### The added value of hepatitis E diagnostics in determining causes of hepatitis in routine diagnostic settings in the Netherlands [^111tSPkM]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 is endemic in Europe and an underdiagnosed and emerging (public) health issue. In recent years commercial enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) that detect antibodies to HEV more adequately, became available. We investigated the added value of this HEV serology in the diagnostic work flow to detect viral causes of recent hepatitis.

Methods

During a 2-year period (May 2013 to May 2015), HEV serology was added to the hepatitis work flow, consisting of serological detection of hepatitis viruses A, B and C (HAV, HBV, HCV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Samples positive for HEV IgM were also analysed using PCR to detect HEV RNA. If positive, HEV sequencing was performed for genotyping purposes.

Results

In 235 out of 2521 patients (9.3%), a viral cause for hepatitis was found. Recent HAV, HBV, HCV, EBV or CMV infections were serologically diagnosed in 3, 34, 10, 69 and 42 patients, respectively. Seventy-eight patients (3.1%) had a recent HEV infection. In 49 of them, sufficient HEV RNA was present for genotyping. All patients were infected with HEV genotype 3.

Conclusions

In our region, an HEV infection is the most frequently diagnosed viral cause for recent hepatitis. These results indicate that, in a country where HEV is endemic, serological HEV diagnostics should be added to the standard work-up for viral hepatitis.

### Unexpected long-lasting anti-HEV IgM positivity: is HEV antigen a better serological marker for hepatitis E infection diagnosis? [^116BRRez]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the leading cause of acute hepatitis worldwide. The minimum criterion for diagnosis of acute infection is detection of anti-HEV antibodies, although there are scant data on IgM duration. Our aim was to assess the persistence of HEV markers after acute self-limited hepatitis E. HEV serological tests (IgM by Mikrogen and Wantai and HEV-Ag) and HEV RNA were carried out in two cohorts: (a) patients with prior acute hepatitis E (ALT > 10 × ULN plus positive IgM ± HEV RNA) currently self-limited and (b) 50 blood donors with positive HEV RNA. Among 25 cases of prior acute hepatitis E, after a median follow-up of 34 months, all presented undetectable HEV RNA. However, anti-HEV IgM remained detectable in 14 (56%) by Mikrogen, 6 (24%) by Wantai and none for HEV-Ag. Anti-HEV IgM tested positive in 80%-100% within the second year and 17%-42% over 3 years later, by Wantai and Mikrogen, respectively. Among HEV RNA-positive donors, 12 (25%) tested positive for either IgM by Mikrogen or Wantai, 9 (18%) for both and 18 (36%) for HEV-Ag. HEV-Ag positivity was more likely as HEV RNA was higher (14% if < 2.2 log IU/mL; 64% if RNA ≥ 3.7). Overall, HEV-Ag performed best, with a positive predictive value of 100% and diagnostic accuracy of 57%. Anti-HEV IgM exhibited unexpectedly long persistence after a self-limited acute hepatitis E. HEV-Ag had the best performance and could be especially useful in settings where HEV RNA is not available.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^111QCSP3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Hepatitis B — serologic dynamics, window period, and chronic infection markers: In acute infection, HBsAg appearance predates clinical symptoms by 4 weeks and remains detectable for 1–6 weeks; HBs antibody indicates recovery and immunity, and in most self-limited acute infections HBsAg and HBs antibody are not detectable simultaneously in serum or plasma. HBc IgM antibody appears during acute or recent infection and remains detectable for about six months, with a serologic "window" from 6 to 8 months after infection when HBsAg disappears and HBs antibody becomes undetectable, during which infection can be diagnosed by detecting HBc IgM. HBc total antibodies appear at symptom onset and persist for life. A chronic hepatitis B carrier state is defined by persistence of HBsAg for at least 6 months; in chronic hepatitis B, HBeAg in serum or plasma is a marker of high viral replication, and loss of HBeAg with emergence of HBe antibody is usually associated with improvement of underlying hepatitis and reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis; disappearance of HBeAg may denote a precore mutant virus when high HBsAg and HBV DNA are present with HBe antibody. HBV DNA is present in serum or plasma in acute and chronic infection, and quantification of HBV DNA in serum or plasma may be included in the initial evaluation and management of chronic hepatitis B infection, especially when serologic results are inconclusive or when deciding treatment initiation and monitoring patient's response; other molecular tests include viral genotype, genotypic drug resistance mutations, and core promoter/precore mutations.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis of acute or chronic HBV infection requires serologic testing (Table 5). Because HBsAg is present in both acute and chronic infection, presence of IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) is diagnostic of acute or recently acquired HBV infection. Antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is produced after a resolved infection and is the only HBV antibody marker present after vaccination. The presence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, with a negative test for IgM anti-HBc, indicates chronic HBV infection. The presence of total anti-HBc alone might indicate acute, resolved, or chronic infection or a false-positive result.

Abbreviations: anti-HBc = antibody to hepatitis B core antigen; anti-HBs = antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen; HBIG = hepatitis B immune globulin; HBsAg = hepatitis B surface antigen; IgM = immunoglobulin M.

* - = negative test result; + = positive test result.

† To ensure that an HBsAg-positive test result is not false positive, samples with repeatedly reactive HBsAg results should be tested with a neutralizing confirmatory test cleared by the Food and Drug Administration.

§ Persons positive for only anti-HBc are unlikely to be infectious, except under unusual circumstances involving direct percutaneous exposure to large quantities of blood (e.g. blood transfusion or organ transplantation) or mutant HBsAg-related infection.

Treatment

No specific therapy is available for persons with acute HBV infection; treatment is supportive. Persons with chronic HBV infection should be referred for evaluation to a provider experienced in managing such infections. Therapeutic agents approved by FDA for treatment of chronic HBV infection can achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease.

### Future directions in acute liver failure [^1179g3Zn]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Future directions

Greater awareness of the importance of etiology in determining prognosis may further improve outcomes. In addition, incorporation of objective and quantitative serum prognostic biomarkers and bedside dynamic indices of global hepatic function may provide even better accuracy in identifying which individual patients require LT (see below).

Causality assessment and indeterminate ALF

Despite the use of modern radiological, serological, and molecular testing, 5%–10% of North American patients do not have an identifiable cause of ALF. The majority of these patients with "indeterminate ALF" present with a viral prodrome of fever and malaise and have a clinical picture that is similar to patients with HBV-related or AIH-related ALF. Over the years, a number of ancillary studies of the ALFSG have sought to assign known causes of ALI and ALF to these indeterminate cases. However, occult HBV, herpes simplex virus, and HEV infections have not been identified. A study of 187 patients with "indeterminate ALF" applied metagenomic sequencing and failed to identify any novel viral pathogens or unsuspected cases of ALF due to known viruses.

In 2016, the ALFSG assembled an Adjudication Committee of experienced hepatologists to review all cases enrolled in its registry using standardized diagnostic criteria, while adding testing of some critical but previously omitted diagnostic serologies, also testing banked biosamples with new methods. This approach led to a reclassification of 142 of the 303 indeterminate ALF cases (47%) to a known cause, which included 45 cases of previously unrecognized APAP overdose that were identified through detection of serum APAP-protein adducts. Reclassification also included 34 cases adjudicated to probable AIH ALF using a combination of serum autoantibody profiles, quantitative IgG levels, and a review of liver histology. Lastly, 24 cases of previously unrecognized idiosyncratic DILI were identified using an adaptation of the expert opinion causality scale published by the DILI Network (DILIN). An early assessment of suspected DILI-related ALF by Reuben et alfrom 1999 to 2008 demonstrated 133 cases attributed to over 60 individual agents, with antituberculosis drugs and sulfonamides most frequently implicated. A more recent analysis of all 277 probable DILI-related ALI and ALF cases enrolled from 1998 to 2019 demonstrated that the incidence of injury from herbal and dietary supplement products increased over time while the frequency of antimicrobials decreased with improved overall survival. These data demonstrate the importance of careful prospective assessment of the etiology of ALF using standardized, predefined diagnostic criteria.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to serologic testing, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain a single serological assay for the detection of HBsAg before further evaluation for HBV DNA and staging of liver disease in settings or populations with an HBsAg seroprevalence of ≥ 0.4%.

Blood tests

A panel of tests is required to identify current or past hepatitis infection. Patients should be tested for HCV antibody and, if positive, should undergo HCV RNA testing for confirmation; the presence of HCV RNA indicates active infection. The following tests are recommended for HBV: hepatitis B surface antigen, which is indicative of HBV infection; hepatitis B surface antibody, which reflects immunity to infection; hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) immunoglobulin G (IgG), which may indicate current or previous HBV infection; and HBcAb immunoglobulin M (IgM), which may be the only detectable indicator of HBV during the period of acute infection. In hepatitis B surface antigen–positive patients, it is necessary to test for HBV DNA (which confirms chronic infection if present) and hepatitis D virus antibody, which, if positive, implies the need to assay hepatitis D virus (HDV) RNA to confirm coinfection/superinfection with HDV causing a higher rate of cirrhosis and its complications than HBV monoinfection. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is confirmed by the detection of IgM (active infection) and IgG (past infection) antibodies for HAV.HBV and HAV vaccinations are recommended for unexposed and unvaccinated patients.

### Multiple factors contribute to positive results for hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M antibody [^1125NRG7]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Context

In the United States, a successful vaccination program for hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection has decreased both its incidence and the true positive rate for diagnostic immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to HAV in acute hepatitis.

Objective

To survey positive results of HAV IgM tests and determine the effect of changing ordering options.

Design

We reviewed all positive results for IgM antibody to HAV between January 2007 and December 2010. Patient demographics, clinical history, and laboratory data were recorded and the encounter, order, and reason for test reviewed. Each result was categorized as indicating acute, recent, resolved, or indeterminate HAV infection.

Results

A total of 10,735 tests were performed; 35 patients had 49 positive results. Most positive test results were associated with outpatient visits and were ordered in the assessment of patients with liver disease, but not clinical acute hepatitis. In the final analysis, 4 patients had acute hepatitis A and 20 individual patients had recent and/or resolved hepatitis. All but 1 of the remaining 11 patients had another established cause of liver disease with a positive IgM HAV antibody test result; data to determine causality were insufficient. The total number of tests requested annually decreased more than 35% with the introduction of computerized physician order entry.

Conclusions

Current assays for IgM HAV antibodies are overused in the absence of clinical acute hepatitis; future clinical decision support may improve patterns of order entry. Most patients have findings consistent with HAV exposure but not acute hepatitis; dormant viral infection may be a continuing source of antigen.
