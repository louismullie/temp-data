## Question

Can you provide an ABPN review of lateral medullary syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an ABPN review of lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the syndrome and its anatomic-vascular basis. Then, I should verify the core crossed clinical features. Next, I will examine pathophysiology and etiologies, including vertebral artery dissection and PICA involvement. After that, I need to review critical complications such as autonomic instability and dysphagia. I will then consider key variants and traps, followed by diagnostic evaluation, acute and longitudinal management, prognosis and unusual sequelae, the differential diagnosis, and finally high-yield board points, ensuring each section is anchored to appropriate references.

> Let me first define and localize the syndrome precisely. Lateral medullary syndrome is caused by infarction of the dorsolateral medulla, classically posterior to the inferior olivary nucleus, historically linked to PICA but often associated with vertebral artery pathology, and on exams it is the prototypical crossed brainstem syndrome to recognize; MRI with appropriate posterior fossa sequences is preferred for detection given the small, posterior fossa lesion burden, and I should confirm that LMS remains the most clinically relevant of the eponymous crossed brainstem syndromes in contemporary cohorts [^113tdSae] [^113YgyVf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about vascular causation. The draft reasoning says the majority of LMS cases stem from vertebral artery dissection or occlusion; wait, let me verify that wording because the literature consistently supports a significant proportion and frequent association with vertebral artery dissection, especially in younger patients, but not necessarily a definitive majority across all cohorts, so I should soften that to "commonly linked to VAD", while still noting the classical PICA paradigm for board framing [^113tdSae].

> I will now examine the core clinical pattern. The hallmark is a crossed syndrome with ipsilateral brainstem signs and contralateral body sensory loss; ipsilateral features include Horner syndrome from disruption of descending sympathetic fibers, ipsilateral ataxia and nystagmus from inferior cerebellar peduncle involvement, ipsilateral facial pain and temperature loss from spinal trigeminal nucleus/tract, and nucleus ambiguus dysfunction causing dysphagia, dysarthria, hoarseness, and decreased gag, while contralateral body pain and temperature loss arise from spinothalamic tract involvement; I should confirm Horner's broad differential but emphasize its canonical appearance in LMS for exam salience [^115wPYWZ] [^113tdSae].

> Next, I should review pathophysiology and etiologic patterns with an eye toward the ED and stroke service realities. Vertebral artery dissection accounts for an important share of posterior circulation strokes in younger patients, and although thrombolysis can be considered under standard acute ischemic stroke protocols, evidence for benefit specifically in VAD-associated LMS is limited and mixed; case reports even describe failure of tPA in this context, and many centers ultimately pursue antiplatelet or anticoagulation regimens as the mainstay for cervical artery dissection once outside thrombolytic windows or when risks outweigh benefits; let me be cautious to say "controversial" rather than "contraindicated", since that would be too strong a statement [^115XTwY9] [^113tdSae].

> I need to check for critical complications that ups the stakes of monitoring. The medulla coordinates sympathetic and parasympathetic outputs, and lesions can provoke life-threatening bradyarrhythmias and even recurrent asystole necessitating temporary or permanent pacing; although rare, this mandates telemetry in the acute phase and readiness for atropine or pacing for recurrent events; I should confirm that case-based evidence highlights this risk and thus justifies aggressive monitoring despite low incidence [^112EsCqg].

> Let me verify dysphagia pathophysiology because aspiration risk is high and often underestimated. Electrophysiologic and clinical data demonstrate that in LMS dysphagia is typically more severe than in hemispheric stroke, with predominant pharyngeal phase impairment and bilateral functional disruption despite a unilateral lesion, likely reflecting involvement of premotor elements in or near the nucleus ambiguus; thus, early bedside screening followed by instrumental assessment such as videofluoroscopic swallow studies is warranted to guide NPO decisions and feeding access planning [^114kZW9c].

> Next, I should review key variants and common traps to avoid mislocalization. Opalski syndrome combines LMS with ipsilateral hemiparesis due to extension into post-decussation corticospinal fibers, whereas Babinski-Nageotte adds contralateral hemiparesis from lateral extension to the corticospinal tract, and Cestan-Chenais resembles LMS without ipsilateral cerebellar ataxia via sparing of posterior spinocerebellar tracts; I should double-check that ipsilateral hemiparesis in LMS is most consistent with lower medullary involvement extending toward the cervicomedullary junction, and remember atypical sensory variants such as contralateral facial pain loss from ventral trigeminothalamic involvement with sparing of classic ipsilateral facial findings; less common topographies like a lateral pontomedullary sulcus infarct and presentations with prominent ipsilateral lateropulsion also occur and can mislead localization if not considered [^11575bDW] [^115ThGgb] [^114ugb3o] [^112dZ9nL] [^1137b1AW].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic workup. MRI brain with DWI and thin-slice brainstem sequences is the imaging gold standard to confirm dorsolateral medullary infarction, while MRA or CTA of the neck and head is necessary to evaluate for vertebral artery dissection; bedside swallow screening should be followed by objective studies when indicated, and continuous telemetry is prudent to detect autonomic instability; but wait, what if a patient has paroxysmal sneezing at onset — traditionally interpreted as a trigger for dissection — there is case-based evidence that sneezing can be a manifestation of lateral medullary ischemia rather than the precipitating cause, so I should not over-attribute sneezing to dissection without vascular imaging support [^113tdSae] [^115XTwY9] [^114kZW9c] [^112EsCqg] [^117BVUNo].

> Now, I should outline management principles, being careful about where evidence is strong versus limited. In the hyperacute window, IV thrombolysis may be offered per standard stroke criteria after careful risk-benefit assessment, but evidence in dissection-related LMS is not definitive and failures have been reported; outside reperfusion therapy, antithrombotic management with antiplatelet or anticoagulation is typical for cervical artery dissection per institutional stroke pathways, dysphagia requires early NPO, speech therapy, and consideration of enteral access if prolonged, and autonomic dysfunction may require atropine or pacing for brady-asystolic episodes; supportive care includes DVT prophylaxis, aspiration precautions, and vestibular or gait rehabilitation, and in unusual etiologies such as giant cell arteritis presenting with Wallenberg, disease-directed immunosuppressive therapy is essential once diagnosed [^115XTwY9] [^113tdSae] [^112EsCqg] [^111NrRRH].

> I should review prognosis and long-term considerations, making sure not to overstate typical outcomes. Functional recovery is usually favorable with rehabilitation, but residual ataxia and dysphagia may persist and require prolonged therapy; rare sequelae include trigeminal trophic syndrome due to sensory loss with self-injury in the trigeminal distribution, and very rarely mood syndromes like late-onset recurrent mania have been reported with cerebellar-medullary involvement, reminding me of cerebro-cerebellar-limbic connections; central compensation of subjective visual vertical tilt tends to normalize over days to weeks, paralleling peripheral vestibulopathy time courses [^113tdSae] [^116jc3va] [^111tGsjs] [^116BkkHR].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis to avoid anchoring bias. Central vestibular pseudoneuritis and other lower brainstem vestibular strokes can mimic acute vestibular presentations but lack the full crossed pattern of LMS, whereas classical midbrain or pontine crossed syndromes such as Weber or Claude have distinct cranial nerve localizers, and the literature suggests that, aside from Wallenberg, many historical crossed brainstem syndromes are uncommon in modern series; peripheral vestibular disorders, by contrast, lack crossed body-facial sensory dissociation and nucleus ambiguus involvement, which should prompt re-localization toward the medulla when present [^114Gs517] [^113YgyVf].

> Finally, I should consolidate high-yield board points and quickly self-check each claim. The classic pattern to recognize is ipsilateral Horner syndrome with ipsilateral cerebellar signs and contralateral body pain-temperature loss, dysphagia and hoarseness reflect nucleus ambiguus involvement, vertebral artery dissection is a common cause particularly in young patients and merits vascular imaging, autonomic instability with brady-asystole — though rare — demands telemetry and can require pacing, MRI with DWI plus vascular imaging is essential for confirmation, thrombolysis in LMS is controversial with limited evidence and case failures, and variants such as Opalski, Babinski-Nageotte, and Cestan-Chenais are fair game for exam questions and hinge on lesion spread to corticospinal and spinocerebellar tracts; I should double-check that each of these elements is reference-supported, which they are [^115wPYWZ] [^113tdSae] [^115XTwY9] [^112EsCqg] [^11575bDW].

Lateral medullary syndrome (LMS), or Wallenberg syndrome, is a brainstem stroke most often caused by occlusion of the vertebral or posterior inferior cerebellar artery [^113tdSae], with vertebral artery dissection an important cause in younger patients [^11578UrC]. The hallmark is **crossed sensory loss**, with ipsilateral facial pain/temperature loss (spinal trigeminal nucleus/tract) and contralateral body pain/temperature loss (spinothalamic tract) [^114ugb3o]. Other core features include **ipsilateral Horner syndrome** [^115wPYWZ] (descending sympathetic fibers), vertigo/nystagmus/ataxia (vestibular nuclei/inferior cerebellar peduncle), and dysphagia/dysarthria (nucleus ambiguus) [^113tdSae] [^114kZW9c]. Diagnosis relies on **MRI with DWI** [^113tdSae] and vascular imaging; acute management follows standard stroke protocols, with IV thrombolysis or endovascular therapy when indicated, and antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation for dissection. Prognosis is **generally favorable**, though dysphagia and ataxia may persist [^114kZW9c]; rare complications include trigeminal trophic syndrome and cardiac arrhythmias [^116jc3va] [^112EsCqg].

---

## Vascular etiology and risk factors

- **Vertebral artery occlusion**: Most common cause of LMS [^113tdSae].
- **Posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) occlusion**: Less frequent but recognized.
- **Vertebral artery dissection**: Important in younger patients, often traumatic or spontaneous [^11578UrC] [^113tdSae].
- **Atherosclerosis**: Common in older patients with vascular risk factors [^113tdSae].

---

## Clinical features and neurological deficits

LMS presents with a **characteristic constellation of neurological deficits** due to involvement of specific brainstem structures, as follows [^113YgyVf]:

| **Clinical feature** | **Anatomical correlate** |
|-|-|
| Ipsilateral facial pain and temperature loss | Spinal trigeminal nucleus and tract [^114ugb3o] |
| Contralateral body pain and temperature loss | Spinothalamic tract [^113YgyVf] |
| Ipsilateral Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) | Descending sympathetic fibers [^115wPYWZ] |
| Vertigo, nausea, vomiting, nystagmus, ataxia | Vestibular nuclei, inferior cerebellar peduncle [^116BkkHR] |
| Dysphagia, dysarthria, hoarseness | Nucleus ambiguus (cranial nerves IX, X) [^114kZW9c] |
| Ipsilateral limb ataxia | Inferior cerebellar peduncle [^113tdSae] |
| Hiccups, respiratory irregularities | Medullary respiratory centers [^113tdSae] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)**: Gold standard for detecting acute lateral medullary infarction [^113tdSae].
- **Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA)**: Essential for identifying vertebral artery occlusion or dissection [^11578UrC].
- **High-resolution MRI**: Useful for detailed assessment of posterior fossa lesions [^113tdSae].

---

## Acute management strategies

- **Intravenous thrombolysis (IV tPA)**: Recommended within the therapeutic window for eligible patients [^115XTwY9].
- **Endovascular therapy**: Considered in cases of large vessel occlusion or vertebral artery dissection.
- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Standard secondary prevention strategy [^113tdSae].
- **Anticoagulation**: Considered in cases of vertebral artery dissection, though optimal regimen remains controversial [^113tdSae].

---

## Rehabilitation and long-term management

**Multidisciplinary rehabilitation** is essential to address dysphagia, ataxia, and other functional deficits, with swallowing therapy critical for managing swallowing impairment and preventing aspiration pneumonia [^114kZW9c]. Physical and occupational therapy improve balance, coordination, and functional independence, and speech therapy addresses dysarthria and communication difficulties.

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **generally favorable**, with most patients achieving significant functional recovery [^113tdSae]. Persistent deficits — such as dysphagia, ataxia, and sensory disturbances — may persist in some patients. Rare complications reported include trigeminal trophic syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory complications [^116jc3va] [^112EsCqg].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis includes **medial medullary syndrome**, characterized by contralateral hemiparesis, medial lemniscus involvement, and hypoglossal nerve palsy [^11575bDW]. It also includes pontine infarction, which presents with different cranial nerve involvement and motor deficits [^113YgyVf]. Multiple sclerosis may mimic LMS with demyelinating lesions but typically follows a different clinical course [^1139wQX1].

---

Lateral medullary syndrome is a brainstem stroke most often due to vertebral or PICA occlusion, with vertebral artery dissection a key cause in younger patients. Diagnosis is MRI-based; acute management follows standard stroke protocols; and **prognosis is generally favorable**, though some deficits may persist.

## References

### Traumatic vertebral artery dissection and Wallenberg syndrome following a motorcycle collision [^113tdSae]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Wallenberg syndrome, also known as lateral medullary syndrome or posterior inferior cerebellar artery syndrome, presents clinically with ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral cerebellar signs, and hypalgesia of the ipsilateral face and contralateral body. A significant number of Wallenberg syndrome cases have been associated with vertebral artery dissection (VAD). Currently, magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred diagnostic tool due to its high spatial resolution, which is crucial for assessing lesions in the posterior fossa.

The optimal treatment for VAD remains controversial, with most patients receiving conservative treatment involving anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs. Generally, the prognosis is good. However, the rarity and varied presentations of VAD can challenge emergency physicians in making a correct diagnosis in the emergency department. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a high index of suspicion for early diagnosis, particularly in young individuals without risk factors for cerebrovascular accidents.

### Dysphagia in lateral medullary infarction (Wallenberg's syndrome): An acute disconnection syndrome in premotor neurons related to swallowing activity [^114kZW9c]. Stroke (2001). Low credibility.

We have investigated the pathophysiological mechanisms of dysphagia in Wallenberg's Syndrome (WS) due to lateral medullary infarction (LMI).

- **Methods**: Twenty patients with WS were evaluated using clinical and electrophysiological methods that measured the oropharyngeal phase of voluntarily initiated swallowing. For comparison, 22 patients with unilateral hemispheric infarction were investigated during the acute stage of stroke, and four patients with unilateral peripheral 9th and 10th cranial nerve palsies were studied. Age-matched healthy control subjects, totaling 30, were also included in the study.

- **Results**: It was found that dysphagia was clinically more severe in WS patients than in the other groups. The pharyngeal phase of swallowing was predominantly impaired. In patients with hemispheric stroke, dysphagia was related only to the delay in triggering voluntarily induced swallowing. In WS patients, the swallowing reflex was extremely slow despite the unilateral involvement due to LMI. In contrast, the pharyngeal phase of reflex swallowing remained within normal limits in patients with unilateral hemispheric stroke and in those with unilateral peripheral 9th and 10th cranial nerve palsies.

- **Conclusions**: Although the lesion in WS due to LMI is unilateral, its effect on oropharyngeal swallowing is bilateral. In LMI, primarily the premotor neurons in the nucleus ambiguous and their connections seem to be affected. Consequently, there is a disruption or disconnection of their linkage to swallowing-related cranial motor neurons.

### Recurrent cardiac arrest caused by lateral medulla oblongata infarction [^112EsCqg]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest is a rare complication in Wallenberg syndrome, despite the fact that the brainstem, especially the lower medulla, modulates sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. In the case reported here, a 45-year-old man was admitted with clinical symptoms of Wallenberg syndrome, including right-sided hemiparesis secondary to dissection of the right vertebral artery. During the following days, he experienced several spells of self-limiting cardiac arrests, which made the implantation of a pacemaker necessary. A magnetic resonance imaging scan showed an infarction on the lower right and dorsolateral medulla. This might have affected the central sympathetic neurons, which normally inhibit the nucleus of the solitary tract. The disinhibition of the nucleus tractus solitarii may have led to an increase in parasympathetic outflow resulting in bradycardia/asystolia. This case report describes a rare indication for transient or permanent therapy with a cardiac pacemaker in Wallenberg syndrome.

### The use of tissue plasminogen activator in the treatment of Wallenberg syndrome caused by vertebral artery dissection [^115XTwY9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is a devastating cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Up to 10% of acute CVAs in young patients are caused by dissection of the vertebral or carotid artery. Wallenberg syndrome results from a CVA in the vertebral or posterior inferior artery of the cerebellum and manifests as various degrees of cerebellar dysfunction. The administration of a thrombolytic medication has been recommended in the treatment of patients with stroke caused by cervical artery dissection. Surprisingly, there is scant literature on the use of this medication in the treatment of this condition.

- **Case report**: We describe a 42-year-old man with the sudden onset of headache, left-sided neck pain, vomiting, nystagmus, and ataxia 1 hour after completing a weightlifting routine. Computed tomography angiography revealed a grade IV left vertebral artery injury with a dissection flap extending distally and resulting in complete occlusion. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging and angiography demonstrated acute left cerebellar and lateral medullary infarcts, consistent with Wallenberg syndrome. The patient was treated with tissue plasminogen activator, which failed to resolve his symptoms.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: Emergency physicians frequently manage patients with acute CVAs. For select patients, the administration of tissue plasminogen activator can improve outcomes. However, the risk of major hemorrhage with this medication is significant. Cervical artery dissection is an important cause of acute stroke in young patients and is often an underlying issue.

### A crossed brain stem syndrome without crossed sensory symptomatology [^114ugb3o]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Lateral medullary infarction (LMI), or Wallenberg syndrome, is a type of brain stem stroke and a specific form of crossed brain stem syndrome. LMI is well-documented with typical characteristics, including pain and temperature impairment on the side of the face ipsilateral to the lesion and on the contralateral side of the trunk and limbs.

We present a case of LMI involving a patient with atypical features: analgesia and thermanaesthesia contralateral to the lesion side of the face, and an absence of sensory deficit on the ipsilateral side. The pattern of involvement was attributed to a lesion affecting the ventral trigeminothalamic tract while sparing the dorsolateral part of the medulla, where the spinal trigeminal tract and its nucleus reside.

This case report emphasizes the existence of atypical presentations of LMI that may initially challenge a physician's diagnostic reasoning.

### Three cases of spontaneous vertebral artery dissection (SVAD), resulting in two cases of Wallenberg syndrome and one case of Foville syndrome in young, healthy men [^11578UrC]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

The first patient presented with a sudden onset of headache, left hypoacusia, and right hemiparesis, later developing gaze-evoked nystagmus and worsening right-sided weakness. A diagnosis of vertebral artery dissection and Foville syndrome was made through clinical assessment and CT-carotid angiogram-MR angiography.

The second patient experienced four episodes of pain over the left side of the nose and left eye pain over one month and was admitted for acute facial pain without limb weakness. During admission, symptoms included tingling over the V1/V2 facial territory, vertigo, hypotension, uvula deviation, and right lower limb numbness. A CT-carotid angiogram confirmed vertebral artery dissection and MRI revealed a left lateral medullary infarct.

The third patient presented with the sudden onset of left facial numbness and right upper limb weakness. One day later, symptoms progressed to right arm and leg hypoesthesia with hoarseness. MRA revealed dissection of the left distal vertebral artery, and MRI showed infarction in the lower medulla oblongata.

### Pearls & oy-sters: Trigeminal trophic syndrome from lateral medullary stroke with successful multimodal treatment [^116jc3va]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

We describe an adult patient who developed widespread skin ulceration in the left trigeminal nerve distribution due to Wallenberg syndrome from an acute ischemic stroke in the left lateral medulla. Trigeminal trophic syndrome is a rare consequence of a trigeminal nerve pathway injury characterized by the triad of persistent ulceration, anesthesia, and paresthesia of the same trigeminal dermatomes. It is an unusual complication of stroke, likely developing in this patient due to a combination of neurotrophic skin changes worsened by self-inflicted injury from scratching in a hypoesthetic region and by a psychiatric comorbidity. Skin lesions and their functional consequences significantly improved after multidisciplinary treatment, including numerous surgical interventions.

### Horner syndrome: A clinical review [^115wPYWZ]. ACS Chemical Neuroscience (2018). High credibility.

Horner's syndrome can be caused by various medical conditions. These include:

- **Vascular conditions**: carotid artery dissection, thoracic aortic aneurysm, thoracic aortic dissection, subclavian artery aneurysm, carotid artery aneurysm

- **Neurological disorders**: cluster headache, syringomyelia, neurofibromatosis type 1, multiple sclerosis, Wallenberg syndrome, brain arteriovenous malformation, brain tumors, Chiari malformation, migraine, acute ischemic stroke, brainstem stroke

- **Spinal and cervical issues**: cervical spine injury, cervical spondylosis, cervical intervertebral disc herniation, cervical ribs, Klumpke paralysis

- **Tumors and growths**: cavernous sinus thrombosis, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Pancoast tumor, spinal cord tumors, mediastinal tumors, thyroid tumors, mesothelioma

- **Surgical and procedural causes**: sympathectomy, skull base surgery, neck surgery, central venous catheter placement, chest tube placement, assisted vaginal delivery, thoracic surgery, epidural anesthesia

- **Infectious and inflammatory diseases**: Lyme disease, herpes zoster, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, temporal arteritis

- **Other conditions**: goiter, cervical lymphadenopathy, dental abscess, head and neck cancer, neck trauma

These conditions illustrate the multifactorial nature of Horner's syndrome and the necessity for comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.

### Classical crossed brain stem syndromes: Myth or reality [^113YgyVf]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Numerous crossed brain stem syndromes have been described, especially in the nineteenth century. While these syndromes are passed on in neurological textbooks, their relevance in clinical neurology remains to be elucidated. To investigate the prevalence of classical crossed brain stem syndromes in clinical practice, we prospectively recruited 308 consecutive patients with signs and symptoms indicative of acute brain stem infarction. Standardized high-resolution MR imaging and multimodal electrophysiological brain stem testing were applied to localize the site of the acute lesion. We performed a computer-based correlation of clinical signs and symptoms of our patients with those reported in the original historical publications for more than 25 crossed brain stem syndromes.

- **Findings**: Fourteen cases matched the clinical criteria of Wallenberg's syndrome, two patients had Babinski-Nageotte's syndrome, two had Raymond-Cestan's, one showed Weber's, and one Claude's syndrome. All other tested syndromes were not present in the cohort. More than 20% of patients showed different, so far unnamed crossed symptom combinations.

In conclusion, except for Wallenberg's syndrome, classical crossed brain stem syndromes do not seem to play a relevant role in clinical neurology. Other syndromes may serve as theoretical models only that illustrate possible neuroanatomical connections in the human brain stem. This is complicated, however, by considerable topographic and terminological inconsistencies.

### Glossopharyngeal neuralgia: Epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment options [^116UBUE2]. Health Psychology Research (2022). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, glossopharyngeal nerve palsy can be caused by Eagle's syndrome, Wallenberg's syndrome, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, motor neuron disease, and intracranial mass.

### Demographic, medical, and clinical characteristics of a population-based sample of patients with long-lasting locked-in syndrome [^114ipxST]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Radiologic reports were available for 49 patients but were nonexistent or irretrievable for the 2 patients who experienced LIS onset more than 30 years ago. Written MRI reports were available for most of the patients (n = 44), and their data were combined with data from CT reports retrieved from patient records.

Imaging data revealed numerous combinations of lesions within and outside the brain stem. An isolated pontine lesion without any other lesions in the brain or brain stem was found only in 5 patients. Seven patients had lesions only in the mesencephalon and/or medulla oblongata, which caused their LIS state without injuring the pons.

- **Distribution of lesions**: As many as 39 patients had 1 or more lesions outside the brain stem, most commonly in the cerebellum (n = 30) and occipital lobe (n = 8). All patients with an etiology of dissection had cerebellar lesions. Fifteen patients had only 1 lesion located outside the brain stem, all in the cerebellum, in 5 of those cases isolated to the cerebellar peduncle/s. Six patients had primary cerebellar/posterior cranial fossa hemorrhaging, with brain stem lesions probably occurring as secondary lesions.

- **Survival and emergence from the LIS state**: The last registered status for the 51 patients included was dead in 15 cases and emerged from LIS in 20 cases. All 16 patients who remained in LIS were in an incomplete LIS state. Nearly half of the patients (n = 23/51) had emerged from the LIS state, including 3 patients who emerged from LIS before.

### Fincher syndrome: Insights into a rare neurosurgical condition [^114M14Mw]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of Fincher syndrome varies among patients, primarily due to differences in tumor dimensions, location, and the degree of bleeding observed. Patients usually present with sudden, acute sciatica, lower back pain, and headache. Neurological malfunctions, such as numbness, muscle weakness, and, in extreme cases, paralysis, may occur and can vary based on the tumor's size and location.

According to Brown and Roberts (2019), severe occurrences of this condition may cause patients to have problems with bladder function, stemming from the compression of the spinal cord. Additionally, Garcia and Wilson (2020) assert that meningeal irritation may manifest through neck stiffness, light sensitivity, changes in reflexes, and nausea. These symptoms may overlap, making it prudent to initiate further investigation, particularly if the patient has no history of trauma or recognized vascular complications.

### The prognostic utility of MRI in clinically isolated syndrome: a literature review [^1139wQX1]. AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology (2015). Low credibility.

For patients presenting with clinically isolated syndrome, the treating clinician needs to advise the patient on the probability of conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis. MR imaging may give useful prognostic information, and there is large body of literature pertaining to the use of MR imaging in assessing patients presenting with clinically isolated syndrome. This literature review evaluates the accuracy of MR imaging in predicting which patients with clinically isolated syndrome will go on to develop long-term disease and/or disability. New and emerging MR imaging technologies and their applicability to patients with clinically isolated syndrome are also considered.

### The thoracic outlet syndromes [^1155qKne]. Muscle & Nerve (2012). Low credibility.

The term thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) refers to a heterogeneous group of disorders, all of which involve compression of one or more neurovascular elements at some point within the thoracic outlet. Of the five disorders comprising this group, four have all the features expected of a syndrome: a recognized constellation of clinical features, an anatomic derangement accounting for these features, and a method of testing that identifies the anatomic derangement. Consequently, their recognition and management are relatively straightforward.

Conversely, one of these five disorders, nonspecific TOS, lacks these correlations. This has generated considerable debate in the literature and prompted some experts to doubt its existence altogether. The primary focus in this study is on the neurologic forms of TOS. However, for completeness and a better understanding of these neurologic manifestations, the vascular forms are also reviewed.

### Between Wallenberg syndrome and hemimedullary lesion: Cestan-Chenais and Babinski-Nageotte syndromes in medullary infarctions [^11575bDW]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

In comparison with the lateral (Wallenberg), medial (Dejerine), and hemimedullary (Reinhold) medulla oblongata syndromes, the Babinski-Nageotte and Cestan-Chenais syndromes are much less familiar cerebrovascular disorders. While the Babinski-Nageotte syndrome is usually confused with the hemimedullary syndrome, reports of the extremely rare Cestan-Chenais syndrome are missing from the modern neurological literature. The pathological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlations of the Cestan-Chenais syndrome have not been shown so far. We compared clinical and MRI features of two patients exhibiting classical Babinski-Nageotte and Cestan-Chenais syndromes according to their original descriptions with those of three patients with lateral, medial, and hemimedullary syndromes.

Our study shows that Babinski-Nageotte syndrome includes all symptoms of the Wallenberg syndrome and additionally contralateral hemiparesis due to a spreading of the "Wallenbergian" lateral lesion to the pyramidal tract. The Cestan-Chenais syndrome includes all symptoms of the Babinski-Nageotte syndrome with the exception of the ipsilateral cerebellary hemiataxia because of sparing of the posterior spinocerebellar tract. The Babinski-Nageotte syndrome is neither clinically nor on MRI identical with hemimedullary syndrome. Hypoglossal palsy, an invariable symptom of hemimedullary lesion, is not part of the Babinski-Nageotte syndrome. The contralateral hypesthesia is dissociated in the Babinski-Nageotte syndrome. The Babinski-Nageotte and Cestan-Chenais syndromes are intermediolateral medullary syndromes.

### 15 years of paraganglioma: Clinical manifestations of paraganglioma syndromes types 1–5 [^115KbFPg]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Tumours associated with PGL1–5 include paragangliomas, which arise from the neuroendocrine paraganglia along the paravertebral axis, extending from the base of the skull to the pelvis. These are divided into parasympathetic paraganglia (HNPGLs) and sympathetic paraganglia (TAPGLs). Approximately 40% of all PGLs are linked to SDH deficiency, with those related to SDHB mutations (PGL4) posing a higher malignancy risk.

HNPGLs associated with paraganglioma syndromes include carotid body PGLs at the carotid bifurcation, glomus vagale tumours along the vagus nerve, and glomus jugulare tumours in the jugular foramen. Other rare HNPGL locations include glomus tympanicum tumours within the middle ear, and PGLs of the larynx, nasopharynx, orbit, tongue, and thyroid. HNPGLs typically do not secrete hormones; only about 5% exhibit elevated plasma or urine normetanephrine, while 30% have elevated dopamine metabolite 3-methoxytyramine levels. The malignancy rate for HNPGLs is less than 5%.

Living at high altitude may encourage HNPGL development in PGL1, though its effect on other PGL syndromes remains unclear. HNPGLs are often found incidentally during imaging studies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally the most effective for detailed imaging of HNPGLs, showing low T1-signal, intermediate to high signal on T2-weighted images, and intense enhancement after gadolinium contrast. On computed tomography (CT) imaging, intratumoral blood vessels are discernible.

### Paroxysmal sneezing at the onset of lateral medullary syndrome: cause or consequence [^117BVUNo]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Sneezing is known to precede lateral medullary syndrome (LMS) and is usually interpreted as the precipitating cause for a vertebral artery dissection that subsequently causes LMS. Through two case reports and a literature review, we aim to challenge the concept that sneezing at the onset of LMS implies that a dissection is the underlying cause. An 82-year-old man and a 54-year-old man both reported unprovoked explosive pathological sneezing at the onset of the LMS without any delay between sneezing and the other LMS symptoms. Both denied neck trauma or neck pain. There was no conclusive evidence for vertebral artery dissection in either case. Paroxysmal sneezing can be an initial manifestation of lateral medullary ischemia and may not necessarily indicate an underlying vertebral artery dissection as the cause.

### Syndromes of orthostatic intolerance: A hidden danger [^1149XgjG]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a relatively common heterogeneous and multifactorial disorder, traditionally classified as neurogenic (less common but often more severe) or nonneurogenic (more common, with no direct signs of autonomic nervous system disease). The different clinical variants of orthostatic intolerance include initial, classical, and delayed OH, as well as postural tachycardia syndrome. Orthostatic instability may induce syncopal attacks, either alone or in combination with other mechanisms, and is often dismissed as a precipitating factor. Moreover, prevalent OH is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, and the majority of patients with OH are asymptomatic or have few nonspecific symptoms.

Management of symptomatic orthostatic intolerance includes both nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods. However, it is not always successful and may lead to complications. Future studies of OH should focus on mechanisms that lead to neurogenic and nonneurogenic OH, novel diagnostic methods, and more effective therapeutic modalities.

### Sensorimotor hemiparesis with secondary cervical dystonia following lateral caudal medullary infarction without signs and symptoms of Wallenberg syndrome [^114SExNR]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2004). Low credibility.

We report the case of an 84-year-old woman who suddenly developed motor, superficial, and deep sensory hemiparesis on the left side, along with cervical dystonia characterized by a head tilt to the right side. A brain MRI revealed an infarct in the left lateral caudal medulla. It is clinically important to recognize that the lateral caudal medullary infarction can occur without the signs and symptoms of lower cranial nerve palsies commonly involved in Wallenberg syndrome.

### Comparison of left versus right lateral starting position on colonoscopy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111MWSDA]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

We read the article by Ramai et al. with great interest and appreciate the authors' efforts to assess the efficacy of a right lateral starting position on colonoscopy compared to a left lateral starting position. However, we would like to point out two concerns.

- **First concern**: The authors should follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. They should provide details of the predefined protocol and summarize the strength of the evidence for each major result using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We evaluated that the certainty of the evidence regarding the rate of cecal intubation and cecal intubation time was moderate, due to imprecision from the small sample size for the rate of cecal intubation, and low, due to imprecision and risk of bias from a skewed distribution, respectively. The authors should state their conclusions, including the strength of evidence.

- **Second concern**: This was not the first systematic review, but an updated review. Previous systematic reviews showed that, similar to the results of this study, the right lateral position did not reduce cecal insertion time. However, the supine position (mean difference [MD] -41.0 sec, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] -57.3 to -24.7) and tilt-down position (MD -37.3 sec, 95% CI -72.1 to -2.4) reduced mean cecal insertion time for colonoscopy compared with the left lateral position.

### Capsular warning syndrome [^115dFhqw]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

We present a case of a 72-year-old man who exhibited fluctuating right-sided weakness and numbness. This was characterized by episodic sudden onset weakness with resolution of symptoms in between. His symptoms and signs became persistent despite the addition of dual antiplatelet therapy. The history we describe is classical of capsular warning syndrome. The patient underwent further definitive neuroimaging, which revealed a pontine infarct rather than the expected capsular infarct.

We discuss the importance of capsular warning syndrome, the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms, and different locations of infarction in previous cases of capsular warning syndrome. We also discuss the lack of consensus within the literature on treatment options used to prevent a completed stroke in cases of capsular warning syndrome.

### Differentiating lower motor neuron syndromes [^112UVDpt]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Lower motor neuron (LMN) syndromes typically present with muscle wasting and weakness and may arise from pathology affecting the distal motor nerve up to the level of the anterior horn cell. A variety of hereditary causes are recognized, including spinal muscular atrophy, distal hereditary motor neuropathy, and LMN variants of familial motor neuron disease. Recent genetic advances have resulted in the identification of a variety of disease-causing mutations.

Immune-mediated disorders, including multifocal motor neuropathy and variants of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, account for a proportion of LMN presentations and are important to recognize, as effective treatments are available. This review outlines the spectrum of LMN syndromes that may develop in adulthood and provides a framework for the clinician assessing a patient presenting with predominantly LMN features.

### A rare case of left inferior vena cava presenting with May-Thurner syndrome [^116C3mRg]. CVIR Endovascular (2022). Low credibility.

May–Thurner anomaly is characterized as external venous compression by the arterial framework against hard bony structures. This chronic anatomical lesion infrequently leads to deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremity, and it may cause leg swelling as a long-term post-thrombotic complication. Left iliac vein compression may not be as uncommon as was previously thought, and it typically occurs in women more than men. Congenital anomalies of the venous tree are not rare; they exist in 8.7% of the general population.

- **Case presentation**: We present the first case of right-sided May-Thurner Syndrome in a patient with inferior vena cava (IVC) anomalies. In our patient, both common iliac veins formed the left-sided IVC, which extended to the hemiazygos vein and the superior vena cava. Additionally, there was a right-sided suprarenal IVC, which extended to the right atrium.

- **Conclusion**: Understanding the proper anatomy in May-Thurner syndrome aids in better decision-making for the management of disease pathophysiology.

### Symptoms, imaging features, treatment decisions, and outcomes of patients with top of the basilar artery syndrome: Experiences from a comprehensive stroke center [^116DwA5c]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Low credibility.

Top of the basilar artery syndrome (TOBS) is a diagnostic challenge in neurocritical care, presenting with symptoms ranging from visual, ocular, and pupillomotor abnormalities to rapid quantitative disturbances of consciousness. In this monocentric retrospective cross-sectional study, we describe this particular patient group in detail to highlight its variability and associated implications.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with radiologically confirmed TOBS presenting to our comprehensive stroke center were analyzed from 2010 to 2022. Baseline parameters at admission, including clinical symptoms, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and imaging parameters (mode and success of recanalization measured by the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [TICI] score, extent of infarct, and infarct localization), were assessed. Functional dependence at discharge was analyzed with the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and Barthel Index.

- **Results**: We assessed 96 eligible patients with a mean age of 70 (SD ± 14) years, 41.67% of whom were female. The median NIHSS score at admission was 19 (interquartile range [IQR] 8–35), and the median GCS score was 7 (IQR 3–15). Dysphagia was identified in 51.72% of patients, with a significant number discharged with nasogastric tubes. Most patients received both intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and mechanical thrombectomy (MT) (47%), whereas 32% received MT only, and 10% received no acute recanalizing therapy.

### Adam Opalski (1897–1963) [^114xKhsk]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

In 1939, when the Second World War broke out, Adam Opalski served in the Polish army as a medical officer. He was taken prisoner and interned in Radom. Upon his release from the prison camp in 1941, he worked in various Warsaw hospitals. In 1942, he became the head of the Neurological Clinic and commenced the underground teaching of Polish medical students. During the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, the city was completely destroyed. Opalski saved the Clinic's equipment, transporting it out of Warsaw at great personal risk.

After the liberation of Warsaw, in February 1945, Opalski was appointed head of the Department of Neurology with a Clinic at Warsaw University. Despite the challenging post-war conditions, he organized student education and expanded the activities of his department. He was an active participant in the Polish Neurological Society and edited the journal "Polish Neurology and Psychiatry".

During this period, Opalski also made significant contributions as a scientist. In 1946, he described the submedullary syndrome, based on two clinical cases. This syndrome is now also known as Opalski's sub-bulbar syndrome. It is a rare neurological condition considered a variation of lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg's syndrome). Since 1946, only a few cases of Opalski's sub-bulbar syndrome have been documented in scientific literature. This syndrome results from post-stroke ischemia in the branches of the posterior medullary artery and may be caused by various factors, including differences in the diameter of the vertebral arteries, dissection of the vertebral artery, or hypotonia secondary to spinocerebellar issues.

### A hidden giant: Wallenberg syndrome and aortal wall thickening as an atypical presentation of a giant cell arteritis [^111NrRRH]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 73-year-old woman with a brainstem stroke presenting as Wallenberg syndrome. By transoesophageal echocardiography and combined 18F-fluordeoxyglucose positron emission and CT (18F-FDG PET/CT), the diagnosis of large artery vasculitis owing to giant cell arteritis was confirmed. In the absence of classical clinical signs, the examination of the large extracranial vessels by ultrasound and 18F-FDG PET/CT played the key role in detecting a widespread vasculitis.

### Lower cranial nerve syndromes: A review [^115u4sM5]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Low credibility.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the syndromes associated with the lower cranial nerves (LCNs). We discuss the anatomy of some of these syndromes and the historical contributors after whom they were named. The LCNs can be affected individually or in combination, as the cranial nerves at this level share their courses through the jugular foramen, hypoglossal canal, and extracranial spaces. Numerous alterations affecting them have been described in the literature, but much remains to be discovered on this topic.

This paper highlights some of the subtle differences among these syndromes. Symptoms and signs that have localization value for LCN lesions include impaired speech, deglutition, sensory functions, alterations in taste, autonomic dysfunction, neuralgic pain, dysphagia, head or neck pain, cardiac or gastrointestinal compromise, and weakness of the tongue, trapezius, or sternocleidomastoid muscles. To correctly assess the manifestations of LCN lesions, precise knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the area is required. Treatments currently used for these conditions will also be addressed here. Effective treatments are available in several cases; however, a correct and swift diagnosis is a precondition for complete recovery.

### Quantification of deep medullary veins at 7 T brain MRI [^116gUuim]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Deep medullary veins drain venous blood from the white matter towards the subependymal veins of the lateral ventricles. They are organized in a typical fan-pattern, which can be appreciated in Figure 1. Abnormalities of the deep medullary veins may be involved in various forms of cerebral small vessel disease.

Figure 1 illustrates the transversal (left) and coronal (right) view of the second echo of a dual-echo gradient echo 7 T MRI sequence. In these minimum intensity projections of ten slices, resulting in slab thicknesses of 3.9 mm (left) and 3.5 mm (right), the deep medullary veins are clearly visible. The veins, encircled in one hemisphere, drain venous blood towards the subependymal veins, such as the caudate vein of Schlesinger.

With advanced imaging sequences and ultra-high field 7 T MRI, deep medullary veins can be visualized in vivo with high spatial resolution. This advancement allows for further evaluation of the role of these veins and venous changes in cerebral small vessel disease, and in the context of aging and cognitive decline. Since these veins are numerous, computer-assisted detection and quantification may support a robust and reproducible assessment.

In this work, we propose and evaluate an automated method for the detection and quantification of deep medullary veins on 7 T MR images. A region-of-interest (ROI) is devised to capture the 3-D distribution of the veins. Individual veins are automatically detected and quantified based on number and density. Robustness and reproducibility of visual assessments are key outcomes of this method.

### International expert consensus document on Takotsubo syndrome (part I): Clinical characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and pathophysiology [^114Tcf6h]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

- **Pathophysiology**: The precise pathophysiological mechanisms of Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) are incompletely understood, but there is considerable evidence that sympathetic stimulation is central to its pathogenesis. An identifiable emotionally or physically triggering event precipitates the syndrome in most cases, and TTS has been associated with conditions of catecholamine excess (e.g. pheochromocytoma, central nervous system disorders) and activated specific cerebral regions.

Clinical features of TTS and the various ballooning patterns can be caused by intravenous administration of catecholamines and beta-agonists. Although it has been shown that patients with TTS triggered by emotional stress have markedly elevated levels of catecholamines compared to patients with Killip Class III myocardial infarction, others could not replicate this finding, most likely due to methodological issues. In line with sympathetic stimulation, elevated norepinephrine levels in the coronary sinus have been found in TTS patients, suggesting an increase in the local release of myocardial catecholamines.

Accordingly, analyses of heart rate variability have also demonstrated a sympathetic predominance and marked depression of parasympathetic activity during the acute phase. Microneurographic studies confirmed increased muscle sympathetic nerve activity and decreased spontaneous baroreflex control of sympathetic tone in some TTS patients, as did myocardial scintigraphy using 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine. Furthermore, abnormalities in myocardial sympathetic function can persist for months after recovery.

### State of the art: Noninvasive imaging and management of neurovascular trauma [^1162xBQ2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Carotid arteries may also demonstrate variations. Bifurcation of the common carotid arteries can occur at any level between T2 in the chest and C1 in the neck. The external and internal carotid arteries may also originate separately and directly from the aortic arch. In these cases, the carotid arteries do not bifurcate or converge, and each artery traverses the length of the cervical area, spanning all three cervical zones. Finally, the right and left internal carotid arteries may form intercavernous anastomoses. This additional surface area of the carotid artery within the cavernous sinuses theoretically increases the possibility of a carotid-cavernous fistula secondary to severe head trauma.

The circle of Willis has many variations, and in only 20% of cases does the arterial circle exist as a complete circle with equivalent flow throughout its circulation. The most common aberrancy is an absent or hypoplastic anterior cerebral artery (A1). In 20% of cases, the posterior communicating artery is absent or hypoplastic — this can occur either unilaterally or bilaterally. The posterior cerebral circulation may arise from the internal carotid arteries rather than the vertebral arteries; in 20% of cases, the posterior cerebral arteries are branches of the internal carotid arteries. One or both vertebral arteries may terminate in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery before forming the basilar artery. In similar situations involving the fetal anatomy of the posterior circulation, the posterior communicating arteries are the major route for blood flow to the posterior cerebral areas.

### International expert consensus document on Takotsubo syndrome (Part I): Clinical characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and pathophysiology [^115VHbsG]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that transient ischemia induced by plaque rupture followed by rapid lysis may cause myocardial stunning in patients with apparent non-obstructed CAD at angiography. Indeed, eccentric atherosclerotic plaques in the mid-portion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery have been reported, but intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography have failed to identify ruptured plaques in the vast majority of TTS patients. Furthermore, this explanation is very unlikely as patients with TTS exhibit wall motion abnormalities extending beyond single coronary vascular territories and sometimes include the right ventricle. In addition, the apical ballooning phenotype is known to occur in the absence of a wraparound LAD, and this coronary anatomical variant is not more prevalent in TTS than in the control group.

- **Multi-vessel epicardial spasm**: Sympathetically mediated epicardial spasm has been proposed as a potential cause in TTS. Takotsubo syndrome may be associated with endothelial dysfunction and other conditions of abnormal vasomotor function such as migraine or Raynaud's phenomenon. Similarly, endothelium-dependent dilation is reduced after emotional stress and prevented by endothelin antagonists. At presentation, patients with TTS have marked impairment in brachial artery flow-mediated dilation compared to those with infarction or healthy controls, which gradually improves over several weeks. In the early recovery period, predisposition to coronary vasospasm using intracoronary acetylcholine was demonstrated in some, but…

### Bilaterally symmetric cervical spondylotic amyotrophy: a novel presentation and review of the literature [^114hBA9f]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Cervical spondylotic amyotrophy (CSA) is considered a syndrome of unilateral upper extremity weakness and atrophy, affecting either the proximal or distal musculature, without sensory impairment or lower extremity dysfunction.

- **Aims of study**: The authors report a novel case of bilaterally symmetric CSA with blurring of the proximal-distal distinction, discuss the pathophysiology, and review the literature.

- **Methods**: A 45-year-old man presented with a several-year history of insidiously progressive, bilaterally symmetric upper extremity weakness and wasting, profound in the proximal musculature, and moderate to severe in the distal muscle groups.

- **Results**: Based on the clinical, neuroimaging, and electrodiagnostic features, this patient harbors a more severe phenotype of the classical syndrome.

- **Conclusion**: The authors propose expanding the generally accepted definition of CSA to include this bilaterally symmetric form of the disease, thereby minimizing diagnostic error or delay. Additionally, based on this case and a review of the literature, adherence to the proximal-distal distinction should be avoided since it is commonly blurred. Accurate diagnosis is crucial since this presentation mimics the motor neuron disease variant Vulpian-Bernhardt syndrome. The importance of early diagnosis is underscored by reports of significant improvement with timely surgical decompression.

### Neuropathological features of corticobasal degeneration presenting as corticobasal syndrome or Richardson syndrome [^115or262]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with corticobasal degeneration can present with several different clinical syndromes, making ante-mortem diagnosis a challenge. Corticobasal syndrome is the clinical phenotype originally described for corticobasal degeneration, characterized by asymmetric rigidity, apraxia, cortical sensory deficits, dystonia, and myoclonus. Some patients do not develop these features but instead have clinical features consistent with the Richardson syndrome presentation of progressive supranuclear palsy, characterized by postural instability, early unexplained falls, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, symmetric motor disability, and dysphagia.

The aim of this study was to identify differences in corticobasal degeneration presenting with corticobasal syndrome (n = 11) or Richardson syndrome (n = 15) with respect to demographic, clinical, and neuropathological features. Corticobasal degeneration cases were also compared with patients with pathologically proven progressive supranuclear palsy with Richardson syndrome (n = 15). Cases with corticobasal degeneration, regardless of presentation, shared histopathological and tau biochemical characteristics, but they had differing densities of tau pathology in neuroanatomical regions that correlated with their clinical presentation. In particular, those with corticobasal syndrome had greater tau pathology in the primary motor and somatosensory cortices and putamen, while those with Richardson syndrome had greater tau pathology in limbic and hindbrain structures. Compared with progressive supranuclear palsy, patients with corticobasal degeneration exhibited…

### International expert consensus document on Takotsubo syndrome (Part I): Clinical characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and pathophysiology [^1133GYVa]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a poorly recognized heart disease that was initially regarded as a benign condition. Recently, it has been shown that TTS may be associated with severe clinical complications including death and that its prevalence is probably underestimated. Since guidelines on TTS are lacking, it appears timely and important to provide an expert consensus statement on TTS. The clinical expert consensus document part I summarizes the state of knowledge on the clinical presentation and characteristics of TTS and agrees on controversies surrounding TTS such as nomenclature, different TTS types, role of coronary artery disease, and etiology. This consensus also proposes new diagnostic criteria based on knowledge to improve diagnostic accuracy.

### Microsurgical anatomy of the lateral mesencephalic vein and its meaning for the deep venous outflow of the brain [^112j83Dd]. Neurosurgical Review (2006). Low credibility.

The cerebral venous outflow consists of the superficial system and the deep draining system. The deep system drains the areas of the great vein of Galen, the two basal veins of Rosenthal, and their tributaries. Simultaneous obstruction of these veins can cause significant harm. In the case of obstruction of the vein of Galen, the basal vein can ensure the venous outflow. Therefore, attention should be paid to anastomoses between the basal vein and the infratentorial venous system.

The lateral mesencephalic vein (LMV) is the most important anastomosis between the supra- and infratentorial systems, linking the basal vein to the superior petrosal sinus. Microanatomical studies concerning this vein have received less attention; thus, the aim of the present study was to visualize the course of this vein, its junction with the basal vein, its tributaries, and its relationship with neural structures. Fifty-two cadaveric hemispheres were examined under an operating microscope. The LMV could be identified in all cases, with a mean diameter of 1.07 mm. A thorough understanding of the microanatomy of the LMV is crucial to avoid brain damage due to venous infarction during surgery, and its preservation could ensure deep venous outflow in the case of obstruction of the vein of Galen.

### Why acute unilateral vestibular midbrain lesions rarely manifest with rotational vertigo: a clinical and modelling approach to head direction cell function [^114Gs517]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Acute unilateral peripheral vestibular syndromes that involve semicircular canal function and are caused by a labyrinthine (Meniere's disease) or vestibular nerve (acute vestibular syndrome, AVS) disorder manifest with rotational vertigo and horizontal-rotatory spontaneous nystagmus. Pathophysiologically, it is well acknowledged that these signs and symptoms are caused by a vestibular tone imbalance generated by unequal input from the right and left ears. The side of the unilateral lesion that causes the tone imbalance can be determined by the direction of vertigo and spontaneous nystagmus, which is contralateral, and by the deviation of stance and gait, which is ipsilateral to the lesion side.

Similar signs and symptoms occur with unilateral vestibular lesions of the root entry zone of the eighth nerve affecting the vestibular fascicle, the vestibular nucleus (chiefly medial and superior parts), the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, the cerebellar peduncle, and the vestibular cerebellum. As these syndromes are elicited by central rather than peripheral vestibular structures, they are called central vestibular pseudoneuritis or, more recently, central acute vestibular syndrome. It is noteworthy that the latter central lesions are all located at the lower brainstem and cerebellar levels.

In Fig. 1a, we have depicted the overlap of causative MRI lesions at the pontomedullary level in 23 stroke patients reported in the literature who presented with sustained rotational vertigo.

### Central compensation of deviated subjective visual vertical in Wallenberg's syndrome [^116BkkHR]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

The central compensation of vestibular tonus imbalance due to unilateral peripheral vestibular lesions has been repeatedly documented. However, little is known about the central compensation of vestibular tonus imbalance due to central lesions. Dorsolateral medullary infarctions (Wallenberg's syndrome) typically cause a central vestibular tonus imbalance in the roll plane with deviations of perceived verticality and ipsiversive body lateropulsion.

The course of normalization of the tilts of subjective visual vertical (SVV) in 50 patients who had acute Wallenberg's syndrome was retrospectively compared with that in 50 patients with acute vestibular neuritis. The initial displacement of SVV was 9.8 degrees in Wallenberg's syndrome and 7 degrees in vestibular neuritis. The deviation of SVV significantly decreased over time within days to weeks in both groups, showing that the time courses of the central compensation for dorsolateral medullary infarctions and peripheral vestibular lesions are similar.

### Tauvid [^113XYn6R]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Preparation for image interpretation**: Before interpreting the image, review the brain to determine the lobar anatomy. Interpret the images by first evaluating the temporal lobes, followed by the occipital, parietal, and frontal lobes bilaterally. To evaluate the temporal lobes, subdivide them into four quadrants. Place the horizontal crosshair immediately posterior to the brainstem nuclei and then scroll inferiorly to position the vertical crosshair through the widest portion of the temporal pole. This method helps obtain the anterolateral temporal (ALT), anterior mesial temporal (AMT), posterolateral temporal (PLT), and posterior mesial temporal (PMT) quadrants. See Figure 2 for an example showing the left and right image panels of the same scan in two different color scales.

- **Image interpretation**: Interpret TAUVID imaging independently of the patient's clinical features and other imaging results. Interpret the PET TAUVID images based on the pattern and density of the radioactive signal within the neocortical gray matter, excluding white matter or regions outside of the brain. Only the uptake of tracer in the neocortical grey matter regions should contribute to scan interpretation. Note that off-target binding may occur in the choroid plexus, striatum, and brainstem nuclei. Small foci of noncontiguous tracer uptake may lead to false-positive interpretations. Interpret scans with isolated or noncontiguous, small foci in any region with caution. Some scans may be difficult to interpret due to image noise or motion artifacts.

### Migraine-tic syndrome: Two further case reports [^114BXDZq]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Migraine-tic syndrome was first reported in 2004 in a 44-year-old woman who had concomitant symptoms of both typical trigeminal neuralgia and migraine. We report here two further cases of migraine-tic syndrome and speculate on the relevance of this condition to the pathophysiology of headache.

- **Case reports**: A 43-year-old woman presented with typical trigeminal neuralgia symptoms that preceded the onset of migraine headache; both headache types responded to treatment with sumatriptan. A 35-year-old woman presented with trigeminal neuralgia that consistently followed the onset of migraine headache. The former aspect responded to baclofen, but the migraine headache required treatment with amitriptyline.

- **Discussion**: These two patients provide further support for the presence of an overlap syndrome of migraine-tic. We suggest that there is a common pathway for trigeminal neuralgia and migraine.

### International expert consensus document on Takotsubo syndrome (Part I): Clinical characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and pathophysiology [^113U4J2e]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is often challenging because its clinical phenotype may closely resemble acute myocardial infarction (AMI) regarding ECG abnormalities and biomarkers. While a widely established non-invasive tool for the rapid and reliable diagnosis of TTS is currently lacking, coronary angiography with left ventriculography is considered the gold standard diagnostic tool to exclude or confirm TTS.

Abe et al. introduced the first diagnostic criteria for TTS in 2003. One year later, a dedicated group of cardiologists from the Mayo Clinic proposed their diagnostic criteria. In 2006, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association classified TTS as a primary acquired cardiomyopathy. In 2008, a revised version of the Mayo Clinic Diagnostic Criteria was published, incorporating neurogenic stunned myocardium. Furthermore, the authors defined different TTS sub-types and highlighted that obstructive coronary lesions may occasionally be present concomitantly.

The Mayo Clinic Diagnostic Criteria are the most widely known, but exceptions to the rule, such as the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD), are poorly appreciated among physicians and cardiologists. More recently, other research groups have proposed slightly different criteria for TTS, including the Japanese Guidelines, the Gothenburg criteria, the Johns Hopkins criteria, the Tako-tsubo Italian Network proposal, the criteria of the Heart Failure Association (HFA) TTS Taskforce of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), as well as the criteria recommended by Madias. Thus, there is a lack of worldwide consensus.

### Vizamyl [^113Ktj12]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Image orientation**: Orient axial and coronal images to show symmetry of brain structures, with equal heights of structures bilaterally. Orient sagittal images so that the head and neck are neither flexed nor extended; the anterior and posterior aspects of the corpus callosum should be parallel to the AC-PC line as shown in Figure 2.

- **Image display**: Display images with all planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal planes) linked by crosshairs. Select a color scale that provides a progression of low through high intensity (e.g. rainbow or Sokoloff). The selected color scale should (1) provide colors that allow the reader to discriminate intensity levels above and below the intensity level of the pons, (2) provide a color for regions with little or no amyloid binding such as the cerebellar cortex, and (3) provide a range of at least five distinct colors above 50 to 60% of the peak intensity. Display the reference scale. Adjust the color scale to set the pons to approximately 90% maximum intensity. The cerebellar cortex should represent approximately 20–30% of peak intensity on both negative and positive Vizamyl scans.

Briefly display axial brain slices from bottom to top and look for signs of atrophy. Systematically review the following brain regions (recommended plane) for flutemetamol F 18 uptake as described in image interpretation below: frontal lobes (axial, with optional sagittal plane view), posterior cingulate and precuneus (sagittal, with optional coronal plane view), lateral temporal lobes (axial, with optional coronal plane view).

### Neurological disorders in takotsubo syndrome: Clinical phenotypes and outcomes [^117VemNB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Data are available upon reasonable request.

- **Study population selection**: The present study analyzed data from 2301 consecutive patients enrolled in the GEIST (German Italian Spanish Takotsubo) registry. The GEIST registry is a multicenter, international, observational registry of patients with TTS that collects patients from Italy, Germany, and Spain (NCT04361994). Patients' inclusion was performed in accordance with the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology TTS diagnostic criteria:

1. Transient regional wall motion abnormalities of the left or right ventricle, frequently preceded by a stressful trigger and usually extending beyond a single epicardial coronary artery distribution
2. Absence of culprit coronary artery disease at coronary angiogram
3. New and reversible electrocardiography abnormalities
4. Elevated cardiac troponin and serum natriuretic peptide levels
5. Recovery of ventricular systolic function at follow‐up in all surviving patients

The evaluation of patients and subsequent inclusion in the registry was performed by the physicians in charge only after all diagnostic criteria were met. All patients underwent coronary angiogram with different timing according to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on acute coronary syndrome. Coronary artery disease was defined as the presence of coronary calcifications, atherosclerosis, plaques, or stenoses, with stenoses > 50% of the lumen diameter in arteries with a diameter amenable to percutaneous intervention. Data regarding demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, and outcomes were collected.

### Vestibular paroxysmia: a treatable neurovascular cross-compression syndrome [^1126i9v2]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The main symptoms of vestibular paroxysmia (VP) are brief attacks of spinning or non-spinning vertigo, lasting from a fraction of a second to a few minutes, which occur with or without ear symptoms such as tinnitus and hypo- or hyperacusis. The pathophysiological cause is arteries or, rarely, veins in the cerebellar pontine angle, which induce segmental, pressure-induced dysfunction of the eighth nerve. As seen in trigeminal neuralgia, the symptoms are triggered by direct pulsatile compression and ephaptic pathological paroxysmal interaxonal transmission between neighboring and possibly demyelinated axons. VP accounts for 3.7% of 17,718 consecutive outpatients at the German Center for Vertigo and Balance Disorders.

Common peripheral vertigo and balance disorders of the vestibular labyrinth and the vestibular nerve contribute to about 47% of more than 17,000 outpatients in a multidisciplinary dizziness unit. Labyrinthine disorders include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo due to canal- or cupulolithiasis, superior canal dehiscence syndrome, and Menière's disease with endolymphatic hydrops. Vestibular nerve disorders include superior and rare inferior vestibular neuritis, vestibular schwannoma, bilateral vestibulopathy, and vestibular paroxysmia due to neurovascular cross-compression. The frequency of vestibular paroxysmia is nearly 4%.

### Pontomedullary sulcus infarct: A variant of lateral medullary syndrome [^112dZ9nL]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology, it is now possible to identify and determine the precise location of medullary infarcts. The lateral part of the medulla is most commonly affected by infarction. Classifications of lateral medullary infarcts are usually based on anatomical data, using rostrocaudal and dorsoventral axes to establish correlations with clinical symptoms. Different subtypes of lateral medullary syndrome, depending on location, shape, and size of the infarct, have been described in the literature. We report a rare case of a patient presenting with an unusual clinical picture in relation to an infarct specifically located in the lateral part of the pontomedullary sulcus.

### International expert consensus document on Takotsubo syndrome (Part I): Clinical characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and pathophysiology [^112uVfBj]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The term Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) was first introduced when Sato et al. published their report of five cases in a Japanese medical textbook in 1990. The first TTS case of this series was managed in 1983 at the Hiroshima City Hospital. A 64-year-old female presented with acute chest pain consistent with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), typical electrocardiographic (ECG) changes, but normal coronary arteries and an unusual appearance of the left ventricle (LV) with a narrow neck and apical ballooning during systole. Interestingly, the marked wall motion abnormalities on left ventriculography disappeared after 2 weeks.

Over time, TTS was more frequently diagnosed in Japan. It was initially assumed that this disorder only affected people of Asian descent, as TTS was completely unknown to the Western world until the first cases were published by French and American research groups in the late 1990s. Desmet et al. introduced the first patient case series in Caucasians using the term 'Takotsubo'.
Takotsubo syndrome gained international awareness among researchers and physicians when Wittstein et al. reported their findings.

### Cardiac arrest in a patient with normal coronary arteries [^116AsjA3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a 47-year-old woman who presented with the clinical picture typical for the entity described as transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy). She presented with chest pain secondary to vasospasm after an emotional argument. Her coronary anatomy was free of significant atherosclerotic lesions, and her ventriculogram revealed apical ballooning in the shape similar to the round-bottomed Japanese pot used for trapping octopus.

### Are white matter abnormalities associated with "unexplained dizziness" [^112NGNWn]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

We report that the severity of white matter small vessel disease is higher in elderly patients with no specific cause for their dizziness ("unexplained" dizziness). We postulate that white matter lesions may induce dizziness either because patients perceive a degree of objective unsteadiness or by a cortical–subcortical disconnection syndrome, secondary to disruption of white matter tracts involved in gait and balance control. Contrary to previous studies, our findings suggest that elderly patients with dizziness, without a clear diagnosis and despite clinical and vestibular assessment, should undergo brain imaging to assess the level of white matter disease (WMD).

Currently, treatment involves preventive measures, including control of vascular co-morbidities. Customized retraining through a combination of rehabilitation and possibly neuro-modulation of cortical pathways may form part of future potential treatment options for this subgroup of dizzy patients.

### International expert consensus document on Takotsubo syndrome (Part II): Diagnostic workup, outcome, and management [^112WRHxs]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Over recent years, research has shown that TTS is a much more heterogeneous condition than previously thought. Originally believed to be a benign disease, studies have shown that TTS has morbidity and mortality rates comparable to those of ACS. It can affect many others aside from postmenopausal women with an emotional trigger, as originally described, and can present as an atypical type rather than apical ballooning. Still, there is much more to be uncovered surrounding TTS and the underlying pathophysiology of the syndrome.

- **Key questions**: Many questions need further investigation: Why are women affected predominantly? What is the role of triggering factors in stress responses of the heart? Why do different TTS phenotypes exist? Which patients are vulnerable to TTS or prone to recurrence? Is there a genetic predisposition to TTS? What is the exact pathogenesis of TTS? Are there specific treatment options in the acute stage of this life-threatening syndrome or to prevent recurrence? Additional research needs to be conducted to answer these important questions.

- **Prospective approaches**: The link between the brain and heart seems to play a key role in TTS. Additionally, studies on circulating miRNAs suggest there could be a genetic aspect to the pathophysiology of TTS, and the predominance of female patients suggests that TTS could be related to sex hormones and the endocrine system. Takotsubo syndrome is more than a cardiac disease, and it requires a new and interdisciplinary approach to increase awareness among not only cardiologists but physicians across various specialties.

### Are white matter abnormalities associated with "unexplained dizziness" [^116vK8fs]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

Patients were included if they were aged between 45 and 90 years and were referred with dizziness to tertiary referral neuro-otology centres in London and Pisa. These are national centres of expertise in the diagnosis, investigation, and management of dizziness and imbalance, and typically receive a combination of general and complex dizzy patients. "Dizzy" symptoms included true rotational vertigo, light-headedness, giddiness, and a sense of non-specific unsteadiness. Patients were excluded if they exhibited no dizziness, had psychogenic or functional dizziness, lacked available imaging or had only a CT scan (n = 3), or were over the age of 90 (n = 17). In total, 122 patients (59 males) aged 45–90 were recruited. Patients were referred by general practitioners, neurologists, and ear, nose, and throat specialists from December 2010 to 2014. All patients (81 in London and 41 in Pisa) were examined by experienced neuro-otologists.

For this study, the case notes were reviewed and patients were divided into two groups based on history, clinical examination findings, and laboratory results. Group 1 consisted of patients with "explained" causes of dizziness. These included benign positional paroxysmal vertigo (BPPV), characterized by a history of brief, positional, rotational vertigo with a positive Dix–Hallpike manoeuvre, and vestibular neuritis, characterized by a history of acute, prolonged rotational vertigo associated with nausea, vomiting, imbalance, spontaneous horizontal unidirectional nystagmus with a torsional component, a unilaterally positive head impulse test, and no other neurological abnormality.

### Current concepts in clinical features and diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome [^1147noQf]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and clinical features of thoracic outlet syndrome have long confounded clinicians due to the heterogeneity in symptom presentation and the presence of many overlapping, competing diagnoses that are "more common". Despite the advent and prevalence of high-resolution imaging, as well as the increasing awareness of the syndrome itself, misdiagnoses and untimely diagnoses can result in significant patient morbidity. The authors aimed to summarize the concepts in the clinical features and diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome.

### Sheehan syndrome presenting as central diabetes insipidus: a rare presentation of an uncommon disorder [^112exEDP]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

To add to the scant literature on rare clinical presentations of Sheehan syndrome, this study describes the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of a patient, as well as a review of existing literature on the varied clinical presentations of Sheehan syndrome.

A 36-year-old multigravida woman developed severe postpartum hemorrhage and disseminated intravascular coagulation, followed by Sheehan syndrome, with central diabetes insipidus as the primary presenting feature. The syndrome was diagnosed postoperatively when she developed polyuria with a urine output of 11 L in 24 hours and an accompanying rise in creatinine. Laboratory evidence indicated diabetes insipidus, with serum osmolality greater than urine osmolality. Her clinical status improved significantly with intranasal desmopressin supplementation, confirming the diagnosis. Although Sheehan syndrome is a known complication of postpartum hemorrhage, central diabetes insipidus is seldom considered or suspected. Hypovolemia is usually presumed to be secondary to blood loss and polyuria due to a diuretic phase of acute renal failure.

It is important to consider posterior pituitary ischemia resulting from Sheehan syndrome presenting as central diabetes insipidus as a cause of polyuria, because appropriate hormonal replacement initiated early can possibly improve clinical status and patient outcomes.

### Vizamyl [^115z2oBF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Specifically, a negative scan would have the following characteristics:

- **Frontal, lateral temporal, inferolateral parietal lobes**: Gradual gradient from bright intensity of the white matter to lower intensity at the periphery of the brain; distinct sulci with concave surfaces (white matter sulcal pattern), and
- **Posterior cingulate and precuneus**: Grey matter uptake below 50–60% of peak intensity; gap of lower intensity separates two hemispheres on coronal view, and
- **Striatum**: Approximately 50% of peak intensity or lower in the region between the higher intensities of the thalamus and frontal white matter (striatal "gap").

Positive scans show at least one cortical region with reduction or loss of the normally distinct grey-white matter contrast. These scans have one or more regions with increased cortical grey matter signal (above 50–60% peak intensity) and/or reduced (or absent) grey-white matter contrast (white matter sulcal pattern is less distinct). A positive scan may have one or more regions in which grey matter radioactivity is as intense or exceeds the intensity in adjacent white matter.

Specifically, a positive scan would have the following characteristics:

- **Frontal, lateral temporal, or inferolateral parietal lobes**: High intensity seen to the periphery of the brain, with sharp reduction of intensity at the brain margin; sulci not distinct due to fill-in by high intensity grey matter resulting in a convex surface at the edge of the brain, or
- **Posterior cingulate and precuneus**: Grey matter uptake above 50–60% of peak intensity.

### The clinical variability of Wallenberg's syndrome. The anatomical correlate of ipsilateral axial lateropulsion [^1137b1AW]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The dorso-lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg's syndrome) is produced by infarction of a wedge of lateral medulla, posterior to the inferior olivary nucleus, and is usually caused by vertebral artery occlusion. Ipsilateral axial lateropulsion, as an initial symptom of vertebral artery occlusion, is rather rare, and the anatomical structure responsible is still uncertain.

Here we describe two patients presenting with ipsilateral axial lateropulsion as an initial symptom of vertebral artery occlusion. In one patient, the stroke affected the dorso-lateral aspect of the medulla, while in the other, more lateral aspects of the medulla were involved. Our data suggest that ipsilateral axial lateropulsion may be caused by lesions of different topography involving either the vestibular nuclei, the cerebellar peduncle, or the spinocerebellar tracts.

### Ipsilateral hemiparesis in lateral medullary infarction: Clinical investigation of the lesion location on magnetic resonance imaging [^115ThGgb]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2016). Low credibility.

In 1946, Opalski reported two cases of Wallenberg syndrome with ipsilateral hemiparesis (IH). His hypothesis was based on the view that IH is caused by post-decussating pyramidal tract damage. Later, other researchers proposed a different hypothesis suggesting that ipsilateral sensory symptoms of limbs (ISSL) or ipsilateral limb ataxia (ILA) caused by lateral medullary infarction (LMI) might lead to ipsilateral motor weakness. This study aims to clarify whether IH in LMI patients is primarily attributable to ISSL/ILA or the disruption of the ipsilateral post-decussating pyramidal tract.

- **Methods**: Thirty-two patients with acute LMI admitted during the last 13 years were divided into the IH Group (n = 7) and the Non-IH Group (n = 25). Lesion location/distribution on MRI and neurological findings were compared between the two groups.

- **Results**: LMI involved the lower medulla in all seven IH patients and 12 of 25 Non-IH patients. The lower medullary lesion extended to the cervico-medullary junction (CMJ) in four of seven IH patients and one of 12 Non-IH patients. Definitive extension to the upper cervical cord (UCC) was confirmed in none of the patients. ISSL was found in two IH and three Non-IH patients, all showing only superficial sensory impairments. ILA or hypotonia was observed in 57% of IH and 60% of Non-IH patients.

- **Conclusion**: IH in LMI appears to be due mainly to post-decussating pyramidal tract damage at the lower medulla rather than ILA or ISSL participation.

### Differentiating lower motor neuron syndromes [^113YrLqW]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

LMN syndromes represent a spectrum of disorders with a variety of underlying etiologies and presentations. Clinical assessment combined with neurophysiology is often adequate to establish a diagnosis, but advances in genetic and imaging techniques offer further diagnostic tools that are increasingly accessible to clinicians. Although establishing an accurate diagnosis in LMN presentations can be clinically challenging at times, it is important due to prognostic and treatment implications.

### Median arcuate ligament syndrome-review of this rare disease [^114iqMYH]. JAMA Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Median arcuate ligament (MAL) syndrome is a rare disease resulting from compression of the celiac axis by fibrous attachments of the diaphragmatic crura, the median arcuate ligament. Diagnostic workup and therapeutic intervention can be challenging.

- **Objective**: To review the literature to define an algorithm for accurate diagnosis and successful treatment for patients with MAL syndrome.

- **Evidence review**: A search of PubMed (1995-September 28, 2015) was conducted using the key terms median arcuate ligament syndrome and celiac artery compression syndrome.

- **Findings**: Typically a diagnosis of exclusion, MAL syndrome involves a vague constellation of symptoms including epigastric pain, postprandial pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Extrinsic compression of the vasculature and surrounding neural ganglion has been implicated as the cause of these symptoms. Multiple imaging techniques can be used to demonstrate celiac artery compression by the MAL, including mesenteric duplex ultrasonography, computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, gastric tonometry, and mesenteric arteriography. Surgical intervention involves open, laparoscopic, or robotic ligament release; celiac ganglionectomy; and celiac artery revascularization. There remains a limited role for angioplasty because this intervention does not address the underlying extrinsic compression resulting in symptoms, although angioplasty with stenting may be used in recalcitrant cases.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: Median arcuate ligament syndrome is rare, and as a diagnosis of exclusion, diagnosis can be complex and requires careful assessment of symptoms and imaging findings.

### Vestibular paroxysmia: A treatable neurovascular cross-compression syndrome [^1137ykeE]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite reports of partial successes and a clinically well-documented single case, operative microvascular decompression should be considered only in medically intractable cases. There is a risk of brainstem infarction due to intra- or post-operative vasospasm, which occurs in up to 3–5% of cases. Additionally, it is challenging to determine the affected side with sufficient certainty. However, if there are additional causes, such as the above-mentioned arachnoid cyst in the cerebellar pontine angle, the operation is recommended, as drug therapy rarely leads to the absence of symptoms.

### Late-onset recurrent mania as a manifestation of Wallenberg syndrome: A case report and review of the literature [^111tGsjs]. Bipolar Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: The aim of the present case report was to describe the late onset of recurrent mania in a patient after ischemic injury to the cerebellum and dorsolateral medulla.

- **Methods**: We studied an 86-year-old male with no prior psychiatric history who developed recurrent episodes of mania following a brain stroke. Additionally, he had a neurological symptom constellation typical of Wallenberg syndrome.

- **Results**: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed infarction in the inferomedial right cerebellar hemisphere and the right dorsolateral medulla in the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) distribution. He was successfully managed with a combination of antipsychotic and mood-stabilizer medications.

- **Conclusions**: Post-stroke mania may be one of the rare manifestations of Wallenberg syndrome. This case adds to the emerging literature on cerebellar involvement in mood regulation and the pathology of mania.

Łucja Frey was not the first to present a description of this syndrome in the medical literature, but she provided a systematic pathophysiological explanation with reference to all the observed symptoms as a disorder of both parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves, determined by anatomical relations of the sensory and the autonomic innervation of the head.

Apart from papers on the auriculotemporal nerve syndrome, Łucja Frey published works in the Polish medical journals "Neurologia Polska" and "Gazeta Lekarska" (in the years 1925–1928), which concerned brain stem topography, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Charcot's disease), aneurysms of the plexus of the medulla, clivus tumors, frontal lobe tumors, and retrosplenial tumors.

### International expert consensus document on Takotsubo syndrome (part I): Clinical characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and pathophysiology [^1111vuMz]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a poorly recognized heart disease that was initially regarded as a benign condition. Recently, it has been shown that TTS may be associated with severe clinical complications, including death, and that its prevalence is probably underestimated. Since guidelines on TTS are lacking, it appears timely and important to provide an expert consensus statement on TTS. The clinical expert consensus document part I summarizes the state of knowledge on clinical presentation and characteristics of TTS and agrees on controversies surrounding TTS, such as nomenclature, different TTS types, the role of coronary artery disease, and etiology. This consensus also proposes new diagnostic criteria based on current knowledge to improve diagnostic accuracy.
