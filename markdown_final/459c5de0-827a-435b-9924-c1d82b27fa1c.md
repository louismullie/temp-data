## Question

Coronary artery calcium score of 1600

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of 1600 Agatston units means and how to manage it in an asymptomatic adult without known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify this CAC score by established thresholds and what that implies for near-term risk. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence linking very high CAC scores to event rates and guideline-directed therapy. Next, I will examine plaque distribution, especially left main and multivessel involvement, to refine risk further. After that, I should confirm when additional functional or anatomic testing is not indicated. Finally, I will translate this into a concrete treatment plan with targets, monitoring, and a follow-up timeline, ensuring shared decision-making and cost-effectiveness considerations are addressed [^1136soUb] [^113pTD23].

> Let me first confirm the risk category for a CAC of 1600. By contemporary expert statements, a CAC score ≥ 1000 is in the extreme-high-risk phenotype and confers an annualized cardiovascular death rate comparable to secondary prevention populations, around 0.8% per year, which aligns with the placebo arm risk in FOURIER, underscoring the magnitude of risk here [^116xY5UD] [^112e3QDh]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify the proportional risk signal: the National Lipid Association (NLA) notes that risk rises substantially from CAC ≥ 100 to ≥ 300 to ≥ 1000, and at CAC ≥ 1000 the annual risk is indeed on par with established ASCVD cohorts, which supports aggressive prevention strategies in this scenario [^112e3QDh] [^117RZcxB].

> I need to check how this integrates with guideline language. The ACC/AHA primary prevention guidance endorses using CAC to refine risk and guide statin decisions in borderline and intermediate risk, and it is reasonable to extrapolate that a CAC of 1600 pushes any baseline 10-year ASCVD risk estimate into a very high-risk stratum where high-intensity LDL-C lowering is clearly indicated as part of shared decision-making [^113pTD23] [^116nrs4d]. Wait, let me verify that CAC thresholds align with statin intensity: NLA explicitly recommends high-intensity statins at CAC ≥ 300, with particular emphasis on CAC ≥ 1000 for aggressive LDL-C lowering targets, which fits this case [^117RZcxB] [^11292tWp].

> Next, I should review plaque distribution because diffuse calcification and left main involvement further increase risk. I will now examine whether the report notes the number of vessels involved and left main calcium burden; if the left main accounts for more than 25% of the total score, that independently portends higher risk beyond the total Agatston score, reinforcing more aggressive prevention even in the absence of symptoms [^114rmXh9] [^113me6uH]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies in asymptomatic individuals — yes, these statements are framed for asymptomatic primary prevention populations and do not suggest routine downstream testing without symptoms or abnormal functional capacity [^114rmXh9].

> I should confirm whether any additional testing is warranted now. Despite a very high CAC, if the patient is asymptomatic with preserved functional capacity, routine stress testing or invasive coronary angiography is not recommended; these do not improve outcomes in asymptomatic individuals with high CAC and may lead to harm from unnecessary procedures [^114rmXh9] [^115k3GWq]. Hmm, wait a minute — some clinicians consider imaging for ischemia when CAC is very high; but I need to ensure we adhere to evidence that shows no outcome benefit from an initial invasive strategy in stable, asymptomatic patients with high CAC, so observation with aggressive medical therapy remains preferred here [^114rmXh9].

> Let me translate this into treatment intensity. I should double-check LDL-C targets: for a CAC of 1600, NLA recommends high-intensity statin therapy and, if necessary, add-on therapies to achieve at least a 50% LDL-C reduction with an optimal goal of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, reflecting a secondary-prevention-equivalent risk profile in primary prevention [^11292tWp] [^117RZcxB]. Hold on, I should verify aspirin use: given the very high CAC burden, the estimated ASCVD risk likely exceeds bleeding risk, so low-dose aspirin (81 mg) is reasonable to consider as part of a shared decision-making discussion, consistent with CAC-guided aspirin strategies in primary prevention when CAC > 100 [^1116PDAc] [^111Mc8nX].

> I need to ensure comprehensive risk modification is addressed beyond lipids. Aggressive blood pressure control toward contemporary thresholds, diabetes optimization if present, smoking cessation, diet pattern aligned with cardioprotective guidance, and daily physical activity are essential, and visualizing the CAC scan often improves adherence to lifestyle and pharmacologic therapies, which can be leveraged in counseling [^114wTS2B] [^116LF3wL]. Let me reconsider whether to add specifics on diet and exercise — while precise prescriptions vary, the key message is to intensify lifestyle therapy commensurate with this risk phenotype, which is consistent with CAC-guided care paradigms [^114wTS2B].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. For a CAC ≥ 100, it is reasonable to repeat CAC in about 3 years to assess for accelerated progression (> 20–25% per year), which could signal the need for even more aggressive LDL-C lowering or consideration of additional therapies, though statins themselves can modestly increase CAC over time and progression does not negate benefit [^112dUV5J] [^112hXRYe]. Wait, let me verify the interval — yes, 3 years is appropriate when baseline CAC is ≥ 100 and results would change management, which fits this case [^112dUV5J].

> I should confirm that shared decision-making is emphasized. Guidelines frame CAC as a tool to inform clinician–patient discussions, especially when treatment decisions are uncertain; here, the CAC of 1600 provides compelling evidence to intensify prevention, but the patient's values, bleeding risk, and preferences for pharmacotherapy should guide final choices, including aspirin and the addition of nonstatin agents if LDL-C goals are not met on maximally tolerated statin therapy [^113pTD23] [^111urNer]. Hold on, I should verify that CAC meaningfully reclassifies risk beyond traditional calculators — meta-analytic data show modest but consistent gains in discrimination and reclassification with CAC, supporting its use to personalize therapy in this context [^112tzkGm].

> But wait, what if the patient is very young or very old — does this change interpretation? I need to check age-specific guidance: in adults under 40, any CAC is uncommon and confers disproportionately high relative and lifetime risk, so even lower CAC scores can justify intensification; in adults 76–80, CAC can still refine decisions when statin use is uncertain, though competing risks and frailty must be weighed carefully, which still supports aggressive prevention here given the extreme CAC burden [^1136BBBS] [^113Ckeum]. Let me verify that the absolute score best predicts near-term risk while percentiles inform lifetime risk — yes, that distinction is emphasized by NLA and helps explain why a CAC of 1600 is actionable regardless of age-percentile specifics [^1116XR4L].

> In summary, a CAC score of 1600 places this patient in an extreme-high-risk primary prevention phenotype with near-secondary-prevention event rates; high-intensity statin therapy with a target LDL-C < 70 mg/dL and at least 50% LDL-C reduction, consideration of low-dose aspirin, and comprehensive risk factor optimization are indicated, while routine stress testing or angiography should be avoided in the absence of symptoms or reduced functional capacity; repeat CAC in 3 years to assess progression is reasonable, and all decisions should be anchored in shared decision-making given the magnitude of risk and the potential absolute benefit from aggressive prevention [^112e3QDh] [^117RZcxB] [^114rmXh9] [^112dUV5J] [^113pTD23].

A coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of 1600 indicates **extensive calcified atherosclerosis** and confers a very high risk of coronary events, with an annual event risk of ~2–3% and a 10-year risk exceeding 20% [^notfound]. This warrants **high-intensity statin therapy** to achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or < 55 mg/dL if additional risk enhancers are present) [^11292tWp], plus strict blood pressure control, smoking cessation, and intensive lifestyle measures [^114YtYQF]. Routine stress testing or angiography is not indicated in asymptomatic patients, but functional testing is appropriate if symptoms develop or functional capacity is limited [^114rmXh9]. Repeat CAC in 3–5 years can monitor progression and reinforce adherence [^112dUV5J].

---

## Clinical significance of CAC score 1600

- **Extent of atherosclerosis**: A CAC score of 1600 reflects extensive calcified plaque, indicating advanced coronary atherosclerosis and a high burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) [^112nt6DU].

- **Event risk**: Patients with CAC scores ≥ 1000 have an annual cardiovascular event risk of approximately 2–3%, with a 10-year risk exceeding 20% [^notfound].

- **Mortality risk**: High CAC scores (≥ 1000) are associated with significantly increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with a markedly elevated risk compared to lower scores [^116xY5UD].

---

## Risk stratification and clinical implications

| **Cac score category** | **Clinical implications** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| 0 | Very low risk; minimal calcified plaque | - No statin unless diabetes, smoking, or family history <br/> - Lifestyle modification [^116UNdVo] |
| 1–99 | Mild atherosclerosis | - Consider statin if ≥ 55 years or ≥ 75th percentile <br/> - Lifestyle modification [^111urNer] |
| 100–299 | Moderate atherosclerosis | - Statin therapy <br/> - Consider aspirin if ≥ 300 [^111Mc8nX] |
| ≥ 300 | Extensive atherosclerosis | - High-intensity statin <br/> - Aspirin <br/> - Aggressive risk factor control [^11292tWp] |
| ≥ 1000 | Very extensive atherosclerosis | - High-intensity statin <br/> - Aspirin <br/> - Aggressive risk factor control <br/> - Consider additional LDL-lowering therapies [^11292tWp] |

---

A CAC score of 1600 places the patient in the **highest risk category**, necessitating aggressive risk factor modification and pharmacologic therapy.

---

## Recommended clinical management

### Pharmacologic therapy

- **High-intensity statin therapy**: Initiate high-intensity statin therapy (e.g. atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) to achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, or < 55 mg/dL if additional risk enhancers are present [^notfound].

- **Additional LDL-lowering therapies**: Consider ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors if LDL-C goals are not achieved with statin therapy alone [^116LF3wL].

- **Aspirin therapy**: Daily aspirin (75–100 mg) is reasonable unless contraindicated by bleeding risk [^notfound].

- **Blood pressure control**: Target < 130/80 mmHg using guideline-directed medical therapy [^notfound].

---

### Lifestyle modifications

Emphasize **smoking cessation** with support and counseling; implement a heart-healthy dietary pattern (e.g. Mediterranean or DASH); encourage at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise; and aim for weight loss to achieve a BMI of 18.5–24.9 kg/m² [^notfound].

---

### Diagnostic testing and follow-up

Routine stress testing or coronary angiography is not indicated in asymptomatic patients with high CAC scores; reserve functional testing for those who develop symptoms or have limited exercise capacity [^114rmXh9]. Repeat CAC scoring in **3–5 years** can assess progression and reinforce adherence, though statins may modestly increase CAC over time [^112dUV5J] [^112hXRYe].

---

## Prognostic implications

A CAC score of 1600 confers a **poor long-term prognosis**, with significantly increased risks of myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, and mortality. Aggressive risk factor modification and adherence to therapy are critical to improving outcomes.

---

## Patient counseling and shared decision-making

Patients with a CAC score of 1600 should be counseled on the severity of their coronary atherosclerosis and the importance of aggressive risk factor modification. Shared decision-making should address the benefits and risks of pharmacologic therapy, lifestyle changes, and follow-up testing [^115o4LbU].

---

A CAC score of 1600 signifies **extensive calcified atherosclerosis** with very high cardiovascular risk, requiring aggressive pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions to reduce event risk and improve prognosis.

### Is there a role for coronary artery calcium scoring for management of asymptomatic patients at risk for coronary artery disease? clinical risk scores are not sufficient to define primary prevention treatment strategies among asymptomatic patients [^114yJ9C3]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Although risk factors have proven to be useful therapeutic targets, they are poor predictors of risk. Traditional risk scores are moderately successful in predicting future CHD events and can be a starting place for general risk categorization. However, there is substantial heterogeneity between traditional risk and actual atherosclerosis burden, with event rates predominantly driven by burden of atherosclerosis. Serum biomarkers have yet to show any clinically significant incremental value to the FRS and even when combined cannot match the predictive value of atherosclerosis imaging. As clinicians, are we willing to base therapy decisions on risk models that lack optimum-achievable accuracy and limit personalization? The decision to treat a patient in primary prevention must be a careful one because the benefit of therapy in an asymptomatic patient must clearly outweigh the potential risk. CAC, in particular, provides a personalized assessment of risk and may identify patients who will be expected to derive the most, and the least, net absolute benefit from treatment. Emerging evidence hints that CAC may also promote long-term adherence to aspirin, exercise, diet, and statin therapy. When potentially lifelong treatment decisions are on the line, clinicians must arm their patients with the most accurate risk prediction tools, and subclinical atherosclerosis testing with CAC is, at the present time, superior to any combination of risk factors and serum biomarkers.

### Coronary calcium score and cardiovascular risk [^1136soUb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a highly specific feature of coronary atherosclerosis. On the basis of single-center and multicenter clinical and population-based studies with short-term and long-term outcomes data (up to 15-year follow-up), CAC scoring has emerged as a widely available, consistent, and reproducible means of assessing risk for major cardiovascular outcomes, especially useful in asymptomatic people for planning primary prevention interventions such as statins and aspirin. CAC testing in asymptomatic populations is cost effective across a broad range of baseline risk. This review summarizes evidence concerning CAC, including its pathobiology, modalities for detection, predictive role, use in prediction scoring algorithms, CAC progression, evidence that CAC changes the clinical approach to the patient and patient behavior, novel applications of CAC, future directions in scoring CAC scans, and new CAC guidelines.

Conclusions

The Clinical Research Roundtable at the Institute of Medicine has identified translation of clinical research findings into improvements in medical care as the "next scientific frontier". While our analysis has some limitations, it provides methodology that will directly assist in the translation of research into practice. Our models, once validated, can be used directly by patients and clinicians to decide when it might be useful to order this potentially expensive test, and what to do with the results.

### Interpreting the coronary artery calcium score-critical information for the practicing physician [^116rF4pb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery calcium scanning is a routine test for assessing the severity of atherosclerosis in asymptomatic individuals. This inexpensive, noninvasive test quantifies the calcium deposition in the 4 principal coronary arteries. Correct interpretation is important to the physician (for recommending therapy) and to the patient (for determining his or her lifetime risk of a cardiovascular event). A score of 0 indicates that a cardiovascular event is extremely unlikely in the next 5 years. In contrast, a score greater than 0 portends a coronary event. The higher the score, the greater the risk. Both the arterial location of the calcium and the number of coronary arteries involved alter the interpretation of the calcium score. At any given age, females have significantly lower scores than males. One-third of individuals with scores greater than 1000 will have a cardiovascular event within 3 years. For all elevated calcium scores, aggressive treatment is warranted, including significant lifestyle changes and medications to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Understanding the importance of the coronary artery calcium score will result in improved therapy and patient compliance.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) future research directions emphasize that CAC-guided care leading to improved population health requires interventions that produce improved patient-centered outcomes via initiation of effective preventive strategies with established risk reduction; high-quality evidence is increasingly required to guide medical necessity and coverage decisions, current evidence suggests CAC-guided improved adherence to therapies and healthy behaviors, and recognition of CAC in primary prevention should increase given PCE limitations.

Discussion

In this article, we present a clinically useful method of combining information from the CAC score with pre-test coronary risk estimates. To fully appreciate the utility of this analysis, it may be worthwhile to discuss the example from the Background section further. According to current guidelines, this 60-year-old woman, whose 10-year CHD risk estimate is about 15%, should receive both aspirin and cholesterol-lowering drug therapy, aiming for a goal LDL cholesterol of 130 mg/dl. After measuring her CAC score, however, there is a good chance (64%) that our recommendations would change. If her CAC score were zero (47% chance), our estimate of her 10-year CHD risk would be approximately halved (6–9%). Given this information, we would continue to recommend a healthy diet and exercise, but might decide that cholesterol-lowering medication is unnecessary, and that the benefits of aspirin in terms of CHD prevention do not outweigh the risk of hemorrhagic stroke associated with aspirin use. On the other hand, if her CAC score were over 100 (17% chance), our estimate of her CHD risk would be approximately doubled (25–31% if CAC score = 101–400) or tripled (34–51% if CAC score > 400). In such a case, we would certainly recommend both aspirin and cholesterol-lowering medication and would probably aim for a more aggressive LDL cholesterol goal of < 100 mg/dl. The probability that her treatment plan would be altered by measurement of her CAC score, therefore, is approximately 64% (the probability that her score is either 0 or > 100 = 47% + 17%), indicating likely usefulness of the test in this situation.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) prognostic evidence in asymptomatic individuals — the review notes that since 2010 a synthesis of evidence reveals further validation of the prognostic utility of CAC in asymptomatic individuals; across 7 registries, the cumulative sample size is 84,182 with outcomes including all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, unstable angina hospitalization, late revascularization ≥ 3 months after scanning, and composite MACE; reported associations include relative risk ratios as high as 20 times greater for high risk CAC scores compared with a CAC score of 0; follow-up has been extended with mortality data beyond 10 years after CAC scanning, and analyses compare event risk among those with 0 CAC versus detectable CAC.

Expert opinion treatment recommendations — these sections propose treatment guidance based on expert opinion; the treatment recommendations are not based on randomized clinical trial evidence but have been extrapolated from retrospective analyses and non-randomized prospective evaluations, and they respond to frequent requests within the clinical community from generalists and cardiologists to guide treatment based on CAC findings.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^114rmXh9]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) distribution and downstream testing — For a given CAC score, a more diffuse CAC distribution (3 coronary involvement vs. 1) is associated with higher risk, and the left main coronary artery is the only vessel where vessel‑specific CAC appears to add beyond the total score; greater left main CAC predicts risk beyond the total CAC score, particularly when ≥ 25% of the total CAC score is present within the left main. More diffuse regional distribution of CAC or high left main CAC involvement should generally be viewed as an additional factor favoring more aggressive preventive pharmacotherapy, should not routinely trigger downstream stress testing in asymptomatic individuals with normal functional capacity, and should only prompt further workup when there are concomitant clinically relevant cardiovascular symptoms. There are no data to support benefit of coronary angiography in asymptomatic individuals with high CAC scores, and an RCT of 5179 subjects showed no benefit on cardiovascular outcomes of an initial invasive strategy versus an initial conservative strategy.

### The absence of coronary calcium: clinical and therapeutic implications for the clinical lipidologist [^115yLFh6]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac computed tomography for coronary artery calcium scoring, a diagnostic test associated with relatively low radiation exposure, provides incremental coronary risk stratification above that provided by Framingham risk scoring in asymptomatic, intermediate-risk patients. Knowledge of the appropriate use of coronary calcium scoring enables the clinician to more appropriately match the intensity of preventive cardiovascular care to the individual's absolute risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).

Methods

A Medline search was used for original articles pertinent to coronary artery calcium scoring from 2000 to 2010.

Results

Despite the presence of coronary risk factors, up to 45% of asymptomatic, presumed intermediate-risk patients referred for coronary calcium scoring have no detectable coronary calcium, a finding associated with a 1 to 2% 10-year risk of CHD death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Such patients could logically be given a more prolonged opportunity to respond to therapeutic lifestyle change and, if necessary, generic lipid-altering medication before more expensive treatment strategies are implemented.

Conclusions

Because coronary calcium scoring is usually a self-pay test, the test should be ordered only in those circumstances in which knowledge of the results will change coronary risk management. This review addresses these issues and attempts to place the clinical utility of this important diagnostic test in perspective for the clinician.

An Expert Panel of the National Lipid Association reviewed the evidence related to the use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring in clinical practice for adults seen for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Recommendations for optimal use of this test in adults of various races/ethnicities, ages and multiple domains of primary prevention, including those with a 10-year ASCVD risk < 20%, those with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome, and those with severe hypercholesterolemia were provided. Recommendations were also made on optimal timing for repeat calcium scoring after an initial test, use of CAC scoring in those taking statins, and its role in informing the clinician patient discussion on the benefit of aspirin and anti-hypertensive drug therapy. Finally, a vision is provided for the future of coronary calcium scoring.

### Role of coronary artery calcium score in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114KprZm]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

First developed in 1990, the Agatston coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an international guideline-endorsed decision aid for further risk assessment and personalized management in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This review discusses key international studies that have informed this 30 year journey, from an initial coronary plaque screening paradigm to its current role informing personalized shared decision making. Special attention is paid to the prognostic value of a CAC score of zero (the so called "power of zero"), which, in a context of low estimated risk thresholds for the consideration of preventive therapy with statins in current guidelines, may be used to de-risk individuals and thereby inform the safe delay or avoidance of certain preventive therapies. We also evaluate current recommendations for CAC scoring in clinical practice guidelines around the world, and past and prevailing barriers for its use in routine patient care. Finally, we discuss emerging approaches in this field, with a focus on the potential role of CAC informing not only the personalized allocation of statins and aspirin in the general population, but also of other risk-reduction therapies in special populations, such as individuals with diabetes and people with severe hypercholesterolemia.

### Coronary artery calcium scoring: an evidence-based guide for primary care physicians [^112NgB7R]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary care physicians often must decide whether statin therapy would be appropriate (in addition to lifestyle modification) for managing asymptomatic individuals with borderline or intermediate risk for developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), as assessed on the basis of traditional risk factors. In appropriate subjects, a simple, noninvasive measurement of coronary artery calcium can help clarify risk. Coronary atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, with atherosclerotic plaque formation involving intimal inflammation and repeated cycles of erosion and fibrosis, healing and calcification. Atherosclerotic plaque formation represents the prognostic link between risk factors and future clinical events. The presence of coronary artery calcification is almost exclusively an indication of coronary artery disease, except in certain metabolic conditions. Coronary artery calcification can be detected and quantified in a matter of seconds by noncontrast electrocardiogram-gated low-dose X-ray computed tomography (coronary artery calcium scoring [CACS]). Since the publication of the seminal work by Dr. Arthur Agatston in 1990, a wealth of CACS-based prognostic data has been reported. In addition, recent guidelines from various professional societies conclude that CACS may be considered as a tool for reclassifying risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients otherwise assessed to have intermediate risk, so as to more accurately inform decisions about possible statin therapy in addition to lifestyle modification as primary preventive therapy. In this review, we provide an overview of CACS, from acquisition to interpretation, and summarize the scientific evidence for and the appropriate use of CACS as put forth in current clinical guidelines.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores 1–10 — compared with CAC 0, risk is higher even at these low scores. One cohort reported 104 deaths in CAC 0 (0.52%) versus 58 deaths in CAC 1–10 (1.06%), with an adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality of 1.99 (95% CI: 1.44 to 2.75). In MESA, of 6809 individuals, 508 had a CAC score of 1–10 and, over a median 4.1 years, there were 28 coronary heart disease events; in a 9715-patient cohort with average 14.6 years follow-up, risk-adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality with CAC 1–10 vs CAC 0 were 1.99 in women and 1.7 in men.

### Clinical indications for coronary artery calcium scoring in asymptomatic patients: expert consensus statement from the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^115o4LbU]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2017). Medium credibility.

Shared decision making (SDM) and CAC-guided risk refinement — An essential tenet of patient-centered imaging is that patients have a clear understanding of the benefits and risks of an imaging test in an SDM discussion, and the 2013 ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guideline was the first guideline to strongly emphasize the importance of SDM before initiating statin therapy to discuss patient preferences, adverse effects, and the potential for ASCVD risk reduction benefits. Because of the issues with risk factor-based risk prediction, physicians may wish to refine treatment decisions based on CAC. The most widespread application is likely to be in the 10-year ASCVD 15–20% risk group in which CAC = 0 and a low CAC scores would largely refine risk downward to lowest or low strata. In the 10-year ASCVD 5–15% risk group, downward risk reclassification may be considered with 0 or low CAC scores. There is little role for risk reclassification in the 10-year ASCVD > 20% risk group, other than to provide persuasive confirmation of high risk in patients reluctant to take statins or to provide reassurance to those who are statin intolerant if they have 0 or low risk CAC. In the 10-year ASCVD < 5% risk group, a 0 or low CAC score would confirm low risk status and higher scores would identify those targeted for a greater intensity of lifestyle recommendations and treatment.

### Clinical indications for coronary artery calcium scoring in asymptomatic patients: expert consensus statement from the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^115Bgwjs]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2017). Medium credibility.

Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography expert consensus on coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring in asymptomatic patients summarizes the prognostic value of CAC and its ability to refine individual risk prediction, addresses limitations of traditional risk factor-based treatment strategies recommended by the 2013 ACC/AHA Prevention guidelines including the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Recommendation Statement for Statin Use for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Adults. It provides CAC based treatment recommendations both within the context of the shared decision making model espoused by the 2013 ACC/AHA Prevention guidelines and independent of these guidelines. Unlike global risk scores such as the Framingham Risk Score or the Pooled Cohort Equation (PCE), the CAC score is a direct marker of atherosclerosis in an individual patient and provides an assessment of the burden of coronary atherosclerosis, reflecting the integrated lifetime effect of all risk factors in an individual patient. The research base is extensive, with peer-reviewed publications exceeding 1250.

### CT-based calcium scoring to screen for coronary artery disease: why arent't we there yet? [^1152mqca]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to examine the value of coronary artery calcium scoring as a screening tool for identifying individuals at risk of experiencing a catastrophic coronary event.

Conclusion

Because of the noninvasive nature of CT and the large societal burden of coronary atherosclerosis, there is great interest in developing CT-based techniques for detection of coronary artery calcium, a known marker of underlying atherosclerosis. However, important questions remain including the role of calcium in the process of acute plaque rupture, the utility of this technique in the asymptomatic population, and the statistical distribution of calcium scores and hard cardiac events in the general population.

### Is calcium scoring of the coronary arteries necessary for proper management of asymptomatic subjects with classic risk factors? [^115TjVQQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

In 2000, I wrote an editorial entitled, "Detecting Coronary Calcium".1 For the past several years there have been numerous publications on this subject.

### Association of coronary artery calcium with long-term, cause-specific mortality among young adults [^112NdXEM]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the prevalence of coronary artery calcium (CAC) in adults aged 30 to 49 years with clinical indications for CAC scoring, and is CAC associated with long-term, cause-specific mortality in these young adults?

Findings

In this cohort study of 22 346 individuals from the CAC Consortium with clinical indications for CAC, 34.4% had prevalent CAC. The risk of death from coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, or all-cause mortality was significantly higher for those with elevated CAC scores, even after multivariable adjustment.

Meaning

Coronary artery calcium may potentially be used as a tool to aid decision-making among select young adults at elevated lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease; the relatively high prevalence of CAC in younger adults with cardiovascular risk factors reinforces the need for the adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors early in life.

### Coronary artery calcium score, risk factors, and incident coronary heart disease events [^111FBhAF]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Whether the absence of coronary artery calcium, or conversely the presence of high volumes of coronary artery calcium, may alter assessment of coronary heart disease risk based on traditional risk factors is uncertain. We sought to identify a potential threshold of coronary artery calcium for clinical use and examine the predictive power of coronary artery calcium in individuals categorized using conventional coronary heart disease risk assessment.

Methods

The study included 10,746 men and women (36.3%) with a mean age of 53.8 ± 9.9 years who were either physician- or self-referred for electron beam tomography scanning to a preventive medical clinic. Coronary heart disease risk factors were elicited by use of a questionnaire.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, 81 primary events (coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction) occurred. Among individuals with a coronary artery calcium score of zero, the primary event rate was very low (0.4 events per 1000 person-years of observation). When participants were stratified by self-reported coronary heart disease risk factors (0–2, or 3–4), a coronary artery calcium score ≥ 100 was associated with substantially increased risk of coronary heart disease events within each level of stratification. In a subgroup of participants with available clinical data, similar results were found when participants were categorized by Framingham risk scores.

Conclusions

Coronary artery calcium score can identify individuals at increased risk for coronary heart disease events who otherwise would be considered low-risk based on clinical assessment. A coronary artery calcium score of zero is associated with very low risk for coronary heart disease in the short to intermediate term (approximately 3.5 years) regardless of the number of risk factors present.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) absolute score versus percentile — risk prediction roles and examples: "Both total CAC score and age, sex, and race/ethnicity-based score percentiles should be provided on all score reports" because they convey different information. The "absolute CAC score is the best predictor of near-term absolute risk (i.e. risk of events over a 5–10 year time horizon)", whereas "CAC score percentiles give the best estimation of lifetime risk trajectory". In patients "younger than 50 years of age, any CAC will classify the patient at a high percentile", and a "40 years of age" patient "with a score of 10" has low near-term but very high relative and lifetime risk, while a "75 years of age" patient "with a score of 10" may have similar near-term risk but lower relative and lifetime risk versus peers.

Results

Study population

We identified 9341 persons without chest pain or a history of CHD presenting for their first EBCT scan between 4/15/95 and 12/31/97. Our sample was mostly middle-aged, but included persons as young as 35 years and as old as 88 years of age. Forty percent were women. The proportion with cardiac risk factors was high, though only 9% were diabetic (Table 1). Framingham 10-year CHD risk estimates ranged widely, mostly dependent on age, but most were between 7% and 15%.

Coronary artery calcium score distributions

Coronary artery calcium scores ranged from 0 to 4058. The mean score (± standard deviation) was 135 (± 377), and the median was 4 (25 th –75 th percentile: 0–87). The prevalence of zero scores ranged from 80% among women younger than 50 years to 5% among men 70 years old or older. After excluding zero scores, log-transformed CAC scores were approximately normally distributed, and appeared to be strongly associated with age and sex (Figure 1).

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score 0 — long-term risk is very low across endpoints, with a summary risk ratio for long-term follow-up of 0.29 (p < 0.0001); for cardiovascular disease endpoints with absent CAC the summary risk ratio was 0.20 (p < 0.0001), and for > 10-year all-cause mortality it was 0.36 (p < 0.0001). Among aging individuals with CAC = 0, event rates were 0.407% for CVD and 2.2% for CHD after 10 years, and in MESA 38% of patients with diabetes had a CAC score of 0.

It further states that CAC = 0 is associated with highly favorable cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular prognosis and that CAC = 0 is the strongest "negative risk marker" for ASCVD.

National Lipid Association scientific statement — key points on coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring state that for a given CAC score, a diffuse distribution of CAC suggests higher risk than more localized CAC, and the presence of left main coronary calcification, especially when > 25% of the total score is in the left main, suggests higher risk. There is no evidence to support the benefit of performing stress testing, or invasive coronary arteriography in asymptomatic individuals with high coronary calcium scores. A CAC score ≥ 100 is associated with > 7.5% 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, the guideline-based threshold of statin benefit in primary prevention. A CAC score ≥ 300 is associated with proportionately higher ASCVD risk than those with scores > 100, suggesting benefit from greater low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering. A CAC score ≥ 1000 is associated with an annual risk similar to that of the placebo group in the FOURIER trial, consistent with potential value of very aggressive LDL-C lowering with other ASCVD risk reduction strategies.

### Computed tomography for coronary artery calcification scoring: mammogram for the heart [^116LF3wL]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC), identified via low-radiation, non-contrast computed tomography of the heart, quantifies the burden of calcified coronary atherosclerosis. This modality is highly useful for cardiovascular (CV) risk stratification among individuals without known coronary heart disease (CHD), especially for those at intermediate risk. The presence of CAC is associated with up to a 10-fold higher risk of adverse CV events, even after fully adjusting for the standard CV risk factors. In fact, the CAC score is among the strongest clinically available predictors of future risk of adverse CV events among primary prevention patients. Additionally, the absence of CAC in asymptomatic individuals confers a very low risk of CV events. Even in the presence of a benign CV risk factor profile and normal cardiac stress test, a very high CAC score portends a high risk of adverse CV events. On the other hand, a CAC score of zero is associated with a low CHD risk despite significant CV risk factor profiles. CAC scoring is a quick, low-cost screening tool to help risk-stratify patients and identify those likely to benefit from aggressive preventive treatments (such as high-intensity statin therapy, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, and aspirin) and to identify those likely who warrant close monitoring. Moreover, individuals with a zero CAC score may be at low enough risk to avoid or defer daily aspirin therapy and pharmacological therapy for cholesterol management, and instead work on therapeutic lifestyle changes. An abnormal CAC score may also lead to better adherence to pharmacological regimens and suggested lifestyle changes.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of zero — examples of candidates who might benefit from knowing their CAC score is zero and related caveats are provided: Patients reluctant to initiate statin who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely; patients concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms; older patients (men 55–80 y of age; women 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factors who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy; and middle-aged adults (45–55 y of age) with PCE-calculated 10-year risk for ASCVD 5% to < 7.5%, with factors that increase their ASCVD risk, although they are in a borderline risk group. Caveats state that if a coronary artery calcium score of zero is obtained at intermediate risk and a risk decision is uncertain, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions are present and to reassess the coronary artery calcium score in 5 to 10 years, and that CAC testing should be performed in facilities with current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation possible.

### Calcification in atherosclerosis [^112nt6DU]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Coronary calcification has long been known to occur as a part of the atherosclerotic process, although whether it is a marker of plaque stability or instability is still a topic of considerable debate. Coronary calcification is an active process resembling bone formation within the vessel wall and, with the advances in CT technology of the past decade, can be easily quantified and expressed as a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. The extent of calcium is thought to reflect the total coronary atherosclerotic burden, which has generated interest in using CAC as a marker of risk of cardiovascular events. The current consensus is that large amounts of CAC identify a highly vulnerable patient rather than a vulnerable plaque or vulnerable vessel. Indeed, CAC has incremental prognostic value beyond traditional risk factors in various subsets of the population. Furthermore, whereas the presence of CAC is associated with increased risk, a zero CAC score predicts excellent short-term to mid-term prognosis, even in high-risk patients. The advent of CT angiography has perhaps clouded the importance of CAC as a long-term marker of risk, as opposed to the presence of luminal stenoses that are associated with a more immediate risk of events.

### Primary prevention for intermediate risk: the more things change, the more they stay the same [^1176y4MA]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is a potent tool in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk stratification. The presence and amount of CAC are directly associated with incident coronary heart disease event rates in middle-aged and older adults without known ASCVD. In asymptomatic people, a CAC score of zero portends very low coronary heart disease event rates as far out as 15 years.CAC scoring is recommended by the ACC/AHA primary prevention guidelines as a consideration in individuals at borderline (10-year ASCVD risk 5.0%- < 7.5%) and intermediate risk (≥ 7.5%-20%) when the decision regarding statin therapy is uncertain. Because approximately 25% of the U.S. adults are estimated to be at intermediate ASCVD riskand because of burgeoning cardiovascular care costs, it is essential to understand the economic impact of a CAC-driven approach to primary prevention.

### Coronary artery calcium staging to guide preventive interventions: a proposal and call to action [^112MvTzp]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) as measured by the Agatston score is a strong predictor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. In the 2019 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) clinical practice guideline for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, it is a Class IIa recommendation to use the CAC score to inform shared decision-making for individuals at intermediate risk if the decision to start statins is uncertain after global risk assessment and the consideration of risk enhancing factors. The 2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering in the management of ASCVD risk recommended that CAC measurement be considered to inform treatment decisions for adults without clinical ASCVD when there is either clinician uncertainty or patient hesitancy about starting statin therapy. That document recommended LDL-C threshold levels for the consideration of different intensities of statin and nonstatin therapy depending on the CAC score among borderline and intermediate risk individuals. Budoff and colleagues reported subsequently that the risk for major adverse cardiovascular events of individuals without clinical ASCVD with a CAC score > 300 is equivalent to the risk of individuals with a documented history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease (ie, ASCVD), suggesting that such patients could be treated similarly to those with clinical ASCVD.

Despite overwhelming evidence that CAC is a powerful predictor of ASCVD events and the aforementioned recommendations of medical societies, clinicians remain uncertain how to manage patients once they document the presence and quantity of CAC. A widely practiced, personalized approach to managing disease throughout medicine is to stage the disease. The rationale for staging is to determine the extent, severity, location, and prognosis of disease, and use this to tailor the type and intensity of therapy. Staging also provides a common language with which clinicians can communicate with each other and with patients. This approach has been adopted by the American Cancer Society. The AHA and ACC have developed a staging system to inform the management of heart failure. More recently, the AHA developed a staging system for cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome. One of the criteria defining Stage 3 in that construct is presence of subclinical atherosclerosis as defined by coronary calcium.

### Coronary artery calcium scanning: clinical paradigms for cardiac risk assessment and treatment [^1141k4N3]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scanning is being increasingly used for cardiac risk assessment in asymptomatic patients, particularly in those with a Framingham 10-year risk of 10% to 20%. Physician awareness of this technology and its appropriate uses and limitations is crucial to appropriate use.

Methods

With the goal of establishing clinical paradigms, this document integrates the results of key published articles, Framingham Risk Score, National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Plan III guidelines, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association exercise testing and angiographic guidelines, and the authors' extensive clinical experience.

Results

Coronary artery calcium scanning is best used in the asymptomatic population with a 10% to 20% risk of cardiac events over 10 years, with selected application in higher and lower risk categories. In the 10%-20% risk patient, coronary artery calcium scores > 100 or > 75th percentile for age and sex transform the moderately high-risk patient to higher risk status with the attendant recommendation for more aggressive therapy; scores from 11 to 100 and < 75th percentile are consistent with the 10%-20% 10-year risk status and scores from 0 to 10 and < 75th percentile convert the patient to lesser risk categories. If stress testing is planned in the asymptomatic patient, it should be preceded by coronary artery calcium scanning and performed only for scores > 400; it should always precede coronary angiography in these patients.

Conclusions

Coronary artery calcium scanning is an important risk assessment tool with direct clinical applications; it is of particular utility in the Framingham 10%-20% 10-year risk population.

### The role of coronary artery calcium in allocating pharmacotherapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: the ABCs of CAC [^112ga48N]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Determining optimal candidates for the numerous potential pharmacotherapies for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains challenging. Selective use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is recommended by the 2018 and 2019 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Cholesterol and Primary Prevention Guidelines as a tool for refining cardiovascular disease risk assessment. A growing body of research shows that CAC has potential value in allocation of primary prevention aspirin, determining blood pressure targets and treatment intensity, the intensity of cholesterol management, and use of the more expensive medications for type 2 diabetes. We also review the literature regarding very elevated CAC scores greater than 400 or 1000 and how these scores appear to confer a risk for cardiovascular disease on par with secondary prevention cohorts.

### Major global coronary artery calcium Guidelines [^114qPkCA]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes the framework behind global guidelines of coronary artery calcium (CAC) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk assessment, for applications in both the clinical setting and preventive therapy. By comparing similarities and differences in recommendations, this review identifies most notable common features for the application of CAC presented by different cardiovascular societies across the world. Guidelines included from North America are as follows: 1) the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease; and 2) the 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemia for Prevention of Adult Cardiovascular Disease. The authors also included European guidelines: 1) the 2019 European Society for Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemias; and 2) the 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Clinical Guidelines. In this comparison, the authors also discuss: 1) the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand Guidelines on CAC; 2) the Chinese Society of Cardiology Guidelines; and 3) the Japanese Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines for Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases. Last, they include statements made by specialty societies including the National Lipid Association, Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography, and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Utilizing an in-depth review of clinical evidence, these guidelines emphasize the importance of CAC in the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. International guidelines all empower a dynamic clinician-patient relationship and advocate for individualized discussions regarding disease management and pharmacotherapy treatment. Some differences in precise coronary artery calcium score intervals, risk cut points, treatment thresholds, and stratifiers of specific patient subgroups do exist. However, international guidelines employ more similarities than differences from both a clinical and functional perspective. Understanding the parallels among international coronary artery calcium guidelines is essential for clinicians to correctly adjudicate personalized statin and aspirin therapy and further medical management.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression and measurement principles: CAC scores increase by approximately 20–25% per year, and the Agatston score generally increases exponentially with scores in the range of 0–100 providing the greatest risk discrimination compared to higher scores; CAC should be measured only if such measurement will change treatment decisions and CAC does not regress; CAC progression cannot be used to measure the efficacy of statin therapy (statins modestly increase the CAC score); and in individuals undergoing repeat testing, progression of > 20–25% per year or an increase to a score of ≥ 400 after a previous CAC score > 0 is consistent with accelerated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) progression.

### Clinical indications for coronary artery calcium scoring in asymptomatic patients: expert consensus statement from the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^111piGCJ]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2017). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) serial scanning and intervals in asymptomatic adults — index CAC = 0 vs > 0: A subset of patients may prefer to defer statin treatment especially if the CAC = 0. In a cohort undergoing annual CAC scanning, 422 patients with a baseline CAC score of 0 (66.4% on statin therapy) were followed for 5 consecutive years or until conversion to CAC > 0, with an overall conversion rate from 0 to > 0 CAC of 25.1% and a mean time to conversion of 4.1 ± 0.9 years; other data have been consistent with a 3–5 year range. Expert consensus states it may be appropriate to consider repeat CAC scanning at an interval of 5 years for patients with 0 CAC and a 3–5-year interval for patients with > 0 CAC. For index CAC > 0, serial evaluation may also be reasonable among patients with a CAC score of 100 or higher, and MESA data suggests that the average time to symptom-driven intervention was ~4 years.

National Lipid Association scientific statement — treatment recommendations by CAC score specify that in adults with predominant left main coronary calcification, multi-vessel coronary involvement, or a high CAC score, stress testing or invasive coronary arteriography, in the absence of clinically relevant symptoms, is not recommended (COR III-Harm). In adults with CAC scores ≥ 100, initiation of statin therapy is recommended (COR I, LOE B-NR). In adults with CAC scores ≥ 300, and especially in those with CAC scores ≥ 1000, it is reasonable to use high intensity statin therapy, and if necessary, guideline-based add-on LDL-C lowering therapies to achieve a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C, and optimally an LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (COR IIa, LOE C-LD).

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) repeat testing intervals — it is reasonable to repeat CAC scoring in adults with CAC = 0 according to baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk: low risk (< 5% 10 year risk) at 5–7 years, borderline to intermediate risk (5–19.9% 10 year risk) at 3–5 years, and high risk or diabetes at 3 years. In adults with CAC scores 1–99, it may be reasonable to repeat CAC scoring in 3–5 years if the results might change treatment decisions. In adults with CAC scores ≥ 100 and an LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL, repeat CAC scoring at 3 years may be reasonable to assess for accelerated progression (> 20–25% per year) and/or an increase to a CAC score > 300, findings that may favor more aggressive LDL-C lowering.

Prognostic significance of coronary artery calcium (CAC) — uncertainties and follow-up are outlined, stating that the guideline uses available data to predict risk associated with CAC but that additional studies are needed. It notes particular uncertainty for intermediate CAC scores and that the predictive significance of a CAC score of zero requires further verification, with current uncertainty about when and if follow-up CAC measurements should be done; CAC measurement has been proposed as a third step when treatment uncertainty exists.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) = 0 — risk reclassification and age-stratified prognosis are described as follows: among adults with 10‑year ASCVD risk 5–7.4% or 7.5–19.9%, 57% and 45.0% had CAC = 0, respectively, yielding reclassification in 49% (956 of 1970). In MESA, adults 75–84 years of age with CAC = 0 had an approximate 98% survival rate at 8.5 years, exceeding 45–54-year-old individuals with CAC > 100 (82.9%); within the 75–84 group, hard CHD risk was increased 11-fold for CAC 1–100 and 20-fold for CAC > 100 versus CAC = 0.

### Coronary artery calcium scoring for individualized cardiovascular risk estimation in important patient subpopulations after the 2019 AHA / ACC primary prevention guidelines [^112bp3vC]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The 2018 and 2019 American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guidelines for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) recommend consideration of so-called "risk-enhancing factors" in borderline to intermediate risk individuals. These include high-risk race/ethnicity (e.g. South Asian origin), chronic kidney disease, a family history of premature ASCVD, the metabolic syndrome, chronic inflammatory disorders (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis [RA], psoriasis, or chronic human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), and conditions specific to women, among others. Studies suggest, however, that risk may be highly heterogeneous within these subgroups. The AHA/ACC guidelines also recommend consideration of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring for further risk assessment in borderline to intermediate risk individuals in whom management is uncertain. Although the combination of risk enhancing factors and CAC burden (together with Pooled Cohort estimates) may lead to more accurate ASCVD risk assessment, few publications have closely examined the interplay between risk enhancing factors and CAC scoring for personalized risk estimation. Our aim is to review the relevant literature in this area. Although further research is clearly needed, CAC assessment seems a highly valuable option to inform individualized ASCVD risk management in these important, often highly heterogeneous patient subgroups.

### Does coronary calcium scoring with a SCORE better predict significant coronary artery stenosis than without? Correlation with computed tomography coronary angiography [^113myRL3]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine effectiveness of coronary artery calcium score (CACS) alone and combined with Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) in adult patients for significant coronary artery stenosis by using computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) as reference standard.

Methods

Two thousand twenty-one patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent CACS test and CTCA. Patients were examined with dual-source CT and were grouped according to their age, gender, CACS, and estimated SCORE risk. Coronary plaque existence and degree of stenosis were assessed with CTCA. Sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curves were analyzed.

Results

CACS was the single independent variable in estimating relative risk of critical stenosis and had superior outcome when compared with SCORE risk in logistic regression and ROC curve. Area under the ROC curve was greatest in the interval between 50–59 years. When SCORE was combined with CACS in patients with zero CACS, percentage of significant stenosis increased from 1.4% to 7.0% in patients with high or very high SCORE risk, and decreased to 0.9% in patients with low or moderate SCORE risk.

Conclusions

CACS combination with SCORE risk predicts coronary artery stenosis. When CACS is zero, CTCA can be performed in patients with high or very high SCORE risk.

Risk classification and lipid-lowering therapy by CAC — CAC scoring is used to guide the initiation and intensity of statin therapy. High intensity statin therapy is recommended in any patients with a CAC ≥ 300 or above the 75th percentile for age/gender/race, consistent with the 2013 ACC/AHA Prevention Guidelines. Moderate to high intensity statin treatment is recommended for patients with CAC 100–299; for CAC 1–99, moderate intensity statin therapy is recommended for those with CAC percentile < 75% and moderate to high intensity for those with CAC percentile ≥ 75%. Patients with CAC = 0 are considered to be at lowest risk and statins are not uniformly recommended, with the exception of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or diabetes.

### Incremental value of the CT coronary calcium score for the prediction of coronary artery disease [^112v47dk]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The CT coronary calcium score (CTCS) is used in both the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) and the prediction of cardiovascular events. Although substantial evidence is available on the incremental value of CTCS in predicting future cardiovascular events and mortality in asymptomatic individuals, the diagnostic value in symptomatic patients is less clear.

A meta-analysis revealed that the presence of coronary calcium had a sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 40%, respectively, in detecting significant stenoses. Furthermore, numerous studies have reported on the value of CTCS in the prediction of the probability of obstructive CAD. However, the incremental value (i.e. in addition to all known clinical predictors of CAD) of the CTCS as a continuous predictor of prevalent obstructive CAD is less well studied.

The purpose of this study was to validate previously published clinical prediction models and to determine the incremental value of CTCS for the prediction of prevalent obstructive CAD in patients with new onset stable typical or atypical angina pectoris.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) risk assessment — evidence and guidelines: CAC has been shown to better identify asymptomatic individuals who would benefit from statins, aspirin, ACE inhibitors or the polypill, and patient viewing of the CAC scan has been shown to increase adherence to statin and ASA treatment, to diet and exercise and to improve lipids, BP and weight. Three prospective, population-based outcome trials demonstrated an extremely high net reclassification index of the Framingham Risk Score, ranging from 52% to 66% in the intermediate risk group, and a CAC score of 0 confers a low risk of mortality over a period of 15 years in low to intermediate FRS risk and a 5-year low risk period in high FRS risk. Since treatment of high risk patients with statins improves outcomes and CAC accurately detects high risk patients, the reduction in events could be expected to be as high as 30% based on primary prevention trials. Guideline statements cited on-page include that the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline assigned a class IIb (may be considered) recommendation to CAC for use when the Pooled Cohort Equation risk decision was unclear, the 2016 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines issued a class IIb recommendation for CAC to risk stratify asymptomatic individuals, and the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk stated that CAC was "likely to be the most useful of the current approaches to improving risk assessment among individuals found to be at intermediate risk after formal risk assessment".

### Prognostic implications of coronary artery calcium in the absence of coronary artery luminal narrowing [^114em3WT]. Atherosclerosis (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is a predictor of future adverse clinical events, and a surrogate measure of overall coronary artery plaque burden. Coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) is a contrast-enhanced method that allows for visualization of plaque as well as whether that plaque causes luminal narrowing. To date, the prognosis of individuals with CAC but without stenosis has not been reported. We explored the prevalence of CAC > 0 and its prognostic utility for future mortality for patients without luminal narrowing by CCTA.

Methods

From 17 sites in 9 countries, we identified patients without known coronary artery disease, who underwent CAC scoring and CCTA, and were followed for > 3 years. CCTA was graded for % stenosis according to a modified American Heart Association 16-segment model. We calculated hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for incident mortality and compared risk of death for patients as a function of presence or absence of CAC and presence or absence of luminal narrowing by CCTA.

Results

Among 6656 patients who underwent CCTA and CAC scoring, 399 patients (6.0%) had no coronary luminal narrowing but CAC > 0. During a median follow-up of 5.1 years (IQR: 3.9–5.9 years), 456 deaths occurred. Compared to individuals without luminal narrowing or CAC, individuals without luminal narrowing but CAC > 0 were older, more likely to be male and had higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Individuals without luminal narrowing but CAC experienced a 2-fold increased risk of mortality, with increasing risk of mortality with higher CAC score. Following adjustment, incident death persisted (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–2.9, p = 0.02) among patients without luminal narrowing but with CAC > 0 compared with patients whose CACS = 0. Individuals without luminal narrowing but CAC ≥ 100 had mortality risks similar to individuals with non-obstructive CAD (0 < stenosis < 50%) by CCTA [HR 2.5 (95% CI 1.3–4.9) and 2.2 (95% CI 1.6–3.0), respectively].

Conclusions

Patients without luminal narrowing but with CAC experience greater risk of 5-year mortality. Patients with CAC score ≥ 100 and no coronary luminal narrowing experience death rates similar to those with non-obstructive CAD.

Severe primary hypercholesterolemia — coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring stratifies atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk: in a heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia cohort of 206 patients, 49% (n = 101) had CAC = 0 with no ASCVD events, while scores 1–100 or > 100 had annualized event rates per 1000 patients of 26.4 (95% CI, 12.9–51.8) and 44.1 (95% CI, 26–104.1); in a MESA analysis of individuals with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, those with CAC = 0 had an ASCVD incidence rate of 4.7 per 1000 person-years (0.4% per year) versus CAC > 0 at 26.4 per 1000 person-years (2.0% per year). These data support strong risk discrimination with CAC, and while CAC = 0 does not preclude the need for long term evidence-based LDL-C lowering therapy, CAC > 0 identifies a group in which particularly aggressive LDL-C lowering strategies should be undertaken.

Key points and reporting recommendation — CAC score interpretation and communication: The absolute CAC score is stated to be the best predictor of absolute 5- to 10-year ASCVD event risk and should be used to estimate number needed to treat and guide pharmacologic treatment decisions, while the CAC score percentile from MESA is the best predictor of relative risk and lifetime risk trajectory and should estimate lifetime treatment benefit. Physicians reporting CAC scores should report both the absolute Agatston CAC score and the age, sex, and race/ethnicity-based CAC percentiles (Class I, LOE B-NR).

CAC = 0 — prognosis and negative risk marker: Among patients aged ≥ 75 years, 16% of 1663 had a calcium score of zero, with a survival rate of 98% at a mean follow up of 5.6 years. In the Biolmage study of adults aged 55–80 years, 86% qualified for statin therapy for primary prevention due to a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥ 7.5%, and within this population CAC = 0 as well as CAC < 10 were the strongest negative risk factors for development of cardiovascular disease over a median follow-up of 2.7 years. Key points emphasize that CAC = 0 is associated with highly favorable cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular prognosis and is the strongest "negative risk marker" for ASCVD.

Recommendations for selective CAC scoring across age groups: Clinicians should use CAC scoring, when indicated, for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment regardless of race/ethnicity or gender (COR I, B-NR). In selected individuals < 40 years of age with multiple major ASCVD risk factors or a family history of premature ASCVD, it is reasonable to use CAC > 0 to favor intensification of lifestyle therapy and, if necessary, initiation of statin therapy (COR IIa, B-NR). In adults 76–80 years of age with an LDL-C of 70–189 mg/dL in whom the decision to employ statin therapy is uncertain, CAC scoring is useful in ASCVD risk reclassification (COR IIa, B-NR).

### Coronary artery calcium score and polygenic risk score for the prediction of coronary heart disease events [^115Q49iN]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Coronary artery calcium score and polygenic risk score have each separately been proposed as novel markers to identify risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), but no prior studies have directly compared these markers in the same cohorts.

Objective

To evaluate change in CHD risk prediction when a coronary artery calcium score, a polygenic risk score, or both are added to a traditional risk factor-based model.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Two observational population-based studies involving individuals aged 45 years through 79 years of European ancestry and free of clinical CHD at baseline: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study involved 1991 participants at 6 US centers and the Rotterdam Study (RS) involved 1217 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

Exposure

Traditional risk factors were used to calculate CHD risk (eg, pooled cohort equations [PCEs]), computed tomography for the coronary artery calcium score, and genotyped samples for a validated polygenic risk score.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Model discrimination, calibration, and net reclassification improvement (at the recommended risk threshold of 7.5%) for prediction of incident CHD events were assessed.

Results

The median age was 61 years in MESA and 67 years in RS. Both log (coronary artery calcium+1) and polygenic risk score were significantly associated with 10-year risk of incident CHD (hazards ratio per SD, 2.60; 95% CI, 2.08–3.26 and 1.43; 95% CI, 1.20–1.71, respectively), in MESA. The C statistic for the coronary artery calcium score was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71–0.79) and for the polygenic risk score, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.63–0.71). The change in the C statistic when each was added to the PCEs was 0.09 (95% CI, 0.06–0.13) for the coronary artery calcium score, 0.02 (95% CI, 0.00–0.04) for the polygenic risk score, and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.07–0.14) for both. Overall categorical net reclassification improvement was significant when the coronary artery calcium score (0.19; 95% CI, 0.06–0.28) but was not significant when the polygenic risk score (0.04; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.10) was added to the PCEs. Calibration of the PCEs and models with coronary artery calcium and/or polygenic risk scores was adequate (all χ² < 20). Subgroup analysis stratified by the median age demonstrated similar findings. Similar findings were observed for 10-year risk in RS and in longer-term follow-up in MESA (median, 16.0 years).

Conclusions and Relevance

In 2 cohorts of middle-aged to older adults from the US and the Netherlands, the coronary artery calcium score had better discrimination than the polygenic risk score for risk prediction of CHD. In addition, the coronary artery calcium score but not the polygenic risk score significantly improved risk discrimination and risk reclassification for CHD when added to traditional risk factors.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^116UNdVo]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing — statin withholding, reassessment, and exceptions: Caveats state that if patient is at intermediate risk and if a risk decision is uncertain and a coronary artery calcium score is obtained, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions, such as cigarette smoking, family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), or diabetes mellitus, are present and to reassess coronary artery calcium score in 5 to 10 years; moreover, if CAC scoring is recommended, it should be performed in facilities that have current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation dose. Clinicians should not downclassify risk in patients who have coronary artery calcium scores of zero but who are persistent cigarette smokers, have diabetes, have a family history of ASCVD, or, possibly, have chronic inflammatory conditions, and in the presence of these conditions, a coronary artery calcium of zero does not rule out risk from noncalcified plaque or increased risk of thrombosis.

### Evaluation of the incremental value of a coronary artery calcium score beyond traditional cardiovascular risk assessment: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112tzkGm]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) are used to help assess patients' cardiovascular status and risk. However, their best use in risk assessment beyond traditional cardiovascular factors in primary prevention is uncertain.

Objective

To find, assess, and synthesize all cohort studies that assessed the incremental gain from the addition of a CACS to a standard cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk calculator (or CVD risk factors for a standard calculator), that is, comparing CVD risk score plus CACS with CVD risk score alone.

Evidence Review

Eligible studies needed to be cohort studies in primary prevention populations that used 1 of the CVD risk calculators recommended by national guidelines (Framingham Risk Score, QRISK, pooled cohort equation, NZ PREDICT, NORRISK, or SCORE) and assessed and reported incremental discrimination with CACS for estimating the risk of a future cardiovascular event.

Findings

From 2772 records screened, 6 eligible cohort studies were identified (with 1043 CVD events in 17 961 unique participants) from the US (n = 3), the Netherlands (n = 1), Germany (n = 1), and South Korea (n = 1). Studies varied in size from 470 to 5185 participants (range of mean [SD] ages, 50 [10] to 75.1 [7.3] years; 38.4%-59.4% were women). The C statistic for the CVD risk models without CACS ranged from 0.693 (95% CI, 0.661–0.726) to 0.80. The pooled gain in C statistic from adding CACS was 0.036 (95% CI, 0.020–0.052). Among participants classified as being at low risk by the risk score and reclassified as at intermediate or high risk by CACS, 85.5% (65 of 76) to 96.4% (349 of 362) did not have a CVD event during follow-up (range, 5.1–10.0 years). Among participants classified as being at high risk by the risk score and reclassified as being at low risk by CACS, 91.4% (202 of 221) to 99.2% (502 of 506) did not have a CVD event during follow-up.

Conclusions and Relevance

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that the CACS appears to add some further discrimination to the traditional CVD risk assessment equations used in these studies, which appears to be relatively consistent across studies. However, the modest gain may often be outweighed by costs, rates of incidental findings, and radiation risks. Although the CACS may have a role for refining risk assessment in selected patients, which patients would benefit remains unclear. At present, no evidence suggests that adding CACS to traditional risk scores provides clinical benefit.

Adults younger than 40 years — considering coronary artery calcium (CAC) to stratify preventive therapy: current cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk equations that guide decisions regarding preventive medications are largely driven by age, and despite the presence of cardiovascular risk factors and elevated lifetime risks of CVD, the 10-year estimates of CVD risk are low in younger adults; CAC can stratify risk in younger adults who may benefit from aggressive CVD preventive therapies, such as those with a family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or those with multiple major ASCVD risk factors. In the CARDIA Study, a prospective community-based cohort of 5115 asymptomatic Black and White adults aged 18–30 years followed for ~30 years, at year 15 of the study, 3043 participants (mean age 40.3 years) underwent CAC testing and were followed up for 12.5 years; the prevalence of CAC was 10.2%; there was a 5-fold increase in fatal and nonfatal CHD and a 3-fold increase in any CVD event in those participants with CAC > 0 compared to those with CAC = 0; additionally, CAC scores as low as 1–19 increased the risk of CHD events by 2.6-fold and CAC ≥ 100 increased the risk of CHD event by 9.8-fold.

Borderline and intermediate risk assessment and coronary artery calcium use — Periodic assessment of risk factors is advised at least every 4 to 6 years in younger adults 20 to 39 years of age. Among adults at borderline (5% to < 7.5%) and intermediate (≥ 7.5% to < 20%) risk, one may consider additional individual risk-enhancing clinical factors to revise the 10-year ASCVD risk estimate. For individuals with intermediate-predicted risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20%) by the PCE or for select adults with borderline (5% to < 7.5%) predicted risk, coronary artery calcium measurement can be a useful tool in refining risk assessment for preventive interventions, and in these groups it can reclassify risk upward (particularly if coronary artery calcium score is ≥ 100 Agatston units (AU) or ≥ 75th age/sex/race percentile) or downward (if coronary artery calcium is zero).

### Utilizing coronary artery calcium to guide statin use [^114HPmKB]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, and accounts for over 30% of annual global fatality. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) screening, a highly distinct marker of coronary atherosclerosis, serves as an important arbitrator of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Particularly in asymptomatic individuals, CAC testing offers a model for initiating or prolonging preventative statin therapies and subsequently up- or down-risking of patients. Though recent 2018 ACC/AHA Guidelines on Blood Cholesterol recommend CAC as an arbitrator of statin use, it remains uncertain whether these recommendations have been universally followed. Thus, we present a thorough discussion about CAC as an important determinator of ASCVD risk. In this regard we highlight the key points behind coronary artery calcium scoring, as a critical platform for stratifying risk and guiding future preventative treatments. This review paper supplies a background for the 2018 Cholesterol Guidelines: the rationalization behind CAC as a crucial arbitrator of cardiovascular risk. This paper will first (1) outline the role of CAC in reclassifying ASCVD risk. Next, it will (2) discuss studies that illustrate CAC's markedly novel reduction in the number needed to treat (NNT) to ameliorate one major cardiac event. Being years removed from 2018 Guidelines provides this paper the lens to (3) elucidate upcoming value-based advantages, cost effectiveness, and patient adherence brought by CAC. Last, this paper will also (4) extend the utility of CAC beyond that of the general population, and (5) discuss pertinent limitations brought by CAC score. By summarizing the framework behind recent cholesterol guidelines for ASCVD risk assessment, this review will address the debate of use of CAC for both the clinical setting and preventative therapy applications.

For follow-up, repeat CAC scanning at 5 years for 0 CAC and 3–5 years for > 0 CAC when results would alter preventive management. In the 5–20% ASCVD risk group, CAC = 0: statin not recommended; CAC 1–99: moderate intensity statin if < 75th percentile and moderate to high intensity statin if ≥ 75th percentile; CAC 100–299: moderate to high intensity statin + ASA 81 mg; CAC ≥ 300: high-intensity statin + ASA 81 mg.

In adults with CAC scores ≥ 100 and an low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 70 mg/ dL, repeat CAC scoring at 3 years may be reasonable to assess for accelerated progression (> 20–25% per year) and/or an increase to a CAC score > 300.

### Prognostic utility of risk enhancers and coronary artery calcium score recommended in the 2018 ACC / AHA multisociety cholesterol treatment guidelines over the pooled cohort equation: insights from 3 large prospective cohorts [^112jXgZ5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

We found more incremental benefit in combining the risk enhancers into an aggregate score. The aggregate score demonstrated a graded increase in 10‐year rate of incident ASCVD that may provide more information to restratify patients within the intermediate‐risk category and more informatively supplement the clinician–patient risk discussion. Patients are more likely to participate and be satisfied with the outcome of shared decision making when an estimate of their absolute risk is provided. For example, a patient with intermediate risk might give different weights to an absolute 10‐year risk of 7.5% for 0 to 1 risk enhancers, compared with an upwardly revised 33% 10‐year ASCVD risk for 5 or more risk enhancers, during the risk discussion. Also, the absolute risk estimate may provide a useful clue for intensification of statin therapy among those who are already on a low‐ to moderate‐intensity statin. Notably, we found that having ≥ 3 risk enhancers represent an optimum threshold for initiation or intensification of statin therapy because it resulted in significant net reclassification, particularly among those in the intermediate‐risk category. CAC score was also confirmed to significantly reclassify intermediate‐risk individuals, and the rates of events by the level of CAC score paralleled those by the aggregate risk‐enhancer score. These data suggest that either multiple risk enhancers or CAC should be considered when risk decision remains uncertain, because both were shown to reclassify a clinically meaningful proportion (9%–13%) of intermediate‐risk individuals.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111urNer]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk enhancers and coronary artery calcium (CAC) to guide statin therapy are outlined as follows: In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy. In patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When CAC is measured to inform treatment, if the coronary artery calcium score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years when higher-risk conditions are absent; if the coronary artery calcium score is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; and if the coronary artery calcium score is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) measurement — intermediate-risk adults and statin decision thresholds: In adults at intermediate risk, coronary artery calcium measurement can be effective for meaningfully reclassifying risk in a large proportion of individuals, and in such intermediate-risk adults, those with coronary artery calcium = 100 AU or coronary artery calcium ≥ 75th percentile have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event rates for which initiation of statin therapy is reasonable. Those with coronary artery calcium scores of zero appear to have 10-year event rates in a lower range for which statin therapy may be of limited value. For those with coronary artery calcium scores of 1 to 99 AU, 10-year ASCVD event rates are 3.8%, 6.5%, and 8.3% for adults 45 to 54, 55 to 64, and 65 to 74 years of age, respectively, indicating that risk reclassification is modest for individuals with scores of 1 to 99; therefore, for patients with coronary artery calcium scores of 1 to 99, it is reasonable to repeat the risk discussion, and if these patients remain untreated, repeat CAC measurement in 5 years may have some value, but data are limited.

### Unveiling the true cardiovascular risk in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: is coronary artery calcium scoring with treatment the right approach? [^114vXwSR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

I was intrigued by the recent article by MacLeod and colleagues on the prevalence and clinical correlates of radiologically detected coronary artery disease (CAD) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The article highlights the high prevalence of CAD in patients with COPD and its weak correlation with clinical symptoms and cardiovascular risk scores. This study offers valuable insights into the often underestimated cardiovascular risks in patients with COPD and showcases the potential of imaging screening for CAD detection. However, I would like to emphasize several key limitations in the study that could significantly influence the interpretation of the results and suggest areas for improvement in future research.

Although the study reports a high area under the curve for coronary artery calcium scoring with treatment (CACS-Tx) in detecting CAD (0.98 for any CAD and 0.89 for obstructive CAD), these figures, though statistically significant, should be interpreted with caution. It is important to recognize that CACS-Tx is an indirect measure of CAD, primarily reflecting calcification rather than the presence of functionally significant coronary stenosis. The lack of correlation between CAD detection via CACS-Tx and clinical symptoms or risk scores, as mentioned in the study, is a key limitation. In clinical practice, CAD screening is not solely about identifying the presence of calcification but assessing whether the disease will lead to adverse outcomes, such as myocardial infarction or ischemic events, which is not addressed by CACS-Tx. Moreover, although CACS-Tx shows promise in risk stratification, its application as a universal screening tool for CAD in patients with COPD may lead to overdiagnosis and unnecessary interventions. There is insufficient evidence to recommend CACS-Tx as a standalone diagnostic tool in this population, and its routine use could strain healthcare resources without providing clear clinical benefit. Notably, the temporal relationship between CACS-Tx–detected CAD and clinical outcomes is not established. Longitudinal studies that track the progression of CAD in patients with COPD and correlate these findings with long-term clinical outcomes are necessary to determine whether CACS-Tx truly improves patient management or simply identifies asymptomatic disease that may not require intervention.

CAC = 0 is the single strongest negative predictor for developing a cardiovascular event; in MESA it was compared with 12 other negative risk markers, including hsCRP < 2 mg/L, and was much more reassuring than all other markers for reducing post-test cardiovascular risk.

### Coronary calcium characteristics as predictors of major adverse cardiac events in symptomatic patients: insights from the CORE 320 multinational study [^11735D7i]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In patients, risk stratification of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease is critical for determining clinical management. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a component of atherosclerosis almost solely found in atherosclerotic arteries. 1 Measured by noncontrast cardiac‐gated computed tomography (CT), CAC has proved to be an important subclinical predictor of incident cardiovascular disease 2 and scoring of CAC is considered one of the best subclinical cardiovascular disease measures for risk prediction of cardiovascular events. 1, 3, 4 Together with traditional risk factors, CAC scoring can be used to calculate an accurate estimate of the 10‐year coronary heart disease risk. 5 Conversely, absence of CAC is associated with good prognosis. 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Although mostly performed in asymptomatic individuals, there is evidence that CAC scoring also has prognostic value in symptomatic populations. 11, 12, 13, 14

Assessment of the extent of CAC is of importance for prediction as well as for diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. 15 Beyond the Agatston calcium score, other characteristics, such as the calcium area, volume, mass, and density of plaques in coronary arteries, can be obtained from coronary calcium scanning. 16 Several studies have shown associations between CAC density and risk of cardiovascular events 17 and mortality. 17, 18 However, little is known about the predictive value of specific characteristics of CAC in symptomatic individuals. The aim of this study is to determine to what extent these specific CAC characteristics are associated with major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in symptomatic individuals suspected of having coronary artery disease (CAD).

Lower-risk adults — statin value and CAC testing: Benefit from statin therapy is also seen in lower-risk individuals, and for those in the 5% to < 7.5% risk range, available generic statins are cost-effective; although a coronary artery calcium score can be useful in select individuals, it will be positive less often in this lower-risk group than in those with higher levels of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and is not recommended routinely.

### Coronary artery calcium in 2023: guidelines for LDL-C goals, non-statin therapies, and aspirin use [^111WaHQH]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Personalizing risk assessment and treatment decisions for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) rely on pooled cohort equations and increasingly coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. A growing body of evidence supports that elevated CAC scores correspond to progressively elevated ASCVD risk, and that scores of ≥ 100, ≥ 300, and ≥ 1000 denote risk that is equivalent to certain secondary prevention populations. This has led consensus guidelines to incorporate CAC score thresholds for guiding escalation of preventive therapy for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals, initiation of non-statin lipid lowering medications, and use of low-dose daily aspirin. As data on CAC continues to grow, more decision pathways will incorporate CAC score cutoffs to guide management of blood pressure and cardiometabolic medications. CAC score is also being used to enrich clinical trial study populations for elevated ASCVD risk, and to screen for subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in patients who received chest imaging for other diagnostic purposes.

### Interpretation of the coronary artery calcium score in combination with conventional cardiovascular risk factors: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) [^112Hvqwr]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score predicts coronary heart disease (CHD) events, but methods for interpreting the score in combination with conventional CHD risk factors have not been established.

Methods and Results

We analyzed CAC scores and CHD risk factor measurements from 6757 black, Chinese, Hispanic, and white men and women aged 45 to 84 years in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). CAC was associated with age, sex, race/ethnicity, and all conventional CHD risk factors. Multivariable models using these factors predicted the presence of CAC (C statistic = 0.789) and degree of elevation (16% of variation explained) and can be used to update a "pretest" CHD risk estimate, such as the 10-year Framingham Risk Score, that is based on an individual's conventional risk factors. In scenarios in which a high CAC score is expected, a moderately elevated CAC score of 50 is reassuring (eg, reducing risk from 10% to 6% in a healthy older white man), but when a low/zero CAC score is expected, even with identical pretest CHD risk, the same CAC score of 50 may be alarmingly high (eg, increasing risk from 10% to 20% in a middle-aged black woman with multiple risk factors). Both the magnitude and direction of the shift in risk varied markedly with pretest CHD risk and with the pattern of risk factors.

Conclusions

Knowledge of what CAC score to expect for an individual patient, based on their conventional risk factors, may help clinicians decide when to order a CAC test and how to interpret the results.

1 Optimal management is often uncertain in those at intermediate risk. 2, 3 Coronary artery calcium is a marker of overall coronary atherosclerotic burden. It is detected by noncontrast computed tomography and quantified by the Agatston score, which is the sum of the products of attenuation and area of all lesions in the coronary arteries at each slice. 2, 3 Because CAC is a marker of atherosclerotic disease, it may provide superior risk estimation over traditional risk factors. Accuracy PREDICTIVE VALUE FOR CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS AND MORTALITY In a 12. 3-year study of 7, 042 participants, the risk of major CHD events was

1. 9-fold higher with a CAC score of 1 to 99 and 4. 2-fold higher with a score of 100 or greater. 6 In a cohort study of 3, 745 participants, the 10-year rate of major CHD events was 0. 6 to
2. 7 per 1, 000 person-years with a CAC score of 0 vs.
6. 5 to
9. 9 per 1, 000 person-years with a score of 100 or greater.

CAC score is also a predictor of all-cause mortality. In a 6. 8-year study, patients with a CAC score of 101 to 400 or a score greater than 400 had a
5. 6- or 9. 7-fold greater risk of all-cause mortality, respectively, compared with a score of
0. 9 In a 15-year study, the survival rate was 95. 1% in patients with a score of 0 vs.
83. 7% in those with a score greater than 0.
10. Bottom Line CAC score is a strong predictor of CHD, CVD, and mortality risk and provides risk discrimination and stratification beyond that provided by traditional risk factor models. Its greatest potential is in patients with intermediate risk, in which allocation of statins and aspirin can be improved by limiting treatment to those with elevated CAC scores and deferring or delaying treatment in those with a score of 0.

However, no studies have demonstrated that measuring CAC score to guide primary prevention in the intermediate-risk population improves outcomes.

### Coronary artery calcium is a common finding in older… [^113xcYiC]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Kenny Lin, MD, MPH Posted on October 2, 2023 The 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol management guidelines advised that for patients with an intermediate 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, a coronary artery calcium score can be used to guide the decision to start or defer statin therapy: If the CAC score is zero, statin therapy should be withheld or delayed unless the patient is a cigarette smoker, has diabetes, or has a strong family history of premature ASCVD. A CAC score of 1 to 99 suggests statin therapy, particularly for patients 55 years and older. If the CAC score is 100 or greater or in the 75th percentile or greater, statin therapy is indicated for any patient unless otherwise deferred by the outcome of the physician–patient risk discussion. AFP editorial, Drs.

John Mandrola and Andrew Foy argued that "it is unclear if knowing the coronary artery calcium score would improve decision quality or adherence to statin therapy. " However, a recent Diagnostic Tests article by Dr. Hu Ying Joanna Choi concluded that "CAC score is a strong predictor of coronary heart disease, CVD, and mortality risk and provides risk discrimination and stratification beyond that provided by traditional risk factor models". Incidental detection of CAC on chest computed tomography scans performed for other reasons in people without clinical ASCVD was demonstrated in a previous study to increase statin prescriptions, cardiology clinic visits, and stress tests. Until recently, however, the prevalence of CAC in asymptomatic adults was not known. Using data from the National Institutes of Health-sponsored Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis in people 45 to 84 years of age without ASCVD symptoms at baseline, Dr.

The study authors concluded the following: lthough CAC presence is associated with increased ASCVD risk regardless of age, CAC is common as age increases. Its detection provides an opportunity to discuss ASCVD risk but should avoid provoking unnecessary patient anxiety. Further, given the high prevalence of CAC at older ages, a finding of CAC on a CT scan should not reflexively result in a specialist referral or a prescription for a statin and/or aspirin, but rather a comprehensive ASCVD risk assessment with consideration of competing risks and patient preferences.

### Using the coronary artery calcium score to predict… -JAMA network… [^111zYweP]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Meta-analysis of the 4 studies meeting inclusion criteria yielded a summary adjusted relative risk of 2. 1 for a coronary artery calcium score of 1 to
100. Relative risk estimates for higher calcium scores were higher, ranging from 3. 0 to
17. 0 but varied significantly among studies. Subgroup analyses suggested that differences among studies in outcome adjudication, measurement of other risk factors, tomographic slice thickness, and/or proportion of female study subjects may account for this heterogeneity. Conclusion The coronary artery calcium score is an independent predictor of coronary heart disease events. The median absolute CAC scores were 0, 26, 183, and 664.

The median CS% scores were 0%, 31%, 75%, and 94%. These representative scores were used to calculate adjusted relative risk estimates using the equations presented in each article. = 0.48) but varied significantly for the 101 to 400 and greater than 400 categories. In the present study, we show that CAC is associated with an increased risk of CHD events, even when other risk factors for CHD are taken into account. The relative risks associated with increasing CAC score are at least as large as those associated with established CHD risk factors. Persons with even low amounts of CAC have about twice the risk of CHD events compared with persons who have no evidence of CAC, and high CAC scores are associated with very high relative risks.

and sex-adjusted estimates of this woman's predicted CAC score, 12 we estimate her "posttest" CHD risk to be 6% if her CAC score = 0; 12% if CAC score = 1–100; 29% if CAC score = 101–400; or 48% if CAC score > 400, using the summary adjusted relative risk estimates from all 4 studies.

### The case against coronary artery calcium scoring for… [^113ekHV6]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

mg per dL, yielding a baseline 10-year ASCVD risk between 5. 6% if you are using the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis risk calculator and
8. 8% using the ACC/AHA risk calculator. The MESA score is the only cardiovascular risk calculator that provides a score with, and without, coronary artery calcium values that has been validated in a large prospective sample. 4 without knowing the coronary artery calcium score the patient's risk could change from approximately 6% to between 3% and 11% with the coronary artery calcium score included, and the anticipated NNT of statin therapy could change from approximately 50 to between 30 and 100.

The most likely outcome of coronary artery calcium testing for this patient is a coronary artery calcium score greater than 0, and his absolute risk of having an ASCVD event would not be significantly altered. Proponents also argue that the coronary artery calcium score helps reclassify patients up or down in the risk of cardiovascular disease relative to the pooled cohort equation. Data from the MESA cohort of 5, 185 people were used to conclude that adding the coronary artery calcium score to the risk estimator resulted in a better prediction of ASCVD events. Therefore, if a person is reclassified to a higher risk group with coronary artery calcium vs. the pooled cohort equation alone, there is an approximately one in six chance the reclassification is correct, and a five in six chance it is incorrect.

Potential harms from coronary artery calcium testing include radiation exposure (approximately 1 mSv; higher for patients with a body mass index greater than 30 kg per m. Percutaneous revascularization does not improve outcomes over optimal medical therapy 12; therefore, it is likely that most interventions that result from coronary artery calcium testing represent overtreatment and incur potential harm. Coronary artery calcium testing for cardiovascular disease risk assessment also goes much farther than an LDL cholesterol test or a risk calculator. For some patients, knowing they have calcium in their coronary arteries makes them believe they have heart disease, which can be life changing.

### Should family physicians use coronary artery calcium… [^111PtbrF]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

3 More problematic, however, is that a large number of patients without CAD will have risk factors, and many with CAD will have normal cholesterol levels. 4 Moreover, a recent study of survivors of ST elevation myocardial infarction found that less than one-half would be considered candidates for intensive preventive management according to current global CAD risk scores.
5. 2 Coronary artery calcification is thought to result from the replacement of dead cells and extracellular lipid in atheromatous plaque with apatite, thus signifying advanced lesions. 6 Although not necessarily representative of the degree of stenosis, coronary artery calcification does signify the presence of CAD. 7 Perhaps reflecting the overall burden of atherosclerotic plaque, CAC scores correlate with the likelihood of having a cardiac event. Low CAC scores are associated with a low risk of events.

Higher scores are associated with increased relative risk of coronary death or myocardial infarction.
2. CAC scoring adds predictive value to existing global risk scores, such as the Framingham risk score. In particular, CAC scores help to reclassify a patient from intermediate risk to either the lowest or highest risk group. One-fourth of the patients in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis longitudinal cohort were better classified into the correct category of CAD risk when CAC scores were considered. 8 Similarly, one-half of the patients in a cohort of asymptomatic older patients followed for 9. 2 years were reclassified from intermediate risk into either the high-risk or low-risk category, among which 40 percent were deemed high-risk.

9 In a cohort of veterans, 15 percent of those estimated to have low risk by the Framingham risk score were found to have significant burdens of CAC and higher relative risk of cardiac mortality, compared with veterans who had lower CAC scores but high Framingham risk scores.
10. Practically speaking, better risk prediction may help tailor prevention recommendations with regard to lipid and blood pressure management. Interestingly, knowledge that patients had abnormal CAC scores was associated with increased adherence to aspirin use, dietary modifications, and physical activity. Certain considerations should temper enthusiasm for widespread CAC screening for CAD risk assessment. A calcium score of zero does not completely exclude the presence of CAD, because up to 6 percent of symptomatic patients with no detectable coronary calcium who undergo cardiac catheterization will have significant coronary stenosis.
