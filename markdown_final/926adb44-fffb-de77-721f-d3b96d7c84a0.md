## Question

31-year-old woman with 5 months of intermittent flank pain, five UTIs over 2 years, hypertension, bilateral nontender upper abdominal masses, elevated BUN and creatinine; renal ultrasound shows bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple parenchymal anechoic masses.

A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 5-month history of intermittent flank pain. Over the past 2 years, she has had five urinary tract infections. Her blood pressure is 150/88 mm Hg. Physical examination shows bilateral, nontender upper abdominal masses. Serum studies show a urea nitrogen concentration of 29 mg/dL and a creatinine concentration of 1.4 mg/dL. Renal ultrasonography shows bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple parenchymal anechoic masses. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Answer Choices:
A. Medullary sponge kidney
B. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
C. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease
D. Obstructive cystic dysplasia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis best explains a 31-year-old woman with intermittent flank pain, recurrent UTIs, hypertension, palpable bilateral upper abdominal masses, elevated BUN/creatinine, and renal ultrasound showing bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple parenchymal anechoic masses. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how the imaging and exam findings map onto cystic kidney diseases. Then, I should verify which hereditary cystic disease fits the age and phenotype. Next, I will consider key differentials like medullary sponge kidney and obstructive cystic dysplasia, and why they don't fit. Finally, I will confirm the diagnosis with guideline-based criteria and outline next steps in evaluation and management.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical picture: bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple parenchymal anechoic masses on ultrasound, palpable bilateral flank masses, hypertension, recurrent UTIs, and mild renal insufficiency in a 31-year-old woman. This constellation is classic for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, which presents with progressive bilateral cystic enlargement, flank pain, hematuria, hypertension, and recurrent infections, and often progresses to chronic kidney disease over decades [^d8d126f2] [^cc870233].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging interpretation before concluding. Multiple parenchymal anechoic masses in enlarged kidneys are characteristic of ADPKD, where cysts arise from tubular epithelium and progressively replace parenchyma. Ultrasound typically shows numerous hypoechoic cysts, and cross-sectional imaging can further characterize cyst burden and complications, aligning with the described findings [^feb6c70f] [^cc870233].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should consider medullary sponge kidney, but it does not fit here. Medullary sponge kidney is a developmental anomaly with medullary cystic dilations that are typically small and confined to the papillae, and it does not cause marked kidney enlargement or palpable flank masses; thus, the bilateral nephromegaly with large parenchymal cysts argues against MSK in this case [^notfound].

> I need to check autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease as a differential. ARPKD presents in infancy or early childhood with massively enlarged, echogenic kidneys and congenital hepatic fibrosis; it is not a plausible diagnosis in a 31-year-old without a history of neonatal disease, so this option is inconsistent with the patient's age and phenotype [^ee6d5905].

> Let me consider obstructive cystic dysplasia. This is typically unilateral or associated with severe congenital urinary tract obstruction and is not characterized by bilateral symmetric cystic enlargement of both kidneys in an adult without obstructive uropathy, making it a poor fit for this presentation [^notfound].

> I should confirm the diagnosis using accepted criteria. In adults with a positive family history or compatible imaging, ultrasound is the first-line modality, and the presence of bilateral kidney enlargement with multiple cysts supports ADPKD. When imaging is equivocal or family history is negative, MRI or CT and genetic testing can clarify the diagnosis, which aligns with KDIGO guidance for suspected ADPKD in adults [^b68df8dd] [^7ef196a3] [^3fc3bd49].

> Next, I should review the clinical implications and next steps. ADPKD explains the hypertension via activation of the renin-angiotensin system from cyst compression and ischemia, the recurrent UTIs from cyst infection risk, and the CKD from progressive parenchymal replacement. Management includes blood pressure control with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, surveillance for complications, and counseling on family screening, consistent with contemporary guidelines and reviews [^d8d126f2] [^cc870233].

> Putting this together, the most likely diagnosis is autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, given the bilateral nephromegaly with multiple parenchymal cysts, palpable flank masses, hypertension, recurrent UTIs, and mild renal insufficiency in early adulthood, with the alternatives failing to match the age, distribution, and imaging pattern [^d8d126f2] [^feb6c70f].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)** [^d8d126f2], given the classic triad of bilateral renal enlargement with multiple cysts, hypertension, and progressive renal impairment, along with recurrent UTIs and palpable flank masses. ADPKD typically presents in adulthood with enlarged kidneys, multiple cysts, and hypertension, and is supported by the ultrasound findings and clinical course [^cc870233]. Medullary sponge kidney presents with medullary nephrocalcinosis and does not cause renal enlargement or palpable masses; autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease presents in infancy with severe renal and hepatic disease; and obstructive cystic dysplasia is congenital and unilateral or asymmetric, not bilateral and symmetric like ADPKD [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features supporting ADPKD

- **Bilateral renal enlargement**: Enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts are a hallmark of ADPKD, typically detected on ultrasound as bilateral renal enlargement with multiple parenchymal anechoic masses [^d8d126f2] [^feb6c70f].
- **Hypertension**: Hypertension is common in ADPKD, often developing before renal impairment, and is present in this patient [^d8d126f2] [^08096fc6].
- **Recurrent UTIs**: Patients with ADPKD are prone to recurrent UTIs due to cyst infections, which correlate with the patient's history of five UTIs over two years [^2d884389] [^48589676].
- **Palpable flank masses**: Large, palpable kidneys are characteristic of ADPKD due to significant renal enlargement from multiple cysts [^d8d126f2] [^0274d1f7].
- **Progressive renal impairment**: Elevated BUN and creatinine indicate declining renal function, consistent with ADPKD progression [^d8d126f2] [^cc870233].

---

## Imaging findings consistent with ADPKD

Ultrasound typically shows **bilateral renal enlargement with multiple parenchymal anechoic masses** — cysts that are usually round, well-defined, and distributed throughout the renal parenchyma [^d8d126f2] [^feb6c70f]. CT or MRI further characterizes cyst burden, kidney volume, and complications such as hemorrhage or infection [^cc870233] [^7ff03270].

---

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other options

| **Option** | **Reason for exclusion** |
|-|-|
| Medullary sponge kidney | - Presents with medullary nephrocalcinosis and small cysts confined to the renal medulla <br/> - Does not cause significant renal enlargement or palpable masses [^notfound] |
| Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) | - Presents in infancy or early childhood with severe renal and hepatic involvement <br/> - Not compatible with adult presentation [^ee6d5905] |
| Obstructive cystic dysplasia | - Congenital and typically unilateral or asymmetric <br/> - Not bilateral and symmetric like ADPKD [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings are most consistent with **autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)** [^d8d126f2]. Further evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is recommended to confirm the diagnosis, assess cyst burden, and identify complications such as hemorrhage or infection [^7ff03270] [^8a1d61df]. Genetic counseling and family screening should also be considered given the hereditary nature of ADPKD [^c1eda8c7] [^1292f92e].

### Atraumatic bilateral renal subcapsular urinomas in a young, healthy female [^84502ebb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinomas are rare and generally result from trauma to any part of the urinary collecting system. Appropriate imaging is crucial in the timely diagnosis and management of urinomas and for ruling out other etiologies such as subcapsular renal hematomas and perinephric abscesses.

Case Report

A 31-year-old woman with no past medical history or known trauma presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a week of right flank pain, abdominal pain, and intermittent fevers. On point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), she was found to have a complex right perinephric collection, later confirmed with computed tomography (CT) imaging. She was treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and discharged after a 3-day hospital admission with instructions to follow up with Urology. A day later, she was readmitted with worsening bilateral flank pain and persistent fevers. Image-guided percutaneous aspirations of her bilateral perinephric fluid collections revealed both urine and blood. A right ureteral stent was then placed with ultimate resolution of her symptoms. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? Urinomas without history of trauma are rare and should be on the differential for patients presenting with flank pain and infectious symptoms. Urinomas or other expanding perinephric fluid collections can result in superimposed infection, rupture, secondary hypertension, and renal failure. Here, we present an atypical case of atraumatic bilateral renal subcapsular urinomas with hemorrhagic components in a young and healthy woman. Our case further outlines the utility of POCUS in the ED for the timely diagnosis and management of this disease process.

### Spontaneous renal artery dissection masquerading as urinary tract infection [^56e2b445]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous renal artery dissection is a rare clinical entity, and symptoms vary from non-specific abdominal pain to life-threatening hypertension. A 44-year-old woman with no significant medical history initially presented with symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infection which did not respond to antibiotic therapy. Imaging revealed right renal infarction resulting from focal spontaneous renal artery dissection, which was managed conservatively. CT angiography is the preferred imaging modality for the diagnosis of this condition. Treatment options include medical management of hypertension with or without anticoagulation, endovascular intervention and surgical revascularisation depending on the presentation and the extent of the vascular and renal parenchymal involvement. This case emphasises the need to have high index of suspicion for uncommon diagnoses in patients who present with common symptoms but do not respond to empiric therapy.

### Persistent fetal lobulation of kidney mimicking renal tumour [^90a787de]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Renal pseudotumour is a term coined to describe conditions of renal anatomic variants that simulate focal renal pathology like a tumour on ultrasonography. These include persistent fetal lobulation, hypertrophy of Bertin columns and dromedary humps. We report a case of a 30-year-old nulliparous woman who was managed in gynaecology clinic for menorrhagia and was subsequently referred to us for management of recurrent urinary tract infections. The clinical examination was normal and on ultrasound scan, she was found to have multiple enlarged heterogeneous solid masses in both kidneys with significantly increased vascularity, suspicious for neoplastic lesions. She subsequently underwent a CT urogram and her case was discussed in uro-radiology meeting where a diagnosis of persistent fetal lobulation was made excluding other diagnoses. She was managed conservatively. We also present grey scale and Doppler ultrasound and CT urogram findings of this condition along with the literature review.

### Complications of sporadic, hereditary, and acquired renal cysts: cross-sectional imaging findings [^13b2bdae]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Commonly encountered in the general adult and elderly population, in most cases simple renal cysts are confidently diagnosed on imaging studies and do not require further workup or treatment. However, large or growing renal cysts sometimes cause symptoms or signs such as hypertension, palpable mass, flank or abdominal pain, obstructive uropathy, and hematuria, which may indicate the need for minimally invasive percutaneous or laparoscopic treatment. Furthermore, severe complications such as cystic hemorrhage, rupture, or superinfection may occur, particularly in patients with polycystic renal disorders, either hereditary (namely adult polycystic kidney diseases) or acquired in chronic renal failure. This pictorial essay reviews and discusses the cross-sectional imaging appearances of symptomatic and complicated sporadic, hereditary, and acquired renal cysts. Early cross-sectional imaging with multidetector computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging or both, including contrast enhancement unless contraindicated by renal dysfunction, is warranted to investigate clinical and laboratory signs suggesting retroperitoneal hemorrhage or infection in patients with pre-existent renal cysts, particularly if large, multiple, or hereditary.

### Complete staghorn calculus in polycystic kidney disease: infection is still the cause [^e2df6d47]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 37-year-old ADPKD female patient with positive family history was admitted in this hospital for repeatedly urinary tract infection for 3 years. Three years ago, the patient was admitted in community hospital for urinary tract irritation with right flank pain and fever for 2 days, and right upper urinary tract infection was considered. After admission, bilateral enlarged kidneys full of fluid-filled cysts were detected by type-B ultrasound examination, and there were no calculus or crystals in the kidneys detected at that time. ADPKD was diagnosed considering her family history. Since then, she suffered from urinary tract infection every 3–4 months, and urine cultures were negative. Symptoms usually were relieved within a week with antibiotics therapy, but the infections relapsed easily.

One week before admission, this patient's urinary irritation relapsed with high fever. As oral antibiotics were not responsive, she was admitted in this hospital for further treatment. On admission, her temperature was 39.0°C, blood pressure 110/82 mmHg. Physical examination revealed the bilateral enlarged kidneys that were palpable, tenderness existed in right flank area. Full blood cell count showed white blood cell count 11.1 × 10 9 /l, hemoglobin 12.3 g/dl and platelets 157 × 10 9 /l. A serum biochemical profile showed her renal function was normal with serum creatinine 0.74 mg/dl. Liver function and electrolytes were unremarkable. Urinalysis revealed +3 leukocytes, +2 blood, and +1 albumin. Chest radiology and electrocardiography were reported to be normal. Abdominal CT scan showed enlarged cystic kidneys and a complete staghorn calculus in the right kidney with no obvious signs of urinary tract obstruction (Figure 1). Wide spectrum antibiotics was administered intravenously and the symptoms relieved in 3 days.

### Spontaneous bilateral renal pelvis rupture during CT in the absence of urinary tract obstruction: case report [^58094953]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Atraumatic renal pelvis rupture without pre-existing renal or ureteric pathology is an uncommon event. It is reported in the setting of acute urinary tract obstruction, most often secondary to ureteric calculi. Typical symptoms include acute flank pain and nausea, mimicking pyelonephritis or other causes of acute abdomen. Spontaneous rupture occurring bilaterally without identifiable urinary tract obstruction is exceedingly rare, and has yet to be reported in current English literature. Possible contributing pathophysiological mechanisms can be postulated from reported cases of rupture with observed obstruction.

Case Presentation

A 58-year-old woman undergoing multiphasic computed tomography (CT) for evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic haematuria developed on-table bilateral renal pelvis rupture seen only after contrast administration, on the delayed phase. There was no significant past medical history of note. The patient remained asymptomatic throughout and after the study, and was managed conservatively. Follow-up radiographical imaging over a month showed resolution of urinoma and no further contrast extravasation. No complications or recurrence was subsequently noted.

Conclusions

Spontaneous rupture of the renal pelvis can be a rare complication of intravenous contrast administration even in cases without identifiable urinary tract obstruction, and it can occur bilaterally. Cases can uncommonly be asymptomatic but typical symptoms should prompt evaluation of the kidneys, particularly when they are not included in the initial study or no delayed phase is protocolled. Interval imaging for resolution of urinoma and contrast extravasation is clinically relevant to monitor for and avoid infective sequelae.

### A rare case of a combination of ectopic kidney and medial arcuate ligament syndrome: a case report [^bed2c535]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The patient was a 24-year-old female who visited our hospital due to fever, dysuria, urinary frequency and left flank pain for two days. She had no systemic disease or a family history of systemic disease and seldom visited a hospital. The primary survey at our urology clinic included physical examinations, urinalysis, renal and bladder sonography, and abdominal X-ray according to her symptoms. Her abdomen was soft and flat, with no palpable mass. A throbbing pain was noted during the examination of the left costovertebral angle. The urinalysis showed pyuria and hematuria. Abdominal X-ray showed no urolithiasis. However, renal sonography showed dilatation of the left renal pelvis and an absent right kidney. The right kidney was found in the pelvic cavity near the bladder by bladder sonography. The primary diagnoses were left acute pyelonephritis, left hydronephrosis, and right ectopic kidney. The patient was admitted to our hospital for further treatment and evaluations due to acute illness.

After admission, the initial vital signs indicated fever (38.2℃), tachycardia (heart rate 124/min), normal respiratory rate (16/min), and low blood pressure (101/57mmHg). Laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 8390/µL, hemoglobin level of 11.9 g/dL, and BUN/CRE of 10.4/0.59. Broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics were given for infection control. Computed tomography (CT) was performed to identify the etiology of the left hydronephrosis. The CT showed right ectopic kidney in the pelvis (Fig. 1), dilatation of left renal pelvis without definite ureteral lesion (Fig. 1), and good bilateral renal contrast enhancement. In addition, compression of the celiac axis due to obstruction by the MAL was incidentally noted (Fig. 2). We rechecked her history for abdominal symptoms due to the CT images. Some evidence was found during repeat history taking. She was underweight (158 cm, 42 kg, BMI = 16.82) and had experienced postprandial nausea, abdominal pain, and delayed gastric emptying for many years.

Case presentation

A 66-year-old female with a history of bilateral ADPKD and urinary tract infection was admitted due to pain in the right flank. The pain in the right flank started approximately 15 days ago, remained persistent, and presented with a low-grade fever and weakness. Although her body temperature was approximately 36.7 °C, she complained of a low basal body temperature throughout the day. There is a family history of ADPKD, but she denied any associated hematuria, dysuria, or weight loss. Physical examination showed no bilateral kidney area bulge or percussed pain. Urinalysis revealed normal red blood cell levels, with white blood cell levels significantly increased to 105.45/μL (normal, 0–28/μL), and the blood tests showed white blood cell levels of 12.8 × 10 9 /L (normal, 3.5 × 10 9–9.5 × 10 9 /L), red blood cell levels of 3.05 × 10 12 /L (normal, 3.8 × 10 12–5.1 × 10 12 /L), and elevated C-reactive protein levels (167 mg/L). Renal function tests showed a serum creatinine level of 145 μmol/L (normal, 41–81 μmol/L) and BUN levels, total carbon dioxide, uric acid, and glomerular filtration rate all within normal limits. Urine culture suggested an Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection. Blood culture was not performed. Before admission, the patient underwent conventional ultrasound imaging to determine her symptoms, etiology and assess the right kidney.

### A clinical view of simple and complex renal cysts [^5df53fc3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

The availability and use of abdominal diagnostic ultrasonography or computed tomography has led to the frequent detection of asymptomatic renal cysts. The vast majority of these are simple cysts that are usually unilateral and solitary with well-defined structural and imaging features and whose occurrence, number, and bilaterality increase with age. Simple cysts are asymptomatic, except when complications such as hemorrhage, infection, or rupture lead to the development of complex cysts with calcification, demarcation irregularities, and multilobularity. The diagnostic challenges that cysts present are in the differentiation of the less common complicated complex cysts from those associated with malignancy and when numerous the possible heralding of genetic or acquired multicystic diseases of the kidney.

### Rare variant of genetically confirmed tuberous sclerosis complex presenting with bilateral renal angiomyolipoma in Wünderlich syndrome [^40be2fed]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 28-year-old woman came for non-traumatic right flank pain with hypotension and right flank mass. She had multiple hyperpigmented skin papules located on the centre area of her face, and angiomas on her toes. She was anaemic and had a blood transfusion on top of aggressive fluid resuscitation. Abdominal CT showed bilaterally enlarged kidneys and fluid collection in the right perirenal space (haemorrhage). The consideration was an angiomyolipoma in spontaneous perinephric haemorrhage. We considered tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and did genetic testing. Results revealed mutations in the TSC2 gene, consistent with the diagnosis of TSC. No immediate surgical plans were considered at that time. She opted to be discharged against medical advice and was scheduled for a close outpatient follow-up. The patient followed up after 2weeks, already on sirolimus 2mg once daily. She reported improved overall well-being and a decrease in the flank mass size.

### The diagnostic value of DMSA scan in differentiating functional pseudo-tumors from malignancies in scarred kidneys: case series and literature review [^869821b3]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case 5

Our last case is a 5-year-old girl with sacral agenesis, neurogenic urinary bladder, bilateral grade 3 VUR and CKD stage 3. She had recurrent episodes of UTI despite being on clean intermittent catheterization and UTI antimicrobial prophylaxis. Vesicostomy was planned. Pre-operative renal US was done to evaluate the degree of hydronephrosis and showed a new finding of a right upper pole renal mass that was occupying most of the kidney parenchyma (Fig. 5 (A)). This mass was not reported/seen on the US scan done a few months prior. In the period between the 2 US scans, she had 2 symptomatic UTIs. She was admitted to the hospital for renal mass work up. No urinary symptoms suggestive of UTI, hematuria, abdominal pain or palpable masses were reported. DMSA scan showed focal tracer uptake in the mid-pole of the right kidney and a tracer defect in the upper pole (Fig. 5 (B)). The nodule on the ultrasound was presumed to correspond to the focal uptake on DMSA scan suggesting the diagnosis of FPT. However, SPECT DMSA; which would have allowed better characterization of the mid-pole uptake and the right upper pole defect; was not done. After vesicostomy, she had no further episodes of UTI. The mass was followed up with serial renal US studies that didn't detect an increase in size over a two-year duration. However, a new mid-pole hyperechoic nodule was detected in the left kidney on a follow up US and showed tracer uptake on repeat DMSA scan.

### Obstructive nephropathy without hydronephrosis: suspicion is the key [^5737ab87]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract obstruction leading to acute kidney injury is usually associated with bilateral hydroureters and hydronephrosis, often accompanied by oliguria. We present an atypical case of obstructive uropathy without these features that presented with severe acute kidney injury. A 64-year-old male with no known medical history has presented with a 2-week history of nausea, decreased appetite, flank pain, and lower extremity edema, and was found to have an elevated creatinine of 10.5mg/dL. Renal ultrasound showed mild prominence of the bilateral renal collecting systems with no evidence of hydronephrosis. Computed tomography scan showed findings suggestive of retroperitoneal fibrosis involving ureteral region and bilateral ureteral stent placement has led to dramatic improvement of creatinine to 1.3mg/dL over the next 4 days.

### Unusual familial cystic kidney disease: combining fine radiologic and genetic evaluation to solve the case [^9ec97a32]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent hereditary kidney disease, characterized by enlarged kidneys with numerous cysts, high blood pressure, and a variety of extrarenal complications. This disease is a significant cause of renal failure and requires accurate differentiation from other cystic kidney diseases, especially when family history does not clearly indicate ADPKD. This is crucial due to differences in prognosis, treatment, and familial implications. Advanced molecular genetics and imaging techniques are employed to diagnose and assess the prognosis of patients and their families.

Case Presentation

The case study revolves around three patients from the same family-two sisters and one daughter-referred to a nephrology department for ADPKD management. The initial proband, a 42-year-old woman, experienced abdominal discomfort leading to an ultrasound that suggested ADPKD. However, MRI findings indicated standard-sized kidneys with bilateral parapelvic cysts, and no genetic markers for ADPKD were found. Her sister, presenting with controlled hypertension and similar ultrasound findings, also had her initial ADPKD diagnosis refuted by MRI and genetic testing, which revealed no significant mutations. The daughter, however, exhibited a different scenario with enlarged kidneys and multiple cysts characteristic of early-stage ADPKD. Genetic testing confirmed a deleterious PKD1 mutation, suggesting a de novo mutation, as her father showed no signs of the disease.

Conclusion

This study highlights the complexity and necessity of thorough diagnostic processes in suspected ADPKD cases to prevent misdiagnosis. The initial symptoms and imaging might misleadingly suggest ADPKD, as seen in the cases of the two older patients. Still, further detailed imaging and genetic analyses revealed no ADPKD, preventing inappropriate treatment and stress. In contrast, the younger patient's distinctive clinical and genetic profile confirmed ADPKD, illustrating the variability within even closely related individuals. Such detailed assessments are crucial in guiding correct treatment decisions and providing accurate familial counseling, emphasizing the importance of considering a broader spectrum of renal cystic disorders before confirming a diagnosis of ADPKD.

### A case report of a young girl with recurrent hematuria: a missed diagnosis-renal nutcracker syndrome [^d7504cdc]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A ten- year- old girl, presented to our clinic with a history of four episodes of unexplained painless gross hematuria since the age of two years. Each episode had spontaneous gradual resolution, while the period between the episodes was from 3 months to 3 years. She denied any other signs or symptoms including fever, headache, convulsions, periorbital edema, joint pain, abdominal or flank pain, weight loss, skin rash, bleeding tendency, dysuria or intermittent micturition. Hematuria was not preceded by upper respiratory tract infection or related to urinary trauma or exercises. There was no history of hospital admission or blood transfusion. She had a history of allergy to mosquito bites, negative history of deafness in the family and a positive history of renal stones in the family (mother & uncle). Urine analysis (UA), kidney function tests (KFT) and renal ultrasounds were repeatedly normal. She was treated as a case of urinary tract infection by different specialists in outpatient clinics.

On examination she was slightly pale. Her weight and height were 20 kg (below 3rd centile) and 128 cm (below 10th centile) respectively. Her blood pressure (BP) was 100/70 mmHg and systemic examination was normal.

Laboratory investigations showed mild iron deficiency anemia (Hb 10 g/dl), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 50 mm/hr. Other investigations including KFT, calcium, uric acid, C- reactive protein (CRP), sickling test, C3, C4, anti-nuclear antibodies, antistreptolysin O, spot urinary calcium/ creatinine ratio (0.08) and 24 h urine collection for calcium and oxalate, all were normal.

Urine analysis confirmed gross hematuria (RBCs full number), albumin + 1, white blood cells 10–12/ high power field (HPF), negative nitrite, and absent casts. Microscopic hematuria was noticed after resolution of gross hematuria. Screening UA for the patient family members was negative. A plain abdominal x-ray was normal. Renal US showed normal kidney measurements and echogenicity and it excluded hydronephrosis, masses or stones.

### Renal infarction versus pyelonephritis in a woman presenting with fever and flank pain [^eeb0f0ee]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with fever, flank pain, and dysuria frequently are encountered in the emergency department. Acute pyelonephritis is the most likely diagnosis; however, its clinical and radiologic presentation consistently overlap with that of acute renal infarction. Ultrasound is unable to distinguish early infarction from nonabscessed acute pyelonephritis. Hence, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging are needed. We report the case of a 68-year-old woman who presented with fever, flank pain, and dysuria, along with respiratory distress and tachycardia. Elevated values for inflammatory indexes suggested a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, and subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed hypodense wedge-shaped areas in both kidneys. However, the presence of a thin rim of capsular enhancement (cortical rim sign), the absence of perirenal inflammatory changes, and the location of the lesions apart from defined calyces suggested the alternative diagnosis of renal infarction. The underlying cause was not identified until an episode of acute dyspnea revealed paroxysmal arrhythmia. Our case demonstrates that a thorough knowledge of the imaging findings of renal infarction and acute pyelonephritis is essential to correctly making the diagnosis.

### Renal vein thrombosis mimicking urinary calculus: a dilemma of diagnosis [^bd533e25]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 38-year-old woman presented to the emergency room in a regional hospital with nausea and left flank pain that had suddenly started 12 h earlier. She had a history of left flank trauma, having fallen from 2-meter- height 5 years earlier. Physical examination revealed no tenderness over the abdomen or flank and normal chest auscultation. Blood analysis was within normal limits, except for leukocytosis (12.7 × 10 9 /L). Routine urine analysis showed microscopic hematuria without white blood cells or proteins. Abdominal ultrasonography showed an enlarged kidney and a 16-mm hyperechoic focus in the left renal pelvis, suggesting a diagnosis of renal calculus. The patient was therefore administered extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy at the regional hospital. A follow-up ultrasound examination 2 weeks later showed that the shape and size of the hyperechoic focus had not changed.

Due to left lower back pain and the persistent left hyperechoic focus in the renal area, the patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Urine analysis and ultrasound examination showed the same results as in the regional hospital (Fig. 1a). An abdominal plain film showed a left-sided renal calcification (Fig. 2a), but there was no evidence of a palpable tender mass or an audible abdominal bruit. Laboratory data, except for urinalysis results, were within normal limits. Because of the failure of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous lithotomy was recommended.

### Bilateral purely laparoscopic nephrectomy for renal masses using five ports without repositioning: a case report [^4210f92b]. Journal of Endourology (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Bilateral nephrectomy is an infrequently performed procedure. The indications include bilateral masses too large for nephron-sparing surgery, recalcitrant hypertension in dialysis patients, pain, infection, reflux, or large symptomatic polycystic kidneys. Bilateral pretransplant purely laparoscopic nephrectomy for bilateral renal masses has not been reported previously. We present our experience with this procedure using five transabdominal trocars without having to reposition the patient.

Methods

We employed a five-port technique in a middle-aged woman with end-stage renal disease who presented with an infected peritoneal dialysis catheter. On abdominal CT, she had bilateral enhancing renal masses. Six weeks after removal of the catheter, she underwent bilateral transperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy. The technique is described, and recommendations are made regarding potential obstacles.

Results

The procedure was performed in 185 minutes, and the total hospital time was 41 hours. The estimated blood loss was 50 mL. Final pathology examination revealed a 5.5-cm right renal-cell carcinoma stage T1N0M0 and left hydronephrosis, atrophy, nephrosclerosis, and thick-walled renal cysts without malignancy. On 3-month follow-up she is well, without complaints.

Conclusion

Bilateral pretransplant purely laparoscopic nephrectomy can be performed without significant repositioning, redraping, and resterilization. In this case, operative time and cosmesis were acceptable, and surgical morbidity was low.

### Congenital and hereditary cystic diseases of the abdomen [^feb6c70f]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Kidney

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a relatively common disease and occurs in approximately 1/1000 individuals. This hereditary condition is largely inherited in autosomal dominant fashion. Most patients become hemodialysis dependent around the 5th to 7th decade of life.

The cysts appear as typically hypoechoic on the US and hypodense on non-contrast CT images (Fig. 13). MRI findings are typical on advanced-stage disease with a bright T2 signal. Despite the fact that most of the cysts have typical imaging findings, some cysts may demonstrate unusual signal characteristics due to proteinaceous content. MRI studies with subtraction images may be helpful in the mural and cavitary evaluation of these cysts.

Fig. 13
A 63-year-old male patient with known ADPKD. a Axial plane post-contrast CT image shows enlarged kidneys with innumerable cysts (arrows). b More cranial CT image demonstrates multiple hepatic (asterisks) and splenic cysts (arrowheads)

In the early stages of the disease, the kidneys may appear as either normal kidneys to single or multiple cysts in one or both kidneys (Fig. 14). The cysts typically increase in size and number into adulthood and during the final stages of the disease the entire renal parenchyma may be replaced with the cysts. Epidemiological and molecular biological data demonstrate that patients with ADPKD bear an increased risk for renal cell cancer (RCC). But preoperative image-based diagnosis is often challenging because of the distortion of the renal parenchyma. (Fig. 15).

### Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis with polycystic kidney disease as a mimic of cystic renal cell carcinoma: a case report [^27c48792]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is a rare chronic pyelonephritis that often mimics other renal diseases, when combined with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease(ADPKD), preoperative diagnosis is exceedingly difficult. It is important for clinicians to be aware of an XGP with ADPKD since a misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary surgical intervention.

Case Presentation

Here, we report a case of a 66-year-old female with a history of bilateral ADPKD and urinary tract infection admitted to our hospital due to right flank pain, feeble, and low-grade fever. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound revealed a malignant mass of the right kidney suspected to be a cystic renal cell carcinoma with polycystic kidney disease. In addition, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT (18 F FDG PET/CT) showed similar results. Subsequently, the patient underwent a right radical nephrectomy, but histopathological examination revealed XGP with ADPKD. On the follow-up, the patient's symptoms were relieved.

Conclusions

XGP should be kept in mind during the differential diagnosis of renal masses with ADPKD even in the absence of characteristic clinical symptoms and imaging manifestations.

### Diagnosis and management of acute pyelonephritis in adults… [^ad433f6c]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Acute pyelonephritis is an infection of the upper urinary tract, specifically the renal parenchyma and renal pelvis. Acute pyelonephritis is considered uncomplicated if the infection is caused by a typical pathogen in an immunocompetent patient who has normal urinary tract anatomy and renal function. Misdiagnosis can lead to sepsis, renal abscesses, and chronic pyelonephritis that may cause secondary hypertension and renal failure. Risk factors for complicated acute pyelonephritis are those that increase susceptibility or reduce host response to infections. 1, 2. Pathogenesis Most renal parenchymal infections occur secondary to bacterial ascent through the urethra and urinary bladder. In men, prostatitis and prostatic hypertrophy causing urethral obstruction predispose to bacteriuria. 6 Hematogenous acute pyelonephritis occurs most often in debilitated, chronically ill patients and those receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

Metastatic staphylococcal or fungal infections may spread to the kidney from distant foci in the bone or skin. 1, 10 Bacteriuria, which frequently is polymicrobial, develops in more than 50 percent of patients who require catheterization for more than five days, and in virtually all patients who have indwelling urinary catheters for more than one month.

1. In a study 11 of young and middle-aged women presenting to an emergency department with fever, pyuria, and other features of upper UTI, 98 percent had acute pyelonephritis. In the absence of fever, 16 percent were given alternative diagnoses. 11 However, up to one third of elderly patients with acute pyelonephritis have no fever; in 20 percent of elderly patients, the predominant symptoms are gastrointestinal or pulmonary. Up to 30 percent of women presenting with cystitis-like symptoms have upper urinary tract involvement, but these infections rarely cause any cortical damage.

This situation is more common in pregnant women andpatientswithrecurrentUTI, diabetes, immunosuppression, renal tract pathology, or previous UTI occurring before 12 years of age. 2 In the presence of obstruction, acute pyelonephritis can be extremely severe and recalcitrant to treatment, and may progress to renal abscess.

### Unilateral global renal infarction in a patient with ischemic stroke and hypertensive heart disease in a resource limited setting: a case report [^e0390613]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with acute renal infarctions usually present with sudden abdominal or flank pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and sometimes fever. Skin color changes are seen in about one-third of cases. The condition can mimic other disorders, leading to delayed diagnosis. Some patients may be asymptomatic, contributing to underdiagnosis, and may be discovered incidentally during imaging for other reasons, as in this case where the patient was sent to have a contrast-enhanced chest CT scan to rule out acute pulmonary thromboembolism.

Renal thromboembolism should always be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with acute flank or abdominal pain, particularly when accompanied by elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and/or hematuria. Laboratory findings typically reveal elevated LDH levels in nearly all cases, making this a key diagnostic indicator. Urinalysis often demonstrates hematuria (though not universally), while proteinuria is observed in approximately 45% of patients. Although serum creatinine levels usually show a slight increase without being significantly elevated initially, this case was different, marked by a sudden rapid increase in both creatinine and LDH levels, coinciding with the detection of complete renal infarction in previously normal lab results, highlighting the rarity of this occurrence. Imaging plays a crucial role in accurately diagnosing renal infarction, with angiography yielding positive results in all cases and renal isotope exams showing abnormalities in 97% of cases. CT scans are diagnostic in 80% of cases, while ultrasound is positive in only 3% of cases. Contrast-enhanced CT scans are the preferred diagnostic tool, as they reveal wedge-shaped, peripheral, non-enhancing areas, hypoattenuated regions with a mass effect, and occasionally a cortical rim sign, which helps differentiate between ischemia and pyelonephritis. Given the often vague presentation of renal infarction, maintaining a high degree of clinical suspicion is essential for diagnosis.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: kidney cancer, version 2.2024 [^2bb74b10]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Kidney cancer initial evaluation and staging — patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) typically present with a suspicious renal mass seen on imaging, and with widespread imaging use, incidental detection has increased and fewer patients present with the typical triad symptoms (hematuria, flank mass, and flank pain); less frequently, presentations reflect metastatic disease with bone pain, adenopathy, and pulmonary symptoms attributable to lung parenchyma or mediastinal metastases, and other presentations include fever, weight loss, anemia, or a varicocele. RCC in younger patients (≤ 46 years) may indicate an inheritable disorder, and these patients should be referred to a hereditary cancer clinic for further evaluation. A thorough physical examination should be performed along with obtaining a complete medical history; laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the metabolic panel may include serum corrected calcium, serum creatinine, liver function studies, and urinalysis. CT of the abdomen with or without pelvic CT and CT chest (preferred) or chest x-ray are essential studies in the initial workup; abdominal MRI is used to evaluate the inferior vena cava if tumor involvement is suspected, or it can be used instead of CT for detecting renal masses or for staging when contrast material cannot be administered because of allergy or moderate renal insufficiency; all imaging studies should be performed with and without contrast, such as renal protocol.

### Acute lobar nephronia: a case report and literature review [^a75b175c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain commonly present to the emergency department, often generating a broad differential diagnosis. We describe the first reported case in the emergency medicine literature of acute lobar nephronia (ALN).

Objectives

To describe the presentation, evaluation, and management of acute lobar nephronia.

Case Report

A healthy 27-year-old woman presented after 18 h of fever to 39.94°C (103.9°F), nausea, vomiting, and severe right-sided abdominal pain. Despite a normal urinalysis, a contrasted computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated right perinephric stranding, which was initially interpreted as pyelonephritis. A staff over-read the following day by a radiology body specialist confirmed "likely developing abscess", consistent with the diagnosis of acute lobar nephronia.

Conclusion

A normal urinalysis may move clinicians to dismiss a nephrogenic or urologic process. ALN is considered a midpoint in the spectrum of upper urinary tract infections between acute pyelonephritis and intrarenal abscess. Diagnosis may be difficult, and inpatient management, sometimes prolonged, is the norm.

### Letter to the editor: catheter-based renal denervation to treat chronic kidney pain secondary to obstructive renal disease [^5ee1655f]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) has been successfully used for resistant hypertension, and more recently, studies have documented its utility in managing kidney-related pain. We present a case of chronic renal pain secondary to obstructive renal disease managed with catheter-based RDN.

A 28-year-old female presented with chronic bilateral flank pain, more pronounced on the right. The pain, rated 4–5/10, was dull in nature with intermittent sharp episodes, radiated to the anterior abdomen, worsened by urinary tract infections (UTIs), and partially controlled with acetaminophen and oxycodone.

Her medical history included primary hyperparathyroidism secondary to an ectopic parathyroid adenoma, recently resected. Complex urological history included: recurrent renal calculi, hydronephrosis, bilateral vesicoureteral reflux, recurrent UTIs, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, and bilateral infundibular stenosis and progressive renal dysfunction with chronic kidney disease stage 3b. Past procedures include deflux injections, ureteroscopy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy, and infundibular laser treatment. She was an active smoker.

Recent estimated glomerular filtration rates were 38 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (creatine based) and 27 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (cystatin C based). Serum creatinine was 1.85 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen was 17 mg/dL. Post-parathyroidectomy, the serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels normalized.

Despite prior urological interventions, her pain persisted. She was referred for catheter-based RDN after informed consent. Access was gained into the right common femoral artery under ultrasound guidance. A 6F catheter was introduced, and renal angiograms showed single renal arteries bilaterally. An SOS catheter was used to select the left renal artery and was replaced by a 7F Ansel I sheath. A Recor Paradise® catheter of 4.2 mm balloon size was used to treat the artery in two separate locations. Subsequently, the right renal artery was selected and treated with a 3.5-mm balloon size Paradise® catheter at two different locations again. Post-treatment angiograms showed preserved renal perfusion.

### A very complicated UTI: malakoplakia following E. coli urinary tract infection [^5c09b43c]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 32-year-old woman with history of recurrent urinary tract infections, Raynaud's phenomenon, and prior COVID-19 infection presented to the emergency department with lower extremity weakness and 2 days of dyspnea. One week prior, she had experienced symptoms consistent with a UTI but did not pursue testing or treatment. On presentation, she reported nausea, vomiting, fatigue, difficulty walking, and ascending paresthesia in her distal legs. She was afebrile with blood pressure 62/38 mmHg, heart rate 106, and respiratory rate 24. Abdominal examination was notable for hepatomegaly and masses attributed to nephromegaly. A diffuse petechial rash was present, and neurologic exam noted 4/5 strength in the bilateral lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes throughout. Although fully alert and oriented on presentation, she became progressively altered. Labs were notable for leukocytosis (WBC 22.22 K/UL), anemia (Hgb 8.0 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (PLT 18 K/UL), elevated inflammatory markers, and kidney failure (creatinine 6.4 mg/dl) with profound hyponatremia and hypokalemia. Blood and urine cultures grew Escherichia coli.

Computed tomography scan of the abdomen/pelvis with intravenous contrast revealed massive bilateral kidney enlargement without nephrolithiasis, as well as hepatomegaly (Fig. 1). Initial imaging noted concern for renal vein thrombosis, but no thrombus was seen on subsequent duplex ultrasound. MRI brain and lumbar puncture were performed due to altered mental status and were normal. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, her clinical condition rapidly deteriorated, requiring escalating vasopressor support, intubation, and initiation of continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD).

Fig. 1

Given the patient's worsening clinical trajectory and renal function, she underwent percutaneous kidney biopsy. Histopathological analysis demonstrated pyelonephritis with focal micro-abscesses alongside a diffuse histiocytic infiltrate. On light microscopy, only a single ischemic glomerulus was observed, and few tubules were recognizable. Arteries were not identified. Diffusely positive cortical immunohistochemical staining for CD163 confirmed the presence of macrophage/histiocytes, and von Kossa stain was positive in small round formations within the histiocytic infiltrate (Michaelis-Gutman bodies), consistent with a diagnosis of renal malakoplakia (Fig. 2).

### Medical treatment for an isolated renal multilocular hydatid cyst in an elderly: a case report [^04116b4c]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Simple abdominal radiography reveals nonspecific findings which are mostly not useful for establishing the exact diagnosis. Ultrasound performed by an expert radiologist who can detect daughter cysts and other features of hydatid cyst can be useful but in majority of cases, these findings are missed on ultrasonography. CT-scan is the modality of choice for imaging in hydatid cyst which has high diagnostic yield as high as 98% specificity.

In renal hydatid cysts, parenchymal preservation surgeries such as cyst removal or partial nephrectomy are the main treatment options. Nephrectomy is also indicated in cases where the cyst is ruptured into the cavity and is complicated by a kidney infection ultimately leading to sequels in kidney. However renal sparing procedures are the treatment of choice for most cases, As in our patient who refused this procedure. Histopathological examination of the nephrectomy specimens is the method of choice for confirmation of the diagnosis; but our case was diagnosed by a pathological assessment of hydatid cyst and serological assessments.

Ramteke et al. reported a 50-year-old female patient with 6-month history of lower abdominal pain presenting with hematuria. Hematuria as the presenting complaint was the same as our case but the difference is the location of pain. In this case abdominal pain was reported but in our case, flank pain was notable. She had right renal hydatid cyst on imaging which was treated with right nephrectomy and albendazole treatment regimen before and after operation. Kumar et al. reported a 37-year-old female patient with right iliac fossa pain. The patient had a shorter clinical course compared to our patient. A case series of 11 patients with renal hydatid cyst was reported by Zargar et al. Among these patients, only two patients were older than 60 years of age. In addition, majority of cases were males and almost all cases were treated by surgery. The important point in that study is the age and gender distribution of patients. Although our patient was over 70 years of age, it is expected that this disease occurs in earlier stages of life. The superiority of male gender is reported in other studies. For instance, Huang et al. reported that 15 out of 19 patients with renal hydatid cysts were males. It is speculated that this gender distribution can be attributed to higher occupational exposures in males.

A urine culture should be obtained before antibiotics are started for UTI, especially for upper UTI and/or suspected kidney cyst infection. Blood cultures should be obtained if an upper UTI or kidney cyst infection is suspected. UTIs in people with ADPKD need to be differentiated from noninfectious processes such as cyst hemorrhage or kidney stone. People with ADPKD who present with fever, acute abdominal or flank pain, and increased white blood cells and/or C-reactive protein (CRP) should be worked up for kidney cyst infection (Figure 16).

### Unusual familial cystic kidney disease: combining fine radiologic and genetic evaluation to solve the case [^bcf33b73]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

Three patients, namely the proband (II-2), her sister (II-3), and her daughter (III-2), were referred to the Nephrology Department of our university hospital by their shared primary care physician for the management of suspected ADPKD.

Patient II-2 (proband)

In the case of the 42-year-old woman (II-2), abdominal discomfort prompted an abdominal ultrasound (US) that revealed multiple bilateral hypoechoic structures suggestive of ADPKD. The patient had no family history of kidney disorders, prior medical history, or high blood pressure. No proteinuria or hematuria was noted, and her estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was normal (106 ml/min/1.73 m2). Subsequent MRI aimed at renal volumetry displayed standard-sized kidneys (10.7 × 5.7 cm on the right and 11.6 × 6 cm on the left). Our radiology center, genitourinary specialized, later suggested bilateral parapelvic cysts without cortical cysts rather than typical ADPKD features (Fig. 1). Furthermore, there were no liver cysts.

### Early-onset renal cell carcinoma inharmatoma tumour syndrome [^c32f019c]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Prior to her visit, the patient had a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the abdomen at her local hospital due to known vascular malformations and revealed multiple simple cysts within both kidneys but no other pathology. Within 8 months of her initial CTA, the patient experienced painless gross haematuria and a magnetic resonance angiography of the abdomen was performed. This revealed multiple lesions in the kidneys with the largest in the medial aspect of the upper pole of the left kidney measuring 3.2 cm in greatest dimension, suggestive of RCC versus hamartomas. A cystoscopy was performed, and was normal. Within 13 months, a subsequent MRI of the kidneys showed bilateral enhancing renal neoplasms with interval enlargement of the dominant 4.5 cm heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the upper pole of left kidney that demonstrates restricted diffusion, likely papillary subtype RCC (Fig. 2). A left partial nephrectomy was performed and pathology revealed RCC, papillary PHTS-associated type, ISUP grade 3 (see Fig. 3). The tumour extended into the pelvicalyceal system with negative margins of resection. Post-operatively, the patient has been doing well clinically and continues with close monitoring of the other lesions within both kidneys as well as age-appropriate surveillance for the other PHTS-relevant organs.

Renal ultrasound studies showed enlarged kidneys (left kidney: 5.1 cm × 2.8 cm; right kidney: 3.5 cm × 1.5 cm), enhanced echogenicity, and multiple cysts of various sizes (Fig. 2 A-B). Ultrasound showed that the bilateral ureters were not dilated and that the bladder was not filled. Ultrasound showed an enlarged pancreas with uneven parenchymal echogenicity enhancement. The head and tail of the pancreas contained two cysts, the larger located in the head measuring 1.2 cm × 1.5 cm (Fig. 2 C) and the smaller located in the tail measuring 0.6 cm × 0.4 cm (Fig. 2 D). Abdominal ultrasound showed uneven liver echogenicity, no intrahepatic bile duct dilation, and no gallbladder and spleen abnormalities (Fig. 3 D). Echocardiography showed pulmonary hypertension, minor pulmonary valve regurgitation, patent ductus arteriosus, and an inner diameter of pulmonary artery end of 3.9 mm. CDFI showed detectable biphasic bidirectional regurgitation, atrial septal defect (2.2 mm) with patent foramen ovale, mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and reduced left ventricular systolic function (LVEF: 43.5%, LVFS: 19%) (Fig. 3). The cardiac position, myocardial echogenicity, and thickness were normal. The cranial ultrasound was normal. The chest ultrasound showed bilateral pleural effusion (left 1.3 cm, right 0.3 cm). Multiple abdominal X-rays showed little abdominal bowel inflation and an absence of colon inflation (Fig. 4).

### Type 2 calyceal diverticulum with an unusual appearance in the lower pole of the kidney [^6d37c769]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A 45-year-old woman presented to our clinic with intermittent left flank pain. The family physician referred her for renal cystic mass with a calcified appearance. The non-contrast spiral abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan demonstrated the mass-like cystic lesion with a densely calcified lesion in the lower pole of the kidney. A detailed history revealed that she underwent shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) for the lower pole renal stone one year ago. After SWL, the stone fragments migrated to the dependent diverticulum region and produced the misleading appearance of a Bosniak type III lesion. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan was done for further evaluation, and finally, the diagnosis of the calyceal diverticulum was confirmed in the lower pole of the kidney. Calyceal diverticula are the outpouching of the pyelocalyceal system lined by non-secretory transitional epithelium. It is a rare condition that occurs in less than 0.5% of the population. Most patients are asymptomatic and have been discovered incidentally in routine imaging modalities. As most of the patients are asymptomatic, many do not need intervention. However, in some instances, patients present with flank pain, hematuria, urinary tract infection, and stone formation in the diverticulum. They are in the differential diagnosis of renal cystic lesions such as simple renal cyst, renal cortical abscess, and parapelvic cyst. In renal cystic lesion besides of simple renal cyst or renal cystic mass, we should keep the differential diagnosis of the calyceal diverticulum type 2, especially in patients that underwent SWL for renal stones; the fragmented residual stone may have migrated to this dilated region and produce the deceptive appearance of a Bosniak type III lesion.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^85cdd8de]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of APN is still a challenge. At least in settings such as ours in which patients are referred to the Emergency Room after a few days of empirical treatment, the prevalence of incomplete oligosymptomatic presentations is high.

In a context of high prevalence of abscessed lesions (39.5%), severe kidney involvement coexisted with incomplete presentations. None of the clinical or biochemical markers at presentation allowed discrimination between small simple lesions and multifocal or abscessed ones. Hence imaging techniques were needed to assess the severity of kidney involvement and to plan the antibiotic therapy. The relatively high prevalence of kidney scars at presentation (15.1%), mostly with a silent clinical history, draws attention to the difficulty in diagnosing and preventing long-term sequelae of APN.

Therefore, we believe that two recommendations for clinical practice can be drawn from our experience. First, the differential diagnosis of APN should be considered in all patients presenting at least one suggestive clinical feature (fever, flank pain, lower UTI symptoms) accompanied by high inflammatory markers. Second, second-line imaging tests (MRI or CT scans) should be systematically used to define the prevalence and type of parenchymal lesions in order to tailor interventions to the specific clinical contexts.

### A 26-year-old woman with dysuria and hematuria [^718a8fba]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

In this case, we present imaging findings characteristic of chronic genitourinary schistosomiasis. Schistosoma haematobium, a blood fluke endemic to Africa and the Middle East, is a prominent cause of hematuria and bladder cancer in regions lacking adequate water sanitation. Luminal calcifications of the genitourinary tract, that is, of the bladder and/or ureters, from deposition of fluke eggs are a classic sign of chronic S. haematobium infection and should raise suspicion for the disease even when urine or serological tests are negative. It is important to recognize these findings on CT or, in resource-limited settings, plain film to allow for prompt, effective treatment.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD: summary of recommendation statements and clinical approach to the patient [^ff5318cb]. Kidney International (2014). Medium credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) — living donor evaluation emphasizes established imaging criteria and targeted genetic testing. Age-dependent imaging criteria for diagnosis and disease exclusion have been established for at-risk adults with unknown ADPKD gene type (PKD1 or PKD2), and in younger donor candidates the utility of ultrasound is more limited, where an absent or limited number of cysts on CT or MRI can be considered to rule out ADPKD. Up to 15% of patients with suspected ADPKD have a negative comprehensive mutation screen, and the first-degree relative with ADPKD should undergo PKD1 and PKD2 mutation screening (using an acceptable technique) with donor testing for the same pathogenic mutation if identified; however, when the relative's mutation screen is negative, DNA testing is unhelpful in determining whether the donor candidate does or does not have ADPKD. In individuals without family history, a family history is absent in 10–15% of patients with ADPKD, and bilaterally enlarged kidneys with innumerable cysts most likely has ADPKD.

Predicting Renal Outcome in Polycystic Kidney Disease (PROPKD) score — variables, risk categories, and performance: The Predicting Renal Outcome in Polycystic Kidney Disease (PROPKD) score can aid in the identification of people with rapidly progressive disease. Variables and points are: Sex — Female 0, Male 1; Hypertension before age 35 yr — No 0, Yes 2; ≥ 1 urologic event before age 35 yr — No 0, Yes 2; Pathogenic variant — PKD2 0, PKD1 nontruncating 2, PKD1 truncating 4. Risk categories are Low risk: 0–3; intermediate risk: 3–6; high risk: 7–9. A PROPKD score of ≤ 3 points allows for instances of kidney-failure onset before age 60 years to be eliminated, with a negative predictive value of 81.6%, whereas a PROPKD score of > 6 points forecasts kidney-failure onset before age 60 years, with a positive predictive value of 90.9%. This scheme can be useful in identifying people at risk for rapidly progressive disease, and it can be employed when kidney imaging data are not available; however, genotype data are required and categories cannot be assigned reliably for people aged < 35 years if they are not already hypertensive or have not had a urological event. Urological events include gross hematuria or cyst hemorrhages, cyst infections, and flank pain related to cysts.

### Imaging for the prognosis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^cc870233]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by the unrelenting enlargement of innumerable cysts derived from renal tubules. This cystic growth often leads to a grotesque renal enlargement. Relatively early in life, the cysts trigger secondary complications including pain, hypertension and gross hematuria; renal insufficiency is usually not detected until the fifth or sixth decade of life. Therapies targeted to molecular and pathophysiological abnormalities slow cyst growth and protect renal function in animal models of the disease. Unfortunately, the translation of these treatments into clinical trials is hampered since glomerular filtration rate, the usual biomarker of renal disease progression, does not decrease substantially until extensive and irreversible damage to noncystic parenchyma occurs. Ultrasonography, CT and MRI have been used for many years to quantify the increase in renal volume in patients with ADPKD. Imaging with these techniques has also been used to accurately quantify the rate of increased kidney and total cyst volume in patients. In this Review we discuss the overwhelming evidence in support of the view that imaging is an invaluable tool to monitor the onset and progression of ADPKD and is well-suited to gauge the response of this disease to targeted therapy before renal function begins to decline.

### Sonography of macrocysts in infantile polycystic kidney disease [^ee6d5905]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The typical sonographic appearance of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) has been described as symmetrically enlarged, echogenic kidneys with occasional visualization of small cysts. Modern sonographic equipment, however, allows a greater ability to show parenchymal detail, and multiple tiny cysts and occasionally dilated tubular structures have become apparent. In this report, we describe sonographic findings of ARPKD that are quite similar to the macroscopic appearance. Sonographic images show unusual focal rosettes consisting of a cluster of the radially oriented, dilated collecting tubules that are apparent on pathologic evaluation. It is important to recognize the focal rosette as a manifestation of ARPKD.

### Intrinsic acute renal failure… [^ee981fe7]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

In acute renal failure, the glomerular filtration rate decreases over days to weeks. As a result, excretion of nitrogenous waste is reduced, and fluid and electrolyte balances cannot be maintained. Patients with acute renal failure are often asymptomatic, and the condition is diagnosed by observed elevations of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. Most authorities define the condition as an acute increase of the serum creatinine level from baseline. 3 Complete renal shutdown is present when the serum creatinine level rises by at least 0. 5 mg per dL per day and the urine output is less than 400 mL per day. Not all BUN and serum creatinine elevations result from acute renal failure.

Cephalosporins and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may cause acute renal failure as a result of interstitial disease, but these agents sometimes cause elevated serum creatinine levels simply by inhibiting the tubular secretion of creatinine without causing real damage to the kidneys. The BUN can be elevated in patients who are receiving corticosteroids, those with increased catabolism or those with gastrointestinal tract bleeding. Intrinsic Acute Renal Failure Intrinsic acute renal failure is subdivided into four categories: tubular disease, glomerular disease, vascular disease and interstitial disease. In intrinsic acute renal failure, the renal parenchyma is injured. The damage to tubule cells leads to certain urine microscopic findings. Parenchymal injury causes impaired sodium reabsorption and results in a fractional excretion of sodium of greater than 3 percent and an isotonic urine osmolality of 250 to 300 mOsm.

Between 20 and 60 percent of patients require short-term dialysis, particularly when the BUN exceeds 100 mg per dL and the serum creatinine level exceeds the range of 5 to 10 mg per dL. Indications for dialysis include acidosis or electrolyte disturbances that do not respond to pharmacologic therapy, fluid overload that does not respond to diuretics, and uremia. In patients with progressive acute renal failure, urgent consultation with a nephrologist is indicated.

Case presentation

Clinical information

A 64-year-old male presented with left upper quadrant pain of 1 week duration. The pain was worse when standing and relieved on lying down. On physical examination, no palpable abdominal mass was found. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a 6.7 × 4.4 × 3.3 cm, heterogeneously enhancing circular mass in the left retroperitoneum (Fig. 1 A). The enhanced scan showed uneven enhancement. The fat space around the mass was blurred and the left perirenal fascia was thickened. No lesion was seen in either of the kidneys. Moreover, there were no congenital renal abnormalities such as horseshoe kidney or ectopic kidney. The patient has a 2-year history of hypertension with the highest recorded blood pressure of 160/130mmHg and the patient reports taking regular medications. Based on clinical examination and radiological assessment, a clinical diagnosis of ectopic pheochromocytoma was made. Subsequently, tumor resection was performed through transperitoneal approach. After resecting the tumor, the resected specimens were immediately fixed in 10% formalin.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: kidney cancer, version 2.2024 [^16745c18]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 Kidney cancer — diagnostic imaging, biopsy, and genetic evaluation: For a central renal mass suspicious for urothelial carcinoma, urine cytology, ureteroscopy, or percutaneous mass biopsy should be considered. Bone scan is not routinely performed unless there is elevated serum alkaline phosphatase or bone pain, and brain MRI can be obtained when clinical signs or symptoms suggest brain metastases. Because abdominal imaging provides high diagnostic accuracy, a needle biopsy is not always necessary before surgery, but may be considered to establish renal cell carcinoma (RCC) diagnosis and to guide active surveillance; biopsy should be performed prior to or at the time of radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, or radiation therapy, and should also be considered for central lesions or homogeneous renal parenchymal infiltration to rule out urothelial carcinoma or lymphoma. The value of PET remains to be determined, and currently PET or PET/CT is not an imaging tool that is recommended to diagnose kidney cancer or to follow for evidence of relapse after nephrectomy. Patients with multiple renal masses, those ≤ 46 years of age at diagnosis, or those with a family history of RCC should consider genetic evaluation.

### PKD2-related autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: prevalence, clinical presentation, mutation spectrum, and Prognosis [^08096fc6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

PKD2-related autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is widely acknowledged to be of milder severity than PKD1-related disease, but population-based studies depicting the exact burden of the disease are lacking. We aimed to revisit PKD2 prevalence, clinical presentation, mutation spectrum, and prognosis through the Genkyst cohort.

Study Design

Case series, January 2010 to March 2016.

Settings & Participants

Genkyst study participants are individuals older than 18 years from 22 nephrology centers from western France with a diagnosis of ADPKD based on Pei criteria or at least 10 bilateral kidney cysts in the absence of a familial history. Publicly available whole-exome sequencing data from the ExAC database were used to provide an estimate of the genetic prevalence of the disease.

Outcomes

Molecular analysis of PKD1 and PKD2 genes. Renal survival, age- and sex-adjusted estimated glomerular filtration rate.

Results

The Genkyst cohort included 293 patients with PKD2 mutations (203 pedigrees). PKD2 patients with a nephrology follow-up corresponded to 0.63 (95% CI, 0.54–0.72)/10,000 in Brittany, while PKD2 genetic prevalence was calculated at 1.64 (95% CI, 1.10–3.51)/10,000 inhabitants in the European population. Median age at diagnosis was 42 years. Flank pain was reported in 38.9%; macroscopic hematuria, in 31.1%; and cyst infections, in 15.3% of patients. At age 60 years, the cumulative probability of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was 9.8% (95% CI, 5.2%-14.4%), whereas the probability of hypertension was 75.2% (95% CI, 68.5%-81.9%). Although there was no sex influence on renal survival, men had lower kidney function than women. Nontruncating mutations (n = 36) were associated with higher age-adjusted estimated glomerular filtration rates. Among the 18 patients with more severe outcomes (ESRD before age 60), 44% had associated conditions or nephropathies likely to account for the early progression to ESRD.

Limitations

Younger patients and patients presenting with milder forms of PKD2-related disease may not be diagnosed or referred to nephrology centers.

Conclusions

Patients with PKD2-related ADPKD typically present with mild disease. In case of accelerated degradation of kidney function, a concomitant nephropathy should be ruled out.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — imaging and endoscopy: There are currently no specific guidelines for imaging studies for women with rUTI; indications for imaging in women with UTI include persistent symptoms, including persistent fever after 72 hours of appropriate antibiotic therapy, rapid recurrence after appropriate treatment, suspected stone or obstruction, and higher-risk diabetes. Cystourethroscopy should be considered if a woman is at risk for suspected foreign body, although the utility of cystoscopy in evaluation of rUTI has not been well studied; one retrospective study reported that 3.8% of the 163 participants had specific findings on cystoscopy that imaging would not detect. Cystoscopy with cytology should be performed when there is clinical suspicion for premalignancy or malignancy. For suspected stones, assessment can be initiated with plain abdominal radiographs, and when a more complete assessment of the upper tracts is warranted, renal ultrasound or computed tomographic urogram should be used; in general, a computed tomographic urogram, which is with and without intravenous contrast, is the imaging modality of choice in suspected pyelonephritis and renal and perirenal abscess, and it can also identify a possible source of infection such as renal or ureteric stones.

### Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^d8d126f2]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease:

- **Definition**: ADPKD is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys, leading to enlarged kidneys and often resulting in kidney failure.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of ADPKD is primarily linked to mutations in two genes: PKD1 and PKD2. These mutations lead to abnormal polycystin proteins, which are believed to play a role in cell signaling and regulation of cell growth and division.
- **Epidemiology**: The point prevalence of ADPKD in the European Union is estimated at < 5 per 100,000 population, and it is estimated to affect 12 million individuals worldwide.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, ADPKD is characterized by progressive kidney enlargement due to cyst growth. Other common symptoms include abdominal pain, hypertension, and hematuria. As the disease progresses, patients are at an increased risk of renal complications, including CKD and ESRD. It is also associated with extrarenal complications such as liver cysts, intracranial aneurysms, and cardiac valvular disease.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The primary risk factor is a family history of the disease, as it is an inherited disorder.

Physical and laboratory examinations

On admission, the patient was 185 cm tall and weighed 72.4 kg. Blood pressure was 190/100 mmHg. Edema was present in palpebra and in the lower extremities. Laboratory findings were as follows: the erythrocyte count was 3.44 × 10 6 /μL; hemoglobin, 10.9 g/dL; hematocrit, 33.1%; leukocyte count, 7200/μL; platelet count, 268 × 10 3 /μL; total protein concentration, 5.1 g/dL; albumin, 2.2 g/dL; urea nitrogen, 71.0 mg/dL; creatinine, 4.8 mg/dL; and C-reactive protein, 0.1 mg/dL. Urine protein excretion was 17.9 g/day, and urinary sediment contained 11–30 erythrocytes per high-power field. Creatinine clearance was 16 mL/min. Ultrasonography showed multiple cysts up to 2 cm in diameter in both kidneys (Fig. 2 a). According to computed tomography (CT) images the right kidney measured 13 × 7 × 6 cm and the left kidney 13 × 7 × 8 cm (Fig. 2 b). Bilateral renal cysts showed high signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. 2 c).

KDIGO 2025 ADPKD diagnosis and screening — The values and preferences of the person with ADPKD should be central when discussing diagnosis, a multidisciplinary team may be helpful, and counseling should be provided before imaging or genetic screening and again after screening to interpret results and plan next steps; for screening adults at risk of ADPKD, we recommend first using abdominal imaging by ultrasound in the context of the family history, kidney function, and comorbidities (1B), and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) imaging, and/or genetic testing may clarify the diagnosis and further characterize the disease.

KDIGO 2025 ADPKD Practice Point 1.3.7 — people with no known family history and incidentally detected kidney cysts — imaging and follow-up: For people with no known family history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) but with incidentally detected kidney cysts, kidney imaging can help to make a diagnosis. Abdominal imaging should be considered for consenting parents, siblings, and/or adult children; and if a positive family history is found, the scheme as indicated in Figure 1 should be followed. If multiple bilateral cysts are identified with increased kidney volume, with or without liver cysts, and no other disease features are suggestive of a different cause of kidney cysts, the presumptive diagnosis is ADPKD. If only a few incidental cysts are identified without kidney enlargement or liver cysts, no clear cutoff has been established; population data show that in a study of contrast-enhanced CT in 2012 potential kidney donors, 39% in the age range of 19–49 years had at least one cyst of size ≥ 2 mm, increasing to 63% for people 50–75 years, and the 97.5th percentile for number of total cysts ≥ 5 mm was 10 for men and 4 for women aged 60–69 years; the > 97.5th percentile group was made up of those for whom an underlying genetic cause is suspected. Therefore, in people with a limited number of cysts and no increase or a minimal increase in TK, periodic follow-up (every 5 years) is suggested, and if cysts were first detected by ultrasound, follow-up imaging by MRI or CT and/or genetic testing are indicated when findings suggest another form of PKD.

### Forgotten ureteral stents: a systematic review of literature [^25f1240a]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations and diagnostic tests

The mean indwelling time was 33.5 months (range from 3 months to 32 years). A 59-year-old woman suffered from heavily encrusted bilateral stents for 32 years, which was the longest indwelling time in previous literatures. The "32-year-old" stents were inserted for a prophylactic use in a hysterectomy. The distribution of the indwelling time of FUS in 130 case reports is detailed in Table 1. Bilateral FUS and FUS in solitary kidneys are both uncommon (2.4% and 2.5% respectively).

The most common primary presenting complaints of FUS were flank pain (37.3%), lower urinary tract symptoms (33.3%) and hematuria (22.8%), which are so-called stent-related symptoms. Encrustation (80.8%) and UTIs (40.2%) were the most common complications. More details are shown in Table 3.

Table 3
Clinical manifestations of forgotten ureteral stents

*few patients presented with suprapubic pain; passage of small stent fragments from urine;

eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; LUTS, lower urinary tract symptoms; sCr, serum creatinine; UTI, urinary tract infection

KUB (kidney-ureter-bladder) radiography (96.8%), non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) (76.1%) and KUB ultrasonography (45.2%) were commonly used for imaging evaluation. Elevated serum creatinine was detected in 24.8% of patients, and the rate increased to 62.5% in patients with bilateral FUS. Renal scintigraphy was preferred in 35.5% of cases to quantitatively estimate the split renal function of affected kidneys.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, more specifically with respect to evaluation for renovascular and renal parenchymal disease, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining renal ultrasound and Doppler in patients with HTN and CKD to assess kidney structure, determine causes of CKD, and exclude renoparenchymal and renovascular HTN. Consider obtaining CT or magnetic resonance renal angiography as alternative options.

### A rare cause of echogenic kidneys with oligohydramnios in the fetus: report of two different cases [^67104d2b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Case 1

A 43-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1 (with a healthy 20-year-old daughter), who had underlying essential hypertension, presented with her second episode of antepartum hemorrhage. Family history was unremarkable. Due to an unintended pregnancy, she initiated antenatal care at 25 weeks of gestation at a local primary care unit. Initial antenatal laboratory investigations and management of her hypertension were unremarkable. An ultrasound was performed at 28 weeks and 2 days gestational age due to the antepartum hemorrhage, revealing placenta previa bleeding in the presence of a single viable fetus with appropriate weight for gestational age but also showing signs of oligohydramnios. Following a course of corticosteroids and resolution of vaginal bleeding, she was discharged without immediate fetal concerns. However, ten days later, she returned to the labor room with painless vaginal bleeding. A subsequent ultrasound at 29 weeks and 6 days gestational age showed a viable fetus with an estimated weight of 1,808 g but with anhydramnios and bilateral enlarged hyperechogenic kidneys, the USclip_case1 in supplementary files. The fetal kidneys exhibited abnormal dimensions, with the right kidney measuring 65.4 mm in length (97th centile = 47.7 mm), 36.0 mm in transverse diameter (97th centile = 28.2 mm), and 51.5 mm in antero-posterior diameter (97th centile = 29.2 mm), while the left kidney measured 61.4 mm, 29.9 mm, and 49.8 mm, respectively, showing loss of corticomedullary differentiation (Fig. 1). Color Doppler ultrasound identified a diminutive fetal urinary bladder at the abdominal umbilical cord insertion site. Given the concerning findings and the suspected diagnosis of ARPKD, the patient and her family were counseled about the perinatal poor prognosis. Despite ongoing bleeding from placenta previa, a female neonate was delivered via cesarean section with a birth weight of 1,800 g. The neonate had APGAR scores of 4 and 2 at 1 and 5 min, respectively, and unfortunately passed away 20 min after neonatal resuscitation. A necropsy was conducted, and examination of kidney sections revealed dilatation of Bowman's capsule, leading to the formation of glomerular cysts primarily in the subcapsular cortex (Fig. 2). These findings were indicative of GCKD, characterized by cyst formation within the glomeruli without significant tubular dilatation or fibrosis in the surrounding stroma. Suspecting cystic kidney disease, genetic testing was initiated. The karyotype analysis revealed 46, XX. Subsequently, singleton whole exome sequencing (WES) with copy number variations (CNVs) analysis was performed using the Illumina HiSeq sequencing system, as detailed in the supplementary material_bioinformatic analysis, to identify potential genetic mutations associated with the condition. Moreover, targeted analysis of 6 genes related to glomerulocystic kidney disease, including PKHD1, PKD2, HNF1B, TSC1, TSC2, and NPHP did not reveal pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants. Unfortunately, the WES and targeted analysis results yielded negative findings, indicating that this specific genetic cause of glomerulocystic kidney disease remained elusive.
