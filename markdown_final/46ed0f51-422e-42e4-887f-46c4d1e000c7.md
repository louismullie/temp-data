## Question

1.6 cm gallastone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage a 1.6 cm gallstone and what the size means for risk and treatment decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the stone is symptomatic or asymptomatic. Then, I should verify the clinical significance of a 1.6 cm size compared with smaller stones. Next, I will review guideline-based management for asymptomatic versus symptomatic disease. After that, I need to check for special high-risk scenarios where prophylactic cholecystectomy is reasonable. Finally, I will consider diagnostic confirmation, timing of surgery if indicated, and a practical decision framework with shared decision-making and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because management hinges on symptoms and complications rather than size alone. I should confirm whether there is biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, or gallstone pancreatitis, and I should remember that ultrasound is the first-line imaging to characterize stones and gallbladder pathology when biliary disease is suspected [^1115ZyaN] [^115XDdSy].

> Now, about the size of 1.6 cm, I initially thought "this is a large stone", but wait, let me verify what "large" really means in the literature. Stones around 2–3 cm or larger are consistently associated with higher risk, including gallbladder cancer, whereas 1.6 cm sits in a moderate-size range that does not, by itself, mandate intervention in the absence of symptoms or other risk factors, so I should not overcall risk based solely on a 1.6 cm dimension [^116G1VMV].

> If the patient is asymptomatic, I should confirm that expectant management is appropriate. Both EASL and AAFP recommend observation for asymptomatic gallstones, with an annual risk of developing symptoms around 2–4% and a low risk of complications, so routine prophylactic cholecystectomy is not advised solely for a 1.6 cm stone without other indications [^113gkusG] [^1118opvp] [^113NB7Ht].

> Hold on, I should verify exceptions where prophylactic cholecystectomy is reasonable even without symptoms. These include hemolytic disorders such as sickle cell disease or hereditary spherocytosis (especially at splenectomy), planned organ transplantation, porcelain gallbladder, and selected bariatric scenarios with altered anatomy where future ERCP is difficult, so I need to check for these high-risk contexts before concluding on observation alone [^114t3SMm] [^113G4q68] [^113CcsCs] [^114KgY87].

> If the patient is symptomatic with classic biliary colic or has documented complications, I should confirm that cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard approach and resolves biliary colic in the vast majority, with early surgery favored when feasible to reduce recurrence and complications, though I should also discuss that conservative management can be a reasonable short-term alternative in carefully selected patients with shared decision-making [^1113ZqqS] [^1111CP8n] [^114fxQys] [^1179BbM5].

> I need to ensure I address bile duct stone risk and preoperative evaluation. For patients with symptomatic gallstones, the prevalence of choledocholithiasis is about 10–20%, so I should stratify risk using clinical predictors and labs, and if intermediate risk is present, consider MRCP or EUS to avoid unnecessary ERCP, reserving ERCP for high-risk features such as cholangitis, obstructive jaundice, or a stone in the duct on imaging [^1178tsxF] [^111iiPZD].

> Next, I should review timing nuances. For mild gallstone pancreatitis, same-admission cholecystectomy reduces recurrence and readmissions, whereas severe pancreatitis warrants delay, and for acute cholecystitis, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is preferred when surgically appropriate, with day-surgery discharge feasible in selected patients without systemic disease [^112RfRRj] [^113GfcMy] [^116V8hwp].

> Let me consider medical options briefly. NSAIDs are first-line for biliary colic pain control, and bile acid litholysis is not recommended for gallbladder stones, so I should avoid suggesting dissolution therapy for a 1.6 cm stone in the gallbladder, reserving UDCA for prevention in select high-risk contexts like rapid weight loss rather than treatment of established stones [^111kF8FT] [^112iyB7e] [^112BakY7].

> I should double-check the diagnostic pathway. If biliary symptoms are present, start with right upper quadrant ultrasound to confirm gallstones and assess gallbladder wall, duct diameter, and peri-cholecystic changes, and if symptoms persist after cholecystectomy or choledocholithiasis remains a concern, MRCP or EUS can clarify ductal pathology when transabdominal ultrasound is non-diagnostic [^115XDdSy] [^116xTYPa].

> Putting this together for a 1.6 cm gallstone, my decision framework is as follows: if asymptomatic, recommend observation with counseling on warning signs and a low threshold to re-evaluate if symptoms arise. If symptomatic or high-risk features exist, offer laparoscopic cholecystectomy with preoperative risk stratification for ductal stones and shared decision-making about timing and alternatives. Throughout, I should verify that size alone does not dictate therapy and that patient values, comorbidities, and anatomy guide the plan [^1118opvp] [^1113ZqqS] [^111iiPZD].

A 1.6 cm gallstone is a **moderately sized stone** that can cause biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, or pancreatitis if it obstructs the cystic or bile duct [^112n3CtX]. Management depends on symptoms and risk: **asymptomatic stones are observed** with ultrasound monitoring, while **symptomatic or complicated cases require laparoscopic cholecystectomy** [^1118opvp] [^1111CP8n]. ERCP is reserved for retained or impacted ductal stones, and medical dissolution is not recommended for stones this size [^1178tsxF] [^112iyB7e]. Prognosis is excellent with timely surgery; delayed treatment increases risks of recurrence and complications [^113hxXo2].

---

## Clinical significance of a 1.6 cm gallstone

A 1.6 cm gallstone is **moderately sized** and can cause significant clinical consequences:

- **Biliary colic**: Intermittent cystic duct obstruction causing episodic RUQ/epigastric pain [^112ZUeFZ].

- **Acute cholecystitis**: Persistent cystic duct obstruction with inflammation/infection [^notfound].

- **Choledocholithiasis**: Migration into the common bile duct, risking obstruction, cholangitis, and pancreatitis [^111NjSa1].

- **Pancreatitis**: Particularly gallstone pancreatitis, a leading cause of acute pancreatitis [^114TTh3j].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Ultrasound is the **first-line modality** for detecting and sizing gallstones and assessing complications [^1115ZyaN] [^115XDdSy]. Use MRCP or EUS when ductal stones are suspected or ultrasound is inconclusive [^111iiPZD].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on **symptoms, complications, and patient factors**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Asymptomatic | Observation with periodic ultrasound; no routine surgery [^113gkusG] [^1118opvp] |
| Symptomatic (biliary colic) | Laparoscopic cholecystectomy; early surgery reduces recurrence [^1113ZqqS] [^114fxQys] |
| Acute cholecystitis | Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 7 days [^113GfcMy] |
| Choledocholithiasis | Preoperative or postoperative ERCP, or intraoperative cholangiography with laparoscopic CBD exploration [^111iiPZD] [^1171QpkN] |
| Gallstone pancreatitis | Same-admission cholecystectomy after stabilization [^113iKkiK] [^112RfRRj] |

---

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the **standard surgical approach**, with low morbidity and rapid recovery [^1111CP8n] [^111DzNJ7]. ERCP is used for retained or impacted ductal stones, and medical dissolution is not recommended for stones of this size [^1178tsxF].

---

## Potential complications

A 1.6 cm gallstone can cause **significant complications** if untreated:

- **Acute cholecystitis**: 10–15% of gallstone patients [^113GfcMy].

- **Choledocholithiasis**: 10–20% of symptomatic patients [^1178tsxF].

- **Gallstone pancreatitis**: Leading cause of acute pancreatitis [^114TTh3j].

- **Cholangitis**: Life-threatening biliary infection [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **excellent with timely cholecystectomy**; recurrence and complications are common without surgery [^113hxXo2]. Conservative management may be effective short term but has higher recurrence and complication rates than surgery [^1179BbM5] [^114RF6Bn].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies focus on **risk reduction**:

- **Diet**: Low-fat, high-fiber diet; maintain healthy weight [^111yg1G2].

- **Weight loss**: Gradual weight loss to avoid rapid cholesterol mobilization [^notfound].

- **UDCA**: Consider in high-risk patients (e.g. rapid weight loss, somatostatin therapy) [^112BakY7] [^1142pjxT].

---

A 1.6 cm gallstone is **clinically significant** and can cause obstruction and complications. Management is symptom-driven: observe if asymptomatic, and perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy if symptomatic or complicated. Prognosis is excellent with timely surgery; delayed treatment increases recurrence and complications [^1111CP8n].

### National adherence to the ASGE-SAGES guidelines for managing suspected choledocholithiasis: an EAST multicenter study [^115HeZy2]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons provide guidelines for managing suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones. We sought to evaluate adherence to the guidelines among patients with choledocholithiasis and/or acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP) and to evaluate the ability of these guidelines to predict choledocholithiasis.

Methods

We prospectively identified patients undergoing same-admission cholecystectomy for choledocholithiasis and/or ABP from 2016 to 2019 at 12 United States medical centers. Predictors of suspected CBD stones were very strong (CBD stone on ultrasound; bilirubin > 4 mg/dL), strong (CBD > 6 mm; bilirubin ≥ 1.8 to ≤ 4 mg/dL), or moderate (abnormal liver function tests other than bilirubin; age > 55 years; ABP). Patients were grouped by probability of CBD stones: high (any very strong or both strong predictors), low (no predictors), or intermediate (any other predictor combination). The management of each probability group was compared with the recommended management in the guidelines.

Results

The cohort was comprised of 844 patients. High-probability patients had 64.3% (n = 238/370) deviation from guidelines, intermediate-probability patients had 29% (n = 132/455) deviation, and low-probability patients had 78.9% (n = 15/19) deviation. Acute biliary pancreatitis increased the odds of deviation for the high- (odds ratio [OR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06–2.8; p = 0.03) and intermediate-probability groups (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.07–2.42; p = 0.02). Age older than 55 years (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.4–3.43; p < 0.001) also increased the odds of deviation for the intermediate group. A CBD greater than 6 mm predicted choledocholithiasis in the high (adjusted OR (aOR), 2.16; 95% CI, 1.17–3.97; p = 0.01) and intermediate group (aOR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.59–4.86; p < 0.001). Any very strong predictor (aOR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.76–3.37; p < 0.0001) and both strong predictors predicted choledocholithiasis (aOR, 2; 95% CI, 1.35–2.96; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Almost 45% of patients with suspected CBD stones were managed discordantly from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons guidelines. We believe these guidelines warrant revision to better reflect the ability of the clinical variables at predicting choledocholithiasis.

Role of ERCP in gallstone pancreatitis — Most patients with gallstone pancreatitis will not benefit from ERCP, including early ERCP. In a multicenter trial of early ERCP, early (within 24 hours) ERCP was not found to decrease complications, including mortality, and urgent ERCP was indicated only for cholangitis or progressive cholestasis defined by a rise in bilirubin in the setting of severe or moderately severe AP (bilirubin > 3–5 mg/dL).

Section 6. Alternative treatment for patients with ACC who are not suitable for surgery: observation and techniques for gallbladder drainage

When should Non-Operative Management be considered for patients with ACC?

6.1 We suggest considering NOM, i.e. best medical therapy with antibiotics and observation, for patients refusing surgery or those who are not suitable for surgery. #QoE: low; SoR: weak#

6.2 We suggest considering alternative treatment options for patients who fail NOM and who still refuse surgery or patients who are not suitable for surgery. #QoE: low; SoR: weak#

Schimdt et al. published an RCT comparing observation and surgery in cases of ACC, with a long median follow-up time of 14 years. In their analysis, about 30% of patients with mildly symptomatic acute cholecystitis who did not undergo cholecystectomy developed recurrent gallstone-related complications, as compared with 3% of patients who underwent cholecystectomy, but these differences were not significant for recurrent disease or complications. Overall, 60% of patients had undergone surgery, while 40% avoided surgery. There are significant limitations in the study, as recognized by the authors: firstly, a relevant percentage of eligible patients (41%) were excluded from randomization; secondly, the reasons for the exclusion were not stated in the paper; thirdly, the definitions of dropout and failure within the observation group were not clear. Brazzelli et al. published a systematic review of two RCTs comparing observation with surgery in patients with symptomatic gallstone disease (in the first study) and patients with ACC (in the second study). From a total of 201 patients, the results confirmed the high rate of gallstone-related complications within the observation group (RR 6.63, 95% CI 1.57–28.51, p = 0.01). The authors, although noting the substantial lack of good quality evidence, reported that a policy of surgery for all patients with ACC, when compared to a policy of observation followed by surgery for symptomatic patients, represents a costly but more effective choice. In conclusion, relevant uncertainty exists regarding the best management between surgery or observation in cases of ACC, especially in uncomplicated disease; observation and best medical therapy are likely to be safe, but this latter approach is characterised by a high incidence of recurrent disease.

### Guidelines on the management of common bile duct stones (CBDS) [^115NsHVC]. Gut (2008). Low credibility.

The last 30 years have seen major developments in the management of gallstone-related disease, which in the United States alone costs over 6 billion dollars per annum to treat. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has become a widely available and routine procedure, whilst open cholecystectomy has largely been replaced by a laparoscopic approach, which may or may not include laparoscopic exploration of the common bile duct (LCBDE). In addition, new imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance cholangiography (MR) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) offer the opportunity to accurately visualise the biliary system without instrumentation of the ducts. As a consequence clinicians are now faced with a number of potentially valid options for managing patients with suspected CBDS. It is with this in mind that the following guidelines have been written.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115kJknF]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

In this systematic review, we have identified 6 diagnostic guidelines predicting CBDS in patients with acute biliary presentation. Of these, there is sufficient data in the literature for the meta‐analysis of the original ASGE guidelines in 2010, the revised ASGE guidelines in 2019, and the ESGE guidelines. All three guidelines stratify patients into high, intermediate, or low risk categories for CBDS, and are similar in their management recommendations.

When the guidelines are used to distinguish patients at low risk for CBDS from those at greater than low risk, both iterations of ASGE guidelines have excellent pooled sensitivities of 95%–97% for CBDS, while that of the ESGE guidelines is lower at 84%. The observed difference may reflect the inclusion of patients older than 55 as intermediate risk in both ASGE but not the ESGE guidelines, even though age was found to be a nonspecific and minimally predictive criterion in a meta‐analysis of predictor performance by Wang et al. These high sensitivities can be utilized to advantage clinically, because a low‐risk classification can reliably rule out most CBDS and allow low‐risk individuals to proceed to cholecystectomy without additional investigations. At this diagnostic threshold, all guidelines have poor specificities for CBDS from 7% to 15% only, resulting in many patients classified as at least intermediate risk thus prompting for additional investigations.

ASGE guideline — Strength of recommendation (GRADE) is labeled as either strong or conditional, with standard wording and practical implications by audience. The recommendations are labeled as either "strong" or "conditional" according to the GRADE approach, and the words "the guideline panel recommend" are used for strong recommendations and "suggest" for conditional recommendations. For patients: Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not for strong recommendations, whereas most individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not for conditional recommendations. For clinicians: Most individuals should receive the intervention and formal decision aids are not likely to be needed for strong recommendations, whereas for conditional recommendations different choices will be appropriate for individual patients, clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences, and decision aids may be useful. For policymakers: The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations and adherence could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator for strong recommendations, whereas conditional recommendations mean policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^112RfRRj]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

Mild gallstone pancreatitis — same admission cholecystectomy is recommended for patients with mild gallstone pancreatitis, with supporting evidence that in a small (n = 50) randomized trial early < 48 hours cholecystectomy among patients with mild acute gallstone pancreatitis (Ranson's score < 3) shortened mean hospitalization by 2 days compared with later cholecystectomy during the initial admission; a literature review from 1992 to 2010 reported 948 patients, including 483 who underwent same admission cholecystectomy and 515 managed with interval cholecystectomy a median of 40 days (IQR, 19–58) after discharge, with among the latter group 95 patients (18%) readmitted before cholecystectomy — 43(8%) for recurrent pancreatitis, 35(7%) for biliary colic, and 17(3%) for acute cholecystitis — and there were no differences in adverse events or conversion to open procedure among those who underwent index hospitalization or interval cholecystectomy; additionally, in the PONCHO trial 266 patients from 23 Dutch centers with mild gallstone pancreatitis were randomized to same admission versus interval cholecystectomy, with the primary outcome defined as gallstone-related adverse events including cholangitis, biliary obstruction, recurrent pancreatitis, biliary colic, or mortality.

### Management of gallstone pancreatitis: a review [^114TTh3j]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Gallstone pancreatitis (GSP) is the leading cause of acute pancreatitis, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. Without appropriate and timely treatment, patients are at increased risk of disease progression and recurrence. While there is increasing consensus among guidelines for the management of mild GSP, adherence to these guidelines remains poor. In addition, there is minimal evidence to guide clinicians in the treatment of moderately severe and severe pancreatitis.

Observations

The management of GSP continues to evolve and is dependent on severity of acute pancreatitis and concomitant biliary diagnoses. Across the spectrum of severity, there is evidence that goal-directed, moderate fluid resuscitation decreases the risk of fluid overload and mortality compared with aggressive resuscitation. Patients with isolated, mild GSP should undergo same-admission cholecystectomy; early cholecystectomy within 48 hours of admission has been supported by several randomized clinical trials. Cholecystectomy should be delayed for patients with severe disease; for severe and moderately severe disease, the optimal timing remains unclear. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is only useful for patients with suspected cholangitis or biliary obstruction, although the concomitance of these conditions in patients with GSP is rare. Modality of evaluation of the common bile duct to rule out concomitant choledocholithiasis varies and should be tailored to level of concern based on objective measures, such as laboratory results and imaging findings. Among these modalities, intraoperative cholangiography is associated with reduced length of stay and decreased use of ERCP. However, the benefit of routine intraoperative cholangiography remains in question.

Conclusions and Relevance

Treatment of GSP is dependent on disease severity, which can be difficult to assess. A comprehensive review of clinically relevant evidence and recommendations on GSP severity grading, fluid resuscitation, timing of cholecystectomy, need for ERCP, and evaluation and management of persistent choledocholithiasis can help guide clinicians in diagnosis and management.

### Implementation of a specialist-led service for the management of acute gallstone disease [^116dn5eX]. The British Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The 'gold standard' treatment for acute cholecystitis and biliary colic requiring hospital admission is urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This is not routinely available in all hospitals.

Methods

A retrospective audit of emergency admissions with acute cholecystitis or biliary colic from January to December 2000 led to the development and implementation of a specialist-led protocol for the urgent management of acute gallstone disease. A second audit was carried out covering the 6 months after implementation.

Results

One hundred and fifty-eight patients were admitted with acute cholecystitis or biliary colic in the first audit period and 110 in the second interval. The rate of cholecystectomy at index admission increased from 37.3 to 67.3 per cent, at a median of 3 days after admission, and the conversion rate to open surgery fell from 32 to 12 per cent. Median hospital stay fell from 9 to 5.5 days, and the unplanned readmission rate decreased from 19.0 to 3.6 per cent.

Conclusion

Urgent cholecystectomy for the management of acute gallstone disease is feasible and achievable in an acute services hospital with a specialist upper gastrointestinal team. It can lead to a reduced conversion rate, shorter hospital stay, fewer unplanned readmissions, an acceptable operating time and a low complication rate. The protocol is recommended for implementation in other hospitals.

Introduction — epidemiology and pathophysiology of gallstones are summarized, stating that "Bile duct stones (choledocholithiasis) most frequently result from the migration of gallstones from the gallbladder into the biliary tree" and that "Gallstones are the consequence of cholesterol supersaturation in bile, inadequate bile salt levels or function, and diminished contractility of the biliary epithelium because of the multifactorial effects of diet, hormones, and genetic predisposition". The introduction adds that "Prospective population data reveal that 10% of American adults will develop symptomatic gallstones over the course of a decade", and that "Greater than 700,000 will undergo outpatient cholecystectomy".

### Management of gallstones [^113qrVME]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients with gallstones can be managed expectantly. Generally, only persons with symptoms related to the presence of gallstones (e.g., steady, nonparoxysmal pain lasting four to six hours located in the upper abdomen) or complications (such as acute cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis) warrant surgical intervention. Biliary pain is alleviated by cholecystectomy in the majority of cases. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the most cost-effective management strategy in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. Medical management strategies are mostly palliative and are not widely supported. Patients with longer-lasting biliary pain, in combination with abdominal tenderness, fever, and/or leukocytosis, require an ultrasound evaluation to help establish a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Once a patient is diagnosed, having cholecystectomy early in the course of the disease can significantly reduce the hospital stay.

Gallbladder polyps — prevalence and management guidance: Gallbladder polyps (GBPs) are detected in 4% to 7% of healthy subjects, and most GBPs are not neoplastic. Symptomatic GBPs should be removed via cholecystectomy, but there are no standard guidelines on the management of asymptomatic GBPs. Traditionally, cholecystectomy for polyps larger than 10 mm has been recommended, and asymptomatic patients at risk of gallbladder (GB) cancer (60 years of age and older, coexistence of gallstones, sessile morphology) with GBPs 6 mm or larger may benefit from cholecystectomy, but stronger evidence is required before this can be advocated. GBPs 6 mm or larger that are not removed should be followed by serial examinations, for example, every 12 months. In patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), it has been proposed that GBPs of any size should prompt cholecystectomy.

Recommendations

KQ1. Should routine IOC or alternative options be used for patients with gastrointestinal bypass-type anatomy (RYGB and DS, etc.) undergoing cholecystectomy?

The panel suggests routine intraoperative imaging of the biliary anatomy in patients with bypass-type anatomy undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (expert opinion recommendation due to low-quality of evidence).

Introduction

Patients who have undergone metabolic and bariatric surgery are at increased risk of developing symptomatic gallstone disease. Bypass-type operations alter the anatomy in a way that typically precludes standard endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) as a viable treatment option. Such patients may require operative bile duct exploration, laparoscopic-assisted ERCP, or an Endoscopic Ultrasound Directed transGastric ERCP (EDGE). Because of the difficulties this situation poses, the panel sought to investigate whether IOC should be performed routinely when completing a cholecystectomy in a patient with bypass-type anatomy.

Summary of the evidence

Both elective and urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomies were included in this question. The literature search for this question revealed only single arm data. The panel deemed this insufficient for an evidence-based recommendation given the lack of direct, comparative data.

Gallstones are a major risk factor for gallbladder cancer, but few persons with stones experience development of tumors. To examine this relationship, a case-control study was performed. Each of 81 cancer cases was matched for age, sex, hospital, and admission date with two controls, one with benign gallbladder disease and one with a nongallbladder diagnosis. Persons with large gallstones were found to be at increased risk for cancer. For those with stone diameters of 2. 0 to
2. 9 cm, the odds ratio was 2. 4; for stones 3 cm or larger, the ratio was 10.

Table 1
Guidelines and criteria for uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis

This variation in criteria for surgery was one of the reasons for initiating the SECURE trial, which tested one set of symptom criteria. The study randomized patients with gallstones and abdominal pain between usual care (diagnostics and treatment based on hospital standard care) and a restrictive strategy. In the restrictive arm of the study, cholecystectomy was advised only for patients who had all five prespecified symptoms based on the Rome III criteria and on predictors identified during a previous clinical study: severe pain in attacks, pain in the upper right quadrant or epigastrium, pain lasting 15–30 min or longer, pain radiating to the back, and positive response to simple analgesics. The primary aim of the SECURE trial was to assess the percentage of patients who were pain-free after 1 year of follow-up. The trial demonstrated a 7 per cent higher cholecystectomy rate in the usual-care arm (75 per cent of 537 patients) compared with the restrictive arm (68 per cent of 530 patients) (P = 0.005). Despite more cholecystectomies, the usual-care strategy resulted in more patients who were pain-free after 12 months of follow-up (60 versus 56 per cent respectively; P = 0.316). Rates of gallstone-related complications were similar in the two groups: 8 per cent in the usual-care and 7 per cent in the restrictive arm (P = 0.155). The SECURE trialalso illustrated the limited validity of Rome III criteria regarding the indication for cholecystectomy in patients with cholecystolithiasis; 35 per cent of patients with typical biliary colic (by Rome definition) reported persistent gastrointestinal symptoms after surgery.

Conclusion

In the short term (< 18 months), conservative management, as an alternative to surgery, may be effective and cost effective for patients with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease.

We conclude that the costs and benefits will continue to be incurred in both groups beyond 24 months, so future research should focus on long term follow-up data to establish lifetime cost effectiveness and aid identification of the cohort of patients who will benefit from surgery.

Results

We retrieved a total of 6494 studies through our initial and updated search, out of which 40 studies were included for systematic review, as shown in the PRISMA flow diagram (figure 1). We had excluded one study from the meta-analysis since no information on complications was reported. Therefore, 39 studies with 4483 patients with gallstone disease (intervention — EC, n = 2265 and comparator (CM/DC), n = 2218) were included in meta-analysis. Characteristics of included studies are provided in online supplemental table 4.

Patient's mean age was 53.47 years and 54.41 years in intervention and comparators, respectively. Sample sizes in individual studies ranged from 15 to 314 patients. In total, 6, 3 and 31 studies that compared EC versus OM, EC versus EMand EC versus DC, respectively, were analysed. Among the 32 studies, which reported gender proportions, 26 studies (81.25%) had a higher proportion of female participants. Only 9 out of 40 included studies for systematic review were multicentric RCTs, and the rest were conducted in single centres. The baseline gallstone complications reported were acute cholecystitis, CBD stones, gallstone pancreatitis and uncomplicated gallstones in 20, 12, 7 and 1 study, respectively. Out of the 40 studies included in systematic review, open cholecystectomy was reported among 9 studies and cholecystectomy was performed laparoscopically among the rest. Duration of symptoms was reported only in seven studies, in which duration varied from 35.1 to 96 hours. In all the included EC versus DC studies, EC was performed within 7 days of randomisation and DC was performed after 6 weeks of randomisation.

Risk of bias assessment

Out of 40 studies included in systematic review, 31 (77.5%) studies adequately followed the randomisation process. None of the included studies reported that patients and caregivers were blinded for the intervention under study, which might be due to the involvement of surgical intervention. Nine (22.5%) studies had shown deviations from the intended intervention. There were seven (17.5%) studies under the missing outcome data domain, one study (2.5%) in each domain for measurement of outcome data and selection of the reported results were assessed as high risk of bias. The overall risk of bias was estimated as low in 22 (55.0%), some concerns in 6 (15.0%) and high in 12 (30.0%) studies (online supplemental figure 1).

### Systematic review of the clinical and cost effectiveness of cholecystectomy versus observation / conservative management for uncomplicated symptomatic gallstones or cholecystitis [^114RF6Bn]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Gallstone disease is a common gastrointestinal disorder in industrialised countries. Although symptoms can be severe, some people can be symptom free for many years after the original attack. Surgery is the current treatment of choice, but evidence suggests that observation is also feasible and safe. We reviewed the evidence on cholecystectomy versus observation for uncomplicated symptomatic gallstones and conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis.

Methods

We searched six electronic databases (last search April 2014). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non-randomised comparative studies where adults received either cholecystectomy or observation/conservative management for the first episode of symptomatic gallstone disease (biliary pain or cholecystitis) being considered for surgery in secondary care. Meta-analysis was used to combine results. A de novo Markov model was developed to assess the cost effectiveness of the interventions.

Results

Two RCTs (201 participants) were included. Eighty-eight percent of people randomised to surgery and 45% of people randomised to observation underwent cholecystectomy during the 14-year follow-up period. Participants randomised to observation were significantly more likely to experience gallstone-related complications (RR = 6.69, 95% CI = 1.57–28.51, p = 0.01), in particular acute cholecystitis (RR = 9.55, 95% CI = 1.25–73.27, p = 0.03), and less likely to undergo surgery (RR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.34–0.73, p = 0.0004) or experience surgery-related complications (RR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.16–0.81, p = 0.01) than those randomised to surgery. Fifty-five percent of people randomised to observation did not require surgery, and 12% of people randomised to cholecystectomy did not undergo surgery. On average, surgery costs £1,236 more per patient than conservative management, but was more effective.

Conclusions

Cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment for symptomatic gallstones. However, approximately half the observation group did not require surgery or suffer complications indicating that it may be a valid alternative to surgery. A multicentre trial is needed to establish the effects, safety and cost effectiveness of observation/conservative management relative to cholecystectomy.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of gallstone disease treatment outcomes in early cholecystectomy versus conservative management / delayed cholecystectomy [^113hxXo2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Cholelithiasis/gallstone disease management imposes a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide, costing about 6.5 billion dollars/year only in the USA itself. The prevalence of gallstones ranges from 0.1% to 50.5% worldwide. Although gallstone disease is usually asymptomatic, certain risk factors drive the progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic illness, with or without complications, making it imperative to treat. Gallstone-related complications include common bile duct stones (CBD stones)/choledocholithiasis, acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, gallstone pancreatitis and others. Surgical removal of the gallbladder (known as cholecystectomy) is the treatment of choice for symptomatic gallstones. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment option over open cholecystectomy for gallstones and cholecystitis. However, approximately 12% of patients who have undergone cholecystectomy continue to experience pain and recurrent gallstone-related symptoms.

Conservative management (CM), involving pain and symptomatic treatment with gallbladder in situ, carries no risk of operative complications and is also considered an alternative to cholecystectomy. However, among conservatively managed patients with uncomplicated gallstones, recurrence of gallstone symptoms and subsequent development of gallstone-related complications often lead to cholecystectomy. Similarly, several randomised control trials (RCTs) comparing early versus delayed cholecystectomy (DC) for gallstone disease reported recurrence of symptoms/complications in the waiting period before surgery and also reported higher postsurgical complications with delayed surgery. Thus, the effectiveness of early cholecystectomy (EC) over CM/DC is ambiguous. Therefore, we aimed to conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesise treatment outcomes between EC and CM/DC. The study's objective is to synthesise treatment outcomes such as (1) gallstone-related complications between EC and CM/DC (2) surgical complications, length of hospital stays and operative time between early and DC.

### Consequences of the spilled gallstones during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a systematic review [^113rDXRJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since 1992, laparoscopic cholecystectomy accepted as a treatment of choice for symptomatic cholelithiasis by consensus statement from the National Institute of health conference. It has been reported that the incidence rate of perforation of gallbladder during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) ranges from 6 to 40%. The incidence rate of spillage of gallstones secondary to perforation reported 16%. In addition, 16 to 50% of spilled stones remained un-retrieved. They may migrate in different regions and the reported complication rate varies from 0.08 to 0.3%. However, most recent evidence reported that the incidence rate of complications of spilled gallstones may ranges from 0.04 to 19%. The management of the spilled gallstones varies widely. Notably, studies which analyse complications of the LCs did not mention perforation of the gallbladder and spillage of stones as complication. In addition, a study from the UK reported that only one fifth of the surgeons document spillage of the gallstones as a potential complication in the consent form. Moreover, only half of them in case of spillage and un-retrieved stones inform the patient. They are reluctant to do that because this may lead to unnecessary stress and repeated examinations for presumed complications of low risk. However, most recent evidence demonstrated that gallbladder perforation and spillage of stones may lead to complications of severe morbidity. In particular, acute cases, older age, male sex, number of spilled stones more than 15 with diameter > 1.5 cm, pigment stones and perihepatic localisation are predicting factors for developing severe complications.

Because of lack of consensus recommendations and guidelines the management of spilled gallstones vary widely between institutions and individual surgeons. Therefore, the need for further evaluation of the accumulated evidence is needed urgently.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the evidence of the complications rate of the spilled gallstones overtime by conducting a systematic review.

### Consequences of the spilled gallstones during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a systematic review [^1139n6vo]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Although, it is reported that the number of spilled gallstones more than 15, size > 1.5 cm and pigment type gallstones are predicting factors of complications of spilled gallstones; in the present study, type of lost gallstones, number, and size of discovered gallstones during the re-intervention reported at 17(20%), 17(20%), and 12(14,11%), respectively. In particular, pigmented and cholesterol gallstones consisted 41% and 47%, respectively. Therefore, future studies should be more meticulous regarding describing type, size, and number of discovered gallstones because the accumulated information will further help describing in details the predicting risk factors and furthermore, this will help in the standardisation of the management of spilled gallstones.

The median time to onset of symptoms was 36 months and ranged from 1 to 180 months. It is obvious that was ranged widely. Considering the above finding and the widely ranged follow-up, the results of the incidence rates of complications should be treated cautiously because time, follow-up, and institutions bias might have influenced the results.

Notably, vast majority of the cases of undiscovered gallstones required open intervention. In particular, 61(72%) patients underwent open surgery and 13(15%) patient laparoscopic procedure, 9(11%) treated either with US and/or CT scan guided drainage. Two cases that detected early postoperatively and were asymptomatic scheduled for regular follow-ups. These finding underlines that although the incidence rate of the complications is low when they become symptomatic the treatment of choice is surgical intervention Therefore, there is urgent need for standardisation and clinical guidelines for the management of spilled gallstones.

Limitations

The results of the present study should be treated cautiously because all the included studies were case reports. Therefore, institutional, national, underpowered sample size, learning curve, performance and follow-up bias might have influenced the results. Another topic that needs special attention is the incidence rate. Usually, the cases with most complicated presentation and with worst outcomes published as case reports. On the contrary cases with mild symptoms and better outcomes, usually are not publishable. Therefore, an international registry and audit may help to define precisely the incidence rate, and severity of complications of spilled gallstones.

### Surgical and nonsurgical management of gallstones [^112n3CtX]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis, or gallstones, is one of the most common and costly of all the gastrointestinal diseases. The incidence of gallstones increases with age. At-risk populations include persons with diabetes mellitus, persons who are obese, women, rapid weight cyclers, and patients on hormone therapy or taking oral contraceptives. Most patients are asymptomatic; gallstones are discovered incidentally during ultrasonography or other imaging of the abdomen. Asymptomatic patients have a low annual rate of developing symptoms (about 2% per year). Once symptoms appear, the usual presentation of uncomplicated gallstones is biliary colic, caused by the intermittent obstruction of the cystic duct by a stone. The pain is characteristically steady, is usually moderate to severe in intensity, is located in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant of the abdomen, lasts one to five hours, and gradually subsides. If pain persists with the onset of fever or high white blood cell count, it should raise suspicion for complications such as acute cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis, and ascending cholangitis. Ultrasonography is the best initial imaging study for most patients, although additional imaging studies may be indicated. The management of acute biliary colic mainly involves pain control with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or narcotic pain relievers. Oral dissolution therapy is usually minimally successful and used only if the patient cannot undergo surgery. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the surgical choice for symptomatic and complicated gallstones, with a shorter hospital stay and shorter convalescence period than open cholecystectomy. Percutaneous cholecystostomy is an alternative for patients who are critically ill with gallbladder empyema and sepsis.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^1144c8H9]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

There is a lack of consensus in selecting patients who do or do not benefit from surgery when patients present with abdominal pain and gallbladder stones are present. This review aimed to give an overview of results from recent trials and available literature to improve treatment decisions in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis.

Methods

First, an overview of different symptom criteria for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis is given, based on national and international guidelines. Second, treatment outcomes (absence of biliary colic, pain-free state, biliary and surgical complications) are summarized, with data from three clinical trials. Finally, personal advice for treatment decisions in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis is provided, based on recent trials, the available literature, and expert opinion.

Results

This review describes different guidelines and criteria sets for uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis, provides an overview of outcomes after cholecystectomy, and advises on treatment decisions in patients with abdominal pain and gallbladder stones. After cholecystectomy, biliary colic is resolved in 95 per cent of patients. However, non-specific abdominal pain persists in 40 per cent. Irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia significantly increase the risk of persistent pain. Age, previous abdominal surgery, baseline pain score on a visual analogue scale, pain characteristics, nausea, and heartburn are part of the SUCCESS criteria, and are associated with clinically relevant pain reduction after gallbladder removal.

Conclusion

The surgical community can now give more personalized advice on surgery to improve care for patients with abdominal pain and uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^113GfcMy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The estimated overall prevalence of gallstones is 10–15% in the general population, with some differences across countries. Between 20 and 40% of patients with gallstones will develop gallstone-related complications, with an incidence of 1–3% annually; acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC) is the first clinical presentation in 10–15% of the cases. Cholecystectomy is the most common therapeutic approach for ACC and is considered the standard of care for gallstone disease for the majority of patients. However, considering the heterogeneity of clinical scenarios, the variability in hospital facilities and in the availability of expertise, the management of patients with right upper quadrant abdominal pain may vary.

In 2016, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) published the first edition of their guidelines for ACC, which presented different diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms, compared with the Tokyo Guidelines (TG), known at that time as Tokyo Guidelines 2013 (TG13). In particular, the direct link between diagnostic criteria for ACC, severity classification and therapeutic indications described in the TG13 are limited by lack of quality evidence. The approach of the WSES guidelines was to simplify the initial management of patients presenting with suspected ACC. The literature review, the discussion of the relevant evidence and the statements made during the consensus conference (CC) held in Jerusalem in 2015 (Third WSES International Congress) supported surgery as the gold standard treatment for all patients with ACC, with two exceptions: patients who refuse surgery, and patients for whom surgery would be considered as 'very high risk', although no clear consensus was reached on this second issue. Moreover, the 2016 WSES Guidelines on ACC included discussions on unclear areas, such as diagnosis, evaluation of the surgical risk and appropriate management of associated common bile duct stones (CBDS).

BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

A sample size of 194 in each group was needed to detect a mean difference in area under the curve of 0.33 standard deviations derived from the SF-36 bodily pain domain with 90% power and a 5% (two sided α) significance level. As observed in other clinical studies, a difference of 0.33 standard deviations in generic health status is considered clinically relevant in terms of treatment effect size in the small to medium ranges. To allow for 10% of participants with data completely missing, with no area under the curve calculable, we needed 430 participants.

The analysis followed a prespecified statistical analysis plan (see supplementary appendix 1). Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle, with participants analysed as randomised irrespective of crossover. We analysed the primary outcome using a mixed effects regression model, with fixed effects for the minimisation covariates and a random effect for the centre. The area under the curve for each participant was generated by the trapezium rule for those with at least one time point up to 30 months post-randomisation. We imputed missing data at 18 months with multiple imputation using Rubin's rule under a missing at random assumption. A sensitivity analysis was performed including all participants who had at least one time point up to 18 months, with multiple imputation being used for missing data at 18 months. A complete case analysis of the primary outcome was also performed for participants with a score at 18 months, and those without such a score were excluded. The area under the curve is interpreted as bodily pain over 18 months. The results of the condition specific questionnaire, SF-36 (excluding bodily pain), and persistent symptoms were analysed using a repeated measures mixed effects regression model correcting for baseline score, fixed effects for the minimisation covariates, and a random effect for centre. We measured outcomes at 3, 9, 12, and 18 months, and treatment effects were estimated from time-by-treatment interactions at each time point. Missing baseline data were imputed using the centre specific mean of that variable. We analysed complications and need for further treatment using a Poisson model adjusted for minimisation covariates sex (male, female) and age (< 35, 35–64, ≥ 65 years) and including a random effect for the centre using robust error variance. Planned subgroup analyses explored the potential treatment effect modification of sex (male, female), age (< 35, 35–64, ≥ 65 years), and ethnicity (white versus other, owing to limited data on categories) on the primary outcome using a stricter level of significance (two sided 1% significance level). To assess the effect of compliance on the primary outcome, we used a two stage least squares regression model adjusted for minimisation covariates as fixed effects and adjusted for centre using cluster robust variance. Adherence was defined as participants who received their allocated treatment within 24 months. For the cholecystectomy group, participants who received emergency cholecystectomy were defined as non-adherent. We did not measure adherence with the standard NHS advice on a healthy diet for gallstone disease provided to participants. Continuous variables were summarised using mean (standard deviation), or median and interquartile range, whereas discrete variables were reported as absolute number and percentage in each category. To assess the impact of covid-19, we undertook a sensitivity analysis on the primary outcome for the subset of data pre-covid-19 (data not shown) using the same analysis as described above. Analyses were carried out using Stata statistical software, release 16.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^116yRz7a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons combined the published validated clinical scores and proposed a risk stratification of CBDS in three different classes, defined as follows: low risk (< 10%), moderate risk (10 to 50%) and high risk (> 50%) of CBDS (see Table 2). This proposed classification has clear clinical implications: patients with a low risk of CBDS should be operated on without further investigation; patients with moderate risk should be evaluated with a second-level examination, either preoperatively with endoscopic US (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or intraoperatively with laparoscopic US (LUS) or IOC, in order to select patients who need stone removal; finally, according to local expertise, laparoscopic transcystic CBD exploration is a valuable option. Patients with high risk of CBDS should undergo preoperative diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP. See Fig. 1 for the flowchart of management of ACC.

Table 2
Risk factors and classification of risk for CBDS (modified from Maple et al. 2010)

What is the best tool to stratify the risk for CBDS in patients with ACC?

2.5 We suggest stratifying the risk of CBDS according to the proposed classification modified from the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeon Guidelines. #QoE: very low; SoR: weak#

ASGE guidelines remains a valuable tool for the diagnosis and the management of CBDS in patients with ACC. According to their classification, high-risk patients have a probability of having CBDS exceeding 50%, which in turn means that up to 49% of patients undergoing ERCP will not have evidence of CBDS and, given the potential complications of ERCP, this may not be considered acceptable. For this reason, we would recommend more cautious approach: only patients with evidence of CBDS at abdominal US should be considered at high risk of CBDS and should undergo diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP directly; patients with total serum bilirubin > 4 mg/dl or enlarged common bile duct diameter at US with concomitant bilirubin level 1.8 to 4 mg/dl should be considered as moderate risk and should undergo second level investigation such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) or IOC, in order to avoid the complications related to ERCP. See Table 2 for the modified risk stratification.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113NB7Ht]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Gallstone disease (cholelithiasis) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders worldwide, with clinical surveys suggesting prevalence rates of 6% to 25% and a tendency to increase with age. Gallstones are more common in women. A clinical ultrasound survey in the UK reported prevalence rates of 12% and 22% among men and women older than 60 years, respectively.

In the UK and North America, the number of surgical procedures for gallstone disease increased steadily between the 1950s and 1990s, reflecting the rise in prevalence and prompt identification of gallstone disease and the use of cholecystectomy as the treatment of choice. Rates of surgical procedures stabilised in these countries towards the end of the 20th century. In England, about 61 000 episodes cost the NHS > £200m in 2018/19.

The natural course of gallstones is benign; most people remain asymptomatic and show a relatively low progression to symptomatic disease. A systematic review published in 2007 reported the range for disease progression as 10% to 25% in studies that followed-up patients after initial diagnosis (≤ 15 years of follow-up). The annual risk of developing symptoms has been estimated at 2–4%.

Most people with symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease do not develop complications; reported annual rates of developing complications (eg, acute cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis, acute cholangitis obstructive jaundice) have been as low as 1–3%. The Italian Group for the Epidemiology and Prevention of Cholelithiasis study reported an annual incidence for complications of 0.7% in patients with symptoms.

Mortality from gallstone disease is rare — typically less than 1% from gallstone related causes.

### Core outcome set for symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease [^114e6DNR]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gallstone disease (cholelithiasis) is one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases worldwide, with a prevalence of approximately 10–15 per cent in adult populations, but more common in women and people aged over 40 years. For the majority (around 80 per cent), gallstones are asymptomatic, but 20 per cent of people experience pain and develop gallstone-related complications. These patients are currently offered symptom control and/or surgical intervention. A significant number of these patients (up to 40 per cent) remain symptomatic after intervention. Conducting large, well designed, RCTs comparing surgery with non-surgical comparators, which measure and report outcomes that matter to all stakeholders, is of importance in this setting.

A recent in-depth analysisof outcomes that had been reported or were considered relevant to symptomatic gallstone disease highlighted the significant variability between studies. In addition, outcome mapping also included empirical research that identified new, unreported in this context, outcomes of importance. This heterogeneity, and absence of outcomes deemed important to patients (and other stakeholders), brings into question the adequacy of existing evidence. Standardizing outcomes through the development and implementation of core outcome sets (COSs) offers a potential solution to this heterogeneity problem and ensures that the right outcomes are being measured and reported. COSs aim to define a minimum set of outcomes that should be considered essential for the evaluation and reporting of specific interventions or conditions.

This study aimed to develop a COS for uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease effectiveness trials, which recommends what outcomes should be measured and reported as a minimum, reflecting the interests of relevant stakeholders to facilitate decision-making.

### Updated guideline on the management of common bile duct stones (CBDS) [^1178tsxF]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Common bile duct stones (CBDS) are estimated to be present in 10–20% of individuals with symptomatic gallstones. They can result in a number of health problems, including pain, jaundice, infection and acute pancreatitis. A variety of imaging modalities can be employed to identify the condition, while management of confirmed cases of CBDS may involve endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, surgery and radiological methods of stone extraction. Clinicians are therefore confronted with a number of potentially valid options to diagnose and treat individuals with suspected CBDS. The British Society of Gastroenterology first published a guideline on the management of CBDS in 2008. Since then a number of developments in management have occurred along with further systematic reviews of the available evidence. The following recommendations reflect these changes and provide updated guidance to healthcare professionals who are involved in the care of adult patients with suspected or proven CBDS. It is not a protocol and the recommendations contained within should not replace individual clinical judgement.

BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

The results of the C-GALL trial add to existing evidence. Two small Norwegian randomised controlled trials with a total of 201 participants found that 55% of people randomised to observation did not require an operation during the 14 year follow-up period, and 12% of people randomised to cholecystectomy did not undergo the scheduled procedure. This contrasts with 70% randomised to conservative management not undergoing surgery at 24 months in the current trial and 30% in the surgery group not undergoing cholecystectomy.

The SECURE (restrictive strategy versus usual care for cholecystectomy in patients with gallstones and abdominal pain) trialwas a non-inferiority multicentre randomised controlled trial in the Netherlands to assess the effects of immediate cholecystectomy versus a restrictive strategy. Participants underwent cholecystectomy only when they fulfilled five prespecified surgery criteria at clinic visits. The authors reported that 7.7% fewer patients had cholecystectomies with the restrictive strategy, but 37% in both groups continued with abdominal pain. The investigators concluded that the current surgical management of patients with gallstone disease and abdominal symptoms is suboptimal, that a restrictive policy is not a solution, and that doctors need to be more careful in advising a surgical approach to patients with symptoms of gallstone disease. The findings of the C-GALL trial are consistent with the conclusions of the SECURE trial and provide stronger evidence from a broader range of patients, as the current trial enrolled participants with biliary colic or acute cholecystitis (SECURE only focused on biliary colic).

Policy implications

Current clinical guidelines recommend laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary pain or acute cholecystitis and radiological evidence of gallstones. Hence, laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the first line treatment for people with symptomatic gallstone disease and is one of the most common elective surgical procedures performed in the NHS. The C-GALL trial found that in adults presenting with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease to secondary care, conservative management may be effective and cost effective than surgery. The study found it is safe to manage patients conservatively for at least 18 months. The crossover between groups suggested that it remains key to identifying patients who require surgery. As healthcare professionals often underestimate surgical risks, and post-cholecystectomy syndrome may occur, a discussion about conservative management should form part of a patient's decision making and consent process.

### Modified dietary fat intake for treatment of gallstone disease in people of any age [^113CSoxa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of gallstones varies between less than 1% and 64% in different populations and is thought to be increasing in response to changes in nutritional intake and increasing obesity. Some people with gallstones have no symptoms but approximately 2% to 4% develop them each year, predominantly including severe abdominal pain. People who experience symptoms have a greater risk of developing complications. The main treatment for symptomatic gallstones is cholecystectomy. Traditionally, a low-fat diet has also been advised to manage gallstone symptoms, but there is uncertainty over the evidence to support this.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of modified dietary fat intake in the treatment of gallstone disease in people of any age.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE ALL Ovid, Embase Ovid, and three other databases to 17 February 2023 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with gallstones. We also searched online trial registries and pharmaceutical company sources, for ongoing or unpublished trials to March 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in people with gallstones diagnosed using ultrasonography or conclusive imaging methods. We excluded participants diagnosed with another condition that may compromise dietary fat tolerance. We excluded trials where data from participants with gallstones were not reported separately from data from participants who did not have gallstones. We included trials that investigated other interventions (e.g. trials of drugs or other dietary (non-fat) components) providing that the trial groups had received the same proportion of drug or other dietary (non-fat) components in the intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

We intended to undertake meta-analysis and present the findings according to Cochrane recommendations. However, as we identified only five trials, with data unsuitable and insufficient for analyses, we described the data narratively.

Main Results

We included five trials but only one randomised clinical trial (69 adults), published in 1986, reported outcomes of interest to the review. The trial had four dietary intervention groups, three of which were relevant to this review. We assessed the trial at high risk of bias. The dietary fat modifications included a modified cholesterol intake and medium-chain triglyceride supplementation. The control treatment was a standard diet. The trial did not report on any of the primary outcomes in this review (i.e. all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life). The trial reported on gallstone dissolution, one of our secondary outcomes. We were unable to apply the GRADE approach to determine certainty of evidence because the included trial did not provide data that could be used to generate an estimate of the effect on this or any other outcome. The trial expressed its finding as "no significant effect of a low-cholesterol diet in the presence of ursodeoxycholic acid on gallstone dissolution". There were no serious adverse events reported. The included trial reported that they received no funding that could bias the trial results through conflicts of interest. We found no ongoing trials.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence about the effects of modifying dietary fat on gallstone disease versus standard diet is scant. We lack results from high-quality randomised clinical trials which investigate the effects of modification of dietary fat and other nutrient intakes with adequate follow-up. There is a need for well-designed trials that should include important clinical outcomes such as mortality, quality of life, impact on dissolution of gallstones, hospital admissions, surgical intervention, and adverse events.

### Gallstone pancreatitis: a review [^114wzfdN]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Gallstone disease is the most common cause of acute pancreatitis in the Western world. In most cases, gallstone pancreatitis is a mild and self-limiting disease, and patients may proceed without complications to cholecystectomy to prevent future recurrence. Severe disease occurs in about 20% of cases and is associated with significant mortality; meticulous management is critical. A thorough understanding of the disease process, diagnosis, severity stratification, and principles of management is essential to the appropriate care of patients presenting with this disease. This article reviews these topics with a focus on surgical management, including appropriate timing and choice of interventions.

Gallstone-related disease can have significant associated morbidity and mortality worldwide. The incidence of gallstone-related disease in the Western world is on the increase. There are multiple different pathological manifestations of gallstone disease: the presentation, diagnosis and associated complications of which vary significantly depending on anatomical location. The role of imaging in gallstone-related disease is broad with radiology playing an essential role in the diagnosis, management and follow-up of gallstone-related pathologies. This paper distills the broad range of gallstone-related pathologies into an anatomical map, discussing the disease processes involved at each point along the biliary tree and reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of different imaging modalities for each distinct disease process.

Abstract

Choledocholithiasis is a common presentation of symptomatic cholelithiasis encountered by the acute care surgeon. There is a wide spectrum of variation in management of this disease due to evolutions in laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques. Intricacies in management are related to the timing of diagnosis as well as locally available imaging modalities, surgical expertise, and ancillary advanced endoscopy and interventional radiological support. While individual patient demographics and institutional characteristics will determine management of choledocholithiasis, it is incumbent for the treating surgeon to be well versed in all manners of therapy currently available. The objective of this review is to provide an evidence-based summary of the contemporary management of choledocholithiasis.
