## Question

Hearing an echo

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "hearing an echo", including what it means, how to distinguish normal from pathological echo perception, what conditions it suggests, and how to evaluate and manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic definitions and the precedence effect in normal hearing. Then, I should verify red flags that make echo perception abnormal. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis, including conductive, sensorineural, and central causes. After that, I need to outline a practical, stepwise evaluation. Finally, I will synthesize management principles and when to refer, making sure I anchor each step to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate concepts. "Hearing an echo" in everyday usage can mean either a normal perceptual phenomenon from environmental reflections or a pathological perception of reverberation or delayed sound that is not explained by the acoustic environment, which in audiology and otolaryngology often reflects abnormal auditory processing or disease states rather than simple room acoustics [^notfound].

> I will now examine the normal precedence effect, because I need to ensure I'm not overcalling pathology when the brain is simply doing its job. The precedence effect allows the auditory system to localize the direct sound source and suppress perception of reflections, so under normal conditions people do not perceive a distinct echo when delays are within roughly 1–50 ms; this is well characterized in animal models and informs human spatial hearing principles, though direct human neurophysiology is less definitive in the provided corpus [^e289325d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. When patients report "hearing an echo", I should verify whether the environment plausibly explains it and whether the perception persists in anechoic or controlled settings; persistent echo perception in quiet or with headphones suggests a pathological process rather than normal precedence suppression, and that distinction is foundational to next steps [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis, and I need to be systematic. Conductive causes like middle ear effusion or otitis media with effusion can alter timing and resonance, producing reverberant or echo-like perceptions; persistent OME warrants age-appropriate hearing testing and follow-up per guidelines, and tympanometry can support the diagnosis when pneumatic otoscopy is equivocal [^3b32a74b] [^6d9ad8c9]. Sensorineural etiologies include sudden sensorineural hearing loss, which can present with distorted or echo-like percepts and requires urgent audiometry and consideration of retrocochlear workup; tinnitus and hyperacusis can also color sound quality and may coexist with echo phenomena, so I should screen for these explicitly [^1a875918] [^28610f09] [^3efc4764]. But wait, what if the problem is central? Central auditory processing disorder and higher-order auditory pathway disease can impair echo suppression and temporal processing, and schizophrenia has been associated with impaired binaural temporal processing and reduced ability to suppress echoes in precedence tasks, so I should keep neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental contributors in mind when the peripheral workup is unrevealing [^93dc4334] [^affa7df9].

> I should double-check the key history elements that separate benign from worrisome echo perception. I need to ask about laterality, onset and tempo, associated symptoms such as tinnitus, vertigo, fullness, otalgia, and neurologic signs, as well as medication exposures including ototoxins and recent infections; unilateral symptoms, sudden onset, or focal neurologic findings push me toward urgent evaluation for SSNHL or retrocochlear disease, whereas bilateral, chronic, context-dependent echo perception may reflect conductive disease or central processing differences [^1a875918] [^28610f09].

> Let me think about the physical exam and bedside tests. I should perform otoscopy for effusion, retraction, or structural disease, and consider tympanometry when middle ear pathology is suspected; pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry together improve diagnostic confidence for OME, which can explain echo-like percepts via altered middle ear mechanics [^notfound]. I should also perform a focused neurologic exam if central causes are suspected, and I must remember that pulsatile tinnitus or objective bruits warrant vascular evaluation rather than attributing symptoms to "echo" phenomena [^188fc4af].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup and make sure I sequence it correctly. For suspected OME, age-appropriate audiometry is indicated if effusion persists for three months or if the child is at risk; for suspected SSNHL, obtain audiometry as soon as possible, ideally within 14 days, and if sensorineural loss is confirmed, evaluate for retrocochlear pathology with MRI or ABR as indicated; for nonurgent, chronic echo perception without red flags, routine audiometry and targeted imaging based on findings are reasonable [^3b32a74b] [^1a875918] [^28610f09]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not over-ordering imaging; routine head CT is not recommended in presumed SSNHL, and MRI is preferred when retrocochlear evaluation is needed, which aligns with best practice [^1a875918] [^28610f09].

> I will now examine management principles, and I need to ensure they map to the underlying cause. For OME, observe with reassessment if no risk factors are present, and consider tympanostomy if effusion persists and hearing loss is significant or symptoms are impactful; for SSNHL, offer systemic corticosteroids within two weeks when appropriate, consider intratympanic steroids for salvage, and arrange follow-up audiometry; for tinnitus with hearing loss, discuss hearing aids and assistive technologies, as they can improve both hearing and tinnitus burden; for suspected CAPD or neuropsychiatric contributors, refer for specialized testing and rehabilitation strategies rather than attempting purely medical fixes [^6d9ad8c9] [^1a875918] [^28610f09] [^7f8d17df] [^15639862] [^93dc4334]. Wait, let me verify the tinnitus guidance strength; both AAO-HNSF and VA/DoD suggest hearing aids for tinnitus with hearing loss, acknowledging low-to-moderate certainty but a preponderance of benefit, which supports offering amplification when appropriate [^7f8d17df] [^15639862].

> I should confirm follow-up cadence and safety netting. For SSNHL, repeat audiometry at the conclusion of treatment and again within 6 months is recommended; for chronic echo perception without a clear diagnosis, periodic reassessment of hearing and symptoms is prudent, with escalation if new red flags emerge such as asymmetry, progression, or neurologic signs; shared decision-making is essential, especially when evidence is limited or interventions carry costs and uncertainties [^1a875918] [^28610f09] [^4bbb8fdd].

> Let me reconsider the core message so I don't overgeneralize. "Hearing an echo" is not a diagnosis but a symptom that requires context-aware differentiation between normal precedence suppression in reflective environments and pathological echo perception from conductive, sensorineural, or central causes; a focused history, exam, and guideline-concordant testing usually reveal the etiology and guide effective management, with timely action critical when SSNHL is suspected [^1a875918] [^28610f09].

Hearing an echo is most often due to **environmental acoustics** (large rooms, hard surfaces) or **hearing loss** (conductive or sensorineural) that delays or distorts sound perception [^7ba73c91]. Less commonly, it reflects **auditory processing disorders** or **psychiatric conditions** such as schizophrenia or depression, where the brain misinterprets or adds perceptual content [^affa7df9] [^60bedf69]. Persistent or bothersome echo perception warrants **audiologic evaluation** (audiometry, tympanometry, and speech testing) [^39860d4c] and, if indicated, **neurologic or psychiatric assessment** [^notfound]. Management targets the cause: treat hearing loss, use hearing aids or assistive devices, and consider therapy or medication for psychiatric contributors [^7f8d17df] [^15639862].

---

## Physiological and environmental causes

### Environmental acoustics

Environmental acoustics commonly cause echo perception in **large, reverberant spaces** with hard surfaces (e.g. cathedrals, gymnasiums, empty rooms) where sound reflects and arrives at the ear milliseconds after the direct signal, producing a distinct echo [^notfound]. The **precedence effect** normally suppresses perception of these reflections, but in highly reverberant settings or with hearing loss, echoes may still be perceived [^e289325d].

---

### Hearing loss and auditory system disorders

- **Conductive hearing loss**: Middle ear pathology (otitis media, otosclerosis, cerumen impaction) can delay sound conduction, creating an echo-like sensation.

- **Sensorineural hearing loss**: Cochlear or retrocochlear lesions (presbycusis, noise-induced loss, acoustic neuroma) can distort temporal processing, causing echoes or reverberation [^notfound].

- **Auditory processing disorders**: Central auditory processing deficits impair the ability to integrate rapid or complex signals, leading to echo perception [^notfound].

---

## Neurological and psychiatric causes

### Neurological conditions

- **Multiple sclerosis**: Demyelination affecting auditory pathways can cause echo perception.

- **Stroke**: Lesions involving auditory cortex or temporal lobes may produce echo-like phenomena.

- **Seizure disorders**: Temporal lobe seizures can include auditory hallucinations or echo perceptions.

---

### Psychiatric conditions

- **Schizophrenia**: Auditory hallucinations, including echo-like voices, are common.

- **Depression**: Altered auditory processing and attentional biases can contribute to echo perception [^notfound].

- **Anxiety disorders**: Hyperarousal and hypervigilance can amplify perceptual anomalies, including echoes.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Audiological assessment

- **Pure-tone audiometry**: Quantifies hearing thresholds and detects conductive vs sensorineural loss [^notfound].

- **Tympanometry**: Assesses middle ear function and conductive pathology [^notfound].

- **Speech audiometry**: Evaluates speech recognition and temporal processing.

- **Otoacoustic emissions**: Detects cochlear dysfunction, even with normal audiometry [^0491e6dc].

---

### Neurological and psychiatric evaluation

Neurological evaluation includes a **focused neurologic exam** and, if indicated, MRI or CT to identify structural lesions, and EEG if seizure activity is suspected. Psychiatric evaluation uses clinical interviews and standardized scales (e.g. PANSS, HAM-D) to assess for primary psychiatric disorders [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Environmental modifications

Environmental modifications include **acoustic treatment** — adding carpets, curtains, or wall panels to reduce reverberation — and **assistive listening devices** such as FM systems or directional microphones to improve signal-to-noise ratio.

---

### Medical and surgical interventions

Medical and surgical interventions include treating **conductive pathology** (e.g. tympanoplasty, myringotomy, cerumen removal) and managing **sensorineural loss** with hearing aids or cochlear implants as appropriate [^df401a29]. Pharmacotherapy may be used for underlying psychiatric or neurologic conditions (e.g. antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants).

---

### Auditory rehabilitation and therapy

Auditory rehabilitation and therapy include **auditory training** to improve temporal processing and reduce echo perception, and **counseling and education** to explain the phenomenon and teach coping strategies [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Hearing an echo can arise from environmental acoustics, hearing loss, auditory processing disorders, or psychiatric and neurologic conditions. Persistent or distressing echo perception should be evaluated with **audiologic testing** and, when indicated, neurologic or psychiatric assessment. Management is cause-specific, ranging from environmental changes and hearing rehabilitation to medical or psychiatric treatment.

### Spatial hearing in echoic environments: the role of the envelope in owls [^e289325d]. Neuron (2010). Low credibility.

In the precedence effect, sounds emanating directly from the source are localized preferentially over their reflections. Although most studies have focused on the delay between the onset of a sound and its echo, humans still experience the precedence effect when this onset delay is removed. We tested in barn owls the hypothesis that an ongoing delay, equivalent to the onset delay, is discernible from the envelope features of amplitude-modulated stimuli and may be sufficient to evoke this effect. With sound pairs having only envelope cues, owls localized direct sounds preferentially, and neurons in their auditory space-maps discharged more vigorously to them, but only if the sounds were amplitude modulated. Under conditions that yielded the precedence effect, acoustical features known to evoke neuronal discharges were more abundant in the envelopes of the direct sounds than of the echoes, suggesting that specialized neural mechanisms for echo suppression were unnecessary.

Recommended echo exam quality review statements — report phrasing is provided to document overall echo image quality, acoustic window interpretability, and diagnostic adequacy. Use categorical wording for overall quality ("excellent/good/fair/poor/non-diagnostic"), and when quality is limited state "The echo study quality was suboptimal (fair, poor or non-diagnostic)" with optional explanations such as "Large body habitus, pulmonary disease, small rib spaces, breast implants, difficulty in positioning, mechanical ventilation". For acoustic windows, document either "All acoustic windows were present and interpretable" or specify "The following windows were not present and/or not interpretable: Parasternal, apical, subcostal, suprasternal notch". Include a diagnostic adequacy line ("Diagnostic Adequacy (excellent/good/inadequate, in respective of overall image quality)") and note that "Inadequate diagnostic value should be addressed in the summary".

### Interpretation of ultrasound [^c4779bb1]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

This content is designed to acquaint the clinician with some of the more common ultrasonographic manifestations of clinical conditions that the otolaryngologist is likely to encounter in a general practice. The clinician requires a thorough knowledge of head and neck anatomy to best interpret the variations from normal structures demonstrated on ultrasound. A knowledge of sonographic artifacts may assist the examiner in properly identifying the process under review. Ultrasonography may be the best imaging study for certain organs. In many instances it is the first clinical study that directs further imaging. By providing the clinician with clues as to the underlying pathology, it allows a more efficient direction in determining which aspiration techniques to use.

Adult echocardiography reporting — summary statement requirements specify that "A summary statement should be included in each echocardiography report" and "The summary statement should be placed at the top of a report (e.g., immediately following the demographics and indications section)". For a comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) report, the summary statement "should encompass five essential elements: 1) assessment of left and right ventricular function, 2) presence or absence of significant valvular abnormalities, 3) clinically important positive findings, 4) pertinent negative findings (when applicable), and 5) a comparison statement". For transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and limited TTE, the summary "may be more focused" on key positive and pertinent negative findings related to the indication. The summary "should present these findings in clear, straightforward sentences or bullet points" and "must highlight key positive or pertinent negative findings", with "critical findings clearly labeled", and "Documentation of any communication of these critical results to the care team should be included within the summary". Comparison is emphasized: "A comparison is recommended in all summary statements", and the report "should specify whether the comparison was made by reviewing prior study images or reports", noting that "While it is not mandatory to recommend serial echocardiography studies, additional imaging, or clinical consultation, it should be considered based on the clinical context".

Audiologic management of adult hearing impairment — epidemiology and causes — notes that hearing loss is common and age related, with prevalence described as follows: Approximately 28 million Americans have a hearing loss, and while approximately 17 in 1,000 children under age 18 have hearing loss, the incidence increases with age so that approximately 314 in 1,000 people over age 65 have hearing loss. Causes include heredity, disease, trauma, long-term exposure to damaging levels of noise, or ototoxic medications, and hearing loss can result from damage to the outer/middle ears (conductive) and/or the inner ear (the sensory and/or neural component), ranging from mild to total loss. Hearing aids are particularly useful in improving the hearing and speech understanding of patients with hearing loss.

### Long-term follow-up of patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia [^3ace25f5]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Significance of long-term CDH clinics

Given the variation in CDH severity and pathophysiology, research collaboration in CDH outcomes forms the foundation for evidence-based management including the identification of predictors of survival to discharge from index hospitalization. The CDH Study Group (CDHSG) was founded in 1995 as a voluntary international data repository to address this need. While the CDHSG provides outcome data from index hospitalization, institution-based CDH clinics provide the majority of research on long-term outcomes in CDH neonates.

The first multidisciplinary long-term clinic was formed at Boston Children's Hospital in 1990 by Wilson and colleagues. In 2008, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section on Surgery published a report outlining recommended multidisciplinary follow-up (table 1). Similarly, the CDH EURO Consortium published guidelines in 2018 emphasizing multidisciplinary CDH postnatal care based on standardized clinical assessment and management plans. Center-specific protocols are not widely available but a review published in 2014 identifies commonalities to clinic structure including presence of a pediatric surgeon, pulmonologist, cardiologist, gastroenterologist and developmental pediatrician. Diagnostic studies completed at these visits vary but include a chest radiograph (CXR), echocardiogram (ECHO), neurodevelopmental assessment, and hearing screening. Other age-specific tests are also performed such as ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scans, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and altitude testing.

Table 1
Recommended follow-up schedule and diagnostic testing for CDH survivors

Organizing a large number of specialty providers, diagnostic testing, and specialized resources is not always feasible. In a hospital setting without a centralized CDH clinic, families reported that time and distance to individual appointments were significant barriers to seeking follow-up care. Families also expressed interest in a CDH multidisciplinary clinic. Forming family-centered multidisciplinary clinics offloads the medical burden for families and broadens the catchment area where CDH survivors can receive multidisciplinary care. Along with providing improved care for CDH survivors, multidisciplinary clinics can collect and interpret data from their centers over longer survival periods.

While there are benefits to the granular research from single-center long-term clinics, collaborative long-term registries provide strength to evidence-based recommendations for follow-up. Chiu and Ijsselstijn outlined the creation of a prospective longitudinal database for multidisciplinary clinics to aggregate data through the CDHSG which is now in progress. These robust longitudinal clinic data will ultimately provide information to inform standardized follow-up protocols and guidance to the adult and pediatric community regarding optimal long-term management of these complex CDH survivors.

### Positive reframing of psychosis risk is seen as more beneficial and less harmful than negative framing by clinicians: an experimental videotaped simulated feedback study [^59b852ac]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Indirect real-world support for the potential benefits of positive framing in at-risk states comes from various areas of general medicine, where high-risk conditions are often framed and communicated positively. For instance, critical medical conditions are referred to as "life-threatening", rather than "high risk for death conditions" or "attenuated death syndrome". High-risk pregnancies are termed just that, avoiding more negative phrasings such as "miscarriage risk syndrome". Hearing problems are described as "hearing loss", potentially alleviated with "hearing aids", steering clear of terms like "attenuated deafness" treatable with "anti-deafness devices".

To ensure a clear understanding of our study's methods and results, it is essential to clarify from the outset both what positive framing entails and what it does not. Specifically, it is crucial to note that positive framing should not be confused with concepts such as re-labeling, positive psychology, or the de-medicalization of "normal human experiences". While these are related ideas, they represent distinct approaches. A comprehensive discussion addressing these potential misconceptions is included in the Discussion section for further clarification.

### Study protocol: baby-OSCAR trial: outcome after selective early treatment for closure of patent ductus ARteriosus in preterm babies, a multicentre, masked, randomised placebo-controlled parallel group trial [^e7bd15f6]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Schedule of study procedures

1 Screening assessments to be completed sufficiently in advance to enable randomisation and dosing within 72 hours of birth. If consent cannot be obtained before echocardiographic evaluation for eligibility, echocardiographic assessment should continue, and consent obtained when possible if a baby is deemed eligible.

2 Randomisation to be completed sufficiently in advance to enable starting IMP dosing within 72 h of birth.

3 Initial trial drug administrations to be given soon after randomisation, after 6 hours of age and within 72 hours of birth. Subsequent doses to be administered 24 hours after the initial dose.

4 Only adverse events which are serious will be recorded from first dose until 7 days after trial medication. Only unforeseeable SAEs will be reported.

5 Concomitant medications to be recorded only in relation to unforeseeable SAEs. In the event of an unforeseeable SAE all concomitant medication, including medication given to the baby's mother, 7 days prior to the onset of the event to the time of its resolution must be recorded on the SAE form.

6 Gross motor, cognitive, visual and hearing function will be assessed using the PARCA-R questionnaire, expanded to include questions to assess visual and hearing function.

7 Respiratory assessments will be performed using a separate validated questionnaire. There will be no requirement for the infants to be assessed for respiratory and/or other neurodevelopmental functions by medically qualified personnel.

8 An echocardiogram scan will be performed when the baby reaches around 3 weeks of age (range of 18–24 days) or at hospital discharge if discharged earlier.

9 Demography and medications at 2 years will be assessed through the PARCA-R and other questionnaires.

10 If a baby transfers from the recruiting site to a continuing care site for on-going care details of any scan would be helpful.

### Clinical evaluation and etiologic diagnosis of hearing loss: a clinical practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^6de65e67]. Genetics in Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Hearing loss (HL) with suspected syndromic etiology — genetic testing and care steps should be implemented. For individuals with findings that suggest a syndromic genetic etiology for their HL, pretest genetic counseling should be provided and, with informed consent, genetic testing should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis, using modalities that may include single-gene tests, HL multigene panels, ES, GS, chromosome analysis, or microarray- or NGS-based copy number analysis, depending on clinical findings. Appropriate studies should be undertaken to determine involvement of other organs, and near-term and long-term screening and management should be arranged, including referrals to specialists, as indicated by syndrome-associated manifestations.

### Human dorsal and ventral auditory streams subserve rehearsal-based and echoic processes during verbal working memory [^236c3b22]. Neuron (2005). Low credibility.

To hear a sequence of words and repeat them requires sensory-motor processing and something more-temporary storage. We investigated neural mechanisms of verbal memory by using fMRI and a task designed to tease apart perceptually based ("echoic") memory from phonological-articulatory memory. Sets of two- or three-word pairs were presented bimodally, followed by a cue indicating from which modality (auditory or visual) items were to be retrieved and rehearsed over a delay. Although delay-period activation in the planum temporale (PT) was insensible to the source modality and showed sustained delay-period activity, the superior temporal gyrus (STG) activated more vigorously when the retrieved items had arrived to the auditory modality and showed transient delay-period activity. Functional connectivity analysis revealed two topographically distinct fronto-temporal circuits, with STG co-activating more strongly with ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and PT co-activating more strongly with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These argue for separate contributions of ventral and dorsal auditory streams in verbal working memory.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^5ca8095c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Ménière's disease — standardization of definitions, severity, treatment failure, and outcomes is needed: The page states there is no clear definition or standardization of stages, severity, and response to treatment universally accepted for MD and proposes staging categories ("Active", "Chronic", and "Burned out") and severity levels (Mild, Moderate, Severe), along with definitions for failure of conservative and medical management. It also calls for development and validation of clinically relevant measures of quality of life (QOL), standardization of disease-specific QOL measures, and standardized follow-up focused on symptoms and long-term hearing and balance outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^1a875918]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Differences from prior guideline — scope updates and KAS clarifications: The update included 10 clinical practice guidelines, 29 new systematic reviews, and 36 new randomized controlled trials, and clarified terminology to use the term sudden sensorineural hearing loss to mean idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss to emphasize that > 90% of sudden sensorineural hearing loss is idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. It highlights the urgency of evaluation and initiation of treatment, if treatment is offered, by emphasizing the time from symptom occurrence. Changes include KAS 1 stating that when a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss, conductive hearing loss should be distinguished from sensorineural; KAS 3 clarifying the word "routine" to address nontargeted head computerized tomography scans and that this does not refer to targeted scans such as temporal bone computerized tomography scan; KAS 4 emphasizing audiometric confirmation as soon as possible and within 14 days of symptom onset; and KAS 6 specifying retrocochlear workup modalities including magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography scan if magnetic resonance imaging cannot be done, and, secondarily, auditory brainstem response evaluation.

### Vision-language foundation model for echocardiogram interpretation [^953897cc]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

Echocardiography, or cardiac ultrasound, is the most common, noninvasive method of evaluating heart function and identifying heart disease. Echocardiography routinely guides clinical cardiology decision-making – and is used for disease diagnosis, risk stratification and assessment of treatment response. Recent work has used artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the accuracy of echocardiographic measurements – and disease diagnoses –; however, these AI approaches focus on narrow individual tasks that require specific training for each task and do not use vision–language foundation models.

Recent advances in AI have leveraged representation learning on large image and text datasets to develop vision–language foundation models that generalize beyond narrow sets of predefined tasks. These models learn to encode images and text into compact representations that can then be used to perform a wide variety of separate prediction tasks for which the model was never specifically trained ('zero-shot' tasks). Given the broad range of data used to train these models, the performance of foundation models are often more robust than with conventional convolutional neural networks. In biomedical applications, foundation models have been developed to organize biological – and medicaldatasets, including modality-specific models for chest X-rays, retinal imaging, wearable waveforms and pathology images –. Training of foundation models on medical imaging has been bottlenecked by dataset size and is often limited to publicly available data that may not represent the range of disease severities and possible presentations. While text information might be imprecise, clinician evaluations of medical imaging provide an information-rich distillation of complex data.

In this work, we introduce EchoCLIP, a foundation model for echocardiography trained on a dataset of 1,032,975 echocardiogram videos sourced from over a decade of clinical imaging. We developed a method for substantially compressing echocardiography reports, simplifying the matching of clinical text assessments to images to focus on important clinical concepts. To assess the model's performance, we tested the model's ability to assess cardiac function, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and chamber size, as well as identify common intracardiac devices in both held-out internal test cohorts as well as external test cohorts. By using the model to compare pairs of echocardiogram studies, we can assess the model's ability to identify unique patients across time, identify clinically important changes in disease state and retrieve relevant clinical text for given images. Finally, we propose a new vision–language model interpretation approach based on matching relevant text with important regions of interest in images.

### Auditory cortex of newborn bats is prewired for echolocation [^d3dd4707]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Neuronal computation of object distance from echo delay is an essential task that echolocating bats must master for spatial orientation and the capture of prey. In the dorsal auditory cortex of bats, neurons specifically respond to combinations of short frequency-modulated components of emitted call and delayed echo. These delay-tuned neurons are thought to serve in target range calculation. It is unknown whether neuronal correlates of active space perception are established by experience-dependent plasticity or by innate mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that in the first postnatal week, before onset of echolocation and flight, dorsal auditory cortex already contains functional circuits that calculate distance from the temporal separation of a simulated pulse and echo. This innate cortical implementation of a purely computational processing mechanism for sonar ranging should enhance survival of juvenile bats when they first engage in active echolocation behaviour and flight.

### Subsequent pregnancy after stillbirth: a qualitative narrative analysis of Canadian families' experiences [^f8fe196d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Theme 3: needing additional and specific clinical care for reassurance

Many respondents discussed changes in the frequency of their medical care in their subsequent pregnancy and saw this as positive. They appreciated "more frequent appointments and monitoring" (21,279), "seeing care providers regularly, and frequent ultrasound reviewed by a perinatologist" (7943), and in general "extra care, which was helpful" (8145). Even simple moments that brought reassurance, like hearing their baby's heartbeat, seeing movements on ultrasound, and hearing that growth was normal (7239) were remembered. One individual commented:

"Extra ultrasounds, for peace of mind". (8656).

On the other hand, sometimes extra testing led to more anxiety:

"I was sent for a late scan to give me 'peace of mind' at about 36 weeks but the ultrasound tech panicked that my baby had a chubby neck and I was sent to a perinatologist at [BC Women's Hospital] for a consult and another scan because they were worried there was something wrong. There wasn't - so what should have given me peace of mind did not". (7952)

Delays or unavailable tests also created stress:

"The option for a 10-week nuchal fold ultrasound covered by [insurance] would have gone a long way to ease my anxiety, rather than waiting for 20 weeks for a fetal echocardiogram". (8656)

Some felt that care in their subsequent pregnancy was not ideal. This quote came from a parent who had experienced two stillbirths:

"… [this] baby was still stillborn. It was after this pregnancy they found out I have a blood clotting disorder. My babies should not have died. This was preventable if they had done the proper testing after my premature birth and especially after my first stillbirth". (7239)

One respondent noted that different care might have been useful in her index stillbirth pregnancy. She also mentioned buying a home fetal doppler monitor for more reassurance:

"It was bittersweet that I had to lose one baby to get that kind of care i.e. more frequent scans". (11230)

### The development and validation of the speech quality instrument [^0599b37c]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Although speech perception tests are available to evaluate hearing, there is no standardized validated tool to quantify speech quality. The objective of this study is to develop a validated tool to measure quality of speech heard.

Study Design

Prospective instrument validation study of 35 normal hearing adults recruited at a tertiary referral center.

Methods

Participants listened to 44 speech clips of male/female voices reciting the Rainbow Passage. Speech clips included original and manipulated excerpts capturing goal qualities such as mechanical and garbled. Listeners rated clips on a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) of 18 characteristics (e.g. cartoonish, garbled).

Results

Skewed distribution analysis identified mean ratings in the upper and lower 2-point limits of the VAS (ratings of 8–10, 0–2, respectively); items with inconsistent responses were eliminated. The test was pruned to a final instrument of nine speech clips that clearly define qualities of interest: speech-like, male/female, cartoonish, echo-y, garbled, tinny, mechanical, rough, breathy, soothing, hoarse, like, pleasant, natural. Mean ratings were highest for original female clips (8.8) and lowest for not-speech manipulation (2.1). Factor analysis identified two subsets of characteristics: internal consistency demonstrated Cronbach's alpha of 0.95 and 0.82 per subset. Test-retest reliability of total scores was high, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.76.

Conclusion

The Speech Quality Instrument (SQI) is a concise, valid tool for assessing speech quality as an indicator for hearing performance. SQI may be a valuable outcome measure for cochlear implant recipients who, despite achieving excellent speech perception, often experience poor speech quality.

### Position statement and practice guidelines on ototoxicity monitoring [^b10b0c27]. AAA (2009). Medium credibility.

Audiological interests in ototoxicity monitoring — clinical goals and patient management emphasize that a variety of drugs can cause auditory and/or vestibular dysfunction with auditory damage including permanent hearing loss and tinnitus, and monitoring is performed for early detection of changes to hearing status so that changes in the drug regimen may be considered and for audiologic intervention when handicapping hearing impairment has occurred. The term "ototoxicity monitoring" is generally taken to express the principle of early identification and also embraces early intervention; when changes are detected early, the physician can be alerted so that alternative treatment protocols, possibly with less ototoxic medications, may be considered, while when clinically significant changes occur, especially hearing deterioration that has migrated into the speech frequencies, the purpose of a monitoring program becomes to assist the patient and/or patient's family to maintain effective communication, acknowledging that this degree of hearing impairment may be unavoidable even with proactive monitoring because the priority is effective treatment of the disease via the given drug therapy. Once protocols are established, assistance to the patient/patient's family may include counseling, communication strategies, and prescribing amplification and/or assistive listening device(s).

### Screening and management of adult hearing loss in primary care: clinical applications [^773b8081]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Hearing loss is one of the most common chronic health conditions and has important implications for patient quality of life. However, hearing loss is substantially underdetected and undertreated. We present clinical cases to illustrate common situations in which primary care physicians may be called on to identify or to manage hearing loss. With the data reported in the companion scientific review as a guide, we present potential answers to important questions pertaining to hearing loss and suggest ways in which primary care physicians can improve the detection, evaluation, and treatment of hearing loss. The cases focus on screening for chronic hearing loss, evaluation of hearing loss, and treatment of patients with presbycusis.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^28610f09]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Sudden hearing loss is a frightening symptom that often prompts an urgent or emergent visit to a health care provider. It is frequently but not universally accompanied by tinnitus and/or vertigo. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss affects 5 to 27 per 100,000 people annually, with about 66,000 new cases per year in the United States. This guideline update provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients who present with sudden hearing loss. It focuses on sudden sensorineural hearing loss in adult patients aged ≥ 18 years and primarily on those with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Prompt recognition and management of sudden sensorineural hearing loss may improve hearing recovery and patient quality of life. The guideline update is intended for all clinicians who diagnose or manage adult patients who present with sudden hearing loss.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline update is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations in evaluating patients with sudden hearing loss and sudden sensorineural hearing loss, with particular emphasis on managing idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The guideline update group recognized that patients enter the health care system with sudden hearing loss as a nonspecific primary complaint. Therefore, the initial recommendations of this guideline update address distinguishing sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss at the time of presentation with hearing loss. They also clarify the need to identify rare, nonidiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss to help separate those patients from those with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, who are the target population for the therapeutic interventions that make up the bulk of the guideline update. By focusing on opportunities for quality improvement, this guideline should improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate prompt intervention, decrease variations in management, reduce unnecessary tests and imaging procedures, and improve hearing and rehabilitative outcomes for affected patients.

Methods

Consistent with the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's "Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual, Third Edition" (Rosenfeld et al. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2013;148[1]:S1-S55), the guideline update group was convened with representation from the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, otology, neurotology, family medicine, audiology, emergency medicine, neurology, radiology, advanced practice nursing, and consumer advocacy. A systematic review of the literature was performed, and the prior clinical practice guideline on sudden hearing loss was reviewed in detail. Key Action Statements (KASs) were updated with new literature, and evidence profiles were brought up to the current standard. Research needs identified in the original clinical practice guideline and data addressing them were reviewed. Current research needs were identified and delineated.

Results

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following: (KAS 1) Clinicians should distinguish sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss when a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss. (KAS 7) Clinicians should educate patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss about the natural history of the condition, the benefits and risks of medical interventions, and the limitations of existing evidence regarding efficacy. (KAS 13) Clinicians should counsel patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss who have residual hearing loss and/or tinnitus about the possible benefits of audiologic rehabilitation and other supportive measures. These strong recommendations were modified from the initial clinical practice guideline for clarity and timing of intervention. The guideline update group made strong recommendations against the following: (KAS 3) Clinicians should < u > not < /u > order routine computed tomography of the head in the initial evaluation of a patient with presumptive sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (KAS 5) Clinicians should < u > not < /u > obtain routine laboratory tests in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (KAS 11) Clinicians should < u > not < /u > routinely prescribe antivirals, thrombolytics, vasodilators, or vasoactive substances to patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following: (KAS 2) Clinicians should assess patients with presumptive sudden sensorineural hearing loss through history and physical examination for bilateral sudden hearing loss, recurrent episodes of sudden hearing loss, and/or focal neurologic findings. (KAS 4) In patients with sudden hearing loss, clinicians should obtain, or refer to a clinician who can obtain, audiometry as soon as possible (within 14 days of symptom onset) to confirm the diagnosis of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (KAS 6) Clinicians should evaluate patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss for retrocochlear pathology by obtaining magnetic resonance imaging or auditory brainstem response. (KAS 10) Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, intratympanic steroid therapy when patients have incomplete recovery from sudden sensorineural hearing loss 2 to 6 weeks after onset of symptoms. (KAS 12) Clinicians should obtain follow-up audiometric evaluation for patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss at the conclusion of treatment and within 6 months of completion of treatment. These recommendations were clarified in terms of timing of intervention and audiometry and method of retrocochlear workup. The guideline update group offered the following KASs as options: (KAS 8) Clinicians may offer corticosteroids as initial therapy to patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss within 2 weeks of symptom onset. (KAS 9a) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with steroid therapy within 2 weeks of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (KAS 9b) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with steroid therapy as salvage therapy within 1 month of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss.

Differences From Prior Guideline

Incorporation of new evidence profiles to include quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, and differences of opinion Included 10 clinical practice guidelines, 29 new systematic reviews, and 36 new randomized controlled trials Highlights the urgency of evaluation and initiation of treatment, if treatment is offered, by emphasizing the time from symptom occurrence Clarification of terminology by changing potentially unclear statements; use of the term sudden sensorineural hearing loss to mean idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss to emphasize that > 90% of sudden sensorineural hearing loss is idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and to avoid confusion in nomenclature for the reader Changes to the KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1-When a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss, conductive hearing loss should be distinguished from sensorineural. KAS 2-The utility of history and physical examination when assessing for modifying factors is emphasized. KAS 3-The word "routine" is added to clarify that this statement addresses nontargeted head computerized tomography scan that is often ordered in the emergency room setting for patients presenting with sudden hearing loss. It does not refer to targeted scans, such as temporal bone computerized tomography scan, to assess for temporal bone pathology. KAS 4-The importance of audiometric confirmation of hearing status as soon as possible and within 14 days of symptom onset is emphasized. KAS 5-New studies were added to confirm the lack of benefit of nontargeted laboratory testing in sudden sensorineural hearing loss. KAS 6-Audiometric follow-up is excluded as a reasonable workup for retrocochlear pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography scan if magnetic resonance imaging cannot be done, and, secondarily, auditory brainstem response evaluation are the modalities recommended. A time frame for such testing is not specified, nor is it specified which clinician should be ordering this workup; however, it is implied that it would be the general or subspecialty otolaryngologist. KAS 7-The importance of shared decision making is highlighted, and salient points are emphasized. KAS 8-The option for corticosteroid intervention within 2 weeks of symptom onset is emphasized. KAS 9-Changed to KAS 9A and 9B. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy remains an option but only when combined with steroid therapy for either initial treatment (9A) or salvage therapy (9B). The timing of initial therapy is within 2 weeks of onset, and that of salvage therapy is within 1 month of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. KAS 10-Intratympanic steroid therapy for salvage is recommended within 2 to 6 weeks following onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The time to treatment is defined and emphasized. KAS 11-Antioxidants were removed from the list of interventions that the clinical practice guideline recommends against using. KAS 12-Follow-up audiometry at conclusion of treatment and also within 6 months posttreatment is added. KAS 13-This statement on audiologic rehabilitation includes patients who have residual hearing loss and/or tinnitus who may benefit from treatment. Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs Enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making with tools provided to assist in same.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^7f8d17df]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Statement 7 — Hearing aid evaluation for hearing loss with persistent, bothersome tinnitus — clinicians should recommend a hearing aid evaluation for patients with hearing loss and persistent, bothersome tinnitus, with the recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm; the aggregate evidence quality is Grade C and the level of confidence in the evidence is High; anticipated benefits include raising awareness of potential beneficial effects of hearing aids on tinnitus, ensuring guidance on benefits and costs of hearing aids, and providing patients with hearing loss access to information and interventions that may alleviate hearing loss and improve function/QOL; risks and costs include the direct cost related to dispensing of a hearing aid; the benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit; intentional vagueness notes that the level of hearing loss is not specified because hearing loss-associated tinnitus may benefit from hearing aids even if hearing loss is mild or if there is more severe unilateral SNHL; and patient preferences apply because the patient may accept or decline pursuing a hearing aid evaluation.

### Genetic architecture distinguishes tinnitus from hearing loss [^3efc4764]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Even with high genetic overlap, comparison of MAGMA tissue expression analyses shows a clear difference between hearing loss and tinnitus, with broad expression in multiple areas of the brain for tinnitus, versus HD which is confined to the cerebellum in our study. These results are consistent with the fact that tinnitus has its source of production and perception within the wider area of the brain, rather than the narrower focus of the cochlea. Broad changes in gray and white matter, magnetoencephalography indication of tinnitus-frequency specific activity, and a difference in the default mode network (DMN) of tinnitus subjects have been identified, while hearing loss appears to be related more specifically to the cochlea and auditory pathway –. However, the lack of human cochlear tissue in reference databases currently precludes a direct comparison across brain regions and cochlea. It must be added that severe tinnitus has been shown to be highly correlated with hyperacusis, i.e. increased sensitivity to loudness comfort level, and that would need to be addressed in future studies. (REF Cederroth's paper).

Both genetic correlations and gSEM demonstrate significant correlations between tinnitus and psychiatric and health-related traits, as supported by epidemiological studies. The strongest associations are with self-reported hearing loss, speech understanding in noise, and hearing aid use. However, other findings of note include relationships with pain syndromes, wellness measures, and internalizing disorders. Tinnitus and another subjective symptom, pain, involve similar networks in the brain –. Findings associated with both pain and tinnitus include loss of gray matter in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and abnormal thalamocortical oscillations. The DMN in the resting state shows increased connectivity between DMN and the fronto-limbic-striatal system in tinnitus, echoing increased connectivity between DMN and the nucleus accumbens in chronic pain. The frontostriatal system functions to update a signal deviation from the predicted environment, serving to update predictions and both tinnitus and pain have been described as a continuous prediction error.

The present study finds that tinnitus genes broadly encompass those of hearing loss. Tinnitus genes are over-expressed in the brain and cochlea, in agreement with extensive imaging, auditory brainstem responses, and epidemiologic data. We have been able to differentiate variants that may be either within a pathway that induces both hearing difficulties and tinnitus, or tinnitus specific. Further work will attempt to characterize tinnitus with various aspects of audiology available in the medical record. Evidence for the significant genetic correlation of tinnitus with specific psychiatric disorders and health-related traits provides a framework for further genomic research of tinnitus.

### Screening for hearing loss in older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^ad20e6f6]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — screening for hearing loss in asymptomatic older adults is an I statement, with scope limited to adults aged 50 years or older without perceived hearing problems; the USPSTF states that "the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for hearing loss in older adults", applies to "asymptomatic older adults (≥ 50 years) with age-related, sensorineural hearing loss", and "does not apply to adults with conductive hearing loss, congenital hearing loss, sudden hearing loss, or hearing loss caused by recent noise exposure, or to persons reporting signs and symptoms of hearing loss"; implementation notes say "There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for hearing loss in persons with unrecognized hearing loss", and "Clinicians should use their clinical judgement about hearing testing for patients who have symptoms of hearing loss or who have raised concerns about their hearing", and the statement is "consistent with the 2012 USPSTF statement".

### Awareness, perceptions, and literacy surrounding hearing loss and hearing rehabilitation among the adult population in the United States [^5886abfe]. Otology & Neurotology (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Given the growing number of reports linking potential long-term health ramifications with untreated hearing loss in adults, the importance of hearing loss literacy has received greater attention in the medical literature in recent years. The current work illustrates the disproportionately limited understanding of hearing loss compared to other common medical conditions among the United States adult population. For instance, whereas the majority (≥ 85%) of respondents demonstrated understanding of "normal" ranges for vision and blood pressure, only approximately 10% reported knowing "normal" ranges for hearing. Moreover, although most respondents acknowledged that hearing impairment impacts quality of life, less than one-fourth of respondents recognized that hearing loss is linked with long-term negative health sequelae such as depression and dementia. Compounding the lack of knowledge regarding implications of untreated hearing loss, less than half of the respondents in the current work recognized that hearing loss is treatable.

impairment, word recognition score in quiet of 60% correct or higher in the better-hearing ear, community-dwelling, and fluent English speaker. The hearing intervention consisted of four 1-hour sessions with a study audiologist every 1 to 3 weeks postrandomization. Participants received bilateral hearing aids that were fit to prescriptive targets using real-ear measures. The intervention included education on device use and counseling on self-management and communication strategies. Participants also received other accompanying hearing assistive technologies based on individual preference and listening needs. Booster sessions every 6 months provided reinstruction for device use and hearing rehabilitative strategies.

Details regarding the hearing intervention have been previously published. 32, 33. This finding suggests a positive association of hearing intervention with reducing declines in social functioning. Additionally, energy increased in the hearing intervention yet declined in the health education control over 3 years, suggesting hearing intervention also had a beneficial association with increased energy over 3 years. In the health-related quality of life domain-specific findings, the ACHIEVE study observed a potential benefit of hearing intervention on reducing fatigue and reducing declines in social functioning. The primary hypothesized mechanisms through which hearing loss may worsen fatigue is increased cognitive load.

Cognitive load posits that, with hearing loss, greater cognitive resources are diverted to processing speech and sound, leaving fewer cognitive resources available for other cognitive functions; fatigue may be a symptom of high cognitive load. 49, 50 Furthermore, hearing loss may worsen social functioning through communication difficulties, withdrawal from participation in social activities, lower physical activity and physical function, and depression. 25, 26, 28, 29, 51, 52 Hearing loss may also impact confidence and perceived capacity to engage with others.

### Chronic pachymeningitis presenting as asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss [^9df9e4cd]. Otology & Neurotology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to characterize the auditory dysfunction associated with chronic pachymeningitis (inflammation of the dura mater).

Study Design and Setting

We conducted a university-based retrospective review.

Results

Three patients were identified who were diagnosed with chronic pachymeningitis after being referred for asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss. All patients were found to have other neurologic symptoms and signs during careful neurotologic evaluation. Two varieties of chronic pachymeningitis exist: a hypertrophic mass lesion and a linear dural thickening. Although the hypertrophic variety could be easily detectable by noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the linear form is only visible with the use of gadolinium enhancement.

Conclusion

Chronic pachymeningitis is a rare form of sensorineural hearing loss that could portend an underlying disease of greater concern. Extensive evaluation is needed to exclude identifiable causes of chronic pachymeningitis, including infectious, neoplastic, and autoimmune diseases.

Significance

The clinician should be aware that the evaluation of a patient with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss involves more than simply ruling out an acoustic neuroma. Fast-spin echo MRI techniques without the use of gadolinium contrast could miss a number of potentially treatable diseases such as chronic pachymeningitis. Patients with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss should be carefully evaluated for other neurologic findings, and imaging with enhanced MRI is recommended.

### Impaired processing of binaural temporal cues to auditory scene analysis in schizophrenia [^affa7df9]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

It is well established that individuals with schizophrenia demonstrate alterations in auditory perception beginning at the very earliest stages of information processing. However, it is not clear how these impairments in basic information processing translate into high-order cognitive deficits. Auditory scene analysis allows listeners to group auditory information into meaningful objects, and as such provides an important link between low-level auditory processing and higher cognitive abilities. In the present study we investigated whether low-level impairments in the processing of binaural temporal information impact upon auditory scene analysis ability. Binaural temporal processing ability was investigated in 19 individuals with schizophrenia and 19 matched controls. Individuals with schizophrenia showed impaired binaural temporal processing ability on an inter-aural time difference (ITD) discrimination task. In addition, patients demonstrated impairment in two measures of auditory scene analysis. Specifically, patients had reduced ability to use binaural temporal cues to extract signal from noise in a masking level difference paradigm, and to separate the location of a source sound in the presence of an echo in the precedence effect paradigm. These findings demonstrate that individuals with schizophrenia have impairments in the accuracy with which simple binaural temporal information is encoded in the auditory system, and furthermore, this impairment has functional consequences in terms of the use of these cues to extract information in complex auditory environments.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^13e473cb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Ménière's disease — hearing usability categorization — in this CPG, the term nonusable hearing is used to indicate that the hearing is not functional for communicative purposes, and Table 11 shows a classification scheme that attempts to differentiate usable hearing from nonusable hearing. The AAO-HNS has also published a hearing categorization scheme that is useful for identifying nonusable hearing; this 4-category scheme (A–D) is also based on the PTA (in this case including 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz) as well as speech recognition/discrimination (the WRS), and for this scheme, category D, with WRS < 50% regardless of PTA, would be categorized as nonusable hearing, while ultimately the decision of hearing being usable or not must be determined by the patient with the hearing loss.

Such general measures of functional health status are often insensitive to the impact of hearing loss, although a study using the World Health Organization's Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS II) demonstrated that the WHO-DAS II is, in fact, sensitive to hearing aid use.

### Guidelines and recommendations for performance of the fetal echocardiogram: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^f3831345]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). High credibility.

Early (< 15 weeks) fetal echocardiography — diagnostic performance, follow-up, and counseling indicate general sensitivity and specificity good with 78.6% and 98.9%, respectively. Most major structural heart disease can be detected at 10–14 wk, though subtle defects including valve lesions are difficult due to suboptimal resolution. If unclear or suspicious, a return within 1–2 wk is suggested. Counseling and reporting integrate the role of genetic screening and testing and limitations of examination, with potential for missed diagnoses and progressive lesions. Although detailed, this is considered a screening examination, and reassessment at 18–20 wk is recommended. Additional considerations include higher rates of pregnancy termination.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^15639862]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Hearing aids for adults with tinnitus and hearing loss — We suggest hearing aids for tinnitus management in adults with hearing loss (see narrative for discussion of patients without hearing loss). It is categorized as a Reviewed, New-added recommendation, and The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low. The body of evidence had some limitations, including small sample size, heterogeneous subpopulation, high risk of bias because of inherent bias from the non-randomized comparative study design, and no statistical corrections for the inclusion of known confounders. The benefits of hearing aids and reduced functional impact of tinnitus outweighed the potential harms. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) included a small number of subjects who reported worsening of tinnitus or hearing or development of anxiety or depression with both interventions. Patient values and preferences favored this option, as the patient focus group participants emphasized that hearing aids were one of the most effective devices and treatments for their tinnitus.

### Cochlear dysfunction is a frequent feature of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 1 (FSHD1) [^0491e6dc]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 1 (FSHD) represents one of the most common forms of muscular hereditary diseases and it is characterized by a great clinical variability with the typical muscular symptoms and other clinical features, including hearing impairment. However, etiopathogenetic mechanisms of auditory dysfunction are still not completely understood and it has been suggested that it could be assigned to a cochlear alteration that is present even in those subjects with a normal pure tonal audiometry (PTA) examination.

Methods

We found out the cochlear function in 26 patients with molecular diagnosis of FSHD1 and in healthy controls. All patients underwent complete neurological and audiological examinations, including FSHD clinical score, pure-tone audiometry (PTA), and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), in particular transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and distortion product evoked otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs).

Results

All FSHD1 patients showed significantly reduced DPOAEs and TEOAEs, bilaterally and at all frequencies, even when considering only subjects with a normal PTA or a mild muscular involvement (FSHD score ≤ 2). No correlation between OAEs and FSHD clinical score was found.

Discussion

Cochlear echoes represent a sensitive tool in detecting subclinical cochlear dysfunction in FSHD1 even in subjects with normal hearing and/or subtle muscle involvement. Our study is focused on the importance of evaluating the cochlear alteration through OAEs and, in particular, by performing TEOAEs and DPOAEs sequentially, to evaluate more frequent specificities of cochlear dysfunction with a wider spectrum of analysis.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) executive summary [^ad919e5d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Sudden hearing loss is a frightening symptom that often prompts an urgent or emergent visit to a health care provider. It is frequently, but not universally, accompanied by tinnitus and/or vertigo. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss affects 5 to 27 per 100,000 people annually, with about 66,000 new cases per year in the United States. This guideline update provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients who present with sudden hearing loss. It focuses on sudden sensorineural hearing loss in adult patients aged 18 and over and primarily on those with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Prompt recognition and management of sudden sensorineural hearing loss may improve hearing recovery and patient quality of life. The guideline update is intended for all clinicians who diagnose or manage adult patients who present with sudden hearing loss.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline update is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations in evaluating patients with sudden hearing loss and sudden sensorineural hearing loss, with particular emphasis on managing idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The guideline update group recognized that patients enter the health care system with sudden hearing loss as a nonspecific primary complaint. Therefore, the initial recommendations of this guideline update address distinguishing sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss at the time of presentation with hearing loss. They also clarify the need to identify rare, nonidiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss to help separate those patients from those with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, who are the target population for the therapeutic interventions that make up the bulk of the guideline update. By focusing on opportunities for quality improvement, this guideline should improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate prompt intervention, decrease variations in management, reduce unnecessary tests and imaging procedures, and improve hearing and rehabilitative outcomes for affected patients.

Methods

Consistent with the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual, Third Edition, the guideline update group was convened with representation from the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, otology, neurotology, family medicine, audiology, emergency medicine, neurology, radiology, advanced practice nursing, and consumer advocacy. A systematic review of the literature was performed, and the prior clinical practice guideline on sudden hearing loss was reviewed in detail. Key action statements (KASs) were updated with new literature, and evidence profiles were brought up to the current standard. Research needs identified in the original clinical practice guideline and data addressing them were reviewed. Current research needs were identified and delineated.

Results

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following: clinicians should distinguish sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss when a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss (KAS 1); clinicians should educate patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss about the natural history of the condition, the benefits and risks of medical interventions, and the limitations of existing evidence regarding efficacy (KAS 7); and clinicians should counsel patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss who have residual hearing loss and/or tinnitus about the possible benefits of audiological rehabilitation and other supportive measures (KAS 13). These strong recommendations were modified from the initial clinical practice guideline for clarity and timing of intervention. The guideline update group made strong recommendation against the following: clinicians should not order routine computed tomography of the head in the initial evaluation of a patient with presumptive sudden sensorineural hearing loss (KAS 3); clinicians should not obtain routine laboratory tests in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (KAS 5); and clinicians should not routinely prescribe antivirals, thrombolytics, vasodilators, or vasoactive substances to patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (KAS 11). The guideline update group made recommendations for the following: clinicians should assess patients with presumptive sudden sensorineural hearing loss through history and physical examination for bilateral sudden hearing loss, recurrent episodes of sudden hearing loss, and/or focal neurologic findings (KAS 2); in patients with sudden hearing loss, clinicians should obtain, or refer to a clinician who can obtain, audiometry as soon as possible (within 14 days of symptom onset) to confirm the diagnosis of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (KAS 4); clinicians should evaluate patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss for retrocochlear pathology by obtaining a magnetic resonance imaging or auditory brainstem response (KAS 6); clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, intratympanic steroid therapy when patients have incomplete recovery from sudden sensorineural hearing loss 2 to 6 weeks after onset of symptoms (KAS 10); and clinicians should obtain follow-up audiometric evaluation for patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss at the conclusion of treatment and within 6 months of completion of treatment (KAS 12). These recommendations were clarified in terms of timing of intervention and audiometry, as well as method of retrocochlear workup. The guideline update group offered the following KASs as options: clinicians may offer corticosteroids as initial therapy to patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss within 2 weeks of symptom onset (KAS 8); clinicians may offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with steroid therapy within 2 weeks of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (KAS 9a); and clinicians may offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with steroid therapy as salvage therapy within 1 month of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (KAS 9b).

Differences From Prior Guideline

Incorporation of new evidence profiles to include quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, and differences of opinion Included 10 clinical practice guidelines, 29 new systematic reviews, and 36 new randomized controlled trials Highlights the urgency of evaluation and initiation of treatment, if treatment is offered, by emphasizing the time from symptom occurrence Clarification of terminology by changing potentially unclear statements; use of the term sudden sensorineural hearing loss to mean idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss to emphasize that over 90% of sudden sensorineural hearing loss is idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and to avoid confusion in nomenclature for the reader Changes to the key action statements (KASs) from the original guideline: KAS 1: When a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss, conductive hearing loss should be distinguished from sensorineural. KAS 2: The utility of history and physical examination when assessing for modifying factors is emphasized. KAS 3: The word routine is added to clarify that this statement addresses a nontargeted head computed tomography scan that is often ordered in the emergency room setting for patients presenting with sudden hearing loss. It does not refer to targeted scans such as a temporal bone computed tomography scan to assess for temporal bone pathology. KAS 4: The importance of audiometric confirmation of hearing status as soon as possible and within 14 days of symptom onset is emphasized. KAS 5: New studies were added to confirm the lack of benefit of nontargeted laboratory testing in sudden sensorineural hearing loss. KAS 6: Audiometric follow-up is excluded as a reasonable workup for retrocochlear pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography scan if magnetic resonance imaging cannot be done, or, secondarily, auditory brainstem response evaluation are the modalities recommended. A time frame for such testing is not specified, nor is it specified which clinician should be ordering this workup; however, it is implied that it would be the general or subspecialty otolaryngologist. KAS 7: The importance of shared decision making is highlighted, and salient points are emphasized. KAS 8: The option for corticosteroid intervention within 2 weeks of symptom onset is emphasized. KAS 9: Changed to KAS 9a and 9b; hyperbaric oxygen therapy remains an option but only when combined with steroid therapy for either initial treatment (9a) or for salvage therapy (9b). The timing is within 2 weeks of onset for initial therapy and within 1 month of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss for salvage therapy. KAS 10: Intratympanic steroid therapy for salvage is recommended within 2 to 6 weeks following onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The time to treatment is defined and emphasized. KAS 11: Antioxidants were removed from the list of interventions that the clinical practice guideline recommends against using. KAS 12: Follow-up audiometry at conclusion of treatment and also within 6 months posttreatment is added. KAS 13: This statement on audiologic rehabilitation includes patients who have residual hearing loss and/or tinnitus who may benefit from treatment. Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs Enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making with tools provided to assist in the same.

### Hearing loss in adults: differential diagnosis and treatment [^7ba73c91]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on presbycusis:

- **Definition**: Presbycusis, also known as age-related hearing loss, is a multifactorial process characterized by a gradual, progressive, and symmetrical loss of hearing ability that occurs as part of the natural aging process.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of presbycusis involves degenerative processes associated with aging, such as the loss of hair cells in the cochlea and the degeneration of auditory nerve fibers. These changes can lead to impairments in both peripheral hearing and central auditory processing, contributing to the overall hearing loss.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of presbycusis in the US is estimated at 29.3%, 55.1%, and 79.1% at 60–69 years, 70–79 years, and ≥ 80 years, respectively.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for presbycusis include advanced age, prolonged exposure to loud noise, genetic predisposition, ototoxic medications, and certain conditions such as diabetes and CVD.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of presbycusis typically begins with difficulty in hearing high-frequency sounds, which gradually progresses to a generalized hearing loss over time. This process is often gradual, so the individual may not notice the hearing loss until it becomes severe.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The hearing loss in presbyscusis is irreversible, with significant impacts on the QoL, including effects on communication, social isolation, depression, and potentially dementia.

### Is idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss seasonal? [^e30d460a]. Otology & Neurotology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the circannual rhythm (seasonal incidence) of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL).

Methods

Data were retrieved from the medical files of an original cohort of all consecutive patients with ISSNHL in a tertiary medical center between 2012 and 2020. A systematic literature search of "MEDLINE" via "PubMed", "Embase", and "Web of Science" on comparable published cases was performed. A Google Trends analysis of the term [sudden hearing loss] and related terms between 2014 and 2020 was also performed.

Results

Most of the published series (9/12) reported the highest ISSNHL incidence in the spring and the lowest in the winter (8/12). In our local series, the incidence during the winter was significantly lower than that for the other seasons by a factor of 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.77; p = 0.041; r = 0.36). Google Trends data showed no significant correlation between the calendric month and the incidence of ISSNHL in any of the analyzed countries (p = 0.873, r2 = 0.029).

Conclusion

The ISSNHL incidence was lowest during the winter season in our cohort and reported for other cohorts worldwide. Google Trends-based model analysis did not determine any circannual rhythm.

### Protocol for the development of the WHO package of ear and hearing care interventions [^987f473c]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Identification or conduct of systematic reviews

Evidence from high-quality systematic reviews will be used to complement evidence from clinical practice guidelines in the following cases: (1) no clinical practice guidelines are identified for a given EHC condition after screening and quality appraisal, (2) the selected clinical practice guidelines provide contradictory recommendations for a given intervention and/or (3) the clinical practice guideline makes recommendations for an intervention based on evidence that is published prior to 2014. Systematic reviews will be identified by the core research group, under the guidance of the WHO EHC Programme. The identification or conduct of systematic reviews is meant to overcome limitations in the availability of clinical practice guidelines.

First, Cochrane systematic reviews, published or updated since 2014, will be identified. If Cochrane systematic reviews for a given intervention do not exist, other high-quality systematic reviews will be identified through a systematic search process. To ensure the selection of high-quality systematic reviews, two reviewers will independently appraise the quality of the systematic review methodology using the A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2). All non-Cochrane systematic reviews will (1) be screened on AMSTAR 2 item 2 (whether the report of the review contained an explicit statement that the review methods were established prior to the conduct of the review) and (2) when item 2 was rated 'yes', reviewers will assess the remaining critical domains. Systematic reviews will be included if all critical item domains (items 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15) are rated as 'yes' or 'partial yes' by both reviewers.

Like the approach described earlier, two members of the core research group will independently perform the title and abstract, then the full-text screening, to determine inclusion of systematic reviews. Systematic reviews will be excluded if they do not focus on an intervention or diagnostic test accuracy specifically related to the target EHC condition. Any disagreements related to the inclusion/exclusion of review articles will be resolved by a discussion of the clinical practice guidelines and will involve a third reviewer as needed.

If there are inadequate evidence-based EHC interventions identified from high-quality clinical practice guidelines or systematic reviews for a given condition, the core research group, under the guidance of the WHO EHC Programme, will conduct systematic reviews for those conditions. These systematic reviews will follow pre-defined protocols and will be reported following PRISMA guidelines.

### A narrative review of pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19: safety considerations and ototoxicity [^35fec460]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective/Hypothesis

The purpose of this review is to summarize evidence-based data regarding the ototoxic effects of potential COVID-19 therapeutics to treat patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2.

Methods

Medications under investigation as novel therapeutics to treat COVID-19 were identified using the search term coronavirus therapeutics, COVID therapeutics, and SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics on ClinicalTrials.gov and the PubMed Database. A literature review was performed using the PubMed Database for each proposed COVID-19 therapeutic to identify relevant articles. Search criteria included Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and key word search terms for ototoxicity, vestibulotoxicity, hearing disorders, and vertigo.

Results

Six proposed COVID-19 therapeutics were identified as possessing ototoxic side effects including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon, ribavirin, and ivermectin.

Conclusions

Available evidence suggests that ototoxic effects may be improved or mitigated by stopping the offending agent. Recognition of hearing loss, tinnitus, or imbalance/vertigo is therefore crucial to facilitate early intervention and prevent long-term damage. Hospitals should consider the inclusion of audiologic monitoring protocols for patients receiving COVID-19 therapeutics with known ototoxicity, especially in high-risk patient groups such as the elderly and hearing impaired.

### Medical evaluation of tinnitus [^049d8998]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

It has been estimated that 15% of the population in the United States has tinnitus which lasts greater than 5 minutes. It has also been estimated that 155 million patients have previously sought care for this symptom. It is clear that the incidence of tinnitus increases with age and by 70 years of age at least 25 to 30% of patients experience tinnitus constantly. In addition, noise exposure and noise induced sensorineural hearing loss are most often seen in tinnitus patients. Furthermore, of interest to the physician, 94% of patients who have sought medical care have not been offered treatment for their tinnitus, rather they have been informed that nothing could be done for them, and they should "live with it".

### Dying art of a history and physical: pulsatile tinnitus [^dd73ba67]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Our opinion is that it would interest the readership of BMJ Case Reports because it describes an important clinical lesson regarding performing a thorough history and physical before using adjunctive radiographic modalities. Examining the patient is the basis of medicine and should not be forgotten. It is an elementary but significant fact that has long-lasting implications. Our hope is that by urging those in medicine to continue to utilising skills such as auscultation, it will decrease patient costs and improve the quality of healthcare.

### Abusive head trauma in infants and children [^e8856489]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) legal and terminology considerations — Clinicians should understand courtroom expectations and use precise terminology. The debate arises from "the legal requirement of physicians to subsequently express in court their degree of certainty of the AHT diagnosis (ie, to a 'reasonable medical certainty')". Clarification is offered that "'reasonable medical certainty' is a pro forma legal expression required of physicians to assure courts that the opinions expressed are reasonable and nonspeculative". Importantly, "Pediatric practitioners should understand that legal burdens of proof (ie, beyond a reasonable doubt) are not required for the diagnosis", and "Diagnosing AHT requires the same meticulousness, thoughtfulness, and comprehensiveness as any other medical diagnosis, no more and no less". In legal settings, "a pediatric practitioner may be called on to testify in AHT hearings", and because "The court may allow extraneous or pseudoscientific theories to be considered as explanations for findings of AHT", a testifying pediatrician "should be sufficiently versed… so that he or she can present responsible, ethical testimony to the court". Regarding terminology, "The term 'shaken baby syndrome' has become synonymous in public discourse with AHT in all its forms", and the pediatric practitioner should be prepared to "use the term 'abusive head trauma' rather than a term that implies a single injury mechanism, such as shaken baby syndrome, in their diagnosis and medical communications".

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^1cdf3494]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Hearing aid evaluation — bothersome tinnitus with hearing loss states that clinicians should recommend a hearing aid evaluation for patients with hearing loss and persistent, bothersome tinnitus, with a recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile describes quality improvement opportunities, aggregate evidence quality Grade C, and a High level of confidence in the evidence. Benefits are to raise awareness of potential beneficial effects of hearing aids on tinnitus, ensure proper guidance regarding benefits and costs of hearing aids, and provide patients who have hearing loss with access to information and interventions that may alleviate hearing loss and improve function/QOL, whereas risks, harms, and costs include the direct cost related to dispensing of a hearing aid; the benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit. Value judgments include a perceived lack of awareness regarding the ability of hearing aids to improve QOL for patients with tinnitus; intentional vagueness is that the level of hearing loss is not specified because hearing loss-associated tinnitus may benefit from hearing aids even if mild or with more severe unilateral SNHL; and patient preferences may lead a patient to accept or decline pursuing a hearing aid evaluation.

### Ultrasonic neuromodulation causes widespread cortical activation via an indirect auditory mechanism [^74d85dd4]. Neuron (2018). Low credibility.

Ultrasound has received widespread attention as an emerging technology for targeted, non-invasive neuromodulation based on its ability to evoke electrophysiological and motor responses in animals. However, little is known about the spatiotemporal pattern of ultrasound-induced brain activity that could drive these responses. Here, we address this question by combining focused ultrasound with wide-field optical imaging of calcium signals in transgenic mice. Surprisingly, we find cortical activity patterns consistent with indirect activation of auditory pathways rather than direct neuromodulation at the ultrasound focus. Ultrasound-induced activity is similar to that evoked by audible sound. Furthermore, both ultrasound and audible sound elicit motor responses consistent with a startle reflex, with both responses reduced by chemical deafening. These findings reveal an indirect auditory mechanism for ultrasound-induced cortical activity and movement requiring careful consideration in future development of ultrasonic neuromodulation as a tool in neuroscience research.

The "Policy level: Recommendation", supported by "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on cohort studies of hearing outcomes in MD and benefits of amplification and cochlear implants" and "Level of confidence in evidence: High". Reported "Benefits: Improved function, improved QOL, improved hearing, less missed work" and "Risk, harm, cost: Clinicians and patients' time, creation of unrealistic expectations", with a "Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harms". Patient input is reflected by "Role of patient preferences: Small regarding counseling, large in terms of choice to use these technologies", and value framing by "Value judgments: The handicap of associated hearing loss is underrecognized in MD patients".

### Social media engagement, perpetuating selected information, and accuracy regarding CA SB-201: treatment or intervention on the sex characteristics of a minor [^015083d4]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Disorders/differences of sex development (DSD) is a medical term used to encompass patients born with congenital conditions that lead to atypical development of the genitalia and reproductive structures.

Objective

To evaluate the factual accuracy of shared articles from popular social media platforms regarding the California State Bill, SB-201, Treatment or Intervention: Sex Characteristics of a Minor.

Design

We used the BuzzSumo© search engine to analyze the terms "SB 201", "intersex", "DSD", and "surgery ban" for worldwide social media engagement (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Reedit) one month before and after bill introduction on January 31, 2019, and final hearing on January 13, 2020. Articles were categorized based on source, opinion of the author, accuracy of scientific information, use of term intersex versus disorder/difference of sex development (DSD), definition of intersex, advocacy group quoted, reference to surgical "gender assignment", mention of negative consequences of the bill/other banned surgeries, the definition of medical necessity, parental rights, psychosocial concerns, and photographic content.

Results

Twenty unique articles with peak activity were analyzed. Eighteen were from news and two from editorial web sources. All mentioned SB-201.50% were classified as one-sided, meaning both arguments for and against were not presented. 60% of articles were perpetuating selected information correlating with the author's opinion. 65% of articles were misleading in terms of factual accuracy. All articles used the term intersex. 20% of articles used scientific terms such as atypical genitalia (2), DSD (2), and born with variations of sex characteristics (1). A urologist was quoted in 45% of articles, while 75% quoted intersex advocacy groups. 55% of articles referred to the surgeries as "gender normalizing", and 75% referred to "assigning gender". Three articles mentioned other non-DSD surgeries that SB-201 would ban in addition to any that "normalize appearance". 45% (9) included any definition of medical necessity, the most common being inability to urinate (7), which is incompatible with post-natal viability.

Discussion

Our study demonstrates that some of the most disseminated information on social media surrounding the introduction and hearing of SB-201 that did not include input from the medical community, perpetuated selected information, and lacked appropriate factual content.

Conclusion

Misinformation in the media can be harmful to patients and the general public. This study highlights the need for balanced and accurate reporting on medical topics that can have emotional and political consequences when speaking to broader audiences.

### Hearing voices and other altered perceptual experiences across psychotic, mood, and anxiety disorders: from phenomenology and mechanisms to future directions [^cbfbad80]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

While voice-hearing in psychosis has received much attention, perceptual experiences in other sensory modalities and psychiatric conditions have remained relatively overlooked. The present review aimed to address this gap by providing an overview of voices/altered perceptual experiences (APE) across psychotic, mood and anxiety disorders in terms of phenomenological characteristics, biopsychosocial mechanisms, etiological models and therapeutic interventions. Where possible, lived experience perspectives and transcultural considerations were embedded. A narrative literature review was conducted. Knowledge pertaining to voices in psychosis formed the foundation, broadened to include other sensory modalities and diagnostic conditions. Quality assessment demonstrated an excellent rating of 12/12. Notable findings related to: (i) phenomenological heterogeneity in voices/APE within individuals and across diagnostic conditions, with multisensory/multimodal experiences relatively widespread; (ii) existing mechanistic studies mainly focusing on the role of trauma and neurocognition in voices; (iii) prevailing explanatory models mostly focusing on voices; (iv) a need for emerging interventions to extrapolate to encompass broader therapeutic applications; and (v) wide-ranging specificity issues and transcultural considerations to be addressed. Future research should invest in appropriate assessment tools as well as ensuring methodological consistency in mechanistic studies. Incorporating lived experience perspectives and meaningfully embedding transcultural considerations in theoretical and empirical ways are also essential.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss [^da1ac23d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Sudden hearing loss (SHL) is a frightening symptom that often prompts an urgent or emergent visit to a physician. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients who present with SHL. The guideline primarily focuses on sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) in adult patients (aged 18 and older). Prompt recognition and management of SSNHL may improve hearing recovery and patient quality of life (QOL). Sudden sensorineural hearing loss affects 5 to 20 per 100,000 population, with about 4000 new cases per year in the United States. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who diagnose or manage adult patients who present with SHL.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations in evaluating patients with SHL, with particular emphasis on managing SSNHL. The panel recognized that patients enter the health care system with SHL as a nonspecific, primary complaint. Therefore, the initial recommendations of the guideline deal with efficiently distinguishing SSNHL from other causes of SHL at the time of presentation. By focusing on opportunities for quality improvement, the guideline should improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate prompt intervention, decrease variations in management, reduce unnecessary tests and imaging procedures, and improve hearing and rehabilitative outcomes for affected patients.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) distinguish sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss in a patient presenting with SHL; (2) educate patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) about the natural history of the condition, the benefits and risks of medical interventions, and the limitations of existing evidence regarding efficacy; and (3) counsel patients with incomplete recovery of hearing about the possible benefits of amplification and hearing-assistive technology and other supportive measures. The panel made recommendations that clinicians should (1) assess patients with presumptive SSNHL for bilateral SHL, recurrent episodes of SHL, or focal neurologic findings; (2) diagnose presumptive ISSNHL if audiometry confirms a 30-dB hearing loss at 3 consecutive frequencies and an underlying condition cannot be identified by history and physical examination; (3) evaluate patients with ISSNHL for retrocochlear pathology by obtaining magnetic resonance imaging, auditory brainstem response, or audiometric follow-up; (4) offer intratympanic steroid perfusion when patients have incomplete recovery from ISSNHL after failure of initial management; and (5) obtain follow-up audiometric evaluation within 6 months of diagnosis for patients with ISSNHL. The panel offered as options that clinicians may offer (1) corticosteroids as initial therapy to patients with ISSNHL and (2) hyperbaric oxygen therapy within 3 months of diagnosis of ISSNHL. The panel made a recommendation against clinicians routinely prescribing antivirals, thrombolytics, vasodilators, vasoactive substances, or antioxidants to patients with ISSNHL. The panel made strong recommendations against clinicians (1) ordering computerized tomography of the head/brain in the initial evaluation of a patient with presumptive SSNHL and (2) obtaining routine laboratory tests in patients with ISSNHL.

### Clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis, treatment, and management of children and adults with central auditory processing disorder [^1dc38d65]. AAA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Audiology — case history guidelines for central auditory processing disorder (C)APD state that a carefully elicited comprehensive case history is essential to both diagnosis and intervention, provides the audiologist with important information about the likelihood of central auditory nervous system (CANS) compromise, helps guide selection of behavioral tests and/or electrophysiologic procedures for the test battery, and helps recognize comorbid conditions and the need to consider them when interpreting test results. Specific areas that should be probed during the case history interview include: auditory and/or communication difficulties experienced by the individual; family history of hearing loss and/or central auditory processing deficits; medical history, including birth, otologic and neurologic history, general health history, and medications; speech and language development and behaviors; educational history and/or work history; existence of any known comorbid conditions, including cognitive, intellectual, and/or medical disorders; social development; and linguistic and cultural background.

### Perilymphatic signal changes in vestibular schwannoma: a potential biomarker of progressive hearing loss? [^af1b168b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Vestibular schwannomas influence the magnetic resonance (MR) signal intensity (SI) in the vestibular cistern and cochlear perilymph. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between perilymphatic signal changes on gradient-echo T2-weighted 3T MR sequence and the clinical symptoms.

Study Design

Retrospective case-control study.

Setting

The study was conducted at the Institute of Image-Guided Surgery in Strasbourg, France.

Methods

Patients with vestibular schwannoma who underwent magnetic resonance imaging at our institution between 2008 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. A control group consisted of individuals without past or present otological symptoms. The vestibular schwannomas were divided into three groups, based on the degree of internal auditory canal obstruction. The SI ratios of the vestibular cistern to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cochlea to CSF were compared with clinical data.

Results

We included 172 patients with vestibular schwannoma and 61 controls. Vestibular schwannoma was associated with a significant decrease of the SI ratio of the vestibular cistern to CSF (0.716 ± 0.297 vs 1.06 ± 0.21, P = 0.004) and cochlea to CSF (0.66 ± 0.199 vs 0.903 ± 0.011, P = 0.004) compared to controls, with significant negative correlation between both the SI ratios of the vestibular cistern and cochlea to CSF with tumor volume (P < .001). Among all the symptoms studied, the SI ratio of the cistern normalized by CSF was significantly associated with progressive hearing loss (P = 0.003).

Conclusion

Perilymphatic vestibular cistern and cochlear SI changes appear to be a promising noninvasive biomarker for hearing impairment in vestibular schwannoma.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for sickle cell disease: cardiopulmonary and kidney disease [^f08c6eec]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease — screening echocardiography (ECHO) for pulmonary hypertension (PH) in asymptomatic patients: In asymptomatic children and adults with SCD, the ASH guideline panel suggests against performing routine screening ECHO to identify PH (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯). The panel agreed that given the risk for cardiopulmonary disease in individuals with SCD, it is good practice to routinely take a targeted history for signs and symptoms that might indicate a need for further evaluation, including consideration for a diagnostic ECHO. Although the panel suggests no routine screening ECHO for asymptomatic patients with SCD, the following signs or symptoms may warrant a consultation with a PH expert or a diagnostic ECHO for patients who are otherwise in steady state to evaluate for PH: Dyspnea at rest or with exertion that is out of proportion to known condition, increased compared with baseline or unexplained; Hypoxemia at rest or with exertion that is out of proportion to known condition, increased compared with baseline or unexplained; Chest pain at rest or with exertion that is out of proportion to known condition, increased compared with baseline or unexplained; Increase in exercise limitation compared with baseline that is unexplained by other factors; History of recurrent hypoxemia at rest or with exertion; Evidence for sleep-disordered breathing with or without hypoxemia; Loud second heart sound or unexpected or new murmur on examination; Signs of heart failure and/or fluid overload on examination; and History of pulmonary embolism. A diagnostic ECHO should be considered for patients with SCD who also have comorbid conditions or disease complications known to be associated with PH when signs or symptoms of PH are present, and evaluation of 6MWD and/or NT-BNP may also be useful in individuals with SCD and suspected PH based on an abnormal ECHO (eg, elevated TRJV).

### FDA authorizes first over-the-counter hearing aid software… [^01b03d78]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

More than 30 million American adults report some degree of hearing loss. Hearing loss can be caused by aging, exposure to loud noises, certain medical conditions, and other factors. Hearing loss can have a negative effect on communication, relationships, school or work performance and emotional well-being. Using hearing aids has been linked to reductions in the frequency or severity of cognitive decline, depression and other health problems in older adults. The Hearing Aid Feature is a software-only mobile medical application that is intended to be used with compatible versions of the AirPods Pro. The HAF utilizes a self-fitting strategy, and users may adjust it to meet their hearing needs without the assistance of a hearing professional. The HAF is set up using an iOS device, and the user's hearing levels are accessed from the iOS HealthKit to customize the HAF. Users can refine the volume, tone and balance settings after setting up the HAF.

The HAF was evaluated in a clinical study with 118 subjects with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, at multiple U. S. sites. The results demonstrated that subjects who used the HAF self-fitting strategy achieved similar perceived benefit as subjects who received professional fitting of the same device. Results also showed comparable performance for tests measuring levels of amplification in the ear canal, as well as a measure of speech understanding in noise. No adverse events related to the device were observed in this study. This application was reviewed under the FDA's De Novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for some low- to moderate-risk devices that are novel and for which there is no prior legally marketed device. As part of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health's strategic priority to advance health equity, the Center will continue to support innovation that expands access to important technologies and brings health care directly to patients.

The FDA granted marketing authorization of the Hearing Aid Feature to Apple Inc. Related Information The FDA, an agency within the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

While not observed in controlled clinical studies with ISOVUE-M (Iopamidol Injection), the following adverse reactions may occur because they have been reported with ISOVUE-M and other nonionic water soluble contrast agents: cardiovascular (arrhythmias); pulmonary (apnea); bacterial meningitis, and aseptic meningitis syndrome; allergy or idiosyncrasy (chills, pruritus, nasal congestion, Guillain_Barre syndrome); CNS irritation (psycho-organic syndrome: mild and transitory perceptual aberrations such as depersonalization, anxiety, deppression, hyperreflexia or areflexia, hypertonia or flaccidity, restlessness, tremor, echoacousia, echolalia, asterixis or dysphasia have occurred). Profound mental disturbances have rarely been reported (various forms and degrees of aphasia, mental confusion or disorientation); the onset is usually at 8 to 10 hours and lasts for about 24 hours without aftereffects. However, occasionally they have been manifest as apprehension, agitation or progressive withdrawal to the point of stupor or coma. In a few cases, these have been accompanied by transitory hearing loss or other auditory symptoms and visual disturbances (believed subjective or delusional). Persistent cortical loss of vision in association with convulsions, and ventricular block have been reported. Rarely, persistent though transitory weakness in the leg or ocular muscles has been reported. Peripheral neuropathies have been rare and transitory. They include sensory and/or motor or nerve root disturbances, myelitis, persistent leg muscle pain or weakness, or sixth nerve palsy, or cauda equina syndrome. Muscle cramps, fasciculation or myoclonia, spinal convulsion, paralysis, or spasticity are unusual.

### Clinical practice guideline: age-related hearing loss [^4bbb8fdd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) — Key action statements for screening, evaluation, counseling, and follow-up: Clinicians should screen patients aged 50 years and older for hearing loss at the time of a health care encounter, and if screening suggests hearing loss, clinicians should examine the ear canal and tympanic membrane with otoscopy or refer for cerumen impaction, infection, or other abnormalities. If screening suggests hearing loss, clinicians should identify sociodemographic factors and patient preferences that influence access to and utilization of hearing health care. Clinicians should evaluate and treat or refer to a clinician who can evaluate and treat patients with significant asymmetric hearing loss, conductive or mixed hearing loss, or poor word recognition on diagnostic testing. Clinicians should educate and counsel patients with hearing loss and their family/care partner(s) about the impact of hearing loss on their communication, safety, function, cognition, and quality of life (QOL), and clinicians should counsel patients with hearing loss on communication strategies and assistive listening devices. For patients with hearing loss, clinicians should assess if communication goals have been met and if there has been improvement in hearing-related QOL at a subsequent health care encounter or within 1 year. As an option, clinicians should assess hearing at least every 3 years in patients with known hearing loss or with reported concern for changes in hearing.

### Evaluation and management of tinnitus: are there opportunities for improvement? [^a34d1f92]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review current information about diagnosis and management of tinnitus aiming to identify opportunities for achieving a cost-effective, efficient, evidence-based approach that meets the needs of tinnitus sufferers.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE.

Review Methods

In total, 249 relevant published reports were reviewed. Pertinent keywords and MeSH terms identified reports via PubMed and EMBASE. Acknowledged experts were consulted on ways to improve tinnitus management.

Conclusions

There may be opportunities to improve evaluation and management of patients with tinnitus using modern modes of communication and a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach.

Implications For Practice

Tinnitus can adversely affect quality of life while being time-consuming and costly to evaluate and manage. Based on both personal experience and the reports of others, patients with tinnitus who choose to see a physician primarily want to know two things: (1) that the tinnitus that is so distressing will not remain at the same level of severity forever and (2) that something can be done to help cope with the tinnitus that is so annoying. Recent advancements in internet communications, social media, information technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, holistic medical care, mind-body integrative health care, and multidisciplinary approaches in medical therapeutics may be possibly making new ways of meeting the needs of patients with tinnitus.

### Basic stimulus processing alterations from top-down cognitive control in depression drive independent temporal components of multi-echo naturalistic fMRI data [^60bedf69]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent mental disorder recognized as one of the leading global causes of disability. On a cognitive level, patients suffer from negative views of themselves, their environment, and their future (Beck's cognitive triad). Such negative cognitive distortions may be partially driven by a perceptual bias toward mood-congruent information. For instance, a negative bias in facial emotion recognition emerges during depressive episodes which can be reversed with antidepressant treatment. In addition, a growing body of evidence suggests deficits at the level of early sensory information processing including diminished visual contrast gain, reduced auditory pitch identification as well as impaired auditory change detection. Such low-level sensory processing deficits may ultimately contribute to the depressive-core symptom of anhedonia by hindering the generation of enjoyable (hedonic) experiences. Despite the identification of basic sensory deficits, the precise origin and nature of such impairments remains unclear. It is debated whether these arise from dysfunctions within the primary sensory cortices, altered sensory processing at lower levels, suggesting bottom-up deficits or alteration in higher-order processing areas, indicating top-down deficits. Moreover, conventional experimental approaches to studying perceptual deficits in MDD may not fully capture the complexities of real-world information processing by the brain processes, as they often lack the contextual depth and dynamic nature characteristic for real-life situations. To address this gap, naturalistic paradigms, such as videos and music, which encompass dynamic stimuli encountered in daily life, present a more realistic approximation of real-world stimuli. Thus, the investigation of alterations in responses to complex naturalistic settings in MDD may provide new insights about perceptual alterations in the disorder.
