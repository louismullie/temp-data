## Question

62 yr old female: hep B core AB reactive, hep B surface AG Nonreactive, hep B surf AB 96

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret hepatitis B serology in a 62-year-old woman with anti-HBc positive, HBsAg negative, and anti-HBs 96 mIU/mL, and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the serologic pattern and what it implies. Then, I should verify the quantitative anti-HBs threshold and whether this level indicates immunity. Next, I will consider alternative explanations like isolated anti-HBc or false positives. After that, I should review risk factors and clinical context that might change management. Finally, I will outline practical next steps, including when to order HBV DNA and how to counsel the patient, and I will double-check for any exceptions or special scenarios that warrant closer follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the serologic pattern. Anti-HBc positive with HBsAg negative and anti-HBs positive typically indicates resolved hepatitis B infection with natural immunity, not chronic infection, because HBsAg has cleared and neutralizing antibodies have appeared, whereas chronic infection would show persistent HBsAg positivity [^00cd38ab] [^6192b89a].

> Wait, let me verify the quantitative anti-HBs interpretation. A value of 96 mIU/mL is well above the 10 mIU/mL threshold considered seroprotective after vaccination or natural infection, so this supports durable immunity; importantly, anti-HBs and HBsAg are not detectable simultaneously in serum, reinforcing that HBsAg has cleared and the patient is not infectious [^70351727] [^0fa599aa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should consider isolated anti-HBc scenarios. Isolated anti-HBc (anti-HBc positive, HBsAg negative, anti-HBs negative) can reflect occult infection, false positivity, or the serologic window, but here anti-HBs is clearly positive, which makes isolated anti-HBc less likely and supports resolved infection with maintained surface antibody [^9d05df38] [^08b73689].

> I need to check for potential false positives or passive antibody transfer. False-positive anti-HBc can occur, albeit rarely, and passive transfer from IVIG or other immunoglobulin products can transiently yield positive anti-HBc; if there is a history of recent IVIG, I should repeat serology after the biologic half-life has elapsed to avoid misclassification, but in the absence of such exposures, the pattern remains most consistent with resolved infection [^89d89e5f] [^da804636].

> Next, I should review clinical context and risk factors. In a 62-year-old, prior exposure is plausible, and without immunosuppression, malignancy, or planned cytotoxic therapy, the risk of HBV reactivation is low; however, if immunosuppressive therapy is planned or if the patient is immunocompromised, I should confirm with HBV DNA and consider prophylaxis per reactivation risk guidelines, even though the baseline risk here is low [^53e2cc2e] [^49211ca4].

> Let me think about what to do next. I should confirm that no additional testing is routinely needed in an immunocompetent person with this pattern; no HBV DNA is indicated unless there are risk factors for reactivation or atypical features. I should document immunity and counsel that she is not infectious and does not need vaccination, while advising standard infection precautions if exposed to high-risk situations in the future [^0fa599aa] [^6192b89a].

> But wait, what if the patient is about to start immunosuppression or has unexplained liver test abnormalities? In those scenarios, I should double-check with HBV DNA because occult infection can rarely persist and reactivate with immunosuppression; otherwise, routine follow-up is unnecessary, and I should simply reassure the patient that she has protective immunity from a prior resolved hepatitis B infection [^53e2cc2e] [^9d05df38].

The patient has **resolved hepatitis B** with natural immunity: anti-HBc indicates prior infection, HBsAg is negative (no active infection), and anti-HBs 96 mIU/mL confirms protective immunity [^0fa599aa] [^6192b89a]. No treatment is needed, but **monitor if immunosuppression is planned** because reactivation can occur [^53e2cc2e]. No isolation or special precautions are required, and the patient is not infectious [^b405f80a].

---

## Interpretation of serological results

| **Marker** | **Result** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) | Reactive | Prior HBV infection |
| Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) | Nonreactive | No active HBV infection |
| Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) | 96 mIU/mL | Protective immunity |

---

This pattern — anti-HBc positive, HBsAg negative, and anti-HBs positive — is consistent with **resolved hepatitis B infection** with natural immunity [^0fa599aa]. The patient has cleared the virus and has protective antibodies against future infection [^6192b89a].

---

## Clinical significance and implications

- **Immunity**: The patient is immune to HBV due to natural infection and does not require vaccination [^0fa599aa].
- **Non-infectious**: The patient is not infectious and poses no risk of transmitting HBV to others [^b405f80a].
- **No treatment**: No antiviral therapy is indicated, as there is no active infection [^35981082].

---

## Recommended follow-up and monitoring

Routine follow-up is not required for resolved HBV infection; however, **periodic monitoring** may be considered in the following scenarios:

- **Immunosuppression**: If the patient is undergoing or planning immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, corticosteroids, biologics), monitor HBV DNA and liver enzymes due to reactivation risk [^53e2cc2e] [^49211ca4].
- **Liver disease**: If the patient has underlying liver disease or abnormal liver function tests, periodic liver function monitoring may be appropriate [^9f8e2324].

---

## Precautions and lifestyle considerations

Standard hygiene and infection control measures are sufficient; **no special precautions** are necessary. The patient should maintain general liver health (limit alcohol, avoid hepatotoxins, and maintain a healthy weight) and discuss any planned immunosuppressive therapy with her healthcare provider to assess reactivation risk [^53e2cc2e].

---

## Summary and recommendations

- **Status**: Resolved hepatitis B infection with natural immunity.
- **Immunity**: Protective anti-HBs level of 96 mIU/mL.
- **Infectiousness**: Non-infectious.
- **Treatment**: Not indicated.
- **Follow-up**: Routine follow-up not required; monitor if immunosuppression is planned or if liver disease is present [^53e2cc2e] [^9f8e2324].

---

The patient has resolved hepatitis B with protective immunity; **no treatment is needed**, and she is not infectious. Consider monitoring only if immunosuppression is planned or if liver disease is present.

What is the Transmission Route of HBV?

Today, we know that HBVs are highly infectious and are spread by exposure of mucosal membranes or nonintact skin to infected blood or other body fluids (saliva, semen, and vaginal fluid). In high endemic areas, HBV is most commonly transmitted from mother to child at birth (perinatal transmission) and during early childhood from infected to uninfected children (horizontal transmission). Most HBV infections in areas of low endemicity occur in adults in relatively well-defined risk groups, such as those at risk through sexual exposure, household members of an infected person, hemodialysis patients, incarcerated persons, injection-drug users, persons at risk for occupational exposure, developmentally disabled persons in long-term care facilities, and travelers to regions with moderate or high HBV endemicity. Today, only humans are a known reservoir for human HBV genotypes, but closely related HBV genotypes exist in higher primates [23]. Hence, a comprehensive control strategy could eventually lead to the eradication of HBV.

How is Hepatitis B Diagnosed?

Because clinical manifestations of hepatitis B are indistinguishable from other causes of viral hepatitis, a definitive diagnosis requires serological testing [24]. This testing uses different (combinations of) serologic markers to identify different phases of HBV infection and to conclude whether a person has acute or chronic HBV infection, or is immune to HBV as a result of prior HBV infection or vaccination, or is susceptible to infection. In Table 1 an interpretation of hepatitis B serologic test results is given.

Table 1.
Interpretation of Serologic Test Results for Hepatitis B

Chronic infection is arbitrarily defined by the persistence of HBsAg (with or without concurrent HBeAg) in serum for at least 6 months. Anti-HBs are neutralizing antibodies and their presence in serum confers long-term immunity against HBV infection. In persons with acquired immunity through vaccination, anti-HBs is the only serological marker detected. In contrast to persons with a past HBV infection where anti-HBs are present concurrently with anti-HBc IgG.

During the initial, highly replicative phase of HBV infection patients are also seropositive for HBeAg, of whom some remain HBeAg positive for years. All HBsAg-positive persons should be considered infectious; however, the presence of HBeAg indicates that the blood and body fluids of the infected individual are highly contagious (ie, HBV DNA levels of 10⁷ to 10⁹ IU/mL). Although HBsAg has been detected in multiple body fluids, only serum, saliva, semen, and vaginal fluid have been demonstrated to be infectious [25].

Interpretation of HBV serologies — test combinations map to infection status and assay caveats: For chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection the pattern across HBsAg, anti–hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), and anti–hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) is "Chronic HBV infection + + −"; for past HBV infection, patterns are "Resolved − + +" and "Isolated core − + −". The legend clarifies "(+) refers to a reactive (or positive) test result; (−) refers to a nonreactive (or negative) test result". Testing guidance specifies "Anti-HBc should be total immunoglobulin (Ig) or IgG test (not IgM, which if positive would indicate acute HBV infection)", and assay performance/caveat notes "Although the sensitivity and specificity of the anti-HBc test exceeds 99%, positive anti-HBc test results may, in rare cases, indicate a false-positive result (eg, after administration of intravenous Ig). As such, clinical assessment and evaluation may be warranted".

Diagnosis

Diagnosis of acute or chronic HBV infection requires serologic testing (Table 5). Because HBsAg is present in both acute and chronic infection, presence of IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) is diagnostic of acute or recently acquired HBV infection. Antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is produced after a resolved infection and is the only HBV antibody marker present after vaccination. The presence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, with a negative test for IgM anti-HBc, indicates chronic HBV infection. The presence of total anti-HBc alone might indicate acute, resolved, or chronic infection or a false-positive result.

§ Persons positive for only anti-HBc are unlikely to be infectious, except under unusual circumstances involving direct percutaneous exposure to large quantities of blood (e.g. blood transfusion or organ transplantation) or mutant HBsAg-related infection.

Treatment

No specific therapy is available for persons with acute HBV infection; treatment is supportive. Persons with chronic HBV infection should be referred for evaluation to a provider experienced in managing such infections. Therapeutic agents approved by FDA for treatment of chronic HBV infection can achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease.

Interpretation of Serologic Markers

Serologic markers for HBV infection include HBsAg, antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), immunoglobulin class M (IgM) antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc), and immunoglobulin class G (IgG) anti-HBc (IgG anti-HBc). At least one serologic marker is present during the different phases of infection. HBV DNA is a measure of viral load and reflects viral replication (Table 1). Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) can be detected in persons with acute or chronic HBV infection; the presence of HBeAg correlates with viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) correlates with the loss of replicating virus, although reversion to HBeAg positivity can occur.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, care and treatment for people with chronic hepatitis B infection [^08183385]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to serologic testing, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain a serological assay, either rapid diagnostic test or laboratory-based immunoassay, meeting minimum quality, safety and performance standards (with regard to both analytical and clinical sensitivity and specificity) to detect HBsAg for the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B in adult, adolescent, and pediatric (aged > 12 months) patients. Obtain laboratory-based immunoassays as the preferred assay format in settings where existing laboratory testing is already available and accessible. Obtain rapid diagnostic tests to improve access in settings where there is limited access to laboratory testing and/or in populations where access to rapid testing would facilitate linkage to care and treatment.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^9f8e2324]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

HBV screening tests — test selection and confirmation: "Screening for hepatitis B should be performed with HBsAg testing to detect the presence of HBV infection". "Serologic testing for HBsAg should be followed by a confirmatory test for initially reactive results". A positive result indicates infection, and serologic panels can guide diagnosis and management.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^fdeaf458]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

Screening pregnant persons

HBV screening for all pregnant persons during each pregnancy, preferably in the first trimester, regardless of vaccination status or history of testing *
Pregnant persons with a history of appropriately timed triple panel screening and without subsequent risk for exposure to HBV (i.e. no new HBV exposures since triple panel screening) only need HBsAg screening

Risk-based testing

Testing for all persons with a history of increased risk for HBV infection, regardless of age, if they might have been susceptible during the period of increased risk †
Periodic testing for susceptible persons, regardless of age, with ongoing risk for exposures, while risk for exposures persists †

† Susceptible persons include those who have never been infected with HBV (i.e. total anti-HBc negative) and either did not complete a HepB vaccine series per Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations or who are known to be vaccine nonresponders.

Interpretation of Screening Tests

The three main serologic markers used to determine HBV infection status are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) (Table 1). Serologic markers change over typical courses of resolved acute infection and progression to chronic infection (Figure 1).

### Screening for hepatitis B virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^bb650886]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF supporting evidence and scope — the recommendation is consistent with the 2014 recommendation and is strengthened by trials and cohort studies reporting that antiviral therapy reduces risk of mortality and hepatocellular carcinoma and improves intermediate outcomes; the USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review on screening for HBV infection in persons at increased risk, examined new randomized clinical trials and cohort studies published from 2014 to August 2019 assessing benefits and harms of screening and antiviral therapy and links between intermediate and health outcomes, added key questions on the yield of alternative screening strategies and the accuracy of tools to identify persons at increased risk, and previously found serologic testing with HBsAg to be accurate.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to serologic testing, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider confirming HBsAg positivity on the same immunoassay with a neutralization step or a second different rapid diagnostic test assay for the detection of HBsAg in settings or populations with a low HBsAg seroprevalence of < 0.4%.

### Hepatitis B [^08b73689]. IDSA (2009). Medium credibility.

Isolated anti‑HBc interpretation — Some persons may test positive for anti‑HBc but not HBsAg or anti‑HBs, and isolated anti‑HBc can reflect different states: it may indicate chronic HBV infection with undetectable HBsAg but detectable HBV DNA (more so in the liver than in serum), it may be a marker of immunity after recovery with an anamnestic response after one dose of HBV vaccine, it may be a false‑positive particularly in low‑prevalence persons with no risk factors, or it may be the only marker during the window phase of acute hepatitis B where anti‑HBc IgM should be positive.

### Determination of hepatitis B phenotype using biochemical and serological markers [^1e69c838]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the validity of categorization of chronic hepatitis B viral infection into stages or phases based upon measures of disease activity and viral load, assuming these phenotypes will be useful for prognostication and determining the need for antiviral therapy. We assessed the phenotype of hepatitis B of 1,390 adult participants enrolled in the Hepatitis B Research Network Cohort Study, using a computer algorithm. Only 4% were immune tolerant, while 35% had chronic hepatitis B (18% e antigen positive and 17% e antigen negative) while 23% were inactive carriers. Strikingly, 38% of participants did not fit clearly into any one of these groups and were considered indeterminant. The largest subset of indeterminants had elevated serum aminotransferases with low levels of HBV DNA (less than 10,000 iu/mL). Subsequent determination of hepatitis B phenotype on the next available laboratory tests showed that 64% remained indeterminant. These findings call into question the validity of conventional staging of hepatitis B, in large part because of the substantial proportion of patients who do not fit readily into one of the usual stages or phases. Further studies are needed of the indeterminant category of chronic hepatitis B viral infection, including assessments of whether patients in this group are perhaps in transition to another phase or if they are a distinct phenotype with a need to assess liver disease severity and need for antiviral therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^540f2929]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) evaluation in the setting of abnormal aminotransferases specifies when to test, core screening markers, and follow-up. Testing for hepatitis B should be performed in all patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT levels. Chronic hepatitis B infects ~1.5 million Americans and over 280 million individuals world-wide. Hepatitis B screening involves testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the hepatitis B core antibody total, and the hepatitis B surface antibody, which together indicate infection, prior exposure, or immunity (natural or vaccine-mediated). Chronic infection is confirmed by presence of the HBsAg and/or positive virion on a highly sensitive HBV DNA assay. Individuals confirmed to have chronic hepatitis B should be referred to physicians with expertise for further characterization and staging, including assessment of HBeAg, HBeAb and HBV DNA, and the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B is made by a positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) hepatitis B core antibody and HBsAg in the setting of an acute hepatitis.

### Monitoring the patient response as an alternative to commercial negative quality control in infectious serology [^8f39fe43]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Traditional internal quality control schemes for qualitative infectious serology mostly rely on the use of commercial positive and negative quality control materials. However, with respect to the negative control, target values provided by the manufacturer are often poorly defined and non-commutability of the commercial materials further complicates correct interpretation of control results. An alternative quality control procedure using the median patient seronegative response is presented.

Study Design

Daily patient median responses were calculated for our Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis B core antibody, Hepatitis C antibody and HIV antigen/antibody test systems. Because of the low prevalence of these viruses in our area, most patient responses are negative. A minimum of 5 patient samples per day was required to generate a stable daily median. Control limits were calculated and daily patient medians were plotted against commercial quality control results.

Results

Commercial negative controls and daily patient medians mostly behaved in the same way. Nevertheless, for the Hepatitis B surface antigen test, patient medians frequently exceeded the calculated control limit in contrast to commercial quality controls. This confirms that target ranges provided by the manufacturer are not always adequate. Moreover, an important matrix-related interference occurred on our HIV antigen/antibody test system and correct interpretation was only possible using daily patient median results.

Conclusion

Monitoring the daily patient median response can be a valuable alternative to traditional commercial negative quality control. It's easy to perform, cost-free, provides additional information with respect to matrix effects and allows for the establishment of well-defined control limits.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to monitoring of treatment response, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain HBV DNA nucleic acid testing (quantitative or qualitative) directly following a positive HBsAg serological test result as the preferred strategy to assess viral load level for monitoring treatment response.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) post-vaccination immunity interpretation — Detection of HBs antibody without HBc total antibodies distinguishes vaccine-derived immunity from natural infection, and commercially available assays report qualitative HBs antibody positivity when levels are ≥ 10 mIU/mL (or ≥ 10 IU/L) in serum or plasma, indicating a protective antibody level; quantitative HBs antibody results are used to monitor hepatitis B immune globulin therapy and immunization of nonresponders.

### Viral hepatitis in pregnancy: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 6 [^21e327b4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) serology — marker dynamics and diagnostic windows are described as follows: anti-HBs and HBsAg do not co-exist detectably in serum, and anti-HBs is seen only after HBsAg has been cleared. The chronic carrier state usually can be predicted by HBsAg seropositivity for more than 20 weeks. During a serologic window, hepatitis B core IgG antibody (anti-HBc) appears 3–5 weeks after HBsAg. IgM anti-HBc appears during acute or after recent hepatitis B virus infection and is present for approximately 6 months. In contrast, vaccinated individuals will have only anti-HBs detectable in serum and not HBsAg or anti-HBc, and hepatitis B core antigen is not detectable outside of research laboratory assays, and tests for it should not be ordered clinically.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^00cd38ab]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

HBV/HIV screening and immunization in HCV — Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an FDA-approved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) assay and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with an FDA-approved HIV-antigen/antibody test is recommended; persons who test positive for HBsAg require additional monitoring during HCV treatment due to HBV reactivation risk, and anti-HBV therapy is another consideration for these patients. For persons who test negative for HBsAg but positive for hepatitis B core antibodies (with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies) have resolved HBV infection, and no further workup or additional monitoring is needed. Primary prevention measures for persons without coinfection include counseling about how to avoid contracting HIV and HBV and immunization against HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) as needed, and the CDC also recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all persons with chronic liver disease.

AGA hepatitis B virus reactivation guideline — recommendation 4 (testing): For individuals at risk of HBV, the AGA recommends testing for hepatitis B, aligning with universal CDC screening guidance for all adults aged ≥ 18 years by testing for HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc, and it is reasonable to test initially for serologic markers alone (at minimum for HBsAg, anti-HBc) followed by viral load testing (HBV-DNA) if HBsAg and/or anti-HBc is positive.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection — serologic diagnosis relies on specific marker patterns. Diagnosis of acute or chronic HBV infection requires serologic testing. Because HBsAg is present in both acute and chronic infection, presence of IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) is diagnostic of acute or recently acquired HBV infection, and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is produced after a resolved infection and is the only HBV antibody marker present after vaccination. The presence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, with a negative test for IgM anti-HBc, indicates chronic HBV infection, and total anti-HBc alone might indicate acute, resolved, or chronic infection or a false-positive result.

### New and old biomarkers for diagnosis and management of chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^7c6a9c10]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Tests to detect the presence and activity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are the cornerstones of diagnosis and management. Assays that detect or measure serum levels of HB surface antigen, HB surface antibody, and HB core antibody are used to identify patients with exposure to HBV, whereas other tests provide information on the level of virus replication, presence of specific variants, and presence of virus reservoirs. Newer diagnostic tests, used only in research settings so far, aim to quantify levels of intrahepatic HBV replication. Other tests have been developed to detect HBV infection in resource-limited settings. We review point-of-care tests (essential in global screening efforts), standard diagnostic tests used in routine clinical management, and newer tests that might be used in clinical trials of agents designed to cure HBV infection.

### Challenge of hepatitis B testing following intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in patients with autoimmune skin diseases [^5c3e5028]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) contains pooled immunoglobulins from the plasma of healthy blood donors. All plasma samples are tested for HIV, hepatitis viruses (A, B, and C), and parvovirus B19. As part of this screening step, nucleic acid amplification technology (NAT) is used and allows the presence of specific antibodies targeting viral structures that are commonly used to test for infection status, such as anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs) or anti-hepatitis B virus core (HBc) antibodies. For this reason, manufacturers point to the possibility of false-positive viral serological test results following IVIg treatment due to the passive transfer of antibodies. IVIg therapy is commonly used to manage patients with severe, treatment-refractory autoimmune skin diseases. The aim of this cohort study was to retrospectively quantify newly-discovered positive serological HBV test results after IVIg treatment in patients with autoimmune skin diseases. Between March 2018 and June 2021, 28 patients with autoimmune skin diseases received IVIg therapy, of whom 17 were longitudinally followed-up. None of the patients had evidence of active HBV infection prior to IVIg therapy. All patients (n = 17) had detectable anti-HBs antibodies and 12 patients had anti-HBc antibodies 4weeks after commencing IVIg treatment. Passive antibody transfer seems the most likely interpretation. Nevertheless, complete serological hepatitis assessment should be performed to exclude a new infection. We recommend hepatitis screening before IVIg therapy to prevent diagnostic confusion which may arise due to passive antibody transfer.

### Hepatitis B virus screening and management for patients with cancer prior to therapy: ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [^da804636]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and anti-HBc test interpretation in oncology: IVIG can produce passive transfer of anti-HBc leading to false-positive anti-HBc test results; in a single-institution retrospective study during 2004–2011, the rate of passive transfer after IVIG was 15%, and the probability of positive anti-HBc decreased with time after IVIG, so anti-HBc testing after IVIG should be interpreted with caution, and universal HBV screening before initiation of IVIG would mostly obviate this diagnostic challenge.

### Infectious complications with the use of biologic response modifiers in infants and children [^77bfd365]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management before biologic response modifier (BRM) therapy — when the hepatitis B surface antibody titer is low (< 10 mIU/mL), strong consideration should be given to giving a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine before initiation of treatment, and recent Immune Globulin Intravenous (IGIV) may be associated with a transiently positive serologic test result. Patients who have acute HBV infection (HBsAg positive, total HBcAb positive, hepatitis B core IgM positive, and elevated LFTs) should not receive a BRM. Patients who show evidence of chronic HBV infection (HBsAg positive, HBcAb positive, hepatitis B core IgM negative, and persistently or intermittently high LFT results) should be evaluated by either an infectious diseases specialist or a hepatologist for further testing to determine their status, and this testing will likely involve measuring HBV DNA levels. In general, chronic carriers with a high viral load (HBV DNA > 10⁵ copies per mL) and abnormal LFTs will need to be treated with antiviral agents effective against HBV, but guidance by an infectious diseases specialist or hepatologist is strongly recommended. Patients who are HBsAg negative, HBsAb positive, and HBcAb positive are considered to have resolved HBV infection and can likely be treated with close monitoring by an infectious diseases expert or hepatologist; in this scenario, it is advisable to first obtain a baseline HBV DNA quantitative level as well as LFTs that can be monitored in follow-up. Some patients will only be positive for HBcAb and are generally considered to have occult HBV; some of these patients may also have a false-positive test result or may have resolving infection, and they may or may not be at risk of HBV reactivation; most can be treated with the BRM under the guidance of an infectious diseases expert or a hepatologist.

Persons with HCV Infection or a Past HCV Infection

The systematic review found 8,295 articles for review; after title review, 1,233 potentially relevant articles remained. After review of articles meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 articles were included (Supplementary Table 12). In 10 U.S. studies, the prevalence of current HBV infection (on the basis of HBsAg positivity, HBV DNA positivity, or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes) among persons with HCV infection ranged from 0.2% to 5.8% (median = 1.2%). Among persons with HCV infection, the prevalence of ever being exposed to HBV ranged from 24.7% to 62.6% (median = 43.0%); this finding was based on anti-HBc positivity, regardless of other HBV test results. Isolated anti-HBc positivity ranged from 36.9% to 53.8% (median = 39.5%) among patients with HCV infection.

HBV Reactivation During Direct-Acting Antiviral Therapy for HCV

FDA requires a boxed warning about the risk for HBV reactivation to be added to drug labels of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) medication for HCV infection. The boxed warning directs health care professionals to screen and monitor for HBV infection in all patients receiving DAA treatment.

In a published systematic review of HBV reactivation during DAA therapy among patients with HCV infection, the overall risk for HBV reactivation was 24% (95% CI = 19%–30%) in patients with untreated chronic HBV infection and 1.4% (95% CI = 0.8%–2.4%) in patients with resolved HBV infection. The risk for HBV reactivation–related hepatitis (i.e. symptomatic) was 9% (95% CI = 5%–16%) in patients with chronic HBV infection; HBV reactivation–related hepatitis did not occur in patients with resolved infection. Three of 1,621 patients with chronic HBV infection had a major clinical event related to the reactivation (liver decompensation or failure), but there were no deaths.

Four studies were published after the 2018 systematic review. In two national cohort studies of U.S. veterans with chronic HCV infection prescribed DAA therapy, HBV reactivation was rare (< 0.1%) and more frequent among patients who were HBsAg positive. Similarly, two other U.S.-based cohort studies of patients with HCV coinfected with HBV did not detect any cases of DAA-associated HBV reactivation.

Risk-based management recommends, for High Risk, "Recommend antiviral prophylaxis over monitoring alone (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence)"; for Moderate Risk, "Suggest antiviral prophylaxis over monitoring alone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence)"; and for Low Risk, "Suggest monitoring alone over using antiviral prophylaxis (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence)". Glucocorticoid dosing definitions are "Glucocorticoids (prednisone or equivalent): low dose, < 10 mg; moderate dose, 10–20 mg; high dose, > 20 mg". Notes specify that "Antiviral prophylaxis should be started before the start of risk-imposing therapy and continued for at least 6 months after discontinuation of risk-imposing agents (at least 12 months for B cell-depleting agents)", that "Using anti-HBs status to guide antiviral prophylaxis for all-risk groups is not supported by the evidence", and that "The risk for HBV reactivation refers to the duration of the risk-imposing state or up to one year, unless otherwise noted; longer-term risk has higher uncertainty".

### Need for confirmatory neutralization tests for hepatitis B surface antigen tests in populations with intermediate prevalence [^b74ab90b]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is known as the hallmark of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. This study aimed to determine whether an HBsAg neutralization test is necessary to accurately interpret HBsAg test results.

Methods

Initially reactive HBsAg specimens from a 5-year period, with cutoff index values between 1.0 and 2.0, were subjected to neutralization confirmatory testing using an Elecsys HBsAg Confirmatory test kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH. Mannheim, Germany).

Results

The neutralization test showed 46.1% positive (confirmed positive group) and 53.9% negative (confirmed negative group) results from the total specimens. Among the confirmed negative group, 79.5% of patients were confirmed to be negative for the current infection, whereas 4 patients in the chronic hepatitis B subgroup showed a neutralization percentage close to 40%. More than half of patients in the confirmed positive group were considered to be in the hepatitis B e antigen-negative inactive HBsAg carrier phase.

Conclusion

In populations with intermediate HBV prevalence, a neutralization test is necessary to confirm an HBsAg result and reduce the false positive and false negative rates of initial HBsAg tests.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^0fa599aa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Hepatitis B — serologic dynamics, window period, and chronic infection markers: In acute infection, HBsAg appearance predates clinical symptoms by 4 weeks and remains detectable for 1–6 weeks; HBs antibody indicates recovery and immunity, and in most self-limited acute infections HBsAg and HBs antibody are not detectable simultaneously in serum or plasma. HBc IgM antibody appears during acute or recent infection and remains detectable for about six months, with a serologic "window" from 6 to 8 months after infection when HBsAg disappears and HBs antibody becomes undetectable, during which infection can be diagnosed by detecting HBc IgM. HBc total antibodies appear at symptom onset and persist for life. A chronic hepatitis B carrier state is defined by persistence of HBsAg for at least 6 months; in chronic hepatitis B, HBeAg in serum or plasma is a marker of high viral replication, and loss of HBeAg with emergence of HBe antibody is usually associated with improvement of underlying hepatitis and reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis; disappearance of HBeAg may denote a precore mutant virus when high HBsAg and HBV DNA are present with HBe antibody. HBV DNA is present in serum or plasma in acute and chronic infection, and quantification of HBV DNA in serum or plasma may be included in the initial evaluation and management of chronic hepatitis B infection, especially when serologic results are inconclusive or when deciding treatment initiation and monitoring patient's response; other molecular tests include viral genotype, genotypic drug resistance mutations, and core promoter/precore mutations.

### Revisiting cytomegalovirus serology in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients [^1c6846fa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

To further validate our approach, we compared those patients with all CMV R− in this cohort, considered as a "gold standard" group. Both groups had a similar number of plasma CMV DNAemia tests performed during the study follow-up period. CMV DNAemia rates between the CMV R− reclassification and CMV R− groups were similar, suggesting that patients in the former group present a behavior analogous to the CMV R− "true-negative" patients. CMV DNAemia in this group could be attributed to either a CMV D+ status (at least in 2 of 3 cases) or potentially false-negative pretransplant CMV serology results. Notably, more patients in the CMV R− group were likely to have an underlying diagnosis of lymphoma, admittedly less frequently transfused than patients with myeloid hematologic malignancies. Furthermore, patients with lymphoma and other hematologic malignancies could have impaired humoral immune responses as a result of their malignancy and associated administered treatments. It is also possible that some of those CMV R− patients were "false-negative" due to chemotherapy-induced antibody loss. This observation further emphasizes the importance of baseline CMV serology at the time of hematologic malignancy diagnosis. Similar observations can be made in the interpretation of other serology tests in the same context. For instance, we have described in the same cohort of patients the reclassification of positive Toxoplasma gondii, hepatitis virus A and/or B serology in 22 of 292 (7.5%) and 38 of 292 (13%), respectively (V Portillo, et al, manuscript submitted, under review). The above suggests that careful review of serology titers pretransplant and comparison, if and when feasible, with values at the time of hematologic malignancy diagnosis may allow for correct classification of patients' serology status.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^6f21f19e]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV — Interpretation of blood tests notes that the HCV antibody test may be negative during the first 6 weeks after exposure, seroconversion may be delayed or absent in immunosuppressed individuals, and presence of HCV antibody alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; HCV RNA may be transiently negative during acute HCV infection and presence of HCV RNA alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; and ALT findings include that fluctuating ALT peaks suggest acute infection, ALT may be normal during acute HCV infection, and ALT may be elevated due to other liver insults, such as alcohol consumption. If HCV antibody is positive but HCV RNA is undetectable, repeat HCV-RNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) testing is recommended to identify acute reinfection. Acute infection should be suspected if there is a rise in the ALT level without an alternative cause and also when there are low (especially < 10⁴ IU/mL) or fluctuating (> 1 log10 IU/mL) HCV-RNA levels or spontaneous clearance during follow-up.

Table 2
Detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) mutants by 4 commercial assays

Case reports of false-negative diagnostic results due to HBsAg mutants have been described in blood bank and hospital settings. The blood bank sample is of special importance since this patient sample (containing a Thr/Leu 143 mutant) was reported as HBsAg positive by 1 screening immunoassay, while a second screening immunoassay reported the same sample as false-negative. The Thr/Leu 143 mutant may be more prevalent than originally thought, as another occurrence has been recently reported in Europe. Screening efforts should be undertaken to establish the prevalence of this apparently emerging mutant and to establish its mechanism of selection.

In most cases, investigators reporting false-negative results due to HBsAg mutants recommend that laboratory users of HBsAg assays be aware of a given assay's ability to detect mutants. An expert advisory meeting has recently issued a consensus report on emerging HBsAg mutants. The meeting participants concluded that the prevalence of HBsAg mutants is probably higher than previously believed. The participants called for enhanced surveillance efforts and data collection for mutants and recommended using assays that detect the most frequently observed mutants at aa positions 139–145. In addition, users should develop an appropriate testing and confirmatory algorithm to ensure mutant detection. The prevalence of HBsAg mutants can be established in laboratories that perform sequential testing of a sample using 2 assays, each with differing susceptibility to mutant false-negative results. Discordant positive samples would be PCR amplified and sequenced to determine if a mutant sequence is present. In a study in Singapore, the Gly/Arg 145 mutation was present alone or in combination with other mutations in 70% of the isolated HBsAg mutants from neonatal breakthrough infections, for an overall mutant prevalence of 4.6% in this population. A screening program for school-age children in Taiwan found 27/3,849 patient samples with "a" determinant mutants for a prevalence of 0.7%. In India, testing of an HBV chronic carrier's household contacts found what might be the first documented case of Gly/Arg 145 horizontal transmission. Therefore, the Gly/Arg 145 mutant occurs at a significant rate in some populations and appears to be horizontally transmissible, which suggests that HBV surveillance programs should use diagnostic methods capable of detecting this mutant.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of hepatitis Delta: commentary [^0db2db12]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Testing uptake in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) cohorts — Only 1.6% of the 2075 individuals positive for anti-HDV had follow-up testing with HDV RNA. Among 91 patients with CHB who had testing for anti-HDV Ab ordered, only 70 (76.9%) completed testing, among whom only 2 completed follow-up HDV RNA, with 1 confirmed active HDV infection. A multicenter US-based study of 1112 HBsAg-positive patients observed only 58.0% completed anti-HDV testing, and among those with positive anti-HDV, only 6 of 9 completed follow-up HDV RNA testing. These existing data series raise concerns about gaps in HDV testing and hence delays in timely diagnosis and treatment.

### Unrecognized hepatitis B in pre-screened children with hematologic and oncologic conditions [^ba1d988c]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This study evaluates the effectiveness and interpretation of hepatitis B (HBV) screening in an at-risk cohort of children with cancer or blood disorders.

Procedure

We conducted a retrospective epidemiologic analysis of children who screened positive for HBV (HBsAg, HbcAb) from 1999 to 2009 at a quaternary children's hospital, focusing on patients with hematologic and oncologic conditions. Descriptive statistics were generated for demographics and serologies. Follow-up of positive serologies and clinical outcomes were analyzed.

Results

A total of 12,754 children were screened for HBV. Of 391 that screened positive, 118 had a hematologic or oncologic diagnosis. Leukemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia comprised 84% of diagnoses. The majority (98%) tested HBcAb positive but only 20% received confirmatory HBV DNA testing. Three patients (13% of those HBV DNA tested) were identified to have chronic disease. HBV was not a known pre-existing condition, and chemotherapy preceded HBV diagnosis in all cases.

Conclusions

The majority of children with cancer or blood disorders who screened HBV positive did not receive follow-up DNA testing, exposing them to reactivation risk and delaying definitive therapy. HBcAb may be the only indicator of chronic HBV infection and DNA confirmation should be routine. Our findings suggest a significant number of additional patients eligible for HBV treatment may have been identified with reflexive DNA testing.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^6192b89a]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

HBsAg: The presence of HBsAg indicates HBV infection, either acute or chronic, except when it might be transiently positive shortly after a dose of HepB vaccine. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) defines chronic infection as the presence of HBsAg for at least 6 months.
Anti-HBs: The appearance of anti-HBs after a decline of HBsAg indicates recovery from HBV infection. Among immunocompetent persons never infected with HBV, anti-HBs at concentrations of ≥ 10 mIU/mL at 1–2 months after completion of a HepB vaccine series indicates immunity. Although certain persons might have anti-HBs of ≥ 10 mIU/mL after partial vaccination, whether this confers long-term protection is unknown. Among vaccine responders who completed a vaccine series, anti-HBs can decline over time to levels of < 10 mIU/mL; however, the majority are still immune and will mount an immune response to a vaccine challenge ≥ 35 years after vaccination. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) can provide anti-HBs for 4–6 months after administration; therefore, testing for anti-HBs ≤ 6 months after HBIG administration is not an accurate measure of a person's immune status.
Total anti-HBc: Total anti-HBc develops in all HBV infections, resolved or current, and typically persists for life. Persons whose immunity to HBV is from a vaccine do not develop anti-HBc. Assays for total anti-HBc detect both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to HBcAg; no test for IgG anti-HBc alone is commercially available. During the typical course of chronic infection, total anti-HBc and HBsAg will be present, whereas IgM anti-HBc will disappear (Figure 1). IgM anti-HBc should be ordered only when acute HBV infection is a concern.
Other markers (HBV DNA, HBeAg, and anti-HBe): HBV DNA is a measure of viral load. HBeAg is a marker for viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) can be used to monitor response to treatment and chronic HBV infection progression. After identifying a person with HBV infection, testing for HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA can provide information on the level of viral replication and infectivity and help guide clinical management.

Background information on HBV, including virus description, transmission, clinical features, natural history, and HepB vaccination seroprotection and coverage, is available (Supplementary Appendix 1).

### Infectious complications with the use of biologic response modifiers in infants and children [^89d4ea90]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B screening and vaccination before BRM therapy — comprehensive serology and immunization planning are advised. Patients being considered for BRM therapy should be screened for past hepatitis B infection with both immunization records and serologic testing for HBsAg, HbcAb (total and IgM), and quantitative HBsAb, and it is advisable to obtain baseline liver function tests at the same time. Patients who are negative for HBsAg, HBcAb, and HBsAb are considered uninfected and nonimmune and should receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at least 2 weeks before initiation of the BRM; whether to give the full series before BRM should be decided with the initiating specialist, weighing potential delay. Patients who are only HBsAb positive are likely immune and can be safely treated with BRMs.

Hepatitis B vaccination after HSCT — dose series, immunogenicity, monitoring, and reactivation risk are described as follows: Vaccination with three or four doses of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine is recommended between 6 and 12 months after HSCT, with seroconversion rates in the first year ranging from 64% to 100% and lower among older individuals and those with GVHD. Reactivation after post-transplant immunization in recipients with resolved hepatitis B infection can occur irrespective of anti–hepatitis B surface antibody levels and with a cumulative 3-year risk of 2%. Clinical interpretation states hepatitis B surface antibody titers should be routinely checked 6 months post-immunization, especially for those vaccinated within 12 months of transplant, and that a three-dose series should be repeated for levels below the protective threshold (hepatitis B surface antibody < 10 mIU/mL). In patients with occult hepatitis B infection, viral reactivation can be a late complication after antiviral cessation, with a 2–year cumulative risk of up to 40%.

Serologic markers for HBV — HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), anti-HBc immunoglobulin M (IgM), anti-HBc immunoglobulin G (IgG), and anti-HBs (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen) — are interpreted as follows: Self-limited infections are usually eliminated in 1 to 2 months, whereas chronic infections are persistently positive beyond 6 months with no detectable anti-HBs in individuals who have never been vaccinated; anti-HBc IgM appears 1 to 2 weeks after HBsAg; anti-HBc IgG persists for life and passively transferred maternal anti-HBc IgG is detectable in infants up to 24 months after birth; anti-HBs develops during convalescence in self-limited infections, indicates immunity from HBV infection, and after post–recovery from natural infection both anti-HBs and anti-HBc IgG are present, whereas after postvaccination without prior infection detectable anti-HBs but no anti-HBc or HBsAg are present, and inadvertent vaccination after recovery from HBV infection yields detectable anti-HBs and anti-HBc upon postvaccination testing.

### Hepatitis B – more treatments, more testing, not enough data [^d5a6a629]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Published clinical guidelines, such as those from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), the US Treatment Algorithm, and the NIH Consensus Conference, offer recommendations as to the frequency of monitoring of ALT, HBV DNA, and HBeAg for different subgroups of chronic HBV patients. They also give recommendations as to when to initiate antiviral HBV treatment and guidelines as to the choice of drug or combination or drugs. Unfortunately there are several problems with these recommendations. For one, the recommendations are quite complicated. For example, for patients who are HBeAg positive and have ALT one to two times the upper limit of normal, the AASLD recommends monitoring the ALT every 3 months and monitoring the HBeAg every 6 months. However, if the patient is HBeAg positive but the ALT is less than the upper limit of normal, then they recommend monitoring the ALT every 3–6 months and monitoring the HBeAg every 6–12 months. For patients who are HBeAg negative with an ALT one to two times the upper limit of normal and HBV DNA between 2,000–20,000 IU/ml, they recommend checking the ALT every 3 months and the HBV DNA every 3 months. The purpose of this frequent monitoring is to determine when a patient may be transitioning from active to inactive phases of disease or vice versa, or when a patient would become eligible for antiviral treatment. However, the second and more significant problem with these guidelines is that there are no data to support the recommended frequencies for laboratory monitoring. While it is increasingly evident that ALT elevation and HBV DNA level are strong predictors of development of cirrhosis and HCC,–the recommendations for indefinite monitoring of ALT, DNA, and HBeAg every 3 or 6 months have never been studied in any randomized trial or been compared to other frequencies, and there are no data to show that such frequent monitoring leads to an increased use of antiviral treatment or a mortality benefit. The third problem with the current guidelines is that long-term management with this frequency of complex monitoring is an ambitious charge for providers and patients. The intensity of the schedule requires a significant burden of both time and resources for both providers and patients. Finally, as for the guidelines for the use of treatment of HBV, while there are clinical trials to support benefits and safety of each therapy or combination of therapies, the endpoints in HBV treatment trials have largely been surrogate markers, such as suppression of HBV DNA, normalization of ALT, and seroconversion of HBeAg to anti-HBe. However, to date, no randomized controlled trials of anti-HBV therapies have demonstrated a beneficial impact on overall mortality, liver-specific mortality, or development of HCC.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^79491213]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing methods and confirmatory approach — The sensitivity and specificity of the lone FDA-approved point-of-care test are similar to laboratory-based assays, but a positive HCV-antibody test indicates current (active) HCV infection, a past resolved infection, or rarely a false-positive result, and a test to detect HCV viremia is necessary to confirm active HCV infection. Ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing, which requires a single blood collection and avoids a return visit for confirmatory testing. Collection of dried blood spots is an option for sequential HCV-antibody and reflex HCV-RNA testing, and dried blood spot collection can be accomplished with a fingerstick rather than venepuncture and transport does not require an intact cold chain, making this advantageous where phlebotomy is a testing barrier. An FDA-approved quantitative or qualitative HCV-RNA assay should be used; immunocompromised persons and those with possible HCV exposure in the prior 6 months may be HCV antibody–negative, and HCV-RNA testing is a consideration for these individuals. If clarification is needed to differentiate resolved infection from biologic false positivity, repeat testing with a different HCV-antibody assay can be undertaken, and a false positive result is more likely when the anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio is low.

### Significance of anti-HBc alone serological status in clinical practice [^9d05df38]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Serum samples identified as positive for total anti-HBc, but negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, are referred to as anti-HBc alone. This serological response is compatible with acute, resolved, and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)infection but might also signify occult HBV infection. Once the anti-HBc alone pattern is detected, false-positive reactivity should be ruled out and further analyses can resolve the clinical status of the donor. The identification of anti-HBc positivity in the absence of HBsAg in organ transplant donors and in candidate patients for chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy requires further investigation because of the risk of HBV reactivation. False-positive detection, acute infection during the window phase, and resolved or chronic HBV infection are all possible and only distinguishable if the additional assays are done and measures of liver damage are taken into account. Measurement of serum anti-HBs responses after the administration of HBV vaccination can be useful to distinguish this serological profile. In view of the low risk of HBV reactivation in anti-HBc alone patients who are candidates for immunosuppressive treatment, such patients might not require pre-emptive antiviral therapy, but should be followed up on a monthly basis for alanine aminotransferase followed by quantitative HBV DNA testing in those with alanine aminotransferase increase. According to specific guidelines, nucleoside analogue prophylaxis is recommended in anti-HBc-positive liver allograft recipients and anti-HBc alone individuals who receive chemotherapy or biological therapy and should be continued for 6–12 months after discontinuation of such immunosuppressive therapies to protect against HBV reactivation.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on hepatitis B virus reactivation (HBVr) provides risk-stratified management and screening directives as follows: "The panel agreed on 4 recommendations". "Based on evidence and baseline risk assessment, the panel made a strong recommendation in favor of antiviral prophylaxis for individuals at high risk of HBVr". "For individuals at moderate risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of antiviral prophylaxis". "For individuals at low risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of monitoring alone without antiviral prophylaxis". "Monitoring should be performed at 1- to 3- month intervals, and must include assessment of hepatitis B viral load in addition to assessment of alanine aminotransferase". For screening, the panel issued "a strong recommendation in favor of testing for HBV, given universal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screening guidance for hepatitis B for all adults 18 years and older by testing for HBV surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and total hepatitis B core antibody; stratifying screening practices by magnitude of HBVr risk is no longer needed".

Benefits of Testing for Current HCV Infection

Accurate testing to identify current infection is important to 1) help clinicians and other providers correctly identify persons infected with HCV, so that preventive services, care and treatment can be offered; 2) notify tested persons of their infection status, enabling them to make informed decisions about medical care and options for HCV treatment, take measures to limit HCV-associated disease progression (e.g. avoidance or reduction of alcohol intake, and vaccination against hepatitis A and B), and minimize risk for transmitting HCV to others; and 3) inform persons who are not currently infected of their status and the fact that they are not infectious.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management during preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) indicates that "HBV infection is not a contraindication to PrEP use", and "Both TDF and FTC are active against HBV". HBV‑monoinfected patients taking TDF or FTC who stop these medications "must have their liver function closely monitored for reactivation of HBV replication that can result in hepatic damage".

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^5027eee3]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B vaccination and serologic management for health care workers — Hepatitis B vaccination has resulted in a 98% decline in HBV incidence among health care workers during the past 30 years, and without vaccine protection, percutaneous exposure to HBV-infected blood is associated with a seroconversion risk of 1–6% if a source patient is e-antigen negative, but 22–31% if the source patient is e-antigen positive; HBV may survive on environmental surfaces for up to one week. Workers with reasonably anticipated potential blood and body fluid exposure must, according to federal regulation, be offered vaccination for hepatitis B, and health care workers who decline to be vaccinated should sign a written declination form, as specified in the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen Standard. Those previously vaccinated for hepatitis B should have documentation of hepatitis B surface antibody response to the vaccine, and hepatitis B surface antibody testing should be carried out among previously vaccinated personnel without such documentation. Reasonable management of such individuals as a part of the pre-placement evaluation includes offering another dose of vaccine, followed 4–6 weeks later by retesting of hepatitis B surface antibody; those who remain hepatitis B surface antibody-negative should have the vaccine series repeated, with surface antibody testing thereafter. Because chronic hepatitis B infection is a reason for vaccine nonresponse, non-responders should be tested for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen, and in general, vaccine non-responders should receive hepatitis B immune globulin if exposed to a hepatitis B-positive source patient.

### Hepatitis B core-related antigen to indicate high viral load: systematic review and meta-analysis of 10, 397 individual participants [^20c9edfc]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

To eliminate hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, scale-up of testing and treatment in resource-limited countries is crucial. However, access to nucleic acid testing to quantify HBV DNA, an essential test to examine treatment eligibility, remains severely limited. We assessed the performance of a novel immunoassay, HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg), as a low-cost (less than US $15/assay) alternative to nucleic acid testing to indicate clinically important high viremia in chronic HBV patients infected with different genotypes.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases through June 27, 2018. Three reviewers independently selected studies measuring HBV DNA and HBcrAg in the same blood samples. We contacted authors to provide individual participant data (IPD). We randomly allocated each IPD to a derivation or validation cohort. We applied optimal HBcrAg cut-off values derived from the derivation set to the validation set to estimate sensitivity/specificity.

Results

Of 74 eligible studies, IPD were obtained successfully for 60 studies (81%). Meta-analysis included 5591 IPD without antiviral therapy and 4806 treated with antivirals. In untreated patients, the pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and optimal cut-off values were as follows: 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83–0.94) and 3.6 log U/mL to diagnose HBV DNA level of 2000 IU/mL or greater; and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94–0.98) and 5.3 log U/mL for 200,000 IU/mL or greater, respectively. In the validation set, the sensitivity and specificity were 85.2% and 84.7% to diagnose HBV DNA level of 2000 IU/mL or greater, and 91.8% and 90.5% for 200,000 IU/mL or greater, respectively. The performance did not vary by HBV genotypes. In patients treated with anti-HBV therapy the correlation between HBcrAg and HBV DNA was poor.

Conclusions

HBcrAg might be a useful serologic marker to indicate clinically important high viremia in treatment-naïve, HBV-infected patients.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the prevention and treatment of hepatitis B virus reactivation in at-risk individuals [^6af4db68]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Hepatitis B reactivation (HBVr) can occur due to a variety of immune-modulating exposures, including multiple drug classes and disease states. Antiviral prophylaxis can be effective in mitigating the risk of HBVr. In select cases, clinical monitoring without antiviral prophylaxis is sufficient for managing the risk of HBVr. This clinical practice guideline update aims to inform frontline health care practitioners by providing evidence-based practice recommendation for the management of HBVr in at-risk individuals.

Methods

The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to assess evidence and make recommendations. The panel conducted a systematic evidence review to identify new studies since publication of the first version of this clinical practice guideline in 2014. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop recommendations regarding the role of antiviral prophylaxis and monitoring without antiviral prophylaxis for management of HBVr. Clinical recommendations were based on the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations.

Results

The panel agreed on 4 recommendations. Based on evidence and baseline risk assessment, the panel made a strong recommendation in favor of antiviral prophylaxis for individuals at high risk of HBVr. For individuals at moderate risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of antiviral prophylaxis. For individuals at low risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of monitoring alone without antiviral prophylaxis. Monitoring should be performed at 1- to 3-month intervals, and must include assessment of hepatitis B viral load in addition to assessment of alanine aminotransferase. For individuals deemed to be at-risk of HBVr, the panel agreed on a strong recommendation in favor of testing for HBV; given universal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screening guidance for hepatitis B for all adults 18 years and older by testing for HBV surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and total hepatitis B core antibody, stratifying screening practices by magnitude of HBVr risk is no longer needed.

Conclusions

This document provides updated guidance for the management of HBVr in at-risk individuals. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted. This guideline is expected to require updating in 5 years from publication.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^0ba7259c]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV infection — testing recommendations and timing: HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing are recommended when acute HCV infection is suspected due to known exposure, clinical presentation, or elevated aminotransferase levels. HCV RNA typically becomes reliably detectable within 2–3 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibody typically occurs 2–3 months after exposure, on average; therefore, the best laboratory evidence is a positive HCV-RNA test in the setting of a negative HCV-antibody test or a positive HCV-antibody test after a prior negative anti-HCV test. When there has been a discrete, known, or suspected exposure, baseline HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing should be performed within 48 hours of the exposure; if baseline testing is negative, repeat testing for HCV antibody and HCV RNA is recommended, with frequency tailored to objectives (e.g., monthly testing to identify and treat acute infection).

### Association of coexistent hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody with severe liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B [^0e9ac539]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the coexistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody against HBsAg (anti-HBs) associated with severe liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB)?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 6534 patients with CHB, the coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs was independently associated with severe liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with CHB, especially among those who had hepatitis B e antigen negativity.

Meaning

This study's findings suggest that coexistent HBsAg and anti-HBs is a rare serological pattern that may reflect a special status of infection and that close monitoring for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis is warranted in patients with CHB who have this serological profile.

AASLD–IDSA simplified HCV treatment — eligibility and pretreatment assessment for treatment‑naive adults without cirrhosis specify that adults with chronic hepatitis C (any genotype) who do not have cirrhosis and have not previously received hepatitis C treatment are eligible, whereas patients with prior hepatitis C treatment, cirrhosis, end‑stage renal disease (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), HIV or HBsAg positive, current pregnancy, known or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma, or prior liver transplantation are not eligible. For cirrhosis assessment, a patient is presumed to have cirrhosis if they have a FIB‑4 score > 3.25 or findings such as FibroScan stiffness > 12.5 kPa or platelet count < 150,000/mm³. Pretreatment laboratory testing includes, within 6 months of initiating treatment, a complete blood count, hepatic function panel, and calculated glomerular filtration rate; any time prior to therapy, quantitative HCV RNA, HIV antigen/antibody test, and hepatitis B surface antigen; and before initiating therapy, serum pregnancy testing and counseling about pregnancy risks for women of childbearing age.

### Acute hepatitis B infection in a long-term hemodialysis patient despite persistent natural immunity [^b769e79c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B infections are a distinct clinical problem in hemodialysis patients. Naturally acquired antibodies from a prior hepatitis B virus infection generally are considered to be immunoprotective for subsequent infections. We describe a new-onset hepatitis B virus infection in a hemodialysis patient despite persistent protective levels of naturally acquired antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen. This case emphasizes that the immune response to hepatitis B virus is complex and still poorly understood. Current recommended screening guidelines may be incomplete in addressing acute hepatitis B virus infections in hemodialysis patients. Aggressive vaccination strategies should be considered to maintain immunity in patients at high risk of seroconversion. Stricter surveillance and use of modern virus detection assays may be required to detect subtle infections and minimize the risk of transmission of hepatitis B virus in hemodialysis units.

As persons transition across phases over the lifetime of infection, regular monitoring is essential to identify when a change of management is indicated, including use of antiviral therapy.

### Positive hepatitis B virus core antibody in HIV infection – false positive or evidence of previous infection? [^a4a481d7]. Journal of Medical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

Isolated HBV core antibody (anti-HBc) is defined as the presence of anti-HBc with a negative HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV surface antibody (anti-HBs < 10IU/l). In patients infected with HIV with isolated anti-HBc, the aim was to determine: The prevalence of isolated positive anti-HBc; The most effective method of identifying which patients have had previous Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection; The prevalence of false positive anti-HBc. HBV serology results were identified from 539 patients infected with HIV sampled between January 2010 and December 2012. In those with an isolated anti-HBc and negative anti-HBe, a second anti-HBc test was carried out using a different assay. Samples were also screened for HBV DNA. The anti-retroviral regimens at time of screening were documented. 101/539 had an isolated anti-HBc. Of these, 32 (32%) had a positive anti-HBe (including 1 equivocal) and 69(68%) were anti-HBe negative. Of those negative for anti-HBe, 32 were tested for both DNA and a second anti-HBc. Of these 26 (81%) were on cART at time of HBV testing, with 25 (78%) on ART with anti-HBV activity. The prevalence of isolated anti-HBc was 19%. Only 32% were also anti-HBe positive, whereas 97% of those anti-HBe negative were positive on a second anti-HBc assay suggesting lack of utility of anti-HBe in resolving serological quandaries. One subject (3%) had a false positive anti-HBc. There was no evidence of chronic HBV but 78% patients were on HBV-suppressive combination anti-retroviral therapy.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of candidates for kidney transplantation [^46f9f193]. Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

HBV-seropositive or anti-HBc–positive candidates — evaluation and risk: The prevalence of HBV infections ranges from 0–7% of patients on hemodialysis. A positive hepatitis B serology (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] and/or antibody to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc]) does not preclude transplantation but does require further evaluation. Positivity of HBsAg denotes actively replicating virus and should be further quantified using HBV DNA, with assessment for chronic liver disease and liver imaging to rule out hepatocellular carcinoma; expert consultation should be sought to determine antiviral therapy prior to transplantation. Positivity of anti-HBc with a negative HBsAg is evidence of prior infection, active replication should be ruled out with HBV DNA testing, patients with isolated anti-HBc positivity can undergo transplantation, and there is a small risk of reactivation (< 5%) post-transplant.

Table 4 — interpretation of HBV serologic markers — HBV surface antigen negative, HBV core antibody negative, and HBV surface antibody negative indicates not infected and not immune. HBV surface antigen negative, HBV core antibody positive, and HBV surface antibody positive indicates previous HBV infection, now cleared (i.e., no viremia) and leading to natural immunity. HBV surface antigen negative, HBV core antibody negative, and HBV surface antibody positive indicates successful HBV vaccination leading to immunity. HBV surface antigen positive, HBV core antibody positive (IgM), and HBV surface antibody negative indicates acute active HBV infection. HBV surface antigen positive, HBV core antibody positive (IgM negative, IgG positive), and HBV surface antibody negative indicates chronic active HBV infection. HBV surface antigen negative, HBV core antibody positive, and HBV surface antibody negative has four possibilities: 1. Resolved infection and immune (most common) 2. False positive 3. Occult chronic infection 4. Resolving acute infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

MEDLINE and WHO regional indexed databases were used to search for articles published from 1 January 1989 (after HCV testing became available) to 31 October 2006, by means of the MeSH terms: 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'hepatitis B virus' and 'hepatitis C virus or hepacvirus'. Additional relevant studies were identified in the reference lists of selected articles. No language limitation was imposed. Eligible studies had to report prevalence of both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies against HCV (anti-HCV), alone and in combination, for at least 20 HCC cases. To avoid multiple inclusions of the same HCC cases in more than one article, the time and place of recruitment of cases were cross-checked and the most recent publication was used. In the event that study methods indicated the availability of HBsAg and anti-HCV prevalence data but did not report both of them and the percent of coinfection in the article, authors were contacted for the supplementary information. In the course of contacting authors, additional data became available from one study expanded since the original publication (Appendix A).

The key information extracted from each study were study country, gender distribution, generation of HCV serology tests used, prevalence of HBsAg alone (HBsAg +) and anti-HCV alone (anti-HCV +) and in combination (HBV/HCV coinfection), and the number of cases that were seronegative for both viral markers.

Key information on 110 selected studies is given in the Appendix A by continent and country. For multicentric studies, HBsAg + and anti-HCV + prevalence data were separated by country (Appendix A). Study size varied substantially and four reports (one each from China, Japan, Taiwan and the United States) included more than 1000 HCC cases. With respect to anti-HCV testing, 17 studies (published from 1989 to 1994) reported the use of first-generation enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA), 29 studies (published from 1992 to 2003) second-generation ELISA and 42 studies (published from 1997 to 2006) third-generation ELISA. Nineteen studies did not report the generation of HCV testing used; four of these were assumed to have used first-generation ELISA based on date of publication or patient admission. Studies known or likely to have used first-generation ELISA were not included in the computation of HCV prevalence owing to known problems of sensitivity and specificity of those assays. Two studies used HCV RNA instead of anti-HCV, and were included in the analysis (Appendix A).

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection — diagnosis and screening in patients with HIV includes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Preventive Services Taskforce, and the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) recommend screening patients with HIV infection for chronic HBV, and initial testing should include serologic testing for surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc total), and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) (AII). In acute infection, HBsAg can be detected 4 weeks (range 1–9 weeks) after exposure and anti-HBc immunoglobulin M is usually detectable at the onset of symptoms. Chronic HBV infection is defined as persistent HBsAg detected on 2 occasions at least 6 months apart, and patients with chronic HBV infection should be further tested for HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA; active disease, which can be HBeAg-negative or HBeAg-positive, can be distinguished from inactive disease by the presence of serum HBV DNA and persistent or fluctuating alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations. Patients whose past infection has resolved are HBsAg-negative with positive anti-HBs and/or anti-HBc, although covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) may remain in hepatocyte nuclei, and with severe immune suppression a patient may become serum HBsAg-positive again with HBV viremia. The presence of an isolated anti-HBc test result usually signifies infection with HBV in the past with subsequent loss of anti-HBs and occurs in 7% to 19% of patients with HIV infection, and incidence of HBV viremia in patients with HIV infection and isolated anti-HBc ranges from 1% to 36%.

Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) and risk of hepatitis B reactivation — prevalence and risk estimates: Among RCTs informing prophylaxis efficacy, the pooled proportion of control-arm patients who were anti-HBs–positive was 65% (95% CI, 58%–72%). In those who were anti-HBs–positive and underwent rituximab therapy, the baseline risk was 6.6%, and the upper bound of the 95% CI for this subgroup was 14.4%.

Hepatitis A testing and documentation around vaccination — serologic testing for immunity is unnecessary after routine vaccination of infants, children, or adults; however, testing for anti-HAV antibody after vaccination is recommended for persons whose subsequent clinical management depends on knowledge of their immune status or for whom revaccination might be indicated. Prevaccination testing will likely be most cost-effective for adults born in or who lived extensively in areas of high or intermediate HAV endemicity, and prevaccination serologic testing of children is not indicated. For populations with high rates of previous HAV infection, vaccination history should be obtained when feasible before testing or vaccination, and vaccination should not be postponed if history cannot be obtained, records are unavailable, or testing is infeasible. Vaccinating persons immune from natural infection carries no known risk and giving extra doses of hepatitis A vaccine is not harmful; persons with a documented history of ≥ 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine do not need further vaccination or serologic testing.

AASLD–IDSA Hepatitis C guidance — spontaneous clearance and follow-up for acute HCV reports that HCV infection spontaneously clears in 20%–50% of patients within 6 months time of infection, and only 11%–14% of those who remain viremic at 6 months spontaneously clear later. Predictors of spontaneous clearance include presentation with jaundice, elevated ALT, HBsAg positivity, female sex, younger age, genotype 1 infection, and host genetic polymorphisms near the IL28B gene. Patients who experience spontaneous clearance do not require antiviral therapy but do require counseling about the risk of reinfection and testing at least annually; transient suppression of viremia can occur, so a single undetectable HCV-RNA test result is insufficient to declare spontaneous clearance.
