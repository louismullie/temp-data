## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication should be used for infective endocarditis prophylaxis in a patient without a penicillin allergy, given the options of Bactrim, doxycycline, amoxicillin, and vancomycin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether prophylaxis is indicated at all. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for patients without penicillin allergy. Next, I will examine each option against those recommendations and check for any exceptions or caveats. Finally, I will confirm dosing and timing to ensure the answer is clinically actionable and reference-aligned.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Infective endocarditis prophylaxis is not universally recommended; it is reserved for patients with specific high-risk cardiac conditions undergoing procedures involving manipulation of gingival tissue, periapical region, or oral mucosa, primarily dental procedures, and is not indicated for most gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures in the absence of active infection, so I need to ensure we are not overgeneralizing prophylaxis to all patients or all procedures [^7bdc4db0] [^8d69cce3] [^ec4d44b5].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance for patients without penicillin allergy. The American Heart Association recommends amoxicillin as the first-line prophylactic agent for dental procedures in appropriate high-risk patients, typically as a single oral dose 30–60 minutes before the procedure, with alternatives reserved for penicillin allergy or inability to take oral therapy, which directly addresses the scenario of no penicillin allergy [^7bdc4db0] [^722eb93f]. Wait, let me verify the exact adult dose; yes, the AHA specifies 2 grams orally for adults, with pediatric dosing at 50 mg/kg, and if oral therapy is not feasible, ampicillin 2 g IV/IM or cefazolin/ceftriaxone 1 g IV/IM are acceptable alternatives, again underscoring that amoxicillin is preferred when oral therapy is possible [^7bdc4db0].

> I will now examine each option against this standard. Amoxicillin matches the first-line recommendation and is the most commonly used agent with a favorable safety profile for single-dose prophylaxis, so it is the correct choice here [^7bdc4db0] [^d8d715cb]. Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is not recommended for IE prophylaxis and lacks activity against viridans streptococci, the principal organisms targeted for dental prophylaxis, so I should exclude it [^notfound]. Doxycycline is not listed as a prophylactic option in current AHA or ESC guidance and is not used for this purpose, so I should not select it either [^notfound]. Vancomycin is an alternative only for patients with penicillin allergy or when beta-lactams cannot be used, and it is generally reserved for parenteral administration when oral therapy is not feasible, so it is not the preferred agent in a patient without penicillin allergy who can take oral medication [^7bdc4db0] [^722eb93f].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any of the provided references contradict this. The AHA consistently places amoxicillin first for dental prophylaxis in non-allergic patients, with cephalosporins or clindamycin/macrolides as alternatives for those with penicillin allergy, and vancomycin reserved for specific circumstances; none of these sources elevate Bactrim or doxycycline to prophylactic roles, reinforcing that amoxicillin is the answer here [^7bdc4db0] [^722eb93f]. I should double-check that vancomycin is not the default; indeed, vancomycin is an alternative for beta-lactam intolerance or allergy, not the routine choice when penicillin is tolerated [^7bdc4db0].

> Final answer: Amoxicillin is the medication of choice for infective endocarditis prophylaxis in patients without penicillin allergy, typically given as a single 2 g oral dose 30–60 minutes before the dental procedure, with alternatives such as ampicillin, cefazolin, or ceftriaxone considered if oral therapy is not feasible or if allergy is present [^7bdc4db0] [^722eb93f].

---

The correct answer is **amoxicillin**. For patients without a penicillin allergy, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends **amoxicillin 2 g orally 30–60 minutes before dental procedures** that involve manipulation of gingival tissue, periapical region, or oral mucosa [^7bdc4db0] [^722eb93f]. If amoxicillin cannot be given orally, **ampicillin 2 g IV/IM** or **cefazolin/ceftriaxone 1 g IV/IM** are acceptable alternatives [^7bdc4db0]. Bactrim, doxycycline, and vancomycin are **not recommended for routine prophylaxis** in non-allergic patients [^notfound].

---

## Recommended prophylactic antibiotic regimen

According to the AHA, the following antibiotic regimens are recommended for patients without penicillin allergy who require infective endocarditis prophylaxis:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage and route** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin | 2 g orally | 30–60 minutes before procedure |
| Ampicillin | 2 g IV or IM | 30–60 minutes before procedure |
| Cefazolin or ceftriaxone | 1 g IV or IM | 30–60 minutes before procedure |

---

These regimens are **specifically targeted** against viridans streptococci, the primary bacteria implicated in dental-related infective endocarditis [^d8d715cb].

---

## Rationale for amoxicillin as the preferred agent

Amoxicillin is the **preferred agent** for prophylaxis in non-allergic patients because of its:

- **Broad-spectrum activity**: Effective against viridans streptococci, the predominant organisms causing dental-related infective endocarditis [^d8d715cb].
- **Favorable pharmacokinetics**: Rapid absorption and adequate tissue penetration.
- **Low adverse reaction rate**: Minimal risk of severe allergic reactions compared to other antibiotics [^d8d715cb].

---

## Alternative antibiotics for patients with penicillin allergy

In patients with documented penicillin allergy, the AHA recommends the following **alternative regimens**:

- **Cephalexin**: 2 g orally, 30–60 minutes before procedure (avoid in patients with severe penicillin allergy).
- **Clindamycin**: 600 mg orally, 30–60 minutes before procedure.
- **Azithromycin or clarithromycin**: 500 mg orally, 30–60 minutes before procedure [^7bdc4db0].

---

## Why bactrim, doxycycline, and vancomycin are not recommended

- **Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole)**: Not effective against viridans streptococci and is therefore not recommended for prophylaxis [^notfound].
- **Doxycycline**: Not included in the AHA guidelines for prophylaxis due to inadequate activity against viridans streptococci.
- **Vancomycin**: Reserved for patients with severe penicillin allergy or when other alternatives are unsuitable, due to its broad-spectrum activity and potential for adverse reactions [^7bdc4db0].

---

## Clinical implications and considerations

- **Patient-specific factors**: Clinicians should consider patient-specific factors such as renal function, hepatic impairment, and potential drug interactions when selecting prophylactic antibiotics.
- **Procedure-specific factors**: Prophylaxis is recommended primarily for dental procedures involving manipulation of gingival tissue, periapical region, or oral mucosa. It is not routinely recommended for gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures unless there is active infection [^7bdc4db0] [^8d69cce3].
- **Timing and adherence**: Antibiotics should be administered 30–60 minutes before the procedure to ensure adequate tissue concentrations during bacteremia [^7bdc4db0].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

For patients without penicillin allergy, **amoxicillin is the preferred prophylactic antibiotic** for preventing infective endocarditis associated with dental procedures [^7bdc4db0]. Alternative regimens include ampicillin or cefazolin/ceftriaxone if oral administration is not feasible [^7bdc4db0]. Bactrim, doxycycline, and vancomycin are not recommended for routine prophylaxis in non-allergic patients [^notfound].

### International guideline changes and the incidence of infective endocarditis: a systematic review [^2cb2b1d8]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Infective endocarditis (IE) is a relatively rare disorder with an estimated incidence of 3–10 cases per 100 000 per year. Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advances, prognosis remains poor, as reflected by hospital mortality of about 22%, rising to 40% at 5 years. Morbidity rates are also high; 50% of patients require operative management in the acute phase of the disease, often with ongoing consequences for quality of life. The substantial risk associated with IE has driven recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk subgroups, particularly those with valvular heart disease and other structural cardiac disorders.

Ever since the 1950s when the large-scale commercial production of penicillin was established, the American Heart Association (AHA) has advocated antibiotic prophylaxis in subgroups of patients undergoing invasive procedures, including dental extraction and certain gastrointestinal and genitourinary procedures, that are likely to cause secondary bacteraemia. Secondary bacteraemia in relation to these procedures is well documented but a causal relationship with IE has never been established in randomised trials or case–control studies. Despite this, antibiotic prophylaxis has remained a central component of management in at-risk individuals for over 50 years.

In 2002, innovative guidelines in France challenged accepted practice by suggesting restriction of prophylaxis against IE to patients with the highest ratio of benefit to individual and collective risk while emphasising the importance of general and oral hygiene in populations at risk. In 2007, the AHA — followed in 2009 by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) — withdrew recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis in all but the highest risk individuals such as those with previous IE, prosthetic heart valves or immunodeficiency disorders. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) made the yet more radical recommendation for complete cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in all individuals regardless of risk. These new guideline recommendations, summarised in table 1, broke with a long-established principle of care and caused deep concern among many clinicians who cited historical, often small studies in questioning whether the recommendation was evidence based and whether it was safe for patients.NICE was unrepentant arguing that the absence of an evidence base was precisely why the need for antibiotic prophylaxis had been questioned and that the harms of anaphylaxis through wide-scale application of antibiotic prophylaxis were likely to exceed any potential benefits of IE prevention.

### Prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis: to use or not to use? [^8d28143d]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) published their revised guidelines in 2007 in which they markedly limited the recommendations for the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of infective endocarditis (IE), except for patients who are at highest risk of adverse outcomes. A recent focused update on valvular heart diseases changed the recommendation for antibiotic use for patients with many underlying heart conditions including mitral valve prolapse (MVP) which were considered as "low risk" heart defects. In this article, we argue that antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered until concrete clinical evidence is provided to dispute against the use of this strategy, especially for patients with MVP. This approach is cost efficient, and provides a chance to prevent a dreadful disease. We have also enlisted 2 clinical cases to support our argument. These are not uncommon clinical scenarios, and emphasize that IE can be fatal in spite of optimum treatment. Patients have the right to make the final decision, and they should be allowed to participate in choosing for or against this approach until adequate clinical evidence is available.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis — antibiotic selection for prevention of IE specifies that amoxicillin is the preferred choice for oral therapy. For patients allergic to penicillins or amoxicillin, cephalexin or another first-generation oral cephalosporin, clindamycin, azithromycin or clarithromycin is recommended, but a cephalosporin should not be administered to patients with a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema or urticaria after any penicillin. Patients unable to tolerate oral therapy may be treated with intramuscular or intravenous ampicillin, ceftriaxone or cefazolin, and for those allergic to ampicillin who also cannot take oral agents, therapy is recommended with parenteral cefazolin, ceftriaxone or clindamycin.

### New British and American guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of infective endocarditis: do the changes make sense? A critical review [^0c08bd23]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy and the American Heart Association have radically revised their guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis. This review discusses the evidence behind the most controversial changes and considers possible future developments.

Recent Findings

The new guidelines emphasize good oral hygiene for preventing viridans streptococcal endocarditis. Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures is only recommended for patients with the highest-risk cardiac conditions. American Heart Association guidelines no longer recommend prophylaxis for urological and gastrointestinal procedures.

Summary

While only up to 6% of endocarditis cases may be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis there is controversy as to what to recommend for the individual cardiac patient undergoing a given procedure. The new guidelines about dental prophylaxis are based on epidemiological studies that failed to include sufficient subjects undergoing specific interventions. When considering viridans streptococcal rather than total bacteraemia rates, asserting that the prevalence of bacteraemia after invasive dental procedures is similar to that after toothbrushing may be incorrect. The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy report probably overestimates the risk of fatal anaphylaxis after an oral dose of amoxicillin. In contrast, the American Heart Association guidelines comment on the absence of any reports of fatal anaphylaxis associated with the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis.

### The cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis [^7901fe3a]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) is a widely used prevention measure for those at risk of developing infective endocarditis (IE). Following the suggestion that bacteremia secondary to invasive dental procedures might cause IE, the American Heart Association's Committee on Prevention of Rheumatic Fever and Bacterial Endocarditis was the first to recommend that individuals at increased risk of IE should be given antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) before invasive dental procedures some 60 years ago. Over time, the American Heart Association and other international guideline committees have gradually restricted AP use, moving to single-dose AP strategies and restricting the types of patients for whom AP is recommended. In 2008, this culminated with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommending that the use of AP to prevent IE should cease in the United Kingdom. This recommendation was confirmed in a recent review of the NICE guidelinesbut is in contrast with current European, North American, and other international guidelines that recommend AP for high-risk individuals undergoing invasive dental procedures.

A recent interrupted time series study found that AP prescribing in England fell sharply after the 2008 NICE guidance with a significant increase in the incidence of IE. By March 2013, it was estimated that there were 34.9 (95% confidence interval, 7.9–61.9) more cases of IE per month than would have been expected from the previous trend. This increase was statistically significant both for those at high risk (previous history of IE, prosthetic heart valve, valve repaired with prosthetic material, unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, or some repaired congenital heart defects) and moderate risk (native valve disease, unrepaired congenital heart valve anomalies, or previous rheumatic fever) of IE. This study provides unique evidence for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of AP, because the United Kingdom is the only country to have transitioned from recommending AP for those at high risk or moderate risk of IE to recommending its complete cessation. Another recent UK study demonstrated that the incidence of adverse drug reactions associated with AP was much lower than previously estimated.

This article estimates the cost-effectiveness of AP (single-dose amoxicillin or clindamycin for those allergic to penicillin) in patients at risk of IE by using (1) recent estimates of the effect of AP on IE in the English population,(2) rates of AP adverse drug reactions, and (3) estimates for the probability of developing IE after dental procedures derived from French dataas the foundation for analysis of cost and health benefits.

### International guideline changes and the incidence of infective endocarditis: a systematic review [^b5fbe3ba]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Although the studies included in this review sought to determine how guideline-recommended changes in antibiotic prophylaxis have affected incident IE, only the two UK studies reported prescription data. Without prescription data, it is simply not possible to determine whether temporal changes in incident IE have been influenced by changes in antibiotic prophylaxis called for in guidelines. For the two UK studies, it must be recognised that prescription data were not linked to the health records which, coupled with the unadjusted incidence calculations, makes it impossible to determine whether the sharp reduction in prescriptions following the 2009 NICE guideline was causally related to changes in incident IE. The monitored prescriptions for a single 3 g dose of oral amoxicillin (or a 600 mg dose of oral clindamycin for patients allergic to penicillin) account for the large bulk of prophylactic treatment in patients undergoing dental work and are targeted against streptococcal infection. Logically, therefore, any change consequent to the guideline recommendations should be confined largely to streptococcal IE. It was a limitation of the Dayer studythat the infective organism was not available to the investigators and we do not know, therefore, if the small increase in the recorded incidence of IE after 2008 was driven by increases in streptococcal IE. The earlier UK study, however, found no apparent change in the upward trend of streptococcal IE after 2008, although the recording of infective organisms was incomplete and captured streptococcal infection generically without specification of the viridans species. Nevertheless, the French study, the smaller Olmstead County study and the US Children's studyalso reported no increases in cases of streptococcal infection after the guideline changes. Only the large US study by Pant et al reported an increase in streptococcal IE hospitalisation rates although overall trends in IE hospitalisations from 2000 to 2007 and from 2008 to 2011 were not significantly different.

### Prophylaxis of infective endocarditis: current tendencies, continuing controversies [^8770da01]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a severe disease with high mortality, and results most often from the combination of bacteraemia (sometimes provoked) and a predisposing cardiac condition. Prophylaxis for infective endocarditis has been recommended by different countries on the basis of the supposed pathophysiology of the disease, although no randomised clinical trial has confirmed its efficacy. We review the data presented over the past few decades, challenge the principles underlying prophylaxis recommendations, and analyse the arguments that explain the general tendency in very recent years to decrease prophylaxis indications. Such arguments include the probable important role of everyday-life bacteraemia in the occurrence of infective endocarditis, the estimated huge number of prophylaxis doses to be given to avoid a single case of infective endocarditis, and the lack of scientific evidence to identify those procedures that should lead to prophylaxis. Recommendations for prophylaxis are now essentially focused on patients with high-risk predisposing cardiac conditions before dental procedures.

Dental procedures in patients already receiving antibiotics — agent selection guidance states that if a patient is already receiving chronic antibiotic therapy with an antibiotic that is also recommended for IE prophylaxis for a dental procedure, it is prudent to select an antibiotic from a different class rather than to increase the dosage of the current antibiotic. For those taking an oral penicillin for secondary prevention of rheumatic fever or for other purposes and likely to harbor viridans group streptococci relatively resistant to penicillin or amoxicillin, the provider should select either clindamycin, azithromycin or clarithromycin for IE prophylaxis for a dental procedure, but only for patients shown in Box 3.

### Perspectives on the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines for the prevention of infective endocarditis [^5502afe3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

In 2007, the American Heart Association published a guideline statement dramatically changing its previous position on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients at risk of infective endocarditis (IE). This year, these views were incorporated in an update of the 2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease. The new recommendations represent a dramatic shift with regard to which patients should receive antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of IE and for what procedures. The shift in recommendations is striking in that the recommendations are based not on new data, but on no data. (There are no large, prospective, randomized double-blind trials testing the efficacy of IE prophylaxis.) However, available data suggest that there may be no real risk associated with IE prophylaxis. Even if few cases of IE are successfully prevented using antibiotic prophylaxis, those few cases may represent a favorable risk-benefit ratio. On an individual basis, patients with organic heart valve disease who are trying to delay or avoid surgical intervention have something very real to risk if they develop IE, and a very real benefit if they avoid it. Pending data from prospective randomized trials, a strategy of individual decision-making by informed patients may be best.

### The cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis [^d42c0aa9]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Comparators and Patient Population

The cost-effectiveness of the AP regimen that was in use in the United Kingdom before the 2008 NICE guidelines (a single 3-g oral dose of amoxicillin or a single 600-mg oral dose of clindamycin for those allergic to penicillin or who had received amoxicillin in the previous month) for all at risk individuals (ie, those at moderate risk or high risk of IE) was compared with a strategy of no AP (as per the NICE guidelines). We also compared no AP with a strategy restricting AP to just those at high risk of IE (as per the Europeanand North Americanguidelines). English National Health Service costs were estimated and health effects measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).

Model Structure

A decision model, based on the decision model used by NICE for the health-economic analysis performed to inform the 2008 guidelines, was constructed to estimate differences in costs and health benefits accruing from the short-term consequences of the decision to administer AP, or not, and the longer-term sequelae of AP and IE (Figure). AP-related adverse events and IE may be fatal or lead to differences in the probability of a patient being otherwise healthy, requiring valve replacement surgery or experiencing congestive heart failure (CHF). These longer-term impacts were captured by using a state transition model, with 1-year cycle periods and a lifetime (50 years) time horizon. We used Treeage Pro software and the Sheffield Accelerated Value of Information Tool.

Dashed arrows represent patient pathways from the decision tree to Markov models (ie, all living patients begin in either the well or valve surgery states).

Parameter Values

Data used to calculate the probability of IE after a high-risk (invasive) dental procedure were based on previous definitions and estimates of the risk of adults with predisposing cardiac conditions developing IE. The number of IE hospital admissions (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision code I33.0) was obtained from Hospital Episode statistics (HES;)and population data from the Office of National Statistics. A more detailed explanation of the calculations and values is provided in theand).

### Infective endocarditis by HACEK: a review [^dd7cf82a]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Prevention and prophylaxis

Recently, prophylaxis attributable to invasive dental operations was a normal precaution for the prevention of infections endocarditis from oropharyngeal bacteria especially HACEK and viridians streptococci group. However, this suggestion was withdrawn by AHA in 2007, after population-based evidence showed that only a minimal percentage of IE cases are eliminated by the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures. Scientific studies and growing evidence continue to contradict and refine the suggested prophylactic techniques. Antibacterial prophylaxis is now approved for use in particular high-risk cases, such as the involvement of a prosthetic heart valve, prior history of IE, uncorrected or newly corrected CHD, and the occurrence of prosthetic heart valve disorders. For patients in these high-risk groups, prophylaxis is recommended prior to dental operations involving stimulation of the gingival tissue or For patients in these high-risk groups, prophylaxis is recommended prior to dental operations involving stimulation of the gingival tissue or periapical area of the teeth or destruction of oral mucosa such as root canal processes. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not approved for using local anesthetic of non — infected areas, for the prevention of superficial caries, for the insertion of sutures, dental x-rays, for the positioning or modification of removable implantation of prosthesis or orthodontics, or for damage to the lips and mucous membranes. The key focus for antibiotic prophylaxis in these groups is oral streptococci, although HACEK group are also considered. The most prescribed prophylaxis are amoxicillin or ampicillin, 2 g orally or intravenously in adults and 50 mg/kg orally or intravenously in non-adults, according to the ESC 2015 standards. In the penicillin or ampicillin allergic patient, clindamycin can be chosen to give at 600 mg for adults and 20 mg/kg in in non-adults. The antibiotics are supplied as a single dose 30–60 min prior to the dental procedure. However, while antibacterial prophylaxis is limited to high-risk populations, such prevention steps should be extended to all cardiac disease. The ESC Standards recommend non-specific preventive steps, such as stringent oral and skin care, 2-yearly dental follow-up, wound disinfection, therapeutic antibiotics for bacterial infection, no antibiotic self-medication and minimal use of catheters and aggressive methods.

### The cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis [^be56524f]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Because the recent time-series analysis was an observational study, we cannot be certain that the number of extra cases of IE identified was caused by the reduction in AP prescribing following the 2008 NICE guidelines. It is possible, therefore, that the number of IE cases prevented by AP is less than the identified 34.9 per month. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of AP across a range of scenarios we performed a sensitivity analysis using a maximum effectiveness of preventing 35 IE cases per month and a minimum of preventing zero cases, ie, where AP is ineffective. Using this approach, we demonstrated that amoxicillin AP has to prevent only 2.76 cases per month in the all-at-risk group to be cost-effective and 16.8 cases per month to be cost saving. Moreover, amoxicillin AP is even more cost-effective in the high-risk group where only 0.12 cases per month need to be prevented for it to be cost-effective and 0.74 cases per month to be cost saving.

These data suggest that a strategy of directing AP at those at high risk of IE is likely to be cost-effective or cost saving, even at very low rates of AP clinical effectiveness. This conflicts with the NICE health economic analysis of AP, which used older data on the incidence of adverse drug reactions after the use of parenteral penicillins. More recent data suggest that fatal anaphylaxis is exceedingly rare, and there have been no reports of fatal anaphylaxis after oral amoxicillin AP in the world literature. The incidence of adverse reactions after amoxicillin AP is extremely low (0 fatal, 22.62 nonfatal reactions per million prescriptions). Although low, reactions to clindamycin AP were higher than anticipated, suggesting that an alternative AP regimen for those allergic to penicillin would be desirable. Our data suggest that AP needs only minimal clinical effectiveness to be cost-effective, because it is so cheap in comparison with the substantial cost and health implications of IE.

Study results

Infective endocarditis

Only study 5 reported an increase in the rate of incident IE of 0.11 cases per 10 million per month (p < 0.0001) following guideline publication representing 35 more cases per month across the UK compared with the period before 2008. This change was associated with an 89% overall reduction in antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions. A similar reduction in antibiotic prescription rates was reported in study 1 but there was no significant change in rates of IE which showed an upward trend throughout the study period. Study 7 also reported an upward trend in incident IE throughout the study period but no significant change with introduction of the 2007 AHA guideline. In studies 3 and 4, there was a declining trajectory of hospital admission with IE throughout the study periods with no change following introduction of the 2007 AHA guideline.

Antibiotics and bacteriology

Only studies 1 and 5 from the UK analysed prescriptions of a single 3 g dose of oral amoxicillin (or a 600 mg dose of oral clindamycin for patients allergic to penicillin). In both studies, prescription data were obtained from the same national source and showed near identical 79% reductions following introduction of the 2008 NICE guideline. In study 1, discharge codes for streptococci were analysed, and notwithstanding the reduction in prophylactic antibiotic prescriptions, these showed no change in the upward trend of cases attributable to oral streptococcus although the authors acknowledged that the data were likely to be incomplete. Data on streptococcal isolates before-and-after guideline changes were also reported in three other studies, showing a decrease in studies 2 and 6 and no change in study 7. In study 6, the only one to report on streptococcal viridans isolates, rates did not change following the guideline change, and in study 5, the bacteriological data were incomplete to the point that it did not provide the investigators with 'any meaningful information'.

A literature review and survey of experts with analysis of severe complications occurring following IM BPG suggests that some of these reactions may, in fact, be something other than anaphylaxis. Suggested putative mechanisms for these reactions were the following: issues with preparation (powdered BPG, additives, diluents, or impurities), administration technique (e.g. accidental intravascular administration, poor technique causing too much pain), vasovagal-driven cardiac events or sudden death related to structural heart disease. The 2022 American Heart Association Presidential Advisory reinforced that these reactions appear more frequent in patients with severe forms of RHD, and suggesting oral antibiotics for in such cases (e.g. severe mitral stenosis, severe aortic stenosis or insufficiency, ventricular dysfunction, and/or severe symptoms) and defining best practices for BPG administration.

Importance of the findings of this systematic review goes beyond RF and RHD, as BPG is also used for the treatment of Syphilis and other endemic Treponemal diseases in low-income countries. Furthermore, worldwide usage of amoxicillin is still high and its indications broad, including ear, nose, and throat infections; Helicobacter pylori eradication, lower respiratory, and urinary tract infections; and skin and soft tissue infections, as well as prevention of endocarditis prior to dental procedures in high risk patients. In consequence, penicillin allergy testing of selected patients will improve antimicrobial stewardship worldwide.

Therapy of MSSA IE in patients allergic to or intolerant of β-lactams — Therapy for MSSA IE in patients truly unable to tolerate β-lactams is problematic. One decision analysis study concluded that patients with a questionable history of immediate-type hypersensitivity to penicillins in the context of IE caused by MSSA should be skin tested before starting antibiotic therapy. However, the limited availability of standardized skin test reagents makes testing impractical; instead, most experts endorse one of the published standard desensitization protocols. For patients with a well-defined history of nonanaphylactoid reactions to penicillins (eg, simple skin rash), a first-generation cephalosporin such as cefazolin is reasonable. Although cefazolin may be more susceptible to β-lactamase–mediated hydrolysis than nafcillin and less effective in the treatment of MSSA experimental IE, the clinical significance of these observations is unknown.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^34036405]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that despite a substantial decrease in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis in England since the introduction of NICE guideline No 64 in March 2008 there has been no significant increase in the number of cases of infective endocarditis, as measured using data from hospital episode statistics.

Some clinicians remain concerned that the NICE recommendation to stop antibiotic prophylaxis in the United Kingdom, and the reduced number of patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis in the United States and Europe as a result of the restriction of antibiotic prophylaxis to patients thought to be at high risk in the latest American Heart Associationand European Society of Cardiologyguidelines, will result in an increased incidence of infective endocarditis. Although one small study found no cause for concern after the change in the American Heart Association guidelinesthe present trial is the first large scale study to evaluate the effect of the NICE guideline recommendation to stop antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis.

Although these findings lend support to the NICE guideline recommendations and suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures is unlikely to be of value in preventing infective endocarditis in patients with a history of rheumatic fever or a heart murmur, our findings do not exclude the possibility that a small number of patients at highest risk, such as those with prosthetic valves, might benefit. Ongoing monitoring of the data is required for confirmation, and further studies are needed to determine if antibiotic prophylaxis has a role in protecting a small group of patients at highest risk from infective endocarditis.

Viridans group streptococci — antimicrobial resistance patterns and implications for IE prophylaxis report resistance to penicillin ranging from 17 to 50 percent and resistance to ceftriaxone from 22 to 42 percent; ceftriaxone was two to four times more active in vitro than was cefazolin. Resistance to macrolides ranged from 22 to 58 percent, and resistance to clindamycin ranged from 13 to 27 percent. In patients without cancer, 32 percent of strains were resistant to penicillin, and erythromycin resistance was 41 percent in otherwise healthy patients; after treatment with either azithromycin or clindamycin, the percentage of resistant streptococci increased to 82 percent and 71 percent, respectively. The impact of viridans group streptococcal resistance on antibiotic prevention of IE is unknown, it is impractical to recommend prophylaxis with only vancomycin or a fluoroquinolone, and there is no evidence that such therapy is effective for prophylaxis of IE.

### Penicillins for the prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in dentistry [^423f6f33]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia and it is believed that this may lead to bacterial endocarditis (BE) in a few people. Guidelines in many countries recommend that prior to invasive dental procedures antibiotics are administered to people at high risk of endocarditis. However, it is unclear whether the potential risks of this prophylaxis outweigh the potential benefits.

Objectives

To determine whether prophylactic penicillin administration compared to no such administration or placebo before invasive dental procedures in people at increased risk of BE influences mortality, serious illness or endocarditis incidence.

Search Strategy

The search strategy was developed on MEDLINE and adapted for use on the Cochrane Oral Health, Heart and Infectious Diseases Groups' Trials Registers (to October 2003), as well as the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2002), OLDMEDLINE (1966 to June 2002); EMBASE (1980 to June 2002); SIGLE (to June 2002); and the Meta-register of current controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Due to the low incidence of BE it was anticipated that few if any trials would be located. For this reason, cohort and case controlled studies were included where suitably matched control or comparison groups had been studied. The intervention was the administration of penicillin compared to no such administration before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk of BE. Cohort studies would need to follow those at increased risk and assess outcomes following any invasive dental procedures, grouping by whether prophylaxis was received. Included case control studies would need to match people who had developed endocarditis (and who were known to be at increased risk before undergoing an invasive dental procedure preceding the onset of endocarditis) with those at similar risk but who had not developed endocarditis. Outcomes of interest were: mortality or serious adverse event requiring hospital admission; development of endocarditis following any dental procedure in a defined time period; development of endocarditis due to other non-dental causes; any recorded adverse events to the antibiotics; and cost implications of the antibiotic provision for the care of those patients who develop endocarditis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion, then assessed quality and extracted data from the included study.

Main Results

No RCTs, CCTs or cohort studies were included. One case-control study met the inclusion criteria. It collected all the cases of endocarditis in the Netherlands over 2 years, finding a total of 24 people who developed endocarditis within 180 days of an invasive dental procedure, definitely requiring prophylaxis according to current guidelines and who were at increased risk of endocarditis due to a pre-existing cardiac problem. This study included participants who died because of the endocarditis (using proxys). Controls attended local cardiology outpatient clinics for similar cardiac problems, had undergone an invasive dental procedure within the past 180 days and were matched by age with the cases. No significant effect of penicillin prophylaxis on the incidence of endocarditis could be seen. No data were found on other outcomes.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is no evidence about whether penicillin prophylaxis is effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in people at risk who are about to undergo an invasive dental procedure. There is a lack of evidence to support published guidelines in this area. It is not clear whether the potential harms and costs of penicillin administration outweigh any beneficial effect. Ethically practitioners need to discuss the potential benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis with their patients before a decision is made about administration.

Current guidance recommends against the use of antibiotic prophylaxis around the time of dental intervention for the prevention of infective endocarditis. The authors report the case of a previously well-patient with an asymptomatic isolated ventricular septal defect (VSD) who developed evidence of infective systemic and pulmonary emboli following dental treatment. A diagnosis of severe endocarditis of a previously normal native mitral valve was made. She subsequently underwent surgical repair of her mitral valve, and closure of her VSD. She was deemed fit for discharge on parenteral antibiotics on the thirtieth postoperative day. The authors highlight the need for further re-evaluation of the issues surrounding antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis in the context of dental procedures.

American Heart Association antibiotic regimens — general principles for dental prophylaxis specify that an antibiotic for prophylaxis should be administered in a single dose before the procedure; if the preprocedural dose is inadvertently not given, the dosage may be administered up to two hours after the procedure, and administration after the procedure should be considered only when the patient did not receive the preprocedural dose. When fever or other manifestations of systemic infection are present, it is important to obtain blood cultures and other relevant tests before administration of antibiotics intended to prevent infective endocarditis.

Administration every 3 wk is recommended in certain high-risk situations. For duration, rheumatic fever with carditis and residual heart disease (persistent valvular heart disease) requires 10 y or until patient is 40 y of age (whichever is longer); with carditis but no residual heart disease, 10 y or until patient is ≥ 21 y of age (whichever is longer); without carditis, 5 y or until patient is ≥ 21 y of age (whichever is longer). In patients with documented valvular heart disease, the duration of rheumatic fever prophylaxis should be ≥ 10 y or until the patient is 40 y of age (whichever is longer), and lifelong prophylaxis may be recommended if the patient is at high risk of group A streptococcus exposure; secondary rheumatic heart disease prophylaxis is required even after valve replacement.

International guidelines: modified indications for antibiotic prophylaxis against IE

The change in guidance has prompted studies internationally to analyse the impact on the incidence of IE. Findings have been inconsistent and there remains considerable uncertainty about the epidemiological consequences of the new guideline recommendations. In order to help resolve this uncertainty, we have undertaken a systematic review of studies to determine whether the change in guidance has been associated with an increase in the incidence of IE. Study characteristics of interest were defined as follows:
Population: healthy population cohorts;
Intervention: modified guideline recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis against IE;
Comparisons: rate of incident IE before-and-after guideline modification;

The guideline expects that 'significantly fewer patients will receive IE prophylaxis for a dental procedure' and that 'studies are necessary to monitor the effects, if any, of these recommended changes in IE prophylaxis', while noting that 'because the incidence of IE is low, small changes in incidence may take years to detect'.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^75d594db]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

There is the concern that the period of follow-up was not long enough. However, in over 90% of cases the incubation period for infective endocarditis is less than six weeks, and other studies have used three months as the cut off for capturing all cases of infective endocarditis that will develop after exposure to the risk of infection. We therefore believe that if antibiotic prophylaxis was effective in preventing infective endocarditis the large decrease in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis that occurred after the introduction of the NICE guideline would have resulted in a detectable increase in cases during the 25 months of the study. Any such change should have been particularly noticeable among those cases where the causal organism was of possible oral streptococcal origin. Regardless, we intend to periodically monitor the rate of endocarditis in the English population over time.

The 78.6% decrease in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis in the months after the introduction of the guideline was large and suggests much better compliance than is often seen after policy changes in medicine. Compliance was particularly good among dentists who, as well as being strongly urged to adopt the new guidelines by the chief dental officer, NICE, and the dental press, were advised by the malpractice insurance organisations that it would be difficult to defend cases where the new guidelines had not been followed. A residual level of prescribing does, however, seem to persist at around 20% of the level before the guideline. There are several possible explanations for this. Firstly, the guideline allows antibiotic prophylaxis to be prescribed to patients who have previously received it and insist on continuing to have it, even after the rationale for the change in policy has been fully explained. Secondly, anecdotal evidence suggests that some cardiologists are pressurising dentists or, where dentists refuse to prescribe, the patient's general medical practitioner to provide antibiotic prophylaxis for patients they regard at particularly high risk of infective endocarditis, such as patients with significant congenital heart lesions, prosthetic heart valves, or a history of infective endocarditis. In other words, some clinicians in the United Kingdom may be implementing the European Society for Cardiology or American Heart Association guidelines rather than the NICE guideline. Finally, anecdotal evidence also suggests that a small proportion of dentists in the United Kingdom prescribe a 3 g dose of amoxicillin (or 600 mg dose of clindamycin) to treat acute dental infections. The precise contribution of each of these explanations to the residual 20% prescribing figure is hard to quantify.

Pharmacotherapy

Targeted antibiotic treatment is vital for PVE and requires ≈6 weeks of bactericidal multidrug therapy secondary to vegetation/biofilm tolerance and resistance to host defenses. 16 Empiric antibiotics for PVE, before culture speciation, should cover Staphylococci, Streptococci, Enterococci, and Gram‐negative pathogens. Specific recommendations from the European Society of Cardiology suggest vancomycin (30 mg/kg per day intravenous in 2 doses) and gentamicin (3 mg/kg per day intravenous/intramuscular in 1 dose) with rifampin to be added 3 to 5 days after treatment to target dormant bacteria. 16 In late PVE (after 1 year), vancomycin/gentamicin is preferred in patients who are allergic to penicillin, but in patients who are penicillin tolerant, instead of vancomycin, ampicillin with (flu)cloxacillin/oxacillin (12 g/day intravenous in 4–6 doses) can be used. 16

For blood culture‐negative pathogens, specific regimens with doxycycline and levofloxacin are suggested. For fungal infections, which can occur in intravenous drug users and immunocompromised patients, amphotericin B should be used for Candida with fluconazole, and voriconazole should be used for Aspergillus. 16 If the infection persists after a week of treatment, one needs to evaluate all lines and search for another source before surgery.

Current European perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines for TAVR/SAVR include dosing antibiotics (ie, intravenous cefazolin) before incision with redosing if necessary and termination within 2 days (Class IIa). They also recommend preoperative screening and treatment of nasal Staph. aureus (Class I).

Recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis of IE for other procedures have become more restricted, and there has been a dramatic shift in guidelines. 1 The American Heart Association updated their level of evidence from B (moderate quality) to C‐LD (limited data) in 2017 with regard to IE prophylaxis in TAVR patients. 42 Patients with surgical and transcatheter valves are still at highest risk of IE; therefore, antibiotic prophylaxis is justifiable with gingival/periapical teeth manipulation or breeching of the oral mucosa. 1, 16, 42

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^2f5ec3c8]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Infective endocarditis is a rare disease with a high morbidity and mortality. For more than 50 years antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive procedures has been the primary focus for preventing infective endocarditis and remains the standard of care for patients with the disease in most parts of the world. The rationale for such treatment is to reduce or eliminate the bacteraemia that may result from such procedures. A particular focus is on antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, as oral streptococci have been implicated in between 18% and 65% of cases of infective endocarditis, although most studies suggest the proportion is closer to 35–45%. Regardless, little or no firm scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing infective endocarditis, and two case-control studies provide evidence that dental treatment is unlikely to be a risk factor. Some authors therefore suggest that the current focus on antibiotic prophylaxis is an unproved, expensive, and potentially harmful standard of care, whereas others argue that it prevents cases of infective endocarditis. Owing to ethical and medicolegal issues, cost, and the large number of patients necessary to achieve statistically significant results, a randomised placebo controlled trial of antibiotic prophylaxis has never been attempted.

In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom produced controversial new guidance recommending the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for all patients at risk of infective endocarditis undergoing dental and a wide range of other invasive procedures. Although the American Heart Associationand the European Society for Cardiologychanged their guidelines around the same time, they did not recommend the complete cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis. Both continued to recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with prosthetic heart valves undergoing invasive dental procedures, patients with cardiac valves repaired using prosthetic material, and patients with significant congenital heart lesions, a heart transplant with valvular lesions, or a history of endocarditis.

We hypothesised that by studying national prescribing data as well as data recorded for all inpatient hospital activity in the United Kingdom, we would be able to quantify the effect of the new NICE guideline on prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis and the incidence of infective endocarditis. We describe the effect of the guideline on the prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis in England and the changes in the incidence of cases of infective endocarditis and deaths from the disease in hospital over that period.

Secondary antibiotic prophylaxis with regular intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (BPG) is the cornerstone of rheumatic heart disease management. However, there is a growing body of evidence that patients with rheumatic heart disease who have severe valvular heart disease with or without reduced ventricular function may be dying from cardiovascular compromise following BPG injections. This advisory responds to these concerns and is intended to: (1) raise awareness, (2) provide risk stratification, and (3) provide strategies for risk reduction. Based on available evidence and expert opinion, we have divided patients into low- and elevated-risk groups, based on symptoms and the severity of underlying heart disease. Patients with elevated risk include those with severe mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, and aortic insuffiency; those with decreased left ventricular systolic dysfunction; and those with no symptoms. For these patients, we believe the risk of adverse reaction to BPG, specifically cardiovascular compromise, may outweigh its theoretical benefit. For patients with elevated risk, we newly advise that oral prophylaxis should be strongly considered. In addition, we advocate for a multifaceted strategy for vasovagal risk reduction in all patients with rheumatic heart disease receiving BPG. As current guidelines recommend, all low-risk patients without a history of penicillin allergy or anaphylaxis should continue to be prescribed BPG for secondary antibiotic prophylaxis. We publish this advisory in the hopes of saving lives and avoiding events that can have devastating effects on patient and clinician confidence in BPG.

Prevention of Bacterial Endocarditis

Although no controlled clinical efficacy trials have been conducted, oral erythromycin has been recommended by the American Heart Association for prevention of bacterial endocarditis in penicillin- allergic patients with prosthetic cardiac valves, most congenital cardiac malformations, surgically constructed systemic pulmonary shunts, rheumatic or other acquired valvular dysfunction, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS), previous history of bacterial endocarditis and mitral valve prolapse with insufficiency when they undergo dental procedures and surgical procedures of the upper respiratory tract.2

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of erythromycin and other antibacterial drugs, erythromycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Background

Infective endocarditis is a severe infection arising in the lining of the chambers of the heart. It can be caused by fungi, but most often is caused by bacteria. Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia, which could lead to bacterial endocarditis in a small proportion of people. The incidence of bacterial endocarditis is low, but it has a high mortality rate. Guidelines in many countries have recommended that antibiotics be administered to people at high risk of endocarditis prior to invasive dental procedures. However, guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales states that antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis is not recommended routinely for people undergoing dental procedures. This is an update of a review that we first conducted in 2004 and last updated in 2013.

Objectives

Primary objective To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration, compared to no antibiotic administration or placebo, before invasive dental procedures in people at risk or at high risk of bacterial endocarditis, influences mortality, serious illness or the incidence of endocarditis. Secondary objectives To determine whether the effect of dental antibiotic prophylaxis differs in people with different cardiac conditions predisposing them to increased risk of endocarditis, and in people undergoing different high risk dental procedures. Harms Had we foundno evidence from randomised controlled trials or cohort studies on whether prophylactic antibiotics affected mortality or serious illness, and we had found evidence from these or case-control studies suggesting that prophylaxis with antibiotics reduced the incidence of endocarditis, then we would also have assessed whether the harms of prophylaxis with single antibiotic doses, such as with penicillin (amoxicillin 2 g or 3 g) before invasive dental procedures, compared with no antibiotic or placebo, equalled the benefits in prevention of endocarditis in people at high risk of this disease.

Search Methods

An information specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 10 May 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies SELECTION CRITERIA: Due to the low incidence of bacterial endocarditis, we anticipated that few if any trials would be located. For this reason, we included cohort and case-control studies with suitably matched control or comparison groups. The intervention was antibiotic prophylaxis, compared to no antibiotic prophylaxis or placebo, before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk of bacterial endocarditis. Cohort studies would need to follow at-risk individuals and assess outcomes following any invasive dental procedures, grouping participants according to whether or not they had received prophylaxis. Case-control studies would need to match people who had developed endocarditis after undergoing an invasive dental procedure (and who were known to be at increased risk before undergoing the procedure) with those at similar risk who had not developed endocarditis. Our outcomes of interest were mortality or serious adverse events requiring hospital admission; development of endocarditis following any dental procedure in a defined time period; development of endocarditis due to other non-dental causes; any recorded adverse effects of the antibiotics; and the cost of antibiotic provision compared to that of caring for patients who developed endocarditis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search records, selected studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias in the included study and extracted data from the included study. As an author team, we judged the certainty of the evidence identified for the main comparison and key outcomes using GRADE criteria. We presented the main results in a summary of findings table.

Main Results

Our new search did not find any new studies for inclusion since the last version of the review in 2013. No randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) or cohort studies were included in the previous versions of the review, but one case-control study met the inclusion criteria. The trial authors collected information on 48 people who had contracted bacterial endocarditis over a specific two-year period and had undergone a medical or dental procedure with an indication for prophylaxis within the past 180 days. These people were matched to a similar group of people who had not contracted bacterial endocarditis. All study participants had undergone an invasive medical or dental procedure. The two groups were compared to establish whether those who had received preventive antibiotics (penicillin) were less likely to have developed endocarditis. The authors found no significant effect of penicillin prophylaxis on the incidence of endocarditis. No data on other outcomes were reported. The level of certainty we have about the evidence is very low.

Authors' Conclusions

There remains no clear evidence about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in at-risk people who are about to undergo an invasive dental procedure. We cannot determine whether the potential harms and costs of antibiotic administration outweigh any beneficial effect. Ethically, practitioners should discuss the potential benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis with their patients before a decision is made about administration.

### Penicillin reactions in patients with severe rheumatic heart disease: a presidential advisory from the American Heart Association [^61d01b6d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

RISK MITIGATION

Based on the available evidence presented in this advisory, the expert working group believes patients with RHD who have severe valvular heart disease or heart failure may be at elevated risk of cardiovascular compromise and sudden death following BPG administration. In addition, the benefit of secondary prophylaxis is questionable given that the purpose of secondary prophylaxis is to prevent progression to severe valve lesions. Thus, we believe the risk of adverse reactions to BPG in patients at elevated risk outweighs its theoretical benefit. For these patients at elevated risk, we newly advise that oral prophylaxis, if reliably available and affordable, should be strongly considered (Table 1). We recognize in making this recommendation that there are availability concerns associated with oral prophylaxis in some settings, which will need to be considered. In many cases, regular prescribing of oral long‐term prophylaxis would require a commitment from government in order to ensure availability. Additionally, although unequivocally inferior, reducing the risk of acute rheumatic fever recurrence by 87% compared with 96% with BPG, high adherence to oral penicillin provides reasonable protection against recurrent group A beta‐haemolytic streptococci infection (71% versus 91% with BPG), and eliminates the risk of injection‐related vasovagal syncope, which may lead to increased mortality in this elevated‐risk group. Guidelines for oral prophylaxis can be drawn from American Heart Association (AHA)or World Health Organization (WHO)recommendations or from local guidelines and best practices, where they exist. Adherence support for those taking oral prophylaxis deserves special attention (at least twice‐daily dosing) and should be tailored as needed to promote high adherence.

### Antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis… [^8d69cce3]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Infective endocarditis is an infection inside the chambers of the heart or on the heart valves. Infectious endocarditis may be triggered by a clot forming on the lining of the heart or on one of its valves in response to damage on the valve surface. Once this clot forms, bacteria that may be present in the bloodstream can stick to the clot and proliferate within it, eventually interfering with the heart's function. In normal hearts, temporary bacteremia usually has no consequences. However, if there are clots or injury to the heart lining and valves or the person has a prosthetic valve, an immune response to kill bacteria in the clot might not be triggered, and infective endocarditis can develop. Prevention Lifelong antibiotics are not necessary to prevent infective endocarditis.

Prophylactic antibiotics should be given to people who are most likely to have severe complications if they develop infective endocarditis. In such people, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended before dental procedures, which have the highest risk of causing bacteria to enter the blood. There is no evidence to recommend using antibiotics before procedures on the gastrointestinal or urinary tracts. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered in people with Prosthetic heart valves Past episodes of infective endocarditis Heart transplants who develop disease in their heart valves Congenital heart diseases who have had prosthetic materials or devices placed in their heart within the last 6 months.

Congenital heart diseases whose heart defects have not been completely fixed or have remaining defects at or near where a prosthetic patch or device was placed Antibiotic use For patients who require prophylactic antibiotics, these medications ideally should be given before a dental procedure. If this dose is missed, patients can receive antibiotics up to 2 hours after the procedure. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic is oral penicillin. People who are allergic to penicillin can be given cephalosporins, macrolides, or clindamycin. There are injectable forms of these antibiotics for people who cannot take medication by mouth.

### International guideline changes and the incidence of infective endocarditis: a systematic review [^bc9d12cf]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

The systematic review was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline.

Eligibility criteria

Studies were included based on a methodological approach taking into consideration the type of study, when the study was published, the study population and whether the study provided estimates of IE diagnostic rates before-and-after changes to guideline recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis. Specific inclusion criteria were for studies with the following characteristics:
Publication in the English language;
Publication after the change in AHA antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines in 2007;
Provision of estimates of IE incidence in the study population before the change of antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines and again for at least 1 year afterwards.

Information sources and search strategy

PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for relevant articles published between 1 January 2007 and 1 December 2015. The search strategy, tailored to capture all variations in diagnostic, therapeutic and policy terminology, used mesh terms as follows: 'infective endocarditis', 'IE', 'endocarditis', 'infectious endocarditis', 'prophylaxis', 'prevention', 'antibiotics', 'guideline', 'recommendation' and 'policy'. Two independent reviewers applied the same database search methodology. Any discrepancies in search findings were resolved by consensus. All search results were downloaded to the EndNote Bibliography database manager where duplicates were excluded and the remaining studies were more carefully assessed prior to inclusion. There was no exclusion by population group. Primary exclusion was based on the title, abstract and key words. Potentially relevant articles were reviewed by both reviewers, and consensus about inclusion was reached. If the abstract was insufficient to formulate a final decision, the full text was reviewed to assess suitability for the purpose of this review.

Selection and data collection process

To avoid selection bias, reviewers independently conducted the search using the proposed search strategy. All relevant articles selected by the independent reviewers were then discussed by the reviewers before inclusion in the review. Each of the studies was then individually reviewed to summarise its findings in a table. After selection of the relevant studies, the data were extracted by one author into a table with predefined variables to summarise all the key points with respect to each of the included studies.

Quality of the evidence

Individual studies included in the review had a quality control assessment against modified STROBE checklist criteria for observational studies, particularly directed at assessing sources of bias.

Data synthesis

No formal quantitative pooling of results was performed based on the heterogeneity of the studies in general and the data in particular. Synthesis of the data was performed qualitatively, and clinical implications are drawn.

Oral administration is preferred, with penicillins and cephalosporins associated with a lower rate of Clostridioides difficile infection when compared with clindamycin. 39 There are no RCTs in support of one agent vs another; however, amoxicillin seems to be the most commonly used and carries the lowest risk of adverse events overall. 36, 40, 41.

In general, a combination of vancomycin or daptomycin and a β-lactam like ceftriaxone.

Vancomycin Daptomycin: Most authors prefer a dose of 8 to 10 mg/kg if S aureus is being targeted or 10 to 12 mg/kg if enterococcus is being targeted. Alternative, linezolid Early.

### Prevention of infective endocarditis: guidelines from the American Heart Association: a guideline from the American Heart Association rheumatic fever, endocarditis and Kawasaki disease committee, council on cardiovascular disease in the young, and the council on clinical cardiology, council on cardiovascular surgery and anesthesia, and the quality of care and outcomes research interdisciplinary working group [^d101de04]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) background and impetus for guideline revision notes that infective endocarditis (IE) is an uncommon but life-threatening infection and that despite advances in diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, surgical techniques and management of complications, patients with IE still have substantial morbidity and mortality related to this condition. Since the last American Heart Association publication on prevention of IE, many authorities, societies and the conclusions of published studies have questioned the efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent IE in patients who undergo a dental, gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) tract procedure and have suggested that the AHA guidelines should be revised.

Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis — vancomycin-based recommendations: Vancomycin should be administered only if a patient is unable to tolerate penicillin or ampicillin (Class I; Level of Evidence B). It is reasonable that patients with NVE receive 6 weeks of vancomycin-gentamicin therapy and that patients with PVE receive at least 6 weeks of therapy (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). Patients with E faecalis IE caused by strains that are intrinsically resistant to penicillin should be treated with a combination of vancomycin plus gentamicin (Class I; Level of Evidence B).

β-Hemolytic streptococci (groups B, C, F, and G) infective endocarditis — strains of group B, C, F, and G streptococci are slightly more resistant to penicillin than are strains of group A streptococci, and in these patients, the addition of gentamicin to penicillin or to ceftriaxone for at least the first 2 weeks of a 4- to 6-week course of antimicrobial therapy for group B, C, and G streptococcal IE may be considered; there is a clinical impression that early cardiac surgical intervention has improved overall survival rates among treated patients with β-hemolytic streptococcal IE, and consultation with an infectious diseases specialist during treatment is recommended.

### Perioperative use of antibiotics: preventing and treating perioperative infections [^2b818b88]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Prevention of postoperative wound infection in dermatologic surgery and appropriate use of antibiotics to prevent endocarditis and joint-replacement infections are controversial issues. Dermatologists often may misunderstand the use of antibiotics to prevent endocarditis, surgical site infections, and prosthesis infections. In order to prevent endocarditis associated with surgical procedures, the American Heart Association (AHA) has developed clinical practice guidelines that apply to surgical patients with prosthetic cardiac valves, previous bacterial endocarditis, mitral valve prolapse with valvular regurgitation, or thickened leaflets. For these patients, the AHA recommends that antistaphylococcal antibiotics (eg, cephalosporins) be given before surgery only when the procedure involves significant risk of bacteremia (eg, incision into infected tissues). Routine dermatologic surgery of intact skin with sterile technique usually does not require prophylaxis. Antibiotic prophylaxis may also be justified in surgical patients who are at moderate to high risk for wound site infection. Patients should be given prophylactic antibiotics shortly before surgery or as soon as the risk is recognized. In patients allergic to penicillin, cross reactions are unlikely for most second- and third-generation agents (cefdinir, cefuroxime, cefixime, ceftibuten), because these agents lack a side chain similar to penicillin. By identifying the risk of infection, being aware of the risks of antibiotic therapy, and weighing the risks and benefits of each option, dermatologists can devise individualized treatments, thus optimizing outcomes of their patients.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^77bb4411]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To quantify the change in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures for patients at risk of infective endocarditis, and any concurrent change in the incidence of infective endocarditis, following introduction of a clinical guideline from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in March 2008 recommending the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in the United Kingdom.

Design

Before and after study.

Setting

England. Population All patients admitted to hospital in England with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of acute or subacute infective endocarditis.

Main Outcome Measures

Monthly number of prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis consisting of a single 3 g oral dose of amoxicillin or a single 600 mg oral dose of clindamycin, and monthly number of cases of infective endocarditis, infective endocarditis related deaths in hospital, or cases of infective endocarditis with a possible oral origin for streptococci.

Results

After the introduction of the NICE guideline there was a highly significant 78.6% reduction (P < 0.001) in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis, from a mean 10,277 (SD 1068) prescriptions per month to 2292 (SD 176). Evidence that the general upward trend in cases of infective endocarditis before the guideline was significantly altered after the guideline was lacking (P = 0.61). Using a non-inferiority test, an increase in the number of cases of 9.3% or more could be excluded after the introduction of the guideline. Similarly an increase in infective endocarditis related deaths in hospital of 12.3% or more could also be excluded.

Conclusion

Despite a 78.6% reduction in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis after the introduction of the NICE guideline, this study excluded any large increase in the incidence of cases of or deaths from infective endocarditis in the two years after the guideline. Although this lends support to the guideline, ongoing data monitoring is needed to confirm this, and further clinical trials should determine if antibiotic prophylaxis still has a role in protecting some patients at particularly high risk.

### The cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis [^b6adea63]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Results

In comparison with no AP, both amoxicillin and clindamycin AP were associated with lower costs and better health outcomes (Table 5) for both high-risk and all-at-risk populations. In the all-at-risk group, there were mean cost savings of £2.47 (95% credible interval [CrI], £0.48–£6.96) ($3.29; CrI $0.64–$9.26; €2.96, CrI €0.58–€8.35) per person with amoxicillin AP and £3.65 (95% CrI, £0.69–£8.14) ($4.86; 95% CrI, $0.92–$10.83; €4.38, 95% CrI, €0.83–€9.77) with clindamycin AP, in comparison with no AP (the difference between the drugs being driven by the lower cost of clindamycin: £1.14 versus £2.28 [$1.52 versus $3.03; €1.37 versus €2.74]). With an estimated 2.24 million dental procedures per year in this population (Table 1), AP would lead to savings of £5.5 million to £8.2 million per annum ($7.3 million to $10.9 million; €6.6 million to €9.8 million). We calculated a mean health improvement of 0.0012 (95% CrI, 0.000–0.003) and 0.0010 (95% CrI, 0.000–0.002) QALYs per person for amoxicillin and clindamycin, respectively (equivalent to 2687 QALYs gained per annum at the population level if amoxicillin AP were used for all-at-risk patients).

Table 5.
Costs and Effects of Antibiotic Prophylaxis Versus No Antibiotic Prophylaxis: Base Case Analysis

These cost savings were substantially greater in the high-risk group at a mean of ≈£40 ($53.2; €48.00) per patient (or £4.0 million [$5.3 million; €4.8 million] per annum in England on the basis of an estimated 100 000 dental procedures in this population). The most effective strategy would be amoxicillin, leading to gains of 0.0107 QALYs per person (or 1071 QALYs for the population) per annum.

American Heart Association infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis decision context — underlying cardiac conditions and dental, gastrointestinal (GI), or genitourinary (GU) procedures: Underlying cardiac conditions are described as representing a lifetime increased risk of acquisition of IE, and when using previous AHA guidelines to decide on IE prophylaxis for a patient scheduled for a dental, GI or GU tract procedure, clinicians were required to base decisions on population-based studies of IE acquisition risk. Clinicians also had to weigh the potential efficacy of IE prophylaxis against the risk of adverse reaction to the antibiotic prescribed and consider medicolegal risk, with the guideline noting for dental procedures that IE prophylaxis may prevent only an exceedingly small number of IE cases.

3.2.4 Publication Bias

Funnel plot inspection and Egger's test revealed some evidence of publication bias in patients with heart failure (p = 0.0038, Supporting Information S1: Figure 34). No publication bias was observed for mortality rate (p = 0.2986, Supporting Information S1: Figure 35) and readmission rate (p = 0.5806, Supporting Information S1: Figure 36) during the treatment period, for mortality rate (p = 0.8285, Supporting Information S1: Figure 37), relapse rate (p = 0.0205, Supporting Information S1: Figure 38), readmission rate (p = 0.7901, Supporting Information S1: Figure 39), and patients requiring valve replacement or cardiac surgery (p = 0.3503, Supporting Information S1: Figure 40) during the follow‐up period, and for patients having a drug allergy or complication (p = 0.0834, Supporting Information S1: Figure 41). Remaining outcomes could not be assessed as they were reported in fewer than 10 studies.

Infective endocarditis (IE) — bactericidal drugs are needed to sterilize vegetations in IE with high bacterial densities; for enterococci, bactericidal activity can be achieved by combining certain β-lactam antibiotics (penicillin, ampicillin, or piperacillin) with an aminoglycoside, and the bactericidal effect achieved by combining agents that alone only inhibit growth is called synergy; the rate of bactericidal activity against some other organisms can also be enhanced by a β-lactam plus an aminoglycoside.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^6c707cc5]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin therapy for enterococcal infective endocarditis when β-lactams cannot be used: Vancomycin should be administered only if a patient is unable to tolerate penicillin or ampicillin. Combinations of penicillin or ampicillin with gentamicin are preferable to combined vancomycin-gentamicin because of the potential increased risk of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity with the vancomycin-gentamicin combination. It is reasonable that patients with NVE receive 6 weeks of vancomycin-gentamicin therapy and that patients with PVE receive at least 6 weeks of therapy.
