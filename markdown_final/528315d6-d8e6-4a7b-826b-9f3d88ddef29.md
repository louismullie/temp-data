## Question

What are the current guidelines for elective surgery post Covid?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the current guidelines for timing elective surgery after COVID-19 infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the evolution of guidance from early pandemic to the present. Then, I should verify the most current consensus statements and their risk-stratified timing recommendations. Next, I will examine the strength and limitations of the evidence base, including vaccination effects and variant considerations. After that, I should integrate specialty-specific nuances and infection control requirements. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified algorithm and note areas of uncertainty and ongoing updates, ensuring I anchor each step to the best available sources.

> Let me first confirm the historical baseline so I don't jump to conclusions. Early in the pandemic, multidisciplinary UK consensus recommended avoiding elective surgery within 7 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to markedly elevated perioperative morbidity and mortality, with risk appearing to normalize after that window; this 7-week deferral became a widely cited standard and was reiterated in subsequent updates during the early variant era [^114K3DKL] [^114jg7yp] [^117BjBAM].

> Wait, let me verify the most current shift, because I recall a move toward shorter deferrals in some contexts. The 2023 update from the same UK bodies now recommends that elective surgery not be undertaken within 2 weeks of diagnosis, and for low-risk patients undergoing low-risk procedures, surgery can proceed after 2 weeks; for higher-risk patients or higher-risk procedures between 2 and 7 weeks, individualized risk assessment is required, and there is no evidence to support routine delays beyond 7 weeks for fully recovered or mild cases, which represents a meaningful relaxation from the earlier blanket 7-week rule [^1154KjfD].

> Hold on, I should verify the infectiousness window before discussing risk stratification. The guidance consistently advises that elective surgery should not occur within 10 days of diagnosis because patients may remain infectious, with longer isolation for severe disease or immunocompromised hosts; this aligns with broader transmission-based precautions and supports the 2-week minimum deferral to ensure both infectivity and early post-acute risk have declined [^114jg7yp] [^113hfZ1v].

> I need to check the evidence underpinning the 7-week concept, because I don't want to overstate it. Large prospective datasets from the GlobalSurg-COVIDSurg collaborative showed that perioperative COVID-19 was associated with substantially increased 30-day mortality and pulmonary complications, with risk declining and approximating baseline after about 7 weeks; this pattern informed the original 7-week recommendation and remains a key anchor for counseling patients about timing trade-offs [^112E5t37] [^117BjBAM].

> Let me consider vaccination, because that could change the calculus. Contemporary data suggest that in fully vaccinated patients, postoperative mortality does not significantly differ between those with and without recent COVID-19 within an 8-week window, implying that vaccination meaningfully mitigates perioperative risk. However, I should be cautious, as these are observational data and not all studies distinguish by severity or variant, so shared decision-making remains essential [^116Yaz3V] [^1154KjfD].

> I should double-check the role of disease severity, since not all COVID-19 is equal. Patients with moderate-to-severe infection, especially those hospitalized or with persistent symptoms, appear to carry elevated postoperative risk even beyond 7 weeks; in such cases, longer delays, specialist assessment, and optimization are advised, whereas patients with mild or asymptomatic infection and full recovery may proceed earlier with individualized risk assessment [^114jg7yp] [^1154KjfD] [^117VcLQ3].

> Next, I should review specialty-specific guidance to ensure I'm not missing nuances. For arthroplasty, systematic review and specialty guidance support stratified delays: about 4–8 weeks for asymptomatic, 6–8 weeks for mild-to-moderate after symptom resolution, and at least 12 weeks after hospital discharge for severe disease. For laparoscopic and other urgent general surgery contexts, expert groups have conditionally recommended delaying elective operations beyond 6 weeks when feasible. And for bleeding and coagulopathy concerns, major elective surgery should be avoided in active COVID-19 coagulopathy, with otherwise standard hemostatic management after recovery absent residual symptoms [^115eQSFa] [^115jmF4v] [^112j9giB] [^111DUdMe].

> I need to ensure infection prevention and testing recommendations are aligned with current community transmission dynamics. Facilities should implement tiered precautions based on community levels, use N95 or higher respirators for aerosol-generating procedures, and consider preoperative testing close to the day of surgery. Importantly, repeat NAAT testing in recently recovered patients can be misleading due to prolonged nucleic acid positivity, so antigen testing is preferred if reassessment is needed in the 31–90 day window, and decisions should integrate test timing, local prevalence, and resource constraints [^11663VNG] [^114LZUsM].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach, and I will sanity-check it against the cited guidance. For low-risk patients undergoing low-risk procedures, proceed after 2 weeks if fully recovered. For patients between 2 and 7 weeks or those with higher baseline risk or more complex surgery, perform individualized risk assessment using validated tools, document shared decision-making, and consider regional anesthesia when appropriate. For moderate-to-severe COVID-19 or persistent symptoms, extend delay beyond 7 weeks when feasible and optimize comorbidities and functional status. Across all strata, avoid elective surgery within 10 days of diagnosis and ensure vaccination is up to date before proceeding [^1154KjfD] [^114jg7yp] [^112E5t37].

> But wait, what about the quality of evidence and the need for ongoing updates. Much of the perioperative COVID-19 literature is observational and heterogenous, and while large cohorts provide robust signals, causality and variant-specific effects remain uncertain; IDSA notes very low certainty for using repeat NAAT to guide timing, and guideline panels emphasize that recommendations should be revisited as new data emerge, reinforcing the importance of living guidance and local policy alignment [^113Y4RME] [^1152KdjB] [^116HUUKf].

> In conclusion, I should confirm that the current trajectory favors a more nuanced, risk-stratified timing model rather than a rigid 7-week rule for all. The 2023 UK consensus represents a pragmatic evolution: minimum 2-week deferral for all, early clearance after 2 weeks for low-risk scenarios, individualized assessment for 2–7 weeks, and consideration of longer delays for moderate-to-severe disease or persistent symptoms; throughout, prioritize vaccination, shared decision-making, and infection control practices tailored to local epidemiology and resources [^1154KjfD] [^116DW5Ey] [^11663VNG].

Current guidance is to **delay elective surgery for at least 7 weeks** after a COVID-19 diagnosis unless the benefits of earlier surgery outweigh the increased risk of postoperative complications [^114K3DKL] [^114jg7yp]. For low-risk patients undergoing low-risk procedures, surgery may proceed after **2 weeks** if fully recovered and asymptomatic, following individualized risk assessment and shared decision-making [^1154KjfD]. Elective surgery should not be scheduled within **10 days** of a positive test due to infectivity and elevated perioperative risk [^114jg7yp]. Persistent symptoms or severe COVID-19 may require longer delays, and vaccination status should be optimized before surgery [^114jg7yp] [^112E5t37].

---

## Timing of elective surgery after COVID-19 infection

### General recommendation

The general recommendation is a **7-week delay**: elective surgery should generally be delayed for at least 7 weeks after a COVID-19 diagnosis unless the benefits of earlier surgery outweigh the increased risk of postoperative complications [^114K3DKL] [^114jg7yp]. For **low-risk patients and procedures**, elective surgery may proceed after 2 weeks if the patient is fully recovered, asymptomatic, and has undergone individualized risk assessment and shared decision-making [^1154KjfD].

---

### Infectious period considerations

Within the infectious period, **10-day minimum** — elective surgery should not be scheduled within 10 days of a positive COVID-19 test due to infectivity and increased perioperative risk [^114jg7yp] [^113hfZ1v]. For **severe or critical cases**, a **15–20-day minimum** — patients with severe or critical COVID-19 may require 15–20 days before surgery due to prolonged infectivity and higher risk of complications [^1125a1oT] [^113hfZ1v].

---

### Factors influencing timing decisions

Several factors influence the **timing of elective surgery** after COVID-19:

| **Factor** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|
| Severity of COVID-19 infection | - Mild/asymptomatic: 7-week delay generally sufficient [^114K3DKL] <br/> - Moderate/severe: longer delay may be necessary [^114jg7yp] |
| Persistence of symptoms | - Persistent symptoms: consider longer delay beyond 7 weeks [^114jg7yp] <br/> - Resolved symptoms: proceed after 7 weeks if fully recovered [^114K3DKL] |
| Vaccination status | - Vaccinated patients: lower risk, may allow earlier surgery after 2 weeks if low-risk procedure [^1154KjfD] <br/> - Unvaccinated patients: higher risk, adhere to 7-week delay [^114jg7yp] |
| Type and complexity of surgery | - Low-risk procedures: may proceed earlier after individualized assessment [^1154KjfD] <br/> - High-risk procedures: adhere to 7-week delay or longer if symptoms persist [^114jg7yp] |
| Patient comorbidities | - Significant comorbidities: longer delay may be necessary [^1117uxfh] <br/> - Minimal comorbidities: standard 7-week delay sufficient [^114K3DKL] |

## Risks associated with early elective surgery after COVID-19

Early elective surgery after COVID-19 infection is associated with **significantly increased risks** of postoperative complications, including:

- **Increased mortality**: Higher 30-day mortality rates have been observed in patients undergoing surgery within 7 weeks of COVID-19 infection [^116DW5Ey].

- **Respiratory complications**: Elevated risk of postoperative pulmonary complications, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [^116DW5Ey].

- **Cardiovascular complications**: Increased risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and thromboembolic events [^1152KdjB].

- **Overall morbidity**: Higher overall postoperative morbidity and longer hospital stays [^notfound].

---

## Preoperative assessment and precautions

Before proceeding with elective surgery after COVID-19, the following **assessments and precautions** are recommended:

- **Clinical assessment**: Evaluate for persistent symptoms, functional status, and comorbidities [^114jg7yp].

- **COVID-19 testing**: Consider preoperative testing, especially if surgery is planned within 7 weeks of infection [^1154KjfD].

- **Vaccination status**: Ensure patients are fully vaccinated before surgery, as vaccination reduces postoperative complications [^112E5t37] [^1152KdjB].

- **Shared decision-making**: Discuss risks and benefits of proceeding with surgery, including potential complications and delays [^114jg7yp] [^114aHjMj].

---

## Special considerations for different surgical procedures

Certain surgical procedures may require **additional precautions** or longer delays:

- **Orthopedic surgery**: Delay arthroplasty procedures for at least 6–8 weeks after COVID-19 infection, with longer delays for severe cases [^115eQSFa].

- **Cardiac surgery**: High-risk procedures may require longer delays and careful assessment of cardiovascular status [^notfound].

- **Cancer surgery**: Time-sensitive cancer surgeries may proceed earlier with individualized risk assessment and enhanced precautions [^113RW4p6].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **General recommendation**: Delay elective surgery for at least 7 weeks after COVID-19 infection [^114K3DKL].

- **Low-risk patients**: May proceed after 2 weeks if fully recovered, asymptomatic, and after individualized risk assessment [^1154KjfD].

- **Infectious period**: Do not schedule elective surgery within 10 days of a positive COVID-19 test [^114jg7yp].

- **Persistent symptoms**: Consider longer delays beyond 7 weeks if symptoms persist [^114jg7yp].

- **Vaccination**: Ensure patients are fully vaccinated before surgery [^112E5t37].

---

Current guidance recommends a **7-week delay** for elective surgery after COVID-19, with exceptions for low-risk patients and procedures after 2 weeks if fully recovered. Persistent symptoms, severe infection, and high-risk surgeries may require longer delays, and vaccination status should be optimized before proceeding [^114jg7yp].

### Timing of surgery after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection [^115jyFnU]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor — The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for infection prevention experts, healthcare providers, and hospital administrative personnel. National, state, and local hospital leaders have had to rapidly adapt and update policies based on personal protective equipment and testing constraints. More recently, emerging data on presymptomatic transmission and prolonged viral shedding have created additional challenges. ‐ As the pandemic continues and states begin to allow easing of nonemergent surgery restrictions, stakeholders are now faced with the task of developing policies for surgeries on recovered COVID-19–positive patients. Based on current data for COVID-19 and prior research on viral respiratory illnesses, we propose a rational surgical policy for such patients.

Most concerns with regard to surgery in recovered COVID-19 positive patients are related to the uncertainty of the postsymptomatic infectious period. Several studies have demonstrated prolonged or intermittent viral shedding in otherwise recovered, asymptomatic patients. ‐

Accordingly, the CDC recently extended the time that recovered COVID-19 patients should remain isolated. Specifically, recovered patients should isolate for at least 10 days rather than 7 days after symptom onset and for at least 3 days after recovery. In its update, the CDC noted that replication-competent virus has not been successfully cultured > 9 days after onset of illness, but data remains either unpublished or consists of very small cohorts. To this point, the CDC has recognized such uncertainty and has allowed consideration of a more stringent test-based strategy, citing "… circumstances under which there is an especially low tolerance for postrecovery SARS-CoV-2 shedding and risk of transmitting infection. In such circumstances, employers and local public health authorities may choose to apply more stringent recommendations, such as a test-based strategy, if feasible, or a requirement for a longer period of isolation after illness resolution".

Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

The impact of vaccination and new SARS-CoV-2 variants on peri-operative outcomes is unclear. We aimed to update previously published consensus recommendations on timing of elective surgery after SARS-CoV-2 infection to assist policymakers, administrative staff, clinicians and patients. The guidance remains that patients should avoid elective surgery within 7weeks of infection, unless the benefits of doing so exceed the risk of waiting. We recommend individualised multidisciplinary risk assessment for patients requiring elective surgery within 7weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This should include baseline mortality risk calculation and assessment of risk modifiers (patient factors; SARS-CoV-2 infection; surgical factors). Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with previous variants increased peri-operative mortality risk three-fold throughout the 6weeks after infection, and assumptions that asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection does not add risk are currently unfounded. Patients with persistent symptoms and those with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 may require a longer delay than 7weeks. Elective surgery should not take place within 10days of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, predominantly because the patient may be infectious, which is a risk to surgical pathways, staff and other patients. We now emphasise that timing of surgery should include the assessment of baseline and increased risk, optimising vaccination and functional status, and shared decision-making. While these recommendations focus on the omicron variant and current evidence, the principles may also be of relevance to future variants. As further data emerge, these recommendations may be revised.

### Association of time to surgery after COVID-19 infection with risk of postoperative cardiovascular morbidity [^113kum63]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The highly variable presentation and long-term effects of COVID-19 infections have also led investigators to question the association between asymptomatic vs symptomatic infections and outcomes after surgery. Although one smaller observational study found an increased risk of mortality and pulmonary complications in asymptomatic surgical patients, results were not replicated in a larger cohort of asymptomatic patients presenting for elective surgery. Our study builds on this work by examining a large population and evaluating a wide array of significant postoperative complications. We did not find a statistically significant temporal association between the timing of surgery and postoperative outcomes among patients who were asymptomatic at the time of preoperative testing (aOR, 0.98 [per 10 days]; 95% CI, 0.96–1.00; p = 0.06), although our results did show a trend toward reducing rates of complications with delaying time to surgery. Evidence remains inconclusive and further work is needed to understand the potential role of severity of illness in surgical outcomes after COVID-19 infection and the utility of performing preoperative COVID-19 testing for all surgical patients.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has some strengths, such as the inclusion of well-defined and rigorous outcomes to quantify multiple postoperative morbidities. The use of a composite outcome is a unique method to measure risk associated with COVID-19, which is critical when deciding perioperative recommendations. Inclusion of any patient with a positive test result, regardless of timing, makes these results more applicable to the late stage of the pandemic, when most COVID-19 infections have occurred outside of the 7- to 10-day infection window used in most initial perioperative studies. The requirement for a positive PCR test result allowed for a clear diagnosis as well as time frame; however, patients without a positive PCR test result who did have COVID-19 could have been missed. In addition, the use of a large database and robust informatics infrastructure with rigorous sensitivity analyses allowed for more continuous assessment of risk, rather than arbitrary cutoffs.

Pituitary surgery during COVID-19 — case prioritization, operative approach, and PPE guidance indicate "we propose stratifying cases as emergent, urgent, or elective", and "We recommend that patients continue to be operated on in an emergent fashion if they present with pituitary apoplexy, acute severe visual loss, or other significant mass effect, or if there is concern regarding malignant pathology", while selected patients "may also benefit from urgent (but not emergent) surgery"; "In most cases, TSS remains the safest, most effective, and most efficient approach", and in "9 consecutive patients" without COVID-19 undergoing surgery "none of the patients or staff contracted COVID-19" after a standardized mitigation strategy; if a COVID-19–positive patient requires nondeferrable emergent surgery, "alternative transcranial approaches may be considered (avoiding nasal mucosa)", "non-powered tools such as rongeurs and chisels has been recommended", large suction can be used if needed, and "the availability and use of PPE, and in particular filtering facepiece (FFP3) respirators, is mandated", with PPE "appropriate in all cases" depending on local activity and testing effectiveness.

### Triaging interventional pain procedures during COVID-19 or related elective surgery restrictions: evidence-informed guidance from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^1144GQ2m]. Pain Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the pain and suffering of chronic pain patients due to stoppage of "elective" interventional pain management and office visits across the United States. The reopening of America and restarting of interventional techniques and elective surgical procedures has started. Unfortunately, with resurgence in some states, restrictions are once again being imposed. In addition, even during the Phase II and III of reopening, chronic pain patients and interventional pain physicians have faced difficulties because of the priority selection of elective surgical procedures. Chronic pain patients require high intensity care, specifically during a pandemic such as COVID-19. Consequently, it has become necessary to provide guidance for triaging interventional pain procedures, or related elective surgery restrictions during a pandemic.

Objectives

The aim of these guidelines is to provide education and guidance for physicians, healthcare administrators, the public and patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our goal is to restore the opportunity to receive appropriate care for our patients who may benefit from interventional techniques.

Methods

The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) has created the COVID-19 Task Force in order to provide guidance for triaging interventional pain procedures or related elective surgery restrictions to provide appropriate access to interventional pain management (IPM) procedures in par with other elective surgical procedures. In developing the guidance, trustworthy standards and appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest were applied with a section of a panel of experts from various regions, specialties, types of practices (private practice, community hospital and academic institutes) and groups. The literature pertaining to all aspects of COVID-19, specifically related to epidemiology, risk factors, complications, morbidity and mortality, and literature related to risk mitigation and stratification was reviewed. The evidence — informed with the incorporation of the best available research and practice knowledge was utilized, instead of a simplified evidence-based approach. Consequently, these guidelines are considered evidence-informed with the incorporation of the best available research and practice knowledge.

Results

The Task Force defined the medical urgency of a case and developed an IPM acuity scale for elective IPM procedures with 3 tiers. These included urgent, emergency, and elective procedures. Examples of urgent and emergency procedures included new onset or exacerbation of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), acute trauma or acute exacerbation of degenerative or neurological disease resulting in impaired mobility and inability to perform activities of daily living. Examples include painful rib fractures affecting oxygenation and post-dural puncture headaches limiting the ability to sit upright, stand and walk. In addition, emergency procedures include procedures to treat any severe or debilitating disease that prevents the patient from carrying out activities of daily living. Elective procedures were considered as any condition that is stable and can be safely managed with alternatives.

Limitations

COVID-19 continues to be an ongoing pandemic. When these recommendations were developed, different stages of reopening based on geographical regulations were in process. The pandemic continues to be dynamic creating every changing evidence-based guidance. Consequently, we provided evidence-informed guidance.

Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges in IPM creating needless suffering for pain patients. Many IPM procedures cannot be indefinitely postponed without adverse consequences. Chronic pain exacerbations are associated with marked functional declines and risks with alternative treatment modalities. They must be treated with the concern that they deserve. Clinicians must assess patients, local healthcare resources, and weigh the risks and benefits of a procedure against the risks of suffering from disabling pain and exposure to the COVID-19 virus.

### Timing of elective surgery and risk assessment after SARS-CoV-2 infection: an update: a multidisciplinary consensus statement on behalf of the association of anaesthetists, centre for perioperative care, federation of surgical specialty associations, royal college of anaesthetists, royal college of surgeons of england [^116LPGsF]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

It is important to note that within populations, harmful events may affect varying proportions of that population, for instance 50% may become infected and 20% harmed with 5% dying. For an individual, outcomes are dichotomous, meaning that the outcomes infection, harm and death, " 100% do or 100% do not happen ".

The increased risk associated with surgery after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection does not fall until 7 weeks, thus there is no benefit in partial delay (e.g. the increased risk at 6 weeks is similar to that at 3 weeks). Therefore, decision‐making should be dichotomised: defer for 7 weeks or do not defer.

Patients with persistent symptoms and those with moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19 (e.g. those who were hospitalised) remain likely to be at greater risk of morbidity and mortality, even after 7 weeks. Therefore, delaying surgery beyond this point should be considered, balancing this risk against any risks associated with such delay. Specialist assessment and individualised, multidisciplinary peri‐operative management are advised.

Elective surgery should be avoided during the period that a patient may be infectious (10 days). This includes patients who test positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 during pre‐operative screening (incidental SARS‐CoV‐2). Patients who are infectious pose a risk to healthcare workers, other patients and safe pathways of care. Furthermore, incidental SARS‐CoV‐2 may be pre‐symptomatic and may be associated with increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients having elective surgery. When emergency surgery is required during this period, full transmission‐based precautions should be undertaken.

Risk assessments should take place at the time of scheduling surgery. Patients should also be informed that a positive pre‐operative SARS‐CoV‐2 test may trigger a review of risks of proceeding with surgery. This can be supported with a risk communication tool (Fig. 1).

### SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 and timing of elective surgery: a multidisciplinary consensus statement on behalf of the association of anaesthetists, the centre for peri-operative care, the federation of surgical specialty associations, the royal college of anaesthetists and the royal college of surgeons of england [^116tKQTA]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As the population of patients requiring surgery following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection grows, so will the need to ensure safe peri‐operative care for this cohort. The same general principles of safe and effective peri‐operative care as for patients with no history of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection apply. However, timing of surgery must also be sensitive to the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on both patients and others. In particular, the variable presentation and disease course of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection means that personalised assessments are required, and rigid timelines unsuitable. This is often complex, and must account for the multifactorial implications of patient, surgery and SARS‐CoV‐2 status. Current data suggest that after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, the majority of patients who have had no symptoms or whose symptoms have resolved should have surgery scheduled at least 7 weeks after diagnosis, unless clinical urgency and risk of disease progression outweigh the risks of delayed procedures. For patients with persisting symptoms or who have more severe COVID‐19, waiting beyond 7 weeks may be beneficial and personalised multidisciplinary peri‐operative care plans are recommended. Peri‐operative SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Current measures to prevent peri‐operative SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, before and during admission and after discharge, need to continue while this remains a significant risk. As further data emerge, these recommendations may need to be revised.

### The COVID-19 pandemic and plastic surgery: literature review, ethical analysis, and proposed guidelines [^112qRUkj]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), known as the "coronavirus", has spread to over 170 countries. In response, many organizations have spoken out and called for cancellation of all elective surgical procedures. This study aimed to provide clear recommendations for plastic surgeons to follow by addressing the following issues: (1) What defines elective surgery, and where does one draw the line between essential versus nonessential services? (2) How does this differ in the hospital versus private practice setting? (3) If called on to operate on a patient with COVID-19, how do plastic surgeons protect themselves and still provide excellent medical care?

Methods

A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses systematic review of the literature on plastic surgery in the setting of a pandemic was performed on March 19, 2020. An ethical analysis was conducted using the four principles of medical ethics.

Results

The initial search yielded 118 articles. Eighteen articles were relevant and included for analysis. Only one editorial article was published in a plastic surgery journal. Accordingly, no peer-reviewed published COVID-19 guidelines exist for plastic surgery. Given that this pandemic may place health care systems under undue stress with an unpredictable trajectory, it is the responsibility of the plastic surgeon to assess and postpone cases whenever possible to properly contribute to adequate resource allocation and patient safety measures.

Conclusions

This article fills an important gap in the literature by addressing COVID-19 and providing guidelines for upholding ethics and responsible resource allocation. By upholding these standards, plastic surgeons can do their part to help minimize the spread of this virus.

### Timing of elective surgery and risk assessment after SARS-CoV-2 infection: 2023 update: a multidisciplinary consensus statement on behalf of the association of anaesthetists, federation of surgical specialty associations, royal college of anaesthetists and royal college of surgeons of england [^1154KjfD]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Guidance for the timing of surgery following SARS-CoV-2 infection needed reassessment given widespread vaccination, less virulent variants, contemporary evidence and a need to increase access to safe surgery. We, therefore, updated previous recommendations to assist policymakers, administrative staff, clinicians and, most importantly, patients. Patients who develop symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 7weeks of planned surgery, including on the day of surgery, should be screened for SARS-CoV-2. Elective surgery should not usually be undertaken within 2weeks of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For patients who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection and who are low risk or having low-risk surgery, most elective surgery can proceed 2weeks following a SARS-CoV-2 positive test. For patients who are not low risk or having anything other than low-risk surgery between 2 and 7weeks following infection, an individual risk assessment must be performed. This should consider: patient factors (age; comorbid and functional status); infection factors (severity; ongoing symptoms; vaccination); and surgical factors (clinical priority; risk of disease progression; grade of surgery). This assessment should include the use of an objective and validated risk prediction tool and shared decision-making, taking into account the patient's own attitude to risk. In most circumstances, surgery should proceed unless risk assessment indicates that the risk of proceeding exceeds the risk of delay. There is currently no evidence to support delaying surgery beyond 7weeks for patients who have fully recovered from or have had mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Can patients with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection safely undergo elective surgery? [^11176Cfk]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Current or recent infection with SARS-CoV-2 increases the risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Consensus guidelines recommend delaying elective major surgery after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection for 7 or 8 weeks. However, because of the growing backlog of untreated surgical disease and the potential risks of delaying surgery, surgical services may be under pressure to reduce this period. Here, we discuss the risks and benefits of delaying surgery for patients with current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the limited evidence supporting delays to surgery, and the need for more research in this area.

### Prioritizing rapid COVID-19 testing in emergency general surgery patients decreases burden of inpatient hospital admission [^116Q56AH]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The COVID-19 pandemic created significant strain on the healthcare system, changing delivery of care across all disciplines during a time of widespread bed shortages. In the surgical population, the pandemic disrupted the delivery of EGS, with care paradigms shifting towards routine perioperative testing, delaying elective procedures when able particularly for patients testing positive for COVID-19, and protecting healthcare workers.

The CovidSurg Collaborative, among other leaders in the surgical field, has been critical in guiding early and current recommendations for surgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic, publishing consistent data from various prospective, multicenter trials on the increased risk of 30-day mortality, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary-related complications associated with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given preliminary data to this effect, there has been a clear indication for preoperative COVID-19 testing since early phases of the pandemic. The CovidSurg network has also been critical in establishing recommendations for delaying elective cases and for optimal duration of planned surgery delay after COVID-19 infection, which has helped mitigate the growing demand for backlogged surgical cases.

Testing protocols are created at the facility level and there is limited literature available on the feasibility, reliability, and use of various testing methods prior to emergency surgery cases. In general, the recommendation has been for universal preoperative testing, although protocols that allow for preoperative isolation without preoperative testing for elective surgery populations have also been implemented. Due to the urgent nature of EGS, however, preoperative isolation is not feasible, and universal testing is likely still necessary particularly when community incidence of COVID-19 is high. There is less data on whether rapid testing should be used in the preoperative setting. In a World Society for Emergency Surgery position paper, RT-PCR testing, often resulting in 4–6 hours, was recommended over rapid antibody testing given concern for poor sensitivity of the IgM/IgG testing alone in acute patients in the ED.

### Perioperative cardiovascular considerations prior to elective noncardiac surgery in patients with a history of COVID-19… [^116DW5Ey]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Patients with cardiovascular risk factors and established cardiovascular disease have excess morbidity and mortality with COVID-19. 1 Acute cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 can include myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, arrhythmias, dysautonomia, and thromboembolism. 1 It remains unknown whether these cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 persist beyond the acute phase of illness. Prior studies indicate that hospitalization with non–COVID-19 pneumonia may be associated with an increased risk of CVD up to 10 years after the initial infection.
2. Many COVID-19 survivors are resuming routine clinical care and being referred for elective surgery. It is unclear if a history of recent COVID-19 warrants additional preoperative cardiac assessment.

We outline key considerations for cardiac risk assessment in patients with recent COVID-19 undergoing evaluation for elective noncardiac surgery. In a large international prospective observational study from the GlobalSurg-COVIDSurg collaborative of 140 231 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, 2. 2% had a preoperative COVID-19 diagnosis. 3 A majority of the patients with a preoperative COVID-19 diagnosis were younger than 70 years, were American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class of 1 or 2, had revised cardiac risk index of 0 or 1, and reported either asymptomatic COVID-19 or experienced symptom resolution prior to the surgery. Among surgeries performed within 2 weeks of a COVID-19 diagnosis, 70. 3% were emergent. The 30-day adjusted postoperative mortality was 3. 6% to
4. 1% in patients undergoing surgery within 7 weeks of a COVID-19 diagnosis, but only 1.

5% in patients undergoing surgery 7 weeks or more after a COVID-19 diagnosis, similar to patients without a COVID-19 diagnosis. This association between postoperative mortality and the timing of COVID-19 diagnosis was observed irrespective of age, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class, major or minor surgery, emergent or elective surgery, or COVID-19 symptom status. Among patients undergoing surgery 7 weeks or more after a COVID-19 diagnosis, those with ongoing COVID-19 symptoms had substantially higher 30-day postoperative mortality when compared with asymptomatic patients or those with symptom resolution. Unfortunately, perioperative cardiovascular complications and causes of death were not reported in these analyses.

However, the postoperative incidence of pulmonary complications was also greater in patients undergoing surgery within 7 weeks of a COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with patients in whom surgery was delayed 7 weeks or more after a COVID-19 diagnosis or those without a COVID-19 diagnosis. Although we cannot exclude confounding by surgical indication in these observational analyses, based on these data, delaying elective surgery for a minimum of 7 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis is advised, and longer delays may be reasonable in patients with persistent symptoms.

### Did COVID-19 impact osteoarthritis-clinical perspective? [^1127arAD]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To assess the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on patients with osteoarthritis (OA).

Recent Findings

The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected patients with OA irrespective of them contracting the infection. Patients with OA had a disruption in access to the healthcare system, which resulted in delays in joint replacement surgeries from cancellations of elective surgical procedures. On the other hand, the pandemic accelerated the drive towards telemedicine and telerehabilitation, with many nonurgent services being delivered remotely whenever possible. Cross-sectional studies showed that the majority of patients with OA were willing to accept the increased risks of contracting the COVID-19 infection and proceed with elective joint replacement surgeries.

Summary

The American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism issued guidelines for managing immune-mediated rheumatic diseases during the pandemic. However, these guidelines did not include recommendations for patients with OA. Healthcare providers, including physical therapists, should aim to schedule more frequent telemedicine follow-up appointments to maximize medical management while patients await elective joint procedures.

### Practical recommendations for gynecologic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic [^117Cfg5x]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Surgery in suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients is a high-risk venture. In infected patients, COVID-19 is present in the body cavity. During surgery it could be nebulized in the spray generated by surgical instruments and could theoretically infect members of the surgical team. Nevertheless, some surgical gynecologic pathologies cannot be postponed. We present a list of the most frequent gynecologic diseases and recommendations on their surgical management during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on expert opinion, current available information, and international scientific society recommendations to support the work of gynecologists worldwide. In brief, any kind of surgical treatment should be scrutinized and postponed if possible. Nonoperative conservative treatment including pharmacological therapies for hormone-sensitive pathologies should be implemented. Health risk assessment by patient history and COVID-19 test before elective surgery are pivotal to protect both patients and healthcare providers. In confirmed COVID-19 patients or highly suspected cases, elective surgery should be postponed until full recovery.

### Association between coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination and mortality after major operations [^116Yaz3V]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare postoperative 90-day mortality between (1) fully vaccinated patients with COVID-19-positive and negative diagnosis, and (2) vaccinated and unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 positive diagnosis.

Background

Societal guidelines recommend postponing elective operations for at least 7 weeks in unvaccinated patients with preoperative coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The role of vaccination in this infection-operation time risk is unclear.

Methods

We conducted a national US multicenter retrospective, matched cohort study spanning July 2021 to October 2022. Participants were included if they underwent a high-risk general, vascular, orthopedic, neurosurgery, or genitourinary surgery. All-cause mortality occurring within 90 days of the index operation was the primary outcome. Inverse probability treatment weighted propensity scores were used to adjust logistic regression models examining the independent and interactive associations between mortality, exposure status, and infection proximity.

Results

Of 3401 fully vaccinated patients in the 8-week preoperative period, 437 (12.9%) were COVID-19-positive. Unadjusted mortality rates were not significantly different between vaccinated patients with COVID-19 (22, 5.0%) and vaccinated patients without COVID-19 (99, 3.3%; P = 0.07). After inverse probability treatment weighted adjustment, mortality risk was not significantly different between vaccinated COVID-19-positive patients compared to vaccinated patients without COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio = 1.38, 95% CI: 0.70, 2.72). The proximity of COVID-19 diagnosis to the index operation did not confer added mortality risk in either comparison cohort.

Conclusions

Contrary to risks observed among unvaccinated patients, postoperative mortality does not differ between patients with and without COVID-19 when vaccinated against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus and receiving a high-risk operation within 8 weeks of the diagnosis, regardless of operation timing relative to diagnosis.

### Timing of elective surgery and risk assessment after SARS-CoV-2 infection: an update: a multidisciplinary consensus statement on behalf of the association of anaesthetists, centre for perioperative care, federation of surgical specialty associations, royal college of anaesthetists, royal college of surgeons of england [^117BjBAM]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

2 Introduction

Pre‐operative SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was previously shown to be associated with significantly increased risks of morbidity and mortality. Data in the early phases of the pandemic demonstrated that peri‐operative SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was associated with clinically important increases in mortality, in some cases more than a 10‐fold increase. Furthermore, when surgery was undertaken within 6 weeks of infection, postoperative morbidity and mortality were also increased. Notably, increased peri‐operative risk remained consistently elevated until 7 weeks after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, at which point it returned to baseline. Therefore, recommendations were made to delay elective surgery for 7 weeks after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, unless the risks of deferring surgery outweighed the risk of postoperative morbidity or mortality associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

As the COVID‐19 pandemic has progressed, disease therapy and prevention have developed, including vaccination. Variants have emerged that differ in terms of their transmissibility, the severity of illness they cause and their ability to infect vaccinated patients. The omicron SARS‐CoV‐2 variant in particular has increased transmissibility and the potential to evade immunity acquired through previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, vaccination or both. This variant also leads to less severe clinical illness than previous variants [, Wang et al. preprint]and this is particularly so for patients who are vaccinated, which, in some countries is the majority of surgical patients. Compounding these concerns, disruption to the delivery of surgical care during the pandemic has significantly increased the number of patients awaiting surgery globally. In the face of these uncertainties, and the expectation of the imminent return to augmented surgical activity, clinical decision‐making regarding timing of surgery has become challenging.

We therefore aim to provide an update to the previously published consensus statement on SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, COVID‐19 and timing of elective surgery in adults to assist policymakers, administrative staff, clinicians and patients. This document focuses on the omicron variant, which is now strongly dominant in many countries. However, the principles may also be of relevance to future variants.

### COVID-19 related mortality in post-operative cardiac surgical patients [^111z3Cjd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The novel coronavirus, now termed SARS-CoV-2, has caused a significant global impact in the space of 6 months. Elective cardiac surgery has been universally postponed with only urgent and emergency cardiac operations being performed. International guidelines are yet to be defined and almost all healthcare institutions have mandated regional or national measures in place to reduce transmission in susceptible patients. The prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease is under-reported, with evidence that pre-existing cardiac disease can render patients more vulnerable to the disease process. The National Health Service in the United Kingdom introduced national measures to conserve intensive care beds and significantly limit elective activity shortly after lockdown. However, these measures were likely implemented after significant viral exposure to the general public and attending healthcare staff. We report two cases of early post-operative mortality secondary to COVID-19 infection immediately prior to the implementation of these widespread measures.

### Perioperative management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19: review and recommendations for perioperative management from a retrospective cohort study [^115t17ZS]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for perioperative management of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) are mainly based on extrapolated evidence or expert opinion. We aimed to systematically investigate how COVID-19 affects perioperative management and clinical outcomes, to develop evidence-based guidelines.

Methods

First, we conducted a rapid literature review in EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (January 1 to July 1, 2020), using a predefined protocol. Second, we performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 166 women undergoing Caesarean section at Tongji Hospital, Wuhan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic, imaging, laboratory, and clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records.

Results

The review identified 26 studies, mainly case reports/series. One large cohort reported greater mortality in elective surgery patients diagnosed after, rather than before surgery. Higher 30 day mortality was associated with emergency surgery, major surgery, poorer preoperative condition and surgery for malignancy. Regional anaesthesia was favoured in most studies and personal protective equipment (PPE) was generally used by healthcare workers (HCWs), but its use was poorly described for patients. In the retrospective cohort study, duration of surgery, oxygen therapy and hospital stay were longer in suspected or confirmed patients than negative patients, but there were no differences in neonatal outcomes. None of the 262 participating HCWs was infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) when using level 3 PPE perioperatively.

Conclusions

When COVID-19 is suspected, testing should be considered before non-urgent surgery. Until further evidence is available, HCWs should use level 3 PPE perioperatively for suspected or confirmed patients, but research is needed on its timing and specifications. Further research must examine longer-term outcomes.

### Estimated risk of adverse surgical outcomes among patients with recent COVID-19 infection using target trial emulation methods [^111deg7o]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The American Society of Anesthesiologists published recommendations on the timing of elective surgery for patients who have recently recovered from COVID-19. Several recent studies are conflicting about optimal timing of surgery relative to vaccination and infection. We emulated a trial within a large veteran population to assess the risk of adverse postoperative outcomes among patients with recent COVID-19 infection. We hypothesized that patients with infection in the 30 or 60 days before surgery would face increased risk compared with those without infection.

### Making a joint decision regarding the timing of surgery for elective arthroplasty surgery after being infected with COVID-19: a systematic review [^115eQSFa]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a substantial number of patients to have their elective arthroplasty surgeries rescheduled. While it is established that patients with COVID-19 who are undergoing surgery have a significantly higher risk of experiencing postoperative complications and mortality, it is not well-known at what time after testing positive the risk of postoperative complications or mortality returns to normal.

Methods

PubMed (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica dataBASE, and professional society websites were systematically reviewed on March 7, 2022 to identify studies and guidelines on the optimal timeframe to reschedule patients for elective surgery after preoperatively testing positive for COVID-19. Outcomes included postoperative complications such as mortality, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and pulmonary embolism.

Results

A total of 14 studies and professional society guidelines met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 should be rescheduled 4–8 weeks after testing positive (as long as they do not develop symptoms in the interim), patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 should be rescheduled 6–8 weeks after testing positive (with complete resolution of symptoms), and patients with severe/critical COVID-19 should be rescheduled at a minimum of 12 weeks after hospital discharge (with complete resolution of symptoms).

Conclusions

Given the negative association between preoperative COVID-19 and postoperative complications, patients should have elective arthroplasty surgery rescheduled at differing timeframes based on their symptoms. In addition, a multidisciplinary and patient-centered approach to rescheduling patients is recommended. Further study is needed to examine the impact of novel COVID-19 variants and vaccination on timeframes for rescheduling surgery.

### Anesthesia considerations and infection precautions for trauma and acute care cases during the COVID-19 pandemic: recommendations from a task force of the Chinese society of anesthesiology [^1159p2ku]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread worldwide. During the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, most hospitals have postponed elective surgeries. However, some emergency surgeries, especially for trauma patients, are inevitable. For patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, a standard protocol addressing preoperative preparation, intraoperative management, and postoperative surveillance should be implemented to avoid nosocomial infection and ensure the safety of patients and the health care workforce. With reference to the guidelines and recommendations issued by the National Health Commission and Chinese Society of Anesthesiology, this article provides recommendations for anesthesia management of trauma and emergency surgery cases during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Perspectives on perioperative management of children's surgical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income and middle-income countries: a global survey [^113S6Nex]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

To address the potential for spread of COVID-19 and the need to reduce resource use during the pandemic, the majority of survey respondents reported that they had modified their preoperative surgical assessments in the face of COVID-19. These include changes across four broad themes: diagnostics and operative triage, intraoperative precautions, postoperative management, PPE and sterilization. The variability seen in the use of these measures among different income groups and different hospital types highlights the lack of formal context-specific guidelines on modification of perioperative practice. Interestingly, although case reports of non-operative management of appendicitis have been reported, and the American College of Surgeons has advocated for increased non-operative management, few surgeons in our study are reporting increasing nonoperative management of appendicitis. Given the increased postoperative mortality seen in adult postoperative patients with COVID-19, further study of the effectiveness of these interventions is needed to create formal guidelines towards perioperative management of children during pandemics. Pragmatic clinical trials, especially in low-resource settings, would help to optimize decisions about elective and urgent surgical cancellations and inform the impact of delays in surgical care on clinical outcomes.

Our results raise a number of important questions for future research. Although providers of children's surgery are generally in agreement that there needs to be cancellation or delay of elective surgical cases, there appears to be minimal consensus on which procedures should fall under this umbrella. Future international multicenter studies evaluating the consequences of postponing surgeries due to COVID-19 are needed. For example, monitoring for potential increases in rates of incarcerated hernias, cancer mortality or advanced progression of surgically amenable disease is needed to guide future guidelines. These studies will be imperative to better guide the list of surgical priorities in the current and future pandemics. Policy work and consensus statements by children's surgical societies or international organizations like the WHO and GICS may help to standardize efforts to limit elective cases and provide a framework for regional or institutional context-specific guidelines. Additionally, future outcomes research may be able to identify which procedures are safe to continue to perform and which should be avoided.

### Perspectives on perioperative management of children's surgical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income and middle-income countries: a global survey [^111wX5xP]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Many organizations have issued recommendations to limit elective surgery during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We surveyed providers of children's surgical care working in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) to understand their perspectives on surgical management in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and how they were subsequently modifying their surgical care practices.

Methods

A survey of children's surgery providers in LMICs was performed. Respondents reported how their perioperative practice had changed in response to COVID-19. They were also presented with 26 specific procedures and asked which of these procedures they were allowed to perform and which they felt they should be allowed to perform. Changes in surgical practice reported by respondents were analyzed thematically.

Results

A total of 132 responses were obtained from 120 unique institutions across 30 LMICs. 117/120 institutions (97.5%) had issued formal guidance on delaying or limiting elective children's surgical procedures. Facilities in LICs were less likely to have issued guidance on elective surgery compared with middle-income facilities (82% in LICs vs 99% in lower middle-income countries and 100% in upper middle-income countries, p = 0.036). Although 122 (97%) providers believed cases should be limited during a global pandemic, there was no procedure where more than 61% of providers agreed cases should be delayed or canceled.

Conclusions

There is little consensus on which procedures should be limited or delayed among LMIC providers. Expansion of testing capacity and local, context-specific guidelines may be a better strategy than international consensus, given the disparities in availability of preoperative testing and the lack of consensus towards which procedures should be delayed.

### Triaging urological surgeries to cope with the coronavirus-19 pandemic [^113vjLSe]. Current Opinion in Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to strains on hospital resources and difficulties in safely and effectively triaging surgical procedures. In this article, we discuss the important considerations for triaging urologic surgeries during a global pandemic, mitigating factors on how to perform surgeries safely, and general guidelines for specific surgeries.

Recent Findings

Many urological procedures have been cut back due to the pandemic, with benign disease states being most affected whereas oncology cases affected least. Current recommendations in urology triage life-threatening conditions, or conditions that may lead to life-threatening ailments as a priority for treatment during the pandemic. Additionally, published recommendations have been put forth recommending all surgical patients be screened for COVID-19 to protect staff, prevent disease dissemination, and to educate patients on worse outcomes that can occur if infected with COVID-19 in the postoperative period.

Summary

COVID-19 has caused worldwide shortages of healthcare resources and increased the need to ethically triage resources to adequately treat the urologic community. These resource limitations have led to increased wait times and cancellations of many urology surgeries that are considered 'elective'.

### Severity of prior coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with postoperative outcomes after major inpatient surgery [^117VcLQ3]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine how the severity of prior history (Hx) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection influences postoperative outcomes after major elective inpatient surgery.

Background

Surgical guidelines instituted early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic recommended a delay in surgery of up to 8 weeks after an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. This was based on the observation of elevated surgical risk after recovery from COVID-19 early in the pandemic. As the pandemic shifts to an endemic phase, it is unclear whether this association remains, especially for those recovering from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19.

Methods

Utilizing the National COVID Cohort Collaborative, we assessed postoperative outcomes for adults with and without a Hx of COVID-19 who underwent major elective inpatient surgery between January 2020 and February 2023. COVID-19 severity and time from infection to surgery were each used as independent variables in multivariable logistic regression models.

Results

This study included 387,030 patients, of whom 37,354 (9.7%) were diagnosed with preoperative COVID-19. Hx of COVID-19 was found to be an independent risk factor for adverse postoperative outcomes even after a 12-week delay for patients with moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with mild COVID-19 did not have an increased risk of adverse postoperative outcomes at any time point. Vaccination decreased the odds of respiratory failure.

Conclusions

Impact of COVID-19 on postoperative outcomes is dependent on the severity of illness, with only moderate and severe disease leading to a higher risk of adverse outcomes. Existing perioperative policies should be updated to include consideration of COVID-19 disease severity and vaccination status.

### Elective, non-urgent procedures and aesthetic surgery in the wake of SARS-COVID-19: considerations regarding safety, feasibility and impact on clinical management [^113xTfU3]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The worldwide spread of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to a near total stop of non-urgent, elective surgeries across all specialties in most affected countries. In the field of aesthetic surgery, the self-imposed moratorium for all aesthetic surgery procedures recommended by most international scientific societies has been adopted by many surgeons worldwide and resulted in a huge socioeconomic impact for most private practices and clinics. An important question still unanswered in most countries is when and how should elective/aesthetic procedures be scheduled again and what kind of organizational changes are necessary to protect patients and healthcare workers when clinics and practices reopen. Defining manageable, evidence-based protocols for testing, surgical/procedural risk mitigation and clinical flow management/contamination management will be paramount for the safety of non-urgent surgical procedures.

Methods

We conducted a MEDLINE/PubMed research for all available publications on COVID-19 and surgery and COVID-19 and anesthesia. Articles and referenced literature describing possible procedural impact factors leading to exacerbation of the clinical evolution of COVID-19-positive patients were identified to perform risk stratification for elective surgery. Based on these impact factors, considerations for patient selection, choice of procedural complexity, duration of procedure, type of anesthesia, etc., are discussed in this article and translated into algorithms for surgical/anesthesia risk management and clinical management. Current recommendations and published protocols on contamination control, avoidance of cross-contamination and procedural patient flow are reviewed. A COVID-19 testing guideline protocol for patients planning to undergo elective aesthetic surgery is presented and recommendations are made regarding adaptation of current patient information/informed consent forms and patient health questionnaires.

Conclusion

The COVID-19 crisis has led to unprecedented challenges in the acute management of the crisis, and the wave only recently seems to flatten out in some countries. The adaptation of surgical and procedural steps for a risk-minimizing management of potential COVID-19-positive patients seeking to undergo elective aesthetic procedures in the wake of that wave will present the next big challenge for the aesthetic surgery community. We propose a clinical algorithm to enhance patient safety in elective surgery in the context of COVID-19 and to minimize cross-contamination between healthcare workers and patients. New evidence-based guidelines regarding surgical risk stratification, testing, and clinical flow management/contamination management are proposed. We believe that only the continuous development and broad implementation of guidelines like the ones proposed in this paper will allow an early reintegration of all aesthetic procedures into the scope of surgical care currently performed and to prepare the elective surgical specialties better for a possible second wave of the pandemic.

### Immediate and long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on delivery of surgical services [^113vZ8Vt]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Reorganization of surgical services to critical care capacity

In the extreme case when waves of patients are admitted to hospital, the surge in critically ill patients may deprive surgical services of resources to the point of exclusion. Several regions have experienced this phenomenon and many are planning for this scenario, with cancellation of all non-essential surgery for an initial period. Operating theatres and anaesthesia machines may be converted to temporary respiratory support units. Postoperative recovery rooms and intermediate-care units may be used as care units outside regular intensive care to manage sick patients with COVID-19. In this case, there is a real threat of disruption to all surgical services and difficulty maintaining even critical surgical care.

In order to prepare, all non-essential elective surgery has been recommended to be cancelled in many healthcare systems and by surgical societies, but with variable suggestions and advice across regions and disciplines (Table 1; Table S3, supporting information). Information and advice are changing as pressure, and needs rise and resources are stretched. New knowledge is emerging rapidly, leading to suggestions sometimes based on anecdotal reports at best. In general, deferral of surgery is especially recommended for non-urgent operations with a potential requirement for postoperative ICU care.

### Prevention and control strategies for emergency, limited-term, and elective operations in pediatric surgery during the epidemic period of COVID-19 [^115B996b]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The epidemic of a novel coronavirus infectionhas spread to more than 100 countries. On January 31, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the outbreak of the new coronavirus constitutes a "public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)". On February 11, 2020, the International Virus Classification Commission named this virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On the same day, WHO named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). On January 20, 2020, the National Health Commission of China categorized COVID-19 as a Class B infectious disease but administered it as a Class A infectious disease. Many countries and regions were involved in this epidemic and the number of infected cases continues to increase. Some countries and regions implemented very stringent prevention and control measures. Preventing and controlling the epidemic while ensuring the orderly flows of pediatric surgery clinical work has proven to be a big challenge for both patients and clinicians during the epidemic period. Several publications that introduced the prevention strategies for surgical operations during the COVID-19 epidemic have been launched. Because children are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, several diagnostic guidelines or consensuses for children were published. However, thus far, no publications providing systemic suggestions or strategies for prevention of COVID-19 in the field of pediatric surgery have been identified.

Based on the "Technical Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of New Coronavirus Infection in Medical Institutions (First Edition)", Diagnosis and Treatment Plan on the New Coronavirus inflicted pneumonia (Sixth trial edition, revised)"(both released by the National Health Commission of China), "Recommendations for the Prevention and Control of General Surgery in the Background of New Coronavirus Outbreak", and other relevant latest reports, we propose the following control measures and practical strategies for pediatric surgery practice during the COVID-19 epidemic.

A study including patients from early in the COVID-19 pandemic found a decreasing risk of major postoperative cardiovascular events with time from an initial positive diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 test result (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.99 [per 10 days after diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection]; 95% CI, 0.98–1.00; p = 0.006), and this association held for patients who had had at least one dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. None of these studies addressed whether results of repeat SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing could help to predict the risk of post-operative morbidity in patients with a recent history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and due to significant limitations of the available evidence the IDSA panel agreed that overall certainty of evidence was very low. SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially early in the pandemic, was associated with adverse post-operative outcomes, and the IDSA panel found no evidence that repeating nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) in a patient with a recent diagnosis would help to mitigate that risk; potential harms of testing include unnecessarily delaying a procedure because of a positive test or risk of infection transmission if appropriate transmission-based precautions are not used when caring for a patient with a negative test but who is still infectious. The existing evidence is derived from time-based studies with heterogeneous definitions of infection, and given the known prolonged positivity of molecular assays such as NAAT, further research is needed to correlate molecular test results and patient outcomes.

### Perspectives on perioperative management of children's surgical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income and middle-income countries: a global survey [^115yEtEp]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As of May 2020, over 212 countries have reported or confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With over 6 million cases worldwide and 380,000 deaths, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a number of changes to healthcare delivery globally. Healthcare systems around the world have rapidly responded to the pandemic by increasing testing capabilities, expanding intensive care units and developing specialized COVID-19 guidelines. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA and National Health Service (NHS) in the UK have made recommendations to prioritize urgent medical visits, delay elective care and increase telemedicine/telehealth. Although delaying non-urgent care may reduce spread of disease, delays and cancellations of surgical care are not without consequences. Additionally, the classification of emergent, urgent and elective surgical care is often left to the discretion of individual providers. Optimizing guidelines for children's surgical care during global pandemics requires a thorough understanding of how providers have changed practices and their perspectives of the inherent risks for both providers and patients during global pandemics.

### Neuraxial anaesthesia and peripheral nerve blocks during the COVID-19 pandemic: a literature review and practice recommendations [^115FpiSi]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a significant impact on global healthcare services. In an attempt to limit the spread of infection and to preserve healthcare resources, one commonly used strategy has been to postpone elective surgery, whilst maintaining the provision of anaesthetic care for urgent and emergency surgery. General anaesthesia with airway intervention leads to aerosol generation, which increases the risk of COVID-19 contamination in operating rooms and significantly exposes the healthcare teams to COVID-19 infection during both tracheal intubation and extubation. Therefore, the provision of regional anaesthesia may be key during this pandemic, as it may reduce the need for general anaesthesia and the associated risk from aerosol-generating procedures. However, guidelines on the safe performance of regional anaesthesia in light of the COVID-19 pandemic are limited. The goal of this review is to provide up-to-date, evidence-based recommendations or expert opinion when evidence is limited, for performing regional anaesthesia procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. These recommendations focus on seven specific domains including: planning of resources and staffing; modifying the clinical environment; preparing equipment, supplies and drugs; selecting appropriate personal protective equipment; providing adequate oxygen therapy; assessing for and safely performing regional anaesthesia procedures; and monitoring during the conduct of anaesthesia and post-anaesthetic care. Implicit in these recommendations is preserving patient safety whilst protecting healthcare providers from possible exposure.

Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Timing of elective surgery after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection

Following infection with SARS‐CoV‐2, timing of surgery must account for severity and ongoing symptoms of COVID‐19, the patient's comorbid status and the priority and complexity of surgery. Detailed methodology and results of the systematic review are reported in online Supporting Information Appendix S2.

Symptoms and severity of disease

The phases of COVID‐19 [29] and the scale of clinical severity [30] are both important factors in planning surgery and are summarised in Tables 1 and 2.

Table 1
Phases of COVID‐19 [29].

Table 2
Clinical progression scale of severity of COVID‐19, adapted from [30].

It is important to note that for the majority of patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, it is either a transient or asymptomatic disease followed by full recovery (Fig. 1). Approximately 15% of infected patients are hospitalised, 5% require advanced oxygen therapies and around 1% of all cases require critical care admission (Fig. 1). Following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, nearly 5% of all patients still have residual symptoms at 8 weeks [Sudre et al. pre‐print,]. This rate is higher in patients who have been hospitalised with COVID‐19. In a cohort study of 1655 hospitalised patients in China followed up at 6 months [10] and another of 143 patients in Italy followed up at 9 weeks [11], 76% and 87% of patients reported at least one persisting symptom, respectively. In the former study, more severe COVID‐19 was associated with progression to post‐COVID‐19 syndromes including functional and physiological restrictions, [10] but in the latter study persisting symptoms correlated poorly with the severity of acute symptoms [11].

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^112J6Lfj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America COVID-19 guideline methodology — evidence selection prioritized acceptable randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of effectiveness, with prophylaxis populations excluding those who had reported COVID-19 infection; if acceptable RCTs were found, no additional non-randomized or non-comparative single-arm evidence was sought, while single-arm data were included only when a historical control event rate could be estimated and conflicts were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Reviewers used a standardized form to extract data, calculating risk ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and for continuous outcomes calculated either mean and standard deviation or standard mean difference; where applicable, data were pooled using a random effects model, with a fixed effects model for two or fewer trials or pooling of rates, and results were presented in RevMan forest plots. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach; within GRADE, certainty could be reduced by risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, or publication bias, and could be strengthened by large or very large effects, a dose-response gradient, or opposing residual confounding, with summary of findings tables developed in GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool. Outcomes used for decision-making may change as higher-quality direct evidence becomes available; for example, at the time of the first guideline clinical improvement outcomes such as need for mechanical ventilation were not reported, only radiographic findings.

Surgical Consideration for Cancer Patients at Risk of Infection

As mentioned earlier, patients who receive surgery in the month before contracting SARS‐CoV‐2 are likely to be at higher risk of clinically severe events than those who did not have surgery 7. During an infectious disease pandemic, patients may face difficulties, including access to hospitalization and deferred surgeries. Currently, there are no published international guidelines for decisions regarding special considerations for surgical intervention in cancer patients during an infectious disease pandemic.

Delaying elective surgical intervention may be more appropriate for select patients (e.g. early asymptomatic small breast cancer tumors detected on routine screening mammograms). These can be followed until the infectious disease pandemic is more controlled or over. Sixty‐day delays in surgical intervention in clinical stage I or stage II breast cancer were not associated with worse oncological outcomes 53. One of the challenges of delaying the elective surgery is the uncertainty regarding the ending of the infectious pandemic. The concept of delaying elective surgery is complex when considered across different disease sites, as each site has a unique oncological multidisciplinary approach. The suggested approach to solid tumor diagnosis and treatment decisions during an infectious disease pandemic, including oncological surgical consideration, is shown in Figure 2. The American College of Surgeons recently published guidance for triage of nonemergent surgical procedures during the COVID‐19 pandemic, based on the Elective Surgery Acuity Scale (ESAS) 54.

### Resuming elective surgical services in times of COVID-19 infection [^113Qebio]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

The consequences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus have been devastating to the healthcare system.

As the positive effects of social distancing, mandatory masking, and societal lockdown on the spread of the disease and its incidence in the community were documented, societal and financial pressures mounted worldwide, prompting efforts to "re-open" countries, states, communities, businesses, and schools. The same happened with hospital, which had to start developing strategies to resume elective surgery activities. This manuscript describes the pre-requisites as well as the strategies for resuming surgical activity, be it in the outpatient or inpatient setting.

Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Shared decision‐making regarding timing of surgery after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection between patient and multidisciplinary clinical teams must consider: severity of the initial infection; ongoing symptoms of COVID‐19; comorbid and functional status, both before and after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; clinical priority and risk of disease progression; and complexity of surgery.
Planned surgery should not be considered during the period that a patient may be infectious: 10 days after mild/moderate disease and 15–20 days after severe disease. For patients who are severely immunosuppressed (online Supporting Information Appendix S1), which may include patients treated with dexamethasone or monoclonal antibodies for severe COVID‐19, specialist advice should be sought. If emergency surgery is required during this period, full transmission‐based precautions should be undertaken for the protection of staff.
Surgery within 7 weeks of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Elective surgery should not be scheduled within 7 weeks of a diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, unless outweighed by the risk of deferring surgery such as disease progression or clinical priority.
Most patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 have either transient or asymptomatic disease and require no additional precautions beyond a 7‐week delay, but those who have persistent symptoms or have been hospitalised require special attention.
Patients with persistent symptoms of COVID‐19 are at increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality even after 7 weeks. Therefore, delaying surgery beyond this point should be considered, balancing this risk against their risk of disease progression and clinical priority. Specialist assessment and personalised, multidisciplinary peri‐operative management is required.
The time before surgery should be used for functional assessment, rehabilitation from severe illness, prehabilitation and multidisciplinary optimisation.
Vaccination several weeks before surgery will reduce risk to patients and might lessen the risk of nosocomial SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of other patients and staff. National vaccine committees should consider whether such patients can be prioritised for vaccination.
As a result of the increased risk of morbidity and mortality of peri‐operative COVID‐19, precautions to prevent admission of patients who are incubating SARS‐CoV‐2 and infection within the hospital should continue.
These recommendations are based on evidence available at the time of writing and may be subject to future review.

### A review of state guidelines for elective orthopaedic procedures during the COVID-19 outbreak [^116rG9nW]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in widespread cancellation of elective orthopaedic procedures. The guidance coming from multiple sources frequently has been difficult to assimilate as well as dynamic, with constantly changing standards. We seek to communicate the current guidelines published by each state, to discuss the impact of these guidelines on orthopaedic surgery, and to provide the general framework used to determine which procedures have been postponed at our institution.

Methods

An internet search was used to identify published state guidelines regarding the cancellation of elective procedures, with a publication cutoff of March 24, 2020, 5:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time. Data collected included the number of states providing guidance to cancel elective procedures and which states provided specific guidance in determining which procedures should continue being performed as well as to orthopaedic-specific guidance.

Results

Thirty states published guidance regarding the discontinuation of elective procedures, and 16 states provided a definition of "elective" procedures or specific guidance for determining which procedures should continue to be performed. Only 5 states provided guidelines specifically mentioning orthopaedic surgery; of those, 4 states explicitly allowed for trauma-related procedures and 4 states provided guidance against performing arthroplasty. Ten states provided guidelines allowing for the continuation of oncological procedures.

Conclusions

Few states have published guidelines specific to orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak, leaving hospital systems and surgeons with the responsibility of balancing the benefits of surgery with the risks to public health.

### 30-day morbidity and mortality of bariatric surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multinational cohort study of 7704 patients from 42 countries [^116WpbZ3]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the biggest study on patients undergoing any non-cancer surgery during the pandemic. This study showed that elective BS performed during the COVID-19 pandemic is probably safe with low 30-day morbidity and mortality and very low risk of symptomatic COVID-19, most of which were mild severity infections. This study also identified the factors associated with 30-day complications and symptomatic COVID-19 post-BS. These findings should reassure patients and health care providers regarding the safety of BS during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The burden of the pandemic has been uneven across the globe and also fluctuated widely from month to month within regions. At times, the healthcare systems have been too overwhelmed to allow for any elective surgery to take place. However, as is evident from our study, there have also been times when some surgical teams have had a more favourable pandemic condition and the resources to carry out elective surgery such as BS. This is probably a result of the massive global effort on the development of consensus guidelines and prioritisation criteria on safe resumption of BS. But there is little data on the safety of the BS during the pandemic with the adoption of some or all of these recommendations. In particular, there is a need to understand the efficacy of protocols in identifying asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and reducing viral transmission within healthcare facilities. We also need to understand if other changes imposed by the pandemic such as recommendations to avoid laparoscopic surgery without any definite evidence; deskilling of the surgical teams; recommendations to shorten hospital stay of patients and increased use of telemedicine; and recommendations to operate on highest risk patients first have impacted the safety of BS.

Defining elective CV procedures and their clinical ecosystems

Despite a uniform desire within the CV community to support vigorous efforts in the fight against COVID-19, heterogeneous opinions were proposed as to which CV procedures should be deemed elective. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) released clinician guidelines concerning those surgical procedures that should be delayed during the COVID-19 outbreak. Importantly, the ACS emphasises the role of the surgeon's expertise in making a determination as to the necessity of proceeding with surgery during these extraordinary times. Emanating from these recommendations was a procedural framework created by clinicians in St Louis, MO. that designated the Elective Surgery Acuity Scale (ESAS). Following the dissemination of the ESAS framework, the CMS adopted and amended this tiered framework to include broad classifications of CV procedures.

Across the USA, elective cardiac procedures are performed in a wide variety of settings including ambulatory care facilities, outpatient surgical centres and traditional hospital settings. Each of these clinical venues differ in its respective exposure to caring for patients either exposed to or infected with COVID-19. Consequently, the decision to perform an elective cardiac procedure impacts multiple stakeholders. The patient undergoing treatment is expected to benefit from it, but in so doing, may be exposed to COVID-19 from the clinical environment of care. Likewise, 40%–50% of all patients infected with COVID-19 but not yet exhibiting symptoms may serve as a vector to other patients or providers within a clinical ecosystem. Additionally, elective patients may consume vital healthcare material and/or human resources that would be better allocated to sicker patients as supply chain management becomes an increasing concern among hospitals and clinics.

In the setting of the current novel coronavirus pandemic, this document has been generated to provide guiding statements for the adult cardiac surgeon to consider in a rapidly evolving national landscape. Acknowledging the risk for a potentially prolonged need for cardiac surgery procedure deferral, we have created this proposed template for physicians and interdisciplinary teams to consider in protecting their patients, institution, and their highly specialized cardiac surgery team. In addition, recommendations on the transition from traditional in-person patient assessments and outpatient follow-up are provided. Lastly, we advocate that cardiac surgeons must continue to serve as leaders, experts, and relevant members of our medical community, shifting our role as necessary in this time of need.

### Approaching "Elective" surgery in the era of COVID-19 [^112Zn6r3]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic created unprecedented challenges for the health care system. To meet capacity demands, hospitals around the world suspended surgeries deemed to be elective. In hand surgery, numerous pathologies are treated on an elective basis, but a delay or absence of care may result in poorer outcomes. Here, we present an ethical framework for prioritizing elective surgery during a period of resource scarcity. Instead of using the term "elective", we define procedures that can be safely delayed on the basis of 3 considerations. First, a safe delay is possible only if deferral will not result in permanent injury. Second, a delay in care will come with tolerable costs and impositions that can be appropriately managed in the future. Third, a safe delay will preserve the bioethical principle of patient autonomy. In considering these criteria, 3 case examples are discussed considering individual patient characteristics and the pathophysiology of the condition. This framework design is applicable to ambulatory surgery in any period of crisis that may strain resources, but further considerations may be important if an operation requires hospital admission.

This interim guidance has been updated based on currently available information about COVID-19 and the current situation in the United States. Updates were made to reflect the high levels of vaccine-and infection-induced immunity and the availability of effective treatments and prevention tools. This guidance provides a framework for facilities to implement select infection prevention and control practices based on their individual circumstances. Establish a Process to Identify and Manage Individuals with Suspected or Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infection. If they are used during the care of patient for which a NIOSH Approved respirator or facemask is indicated for personal protective equipment, they should be removed and discarded after the patient care encounter and a new one should be donned.
- Facility-wide or, based on a facility risk assessment, targeted toward higher risk areas or patient populations during periods of higher levels of community SARS-CoV-2 or other respiratory virus transmission.
- All aerosol-generating procedures.
- All surgical procedures that might pose higher risk for transmission if the patient has SARS-CoV-2 infection.
- NIOSH Approved particulate respirators with N95 filters or higher can also be used by HCP working in other situations where additional risk factors for transmission are present, such as when the patient is unable to use source control and the area is poorly ventilated. They may also be considered if healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 transmission is identified and universal respirator use by HCP working in affected areas is not already in place.
- All surgical procedures that might pose higher risk for transmission if the patient has SARS-CoV-2 infection.
- Eye protection worn during all patient care encounters.
- Due to challenges in interpreting the result, testing is generally not recommended for asymptomatic people who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the prior 30 days. Testing should be considered for those who have recovered in the prior 31–90 days; however, an antigen test instead of a nucleic acid amplification test is recommended. This is because some people may remain NAAT positive but not be infectious during this period.

### EACTA / SCA recommendations for the cardiac anesthesia management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection: an expert consensus from the European association of cardiothoracic anesthesiology and Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists with endorsement from the Chinese society of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesiology [^112FiT2X]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

The European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology (EACTA) and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists (SCA) aimed to create joint recommendations for the perioperative management of patients with suspected or proven severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection undergoing cardiac surgery or invasive cardiac procedures. To produce appropriate recommendations, the authors combined the evidence from the literature review, reevaluating the clinical experience of routine cardiac surgery in similar cases during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) outbreak and the current pandemic with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, and the expert opinions through broad discussions within the EACTA and SCA. The authors took into consideration the balance between established procedures and the feasibility during the present outbreak. The authors present an agreement between the European and US practices in managing patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The recommendations take into consideration a broad spectrum of issues, with a focus on preoperative testing, safety concerns, overall approaches to general and specific aspects of preparation for anesthesia, airway management, transesophageal echocardiography, perioperative ventilation, coagulation, hemodynamic control, and postoperative care. As the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading, it will continue to present a challenge for the worldwide anesthesiology community. To allow these recommendations to be updated as long as possible, the authors provided weblinks to international public and academic sources providing timely updated data. This document should be the basis of future task forces to develop a more comprehensive consensus considering new evidence uncovered during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Tracheostomy protocols during COVID-19 pandemic [^117BgxcW]. Head & Neck (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the implementation of rapidly changing protocols and guidelines related to the indications and perioperative precautions and protocols for tracheostomy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate current guidelines for tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide a framework for health systems to prepare as the science evolves over the upcoming months and years.

Methods

Literature review was performed. Articles reporting clinical practice guidelines for tracheostomy in the context of COVID-19 were included.

Results

A total of 13 tracheotomy guidelines were identified. Two were available via PubMed, five in society or organization websites, and six identified via health system websites or other sources. Five were from Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery specialties, six from Anesthesiology and one from Pulmonary/Critical Care. All (100%) studies recommended postponing elective OR cases in COVID-19 positive patients, while seven recommended reducing team members to only essential staff and three recommended forming a designated tracheostomy team. Recommendations with supporting references are summarized in the article.

Conclusions

Tracheostomy guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic vary by physician groups and specialty, hospital systems, and supply-chain/resource availability. This summary is provided as a point-in-time current state of the guidelines for tracheotomy management in April 2020 and is expected to change in coming weeks and months as the COVID-19 pandemic, virus testing and antibody testing evolves.

### Plastic surgery and the COVID-19 pandemic: a review of clinical guidelines [^112uuS5t]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019 in China and was soon declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Many elective and nonessential surgeries were postponed worldwide in an effort to minimize spread of disease, as well as to conserve resources. Our goal with this article is to review current practice guidelines in setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on available data and literature.

Methods

Websites pertaining to surgical and medical societies, and government agencies were reviewed, along with recently published literature to identify recommendations related to COVID-19 and plastic surgery procedures.

Results

Clinical practice modifications are recommended during the pandemic in outpatient and perioperative settings. Use of personal protective equipment is critical for aerosol-generating procedures, such as surgery in the head and neck area. Care for trauma and malignancy should continue during the pandemic; however, definitive reconstruction could be delayed for select cases. Specific recommendations were made for surgical treatment of cancer, trauma, and semiurgent reconstructive procedures based on available data and literature.

Conclusions

The risk and benefit of each reconstructive procedure should be carefully analyzed in relation to necessary patient care, minimized COVID-19 spread, protection of health care personnel, and utilization of resources. Recommendations in this article should be taken in the context of each institute's resources and prevalance of COVID-19 in the region. It should be emphasized that the guidelines provided are a snapshot of current practices and are subject to change as the pandemic continues to evolve.

### Safety of esophageal cancer surgery during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe: a multicenter study [^111sB94t]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Curative treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer consists of esophagectomy combined with perioperative (radio-)chemotherapy. Esophagectomy is a complex surgical procedure and is associated with substantial morbidity, in particular postoperative pneumonia and consecutive respiratory failure.–

Many hospitals postponed elective surgical care during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This was necessary as medical resources were shifted to increase intensive care unit capacities, to prevent patients acquiring in-hospital severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, and concerns regarding the safety of healthcare workers and patients. This strategy is supported by a recent study demonstrating that patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing surgery have increased risk for postoperative pulmonary complications and mortality. Additionally, patients scheduled for esophageal cancer surgery are at high risk for symptomatic COVID-19 because of epidemiologic characteristics such as high age, male sex, and high prevalence of obesity; immunosuppression due to neoadjuvant therapy; high prevalence of pre-existing pulmonary comorbidities; and transthoracic esophagectomy with single lung ventilation.–

On the other hand, some countries have implemented national guidelines advising the use of preoperative SARS-CoV-2 screening methods in order to continue elective surgery. Certain international tertiary hospitals specializing in esophageal cancer have been able to continue elective cancer surgery with the use of preoperative screening; however, there is no evidence supporting the safety of this strategy as postoperative outcomes after esophageal cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic have not yet been investigated in detail.

Currently, second waves of COVID-19 are occurring around the world; therefore, it is important to investigate the safety of continuing elective cancer surgery as postponement substantially increases the number of avoidable cancer deaths, as demonstrated in a recent national cancer registry analysis. The aim of this current study was to assess the safety of patients undergoing elective esophageal cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on respiratory failure as the most critical condition of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Recommendation 12: Molecular testing at home — the IDSA panel suggests neither for nor against home-testing for SARS-CoV-2 (evidence gap). Remarks state that the panel defined time-sensitive surgery as medically necessary surgeries that need to be done within three months, that testing should ideally be performed as close to the planned surgery as possible (e.g., within 48–72 hours), that to limit potential poor outcomes deferring non-emergent surgeries should be considered for patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, that decisions about PPE use for the aerosol generating portions of these procedures may be dependent on test results when there is limited availability of PPE and there is a risk for false negative test results so caution should be exercised by those who will be in close contact with/exposed to the upper respiratory tract (e.g., anesthesia personnel, ENT procedures), that the decision to test asymptomatic patients will be dependent on the availability of testing resources, and that this recommendation does not address the need for repeat testing if patients are required to undergo multiple surgeries over time.

The scale of the COVID‐19 pandemic means that a significant number of patients who have previously been infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 will require surgery. Given the potential for multisystem involvement, timing of surgery needs to be carefully considered to plan for safe surgery. This consensus statement uses evidence from a systematic review and expert opinion to highlight key principles in the timing of surgery. Shared decision‐making regarding timing of surgery after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection must account for severity of the initial infection; ongoing symptoms of COVID‐19; comorbid and functional status; clinical priority and risk of disease progression; and complexity of surgery. For the protection of staff, other patients and the public, planned surgery should not be considered during the period that a patient may be infectious. Precautions should be undertaken to prevent pre‐ and peri‐operative infection, especially in higher risk patients. Elective surgery should not be scheduled within 7 weeks of a diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection unless the risks of deferring surgery outweigh the risk of postoperative morbidity or mortality associated with COVID‐19. SARS‐CoV‐2 causes either transient or asymptomatic disease for most patients, who require no additional precautions beyond a 7‐week delay, but those who have persistent symptoms or have been hospitalised require special attention. Patients with persistent symptoms of COVID‐19 are at increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality even after 7 weeks. The time before surgery should be used for functional assessment, prehabilitation and multidisciplinary optimisation. Vaccination several weeks before surgery will reduce risk to patients and might lessen the risk of nosocomial SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of other patients and staff. National vaccine committees should consider whether such patients can be prioritised for vaccination. As further data emerge, these recommendations may need to be revised, but the principles presented should be considered to ensure safety of patients, the public and staff.

### Perspectives on perioperative management of children's surgical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income and middle-income countries: a global survey [^111f2dgX]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

A number of organizations from various income settings have issued guidelines on how to handle emergent and elective surgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the WHO, College of Surgeons of East, Central and Southern Africa, the UK NHSand the American College of Surgeons (ACS). Initially, The COVID-19 crisis required hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers throughout the country to defer non-essential surgery to preserve personal protective equipment (PPE), protect the safety of healthcare professionals, and allocate potentially scarce resources for the care of the patient with COVID-19. The American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) endorsed the ACS guidelines and added additional guiding principles specifically for children's' surgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surgery was recommended to be performed 'only if delaying the procedure is likely to prolong hospital stay, increase the likelihood of later hospital admission or cause harm to the patient'. As the pandemic spread worldwide, many other countries and regions followed suit by canceling elective surgeries and issuing guidelines. On 18 April, the WHO released two technical guidance reports, recommending health systems 'progressively postpone all but the most urgent elective surgery and internally repurpose space and staff to COVID-19'. Given the recognition that 'there is no substitute for sound surgical judgement', there is a need to study both surgeon and administrative decisions during this pandemic and their impact on children's surgical care. It is essential that we try to optimize child health outcomes during times of stress on healthcare infrastructure. Institutions providing children's surgery in high-income countries have begun to report changes in practice in response to COVID-19, but this has yet to be evaluated in lower-resource settings.

This study aimed to understand how providers of children's surgery in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) were modifying their perioperative practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including their attitudes towards triage guidelines for elective and urgent procedures.

1 Recommendations

1 There is currently no evidence on peri‐operative outcomes after SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination and the omicron variant. Therefore, previous recommendations that, where possible, patients should avoid elective surgery within 7 weeks of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection remain, unless the benefits of doing so exceed the risk of waiting. We recommend individualised risk assessment for patients with elective surgery planned within 7 weeks of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.
2 Surgical patients should have received pre‐operative COVID‐19 vaccination, with three doses wherever possible, with the last dose at least 2 weeks before surgery. Confirming and optimising vaccination status should be actioned as soon as possible, either before primary care referral or at surgical decision‐making.
3 Current measures designed to reduce the risk of patients acquiring SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the peri‐operative period should continue and, in view of the increased transmissibility of omicron, should be augmented (e.g. respiratory protective equipment) where evidence supports this.
4 Patients should be requested to notify the surgical team if they test positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection within 7 weeks of their planned operation date. From there, a conversation should take place between the peri‐operative team and the patient about the risks and benefits of deferring surgery.
5 Elective surgery should not take place within 10 days of diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, predominantly because the patient may be infectious, which is a risk to surgical pathways, staff and other patients.
6 Asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with previous variants increased mortality risk three‐fold throughout the 6 weeks after infection. Given the lack of evidence with peri‐operative omicron infection, assumptions that asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection does not add risk are currently unfounded.
7 If elective surgery is considered within 7 weeks of diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, we recommend multidisciplinary discussions with the patient occur with documentation of the risks and benefits. a All patients should have their risk of mortality (and complications, where possible) calculated using a validated risk score. b Risk modifiers based on patient factors (age; comorbid status); SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (timing; severity of initial infection; ongoing symptoms); and surgical factors (clinical priority; risk of disease progression; complexity of surgery) can then be applied to help estimate how underlying risk would be altered by undertaking surgery within 7 weeks of infection. c Patients should be advised that a decision to proceed with surgery within 7 weeks will be pragmatic rather than evidence‐based.
8 Patients with persistent symptoms and those with moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19 (e.g. those who were hospitalised) remain likely to be at greater risk of morbidity and mortality, even after 7 weeks. Therefore, delaying surgery beyond this point should be considered, balancing this risk against any risks associated with such delay.
9 In patients with recent or peri‐operative SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, avoidance of general anaesthesia in favour of local or regional anaesthetic techniques should be considered.
10 Rather than emphasising timing alone, we emphasise timing, assessment of baseline and increased risk, and shared decision‐making.
11 All patients awaiting surgery should address modifiable risk‐factors, such as through pre‐operative exercise, nutritional optimisation and stopping smoking.

Patients with conditions in need of high-priority elective or urgent surgery

There is no consensus on what types of non-elective, non-emergency procedures should proceed, and under what circumstances. The definition of elective surgery varies widely, but general recommendations have been issued by several surgical societies and organizations (Table 1) to advise on priorities and support cancellations or deferred procedures. A definition of major surgery is also lacking, and varies between surgeons, regions and even subdisciplines. A recent Delphi studyagreed that 'significant co-morbidities' were the only preoperative factor retained to define major surgery. Notably, several of the risk factors in patients that predict risk of complications and need for intensive care after surgery are also the factors associated with higher risk of poor outcomes in COVID-19, including increasing age, diabetes, hypertension and cardiac disease.

A conceptual framework might stratify medically necessary, time-sensitive surgeryby variables that include the nature of the disease, the nature of the procedure and the nature of the patient. As regards procedures, variables to consider include the duration of operation, potential for ICU care, length of hospital stay, surgical site and risk of aerosolized droplets. Disease-specific considerations include the risk of delay on outcome (2, 4 or 8 weeks or longer) and alternative non-surgical options for therapy. Patient-specific considerations, in addition to COVID-19 or influenza-like illness status, might include age, pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease, immunocompetence and diabetes.

With some early reports of a high risk of postoperative morbidity and death in patients exposed to COVID-19 at the time of surgery, a set of minimum screening initiatives should take place until better data are available. For patients with urgent and non-emergency surgical conditions requiring operation, before admission (or on admission in a pathway evaluation if admitted semiurgently) there should be an interview with attention to sick contacts and extent of social isolation performed. A single swab with PCR or chest CT on the day before surgery to screen for COVID-19 is recommended by some. The applicability of these measures may change as knowledge, testing capability and sensitivity evolve, and with prevalence of COVID-19 (and evolving immunity) among the public.

Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Priority and complexity of surgery

To support the organisation and delivery of surgical services during the COVID‐19 pandemic, prioritisation of surgical urgency for patients based on clinical conditions has been implemented [6]. This process categorises surgical procedures into priority groups based on immediate and longer‐term risks to patient health and well‐being, including the risks of pain, adverse sequelae and disease progression, and a 'recovery prioritisation matrix' enables prioritisation of cases within each group [39]. This prioritisation is under constant review and subject to change; the most recent version is presented in Box 1.

Box 1

The complexity and the nature of surgery is a further consideration, as more complex surgery is consistently associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, including in patients with COVID‐19 [7]. Validated risk prediction tools account for complexity and urgency of surgery, and can be used to aid decision‐making regarding timing of surgery after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection [41].

Anaesthetic technique

There is currently no strong evidence that anaesthetic technique is associated with an alteration in postoperative outcome in patients who have had peri‐operative SARS‐CoV‐2 infection [7]. In patients with persistent respiratory pathophysiological changes after severe COVID‐19, the benefits of avoiding general anaesthesia are likely to be the same as in other respiratory disease. The use of local or regional anaesthetic techniques may have outcome and resource‐utilisation benefits, but this is not specific to patients with previous or current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

### Resuming elective surgical services in times of COVID-19 infection [^113d8DgN]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

The consequences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus have been devastating to the healthcare system. As the positive effects of social distancing, mandatory masking, and societal lockdown on the spread of the disease and its incidence in the community were documented, societal and financial pressures mounted worldwide, prompting efforts to "re-open" countries, states, communities, businesses, and schools. The same happened with hospital, which had to start developing strategies to resume elective surgery activities. This manuscript describes the pre-requisites as well as the strategies for resuming surgical activity, be it in the outpatient or inpatient setting.

### SAGES guidelines update to laparoscopy in the era of COVID-19 [^115jmF4v]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients requiring cholecystectomy or appendectomy may present with concomitant COVID infection in both the inpatient and outpatient scenarios. It is unclear whether these patients benefit more from operative or nonoperative management in the setting of active COVID infection. These guidelines seek to address urgent and elective clinical scenarios.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted to address these questions. These results were then presented to an interdisciplinary panel that formulated recommendations based on the best available evidence or utilized expert opinion when the evidence base was lacking.

Results

Conditional recommendations were made in favor of (1) either operative or nonoperative management of COVID-positive patients with appendicitis or cholecystitis and (2) delaying operations by more than six weeks in patients who test positive for COVID in the elective setting.

Conclusions

These recommendations should provide guidance regarding the management of surgical patients with concomitant COVID infection. This guideline also identifies important areas where future research should focus to strengthen the evidence base.

### Shared decision making for surgical care in the era of COVID-19 [^114aHjMj]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has upended surgical practice. In an effort to preserve resources, mitigate risk, and maintain health system capacity, nonurgent surgeries have been deferred in many jurisdictions, with urgent procedures facing increasing wait times and unpredictability given potential future surges. Shared decision making, a process that integrates patient values and preferences with the scientific expertise of clinicians, may be of particular benefit during these unprecedented times. Aligning patient choices with their values, reducing unnecessary health care use, and promoting consistency between providers are now more critical than ever before. We review important aspects of shared decision making and provide guidance for its perioperative application during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

Stage 2

After a functional period in stage 1, a reassessment of the COVID-19 infection in the community and in the hospital should occur to determine if adding operating room capacity and increasing the number of surgical cases is warranted. As an example, a hospital that initially reopened for outpatient surgeries may in stage 2 consider increasing inpatient cases. Hospitals that opened for both outpatient and inpatient cases, at a limited capacity (eg, 50% capacity), may increase, in stage 2, to 75%. Obviously, the model has to be tailored to each institution. However, a few details must be contemplated (box 5). Should the distribution of operating room time be in an "open block" fashion or should the block time grid be reconfigured for a limited number of weeks only, prior to complete reopening (stage 3)? To be equitable and fair with all surgical services, hospitals may contemplate extending the operating room hours for elective procedures to accommodate all requests. Once again, after a period of time, the whole strategy must be reassessed prior to transitioning to the next and final stage.

Stage 3

Stage 3 may commence when the full capacity of the operating rooms is used by the surgical services. Many safety measures employed in early stages, such as preoperative testing, mandatory masking in the preoperative period and in the recovery room, use of appropriate PPE, and safety measures to prevent cross-contamination must continue. The pre-COVID-19 block time grid is reinstituted, and the strategy must be re-evaluated considering the incidence of COVID-19 infection in the community, use of hospital resources, including bed utilization and ICU capacity, as more complex surgical cases will be performed over time.

Preparing surgical services for postpandemic phase

The cancellation of all elective operations creates a huge backlog of patients who have been, or would be, seen for planned surgery (Fig. 2). With a long-lasting lockdown and social distancing in effect, there will be millions of operations cancelled, deferred or simply not done at all over the coming months. Surgery is already recognized as a scarce resource in much of the world, with a global challenge to provide safe surgery and anaesthesia as a recognized area of priority.

Fig. 2
Proposed framework for surgical planning through pandemic phases

The framework is a basic overview of steps for surgical services to incorporate, and is not exhaustive. Currently, no universal framework for planning of surgical services and maintenance of capacity exists in the governing organizations. Surgery may be affected disproportionally by the loss of space and personnel, and the uncertainty of associated risks to patients and with exposure to procedures, compared with other disciplines. Training and simulation for personnel (donning and doffing; getting used to specific personal protective equipment (PPE); logistics and transport) is important in every phase. Clear and continued communication of information and knowledge is of the essence in all phases. *Depending on burden to hospital/region.

Although the majority of infected people experience a mild disease, there are currently only anecdotal reports on potential adverse outcomes even after relatively minor, elective surgical procedures. Until better data are at hand, the uncertainty will affect management during the surge of the pandemic and also have implications in the long term during the 'tail' of the pandemic (Fig. 1), as COVID-19 may be present in the general population for months ahead (until vaccine is universally available), until proper systems for high-accuracy testing and availability allow proper protection of patients and healthcare providers alike.

There is a lack of data on the actual risk of several procedures that are potentially aerosol-generating, including thoracoscopic interventions, laparoscopic abdominal surgery, endoscopic procedures, and open surgery performed with traditional equipment (including electrocautery and tissue-sealing devices). Safety hazards need to be addressed and investigated by proper methods to arrive at guidelines that protect surgical teams appropriately. Changing clinical practice to a point that jeopardizes surgical care or even leads to substandard management in fear of COVID-19 should be avoided.

### Literature-based considerations regarding organizing and performing cardiac surgery against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic [^111Mg27Y]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Global public healthcare providers are currently facing an unprecedented challenge in dealing with the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Readjustments in the field of cardiac surgery are critically important for several reasons: all phases of cardiac surgery (preoperative care, the surgery itself, postoperative care, and follow-up visits) require high capacities of trained staff, operating rooms, and — crucially during the pandemic — intensive care resources. In apportioning intensive care and staff capacities, all involved sectors are forced to triage time-sensitive interventions from those that can be safely delayed, or in some cases, substituted by less complex therapy options. However, in practice, there is a wide degree of medical urgency, ranging from elective operations to high emergency options. Therefore, the reasonable execution of a heart surgery programs affected by capacity shortage during the pandemic demands complex consideration and decision-making.

Given the high-speed dynamic of the Covid-19 outbreak, no scientific evidence is currently available to guide medical policymakers during this crucial period of readjustment. Therefore, clear guidelines and recommendations are urgently needed.

In this literature review, we aimed to identify the best practices to manage surgical programs until reliable scientific data are available.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 and timing of elective surgery: a multidisciplinary consensus statement on behalf of the association of anaesthetists, the centre for peri-operative care, the federation of surgical specialty associations, the royal college of anaesthetists and the royal college of surgeons of england [^115aXoxU]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection has contributed to more than 118 million infections globally and more than 2.6 million deaths from COVID‐19 [1]. The impact of COVID‐19 has been particularly significant in the UK, with more than 4.2 million cases and 125,000 people dying within 28 days of a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 test [2]. The scale of the pandemic has created substantial pressures on healthcare systems globally, leading to sustained reductions in surgical activity. An estimated 28 million operations were cancelled in 12 weeks of the first pandemic surge [3], with millions of patients still waiting for surgery [4, 5]. To support delivery of surgical services throughout the pandemic, prioritisation of different procedures has been undertaken [6].

One of the challenges of surgery during the COVID‐19 pandemic is the peri‐operative risk of morbidity and mortality to patients with active SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Evidence suggests a 19.1% 30‐day mortality in elective (planned) and 26.0% 30‐day mortality in emergency surgical patients, with around half of patients having surgery when infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 experiencing postoperative pulmonary complications [7]. In addition, given the scale of the pandemic, peri‐operative outcomes after a previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are an important concern, as a significant number of patients who have previously been infected (estimated at 15–20% of the UK population [8]) will require surgery.

Surgery after a previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection should be timed to ensure the safest delivery of peri‐operative care. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection may cause multisystem disease with both short and long‐term sequelae, including chronic pulmonary dysfunction, myocardial inflammatory states, renal impairment, psychological distress, chronic fatigue and musculoskeletal deconditioning [9, 10, 11, 12]. These short and long‐term complications of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection could have an impact on postoperative recovery, and therefore must be considered in order to plan safe surgery.

This consensus statement aims to use evidence and expert opinion to highlight key principles in the timing of surgery for the growing number of patients who have had a SARS‐CoV‐2 infection to support safe surgery in those requiring it. The document refers in parts specifically to UK practice, but the underlying principles are likely to be relevant internationally.

### Advantages of, and adaptations to, enhanced recovery protocols for perioperative care during the COVID-19 pandemic [^115JotPC]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This review formulates the rationale for using enhanced recovery protocols (ERPs) to standardize and optimize perioperative care during this high-risk time to minimize poor outcomes owing to provider, patient, and system vulnerabilities.

Data Sources

n/a METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: A literature review using key Medical Subject Headings terms was performed-according to methods described by the Cochrane Collaboration and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines-on studies that described enhanced recovery and coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Modifications to our existing ERPs related to the COVID-19 pandemic should include new accommodations for patient education, preoperative COVID-19 testing, prehabilitation, and intraoperative infection as well as thromboembolism risk reduction.

Conclusion

ERPs are evidence-based, best practice guidelines applied across the perioperative continuum to mitigate surgical stress, decrease complications, and accelerate recovery. These benefits are part of the high-value-care equation needed to solve the clinical, operational, and financial challenges of the current COVID-19 pandemic. The factors driving outcomes on ERPs, such as the provision of minimally invasive surgery, warrant careful consideration. Tracking patient outcomes and improving care in response to outcomes data are key to the success of clinical care protocols such as ERPs. Numerous emerging clinical registries and reporting systems have been activated to provide outcomes data on the impact of COVID-19. This will inform and change surgical practice as well as provide opportunity to learn if the advantages that surgeons, patients, and the healthcare system might gain from using ERPs during a pandemic are meaningful.

### Preserving elective surgeries in the COVID-19 pandemic and the future… [^117Nz56G]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. "Cancel everything" has trended as a hashtag during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and for good reason. The pandemic has touched virtually every aspect of society, substantially altering, and at its onset halting, the very ways nearly every person in the United States works, learns, lives, and maintains health. The practice of surgery has not been immune, with emergency declarations by many states to suspend elective procedures and office visits in mid-March. While only temporary, this abrupt cessation of surgery has had far-reaching implications that can inform future approaches in the context of both crisis and uncertainty. Elective Procedures as Essential.

Although most operations and procedures are described as "elective, " these interventions are essential contributors to patient health, to the well-being of communities, and to the solvency of the nation's health care system, which comprises nearly 20% of economic activity in the United States. The choice of the term elective is therefore unfortunate when used in regulations; "nonemergency" surgery would be more accurate. As COVID-19 emerged, these procedures were temporarily stopped to mitigate the risk of virus transmission; to preserve personal protective equipment, hospital bed capacity, and key equipment; and to allow shifts in health care staffing patterns.

The American College of Surgeons disseminated a tiered acuity scale1 to guide patient triage for surgery relative to severity of illness, time sensitivity, and community disease prevalence, with hospitals and health systems delicately balancing case prioritization; safety of patients, surgeons, and other health care professionals; and resource availability. Consequences of Delays in Care These safeguards, however, did not account for the physical and emotional challenges of delayed surgeries, concerns associated with resuming pandemic care, and changes in mindset needed to move forward effectively with ongoing concerns about COVID-19. The negative effects on patient health outcomes are being realized as delays become disruptions in care. A survey conducted by Massachusetts General Hospital among 534 patients with breast cancer indicated that 31. 7% reported they experienced delays in screening or treatment from May to July
2020.

2 Similarly, at Wake Forest Baptist Health, there was a near-complete pause in mammograms in April. From March to June of the pandemic, this health system experienced significant declines in surgical volumes compared with the same period during the previous year, with a 27% reduction in orthopedic surgery cases and a 34% reduction in breast surgery cases, followed by a gradual recovery, to 434 orthopedic surgery cases and 116 breast surgery cases in July and August 2020. The long-term effects of widespread delays and their influence on resources, outcomes, and survival may not be apparent for some time. One analysis projected that tremendous effort will be required to clear a surgical case backlog estimated to be nearly 5 million cases.

Gastrointestinal procedure triage during COVID-19 — Since the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, US health systems started implementing infection control measures, planning for surge capacity in health care facilities, and proposing triage of health care services (Figure 4). The US Surgeon General and the American College of Surgeons recommended suspension of all elective surgical procedures, and on March 15, 2020, a joint society statement by 4 GI organizations recommended that elective nonurgent procedures be rescheduled to mitigate COVID-19 spread and preserve PPE. For guidance on how to implement a triage system see Figure 5.

### Evaluation of the post-COVID patient prior to elective plastic surgery: developing an evidence-based framework [^115ABS1Q]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Preoperative assessment of a potential surgical patient has long been a cornerstone of patient safety. As more patients get, and recover from, COVID, plastic surgeons will be faced with the challenge of evaluating the health status and operative risk of convalescent COVID patients who now desire elective surgery. A significant fraction of these patients, however, can have new or persistent health issues as a result of COVID-19, which can affect surgical safety. This paper briefly examines the current relevant literature regarding the post-COVID patient, reviews the waiting period for adequate recovery, and suggests an evidence-based framework for preoperative assessment, based on the severity of the prior COVID-19 episode, ongoing symptoms, and basic screening tests.

### Literature-based considerations regarding organizing and performing cardiac surgery against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic [^1127QVhf]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic presents challenges for surgeons of all disciplines, including cardiologists. The volume of cardiac surgery cases has to comply with the mandatory constraints of healthcare capacities. The treatment of Covid-19-positive patients must also be considered. Unfortunately, no scientific evidence is available on this issue. Therefore, this study aimed to offer some consensus-based considerations, derived from available scientific papers, regarding the organization and performance of cardiac surgery against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Methods

Key recommendations were extracted from recent literature concerning cardiac surgery. RESULTSː Reducing elective cardiac procedures should be based on frequent clinical assessment of patients on the waiting list (every one or two weeks) and the current local status of the Covid-19 pandemic. Screening tests at admission for every patient are broadly recommended. Where appropriate, alternative treatment methods can be considered, including percutaneous techniques and minimally invasive surgery, if performed by experienced cardiac surgery teams.

Conclusions

There is little evidence on the strategies to organize cardiac surgery in the Covid-19 pandemic. Most authors agree on reducing elective operations based on patients' clinical condition and the status of the Covid-19 pandemic. Admission screenings and the use of percutaneous or minimally invasive approaches should be preferred to reduce in-hospital stays.

The postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was also lower in COVID-19–free surgical pathways and to release surgical team members to support wider hospital responses. 6–8However, some elective surgery for time-sensitive conditions continued, with prioritization of patients with resectable cancers at risk for progression and patients for whom alternative treatment modalities would be ineffective.

9–11 12–14Such hospitals have admitted patients with COVID-19 during the pandemic, increasing the risk of cross infection of elective surgery patients. To avoid this, some health care providers have established dedicated COVID-19–free surgical pathways, which deliver surgery, critical care, and inpatient ward care with no shared areas with patients with COVID-19.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^113Y4RME]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Summary of the evidence — testing strategies and procedural risk after prior SARS-CoV-2 infection states that no studies directly assessed NAAT testing for SARS-CoV-2 versus no testing in patients with a prior COVID-19 diagnosis, but five cohort studies addressed prognosis for individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent procedures. Across these studies, some excluded emergency surgery while others included emergency and non-emergency operations, outcomes were correlated to time since COVID-19 diagnosis, diagnostic criteria ranged from NAAT to chest imaging plus symptoms, and no repeat testing strategies were identified. Data from early in the pandemic indicate that individuals with peri-operative SARS-C-V-2 NAAT positivity may have had an increased risk of post-operative complications, that symptomatic patients had a higher reported risk of complications, and that there may be an increased risk of complications if procedures are performed within 0–8 weeks of diagnosis, but not after 8 weeks.

### Perspectives on perioperative management of children's surgical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income and middle-income countries: a global survey [^116ehwcZ]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Similar to adult surgical procedures, children's surgical procedures have been delayed or canceled across the globe in an effort to conserve resources and decrease potential postoperative complications, but optimization of which procedures, when, and how to minimize health risks for cases that are urgent or emergent have not been well defined. Emerging literature suggests that children generally experience less severe symptoms but do develop respiratory symptoms which can increase the potential for postoperative complications. This demonstrates the need to minimize procedures on children with active COVID-19 infection as well as the need to limit surgical care in order to conserve healthcare system resources. A number of organizations have offered consensus-based guidelines designed to advise surgeons on when and how to cancel or delay elective cases. For example, while APSA has endorsed the ACS guidelines, a number of additional US pediatric subspecialty societies have created their own guidelines to guide subspecialty elective surgery. Our survey suggests the majority of children's surgery providers in LMICs (97%) agree with limiting elective cases due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there was no single procedure where more than 60% of respondents agreed it should be delayed. Among procedures given as examples in the American College of Surgeons Triage for Pediatric Patients during COVID-19, only 10%–30% of surgeons agree with limiting each urgent case, and only 30%–60% of surgeons agree with limiting each elective case. In fact, no individual procedure outlined by the ACS as urgent or elective, had more than 65% of respondents agree that it should be canceled. Given the variability in perspectives among providers, it is clear that international guidelines alone are not enough to guide selection of surgical triage, and that institutional buy-in and decisions from local health leaders are needed to develop and enforce children's surgical triage in LMICs. This highlights the need for local, context-based triage guidelines based on local case mix, resources and patient population.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 and timing of elective surgery: a multidisciplinary consensus statement on behalf of the association of anaesthetists, the centre for peri-operative care, the federation of surgical specialty associations, the royal college of anaesthetists and the royal college of surgeons of england [^1117uxfh]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Notably, symptomatic patients are at greater risk of 30‐day mortality than patients whose symptoms have resolved or those who have asymptomatic infection, even beyond a 7‐week delay. Moreover, patients with resolved symptoms are also at greater risk of 30‐day mortality than those who had asymptomatic infection [36, 37]. Thus, both the previous and current clinical condition of patients appear to influence postoperative outcomes.

Timing of surgery in patients who have been in critical care requires special consideration. In addition to residual pathophysiological sequelae, many will be deconditioned and require physical rehabilitation. Many will also have had dexamethasone 6 mg (equivalent to 40 mg prednisolone) for 10 days and/or anti‐inflammatory monoclonal antibodies (e.g. tocilizumab or sarilumab) as part of their COVID‐19 treatment. These patients are on the cusp of meeting the definition of severe immunosuppression, and in the absence of explicit national guidance warrant discussion with specialists, including immunologists, within the multidisciplinary team before planning surgery.

Some data suggest that peri‐operative outcomes of children with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are favourable compared with adults [38], but there remains a dearth of evidence regarding timing of surgery after infection in this group. Detailed consideration of timing of surgery in children is outside the scope of this document.

Comorbid and functional status

The patient's comorbid and functional status, both before SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and after it, should be considered in planning, in the same manner as for any interventional procedure. Comorbidity may influence the timing of surgery if deferring the procedure may provide an opportunity for improvement or resolution of post‐COVID‐19 pathophysiology; the additional time can be used for prehabilitation, particularly when there has been deconditioning, or for rehabilitation of patients recovering from a critical care admission. Further discussion of functional assessment and prehabilitation is beyond the remit of this document.

### Evidence-based risk stratification for sport medicine procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114BVvj8]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Globally, as of May 2, 2020, there were 3,233,191 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 227,489 associated deaths. In the Unites States alone, there were 1,067,127 confirmed cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with 57,406 deaths.

Few states have published guidelines specific to orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak, leaving hospital systems and surgeons with the responsibility of balancing the benefits of surgery with the risks to public health. Before March 24, 30 states published guidance regarding the discontinuation of elective procedures and 16 states provided a definition of "elective" procedures or specific guidance for determining which procedures should continue to be performed. Only five states provided guidelines specifically mentioning orthopaedic surgery; of those, four states explicitly allowed for trauma-related procedures and four states provided guidance against performing arthroplasty. On April 16, 2020, The White House released a three-phased guideline, called Opening Up America Again, for state and local authorities to follow when reopening their economies. In phase 1, for states and regions that satisfy the gating criteria, "elective surgeries" can resume when appropriate and on an outpatient basis.

Mi et alshowed that clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with fractures were more severe than those reported for adult patients with COVID-19 without fractures, suggesting that fractures can worsen the course of the infection. Catellani et alconcluded that surgical treatment of femoral fragility fractures in COVID-19-positive patients not only contributed to the overall patients' mobility but also improved the physiologic ventilation, O 2 saturation, and assisted respiration, indicating that appropriate treatment improves the patients' overall clinical status. Dephillipo et alreported on acute orthopaedic injuries they recommend as "surgically necessary" for elective-urgent procedures at Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs); however, they did not provide literature support to these recommendations, nor did they identify the timeframe in which surgeries should be performed. Therefore, an evidence-based risk stratification for orthopaedic pathologies has yet to be established. In addition, in the context of a pandemic, it is important to integrate the disease-intrinsic factors to external factors (eg, epidemic situation, healthcare system situation, and patient characteristics) to decide whether time-sensitive surgeries should be performed in a specific patient in a particular scenario.

### COVID-19 infection: implications for perioperative and critical care physicians [^116jcrer]. Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Healthcare systems worldwide are responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), an emerging infectious syndrome caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Patients with COVID-19 can progress from asymptomatic or mild illness to hypoxemic respiratory failure or multisystem organ failure, necessitating intubation and intensive care management. Healthcare providers, and particularly anesthesiologists, are at the frontline of this epidemic, and they need to be aware of the best available evidence to guide therapeutic management of patients with COVID-19 and to keep themselves safe while doing so. Here, the authors review COVID-19 pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and potential therapeutics, with a focus on management of COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. The authors draw on literature from other viral epidemics, treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and recent publications on COVID-19, as well as guidelines from major health organizations. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the evidence currently available to guide management of critically ill patients with COVID-19.

### Timing of elective surgery and risk assessment after SARS-CoV-2 infection: an update: a multidisciplinary consensus statement on behalf of the association of anaesthetists, centre for perioperative care, federation of surgical specialty associations, royal college of anaesthetists, royal college of surgeons of england [^11764ThR]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

The impact of vaccination and new SARS‐CoV‐2 variants on peri‐operative outcomes is unclear. We aimed to update previously published consensus recommendations on timing of elective surgery after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection to assist policymakers, administrative staff, clinicians and patients. The guidance remains that patients should avoid elective surgery within 7 weeks of infection, unless the benefits of doing so exceed the risk of waiting. We recommend individualised multidisciplinary risk assessment for patients requiring elective surgery within 7 weeks of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. This should include baseline mortality risk calculation and assessment of risk modifiers (patient factors; SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; surgical factors). Asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with previous variants increased peri‐operative mortality risk three‐fold throughout the 6 weeks after infection, and assumptions that asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic omicron SARS‐CoV‐2 infection does not add risk are currently unfounded. Patients with persistent symptoms and those with moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19 may require a longer delay than 7 weeks. Elective surgery should not take place within 10 days of diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, predominantly because the patient may be infectious, which is a risk to surgical pathways, staff and other patients. We now emphasise that timing of surgery should include the assessment of baseline and increased risk, optimising vaccination and functional status, and shared decision‐making. While these recommendations focus on the omicron variant and current evidence, the principles may also be of relevance to future variants. As further data emerge, these recommendations may be revised.

### Management and scheduling of spine surgery in a level 1 trauma center in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic: feasibility and considerations for reimplementation of elective spine surgery [^111BqgSt]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Determination of what constitutes necessary surgery in the setting of acute hospital resource strain during the COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented challenge for healthcare systems. Over the past two years during the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been many changes in reviews of medically necessary spine surgery. There continues to be no clear guidelines on recommendations and further discussion is necessary to continue to provide appropriate and high-level care during future pandemics.

Significance

This review critically appraises and evaluates current barriers to medically necessary spine surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluates future decision making to maintain spine surgery during future pandemics or limitations in medical care.

Results

Multiple studies included in this review have shown that while various orthopaedic surgeries may be considered elective, medically necessary spine surgery will need to continue during settings of limited medical care. This review discussed multiple methods and recommendations to limit transmission of virus from patients to providers and providers to patients.

Conclusion

Continued medically necessary spine surgery in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics should continue while limiting risk of transmission to continue providing high-level medical care and allowing hospitals to maintain financial responsibility.

### Is Re-introducing major open and minimally invasive surgery during COVID-19 safe for patients and healthcare workers? An international, multi-centre cohort study in the field of oesophago-gastric surgery [^116jwduj]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the current climate, minimising the direct risks of COVID-19 to patients undergoing major complex surgery is paramount. However, as EG surgery is associated with significant risk of complications, a 'safe' surgical pathway for this patient group must also ensure that appropriate resources are available to manage morbidity in the post-operative period. Our study suggests that collaborators were able to deliver safe care to patients and achieve low levels of morbidity and mortality. However, many healthcare services have 're-deployed' vitally important members of surgical, anaesthetic and nursing teams and diverted intensive care resources to help manage the pandemic. This leaves elective surgical services vulnerable and has led to large numbers of elective cancellations. Many centres included in our study had suspended their surgical programmes during the initial peak incidence of the pandemic for this reason. Some collaborators adopted different approaches and rationalised regional services so that high-risk surgery was undertaken on 'cold operative sites' where patients with COVID-19 were not admitted. The lead collaborating centre in our study aimed to limit hospital occupancy to around 60% during the first wave so that resources could be appropriately shared between COVID-19, emergency and cancer surgery patients. Such figures are not necessarily applicable to other centres, which must take into account the number of complex/major surgical services within the hospital, the local population levels of COVID-19 and available resources.

One of the unintended consequences of the pandemic has been the devastating impact on patients with disease unrelated to COVID-19. Several guidelines that detail how surgical care should be prioritised during this time have been developed for clinical practice. Whilst delaying cancer surgery would understandably risk the repercussions of disease progression, many other patients with conditions that impact severely on quality of life have also been affected. Most collaborating centres only undertook cancer surgery when elective programmes first recommenced. However, as confidence grew that patients could be treated safely, a small number of surgical cases for benign disease were successfully undertaken. The argument for undertaking (complex) benign elective cases during the pandemic is one which should be considered alongside local resource availability and therefore broad recommendations cannot be made. Whilst it is understandable that this subset of patients will be prioritised differently from cancer cases, the results of delays in this cohort should not be ignored.

Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Prevention of peri‐operative SARS‐CoV‐2 infection

Peri‐operative SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (de novo or re‐infection [Hall et al. pre‐print,]) is associated with a more than 10‐fold increase in short‐term mortality [7, Abbot et al. pre‐print,]. Therefore, it is essential to minimise the risk of patients either arriving in hospital whilst incubating SARS‐CoV‐2 or acquiring it in hospital. This is particularly important in patients who are at high risk of severe disease and mortality from COVID‐19, such as older people, men, Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups and comorbid patients. The principal actions to achieve this for all patients are:
SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination of patients several weeks before hospital admission, where appropriate and as prioritised by national vaccination strategies;
Self‐isolation for a period that exceeds the incubation period of SARS‐CoV‐2 illness [13] combined with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing before admission;
Adherence to practices that reduce the risk of community‐acquired SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and social distancing, as well as shielding advice where indicated;
Screening of hospital staff to prevent contact with infectious staff [14];
Maintaining dedicated pathways that separate screened and PCR‐negative patients from contact with patients with suspected or confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and the staff and locations involved in their treatment [15];
Minimising time spent within healthcare environments.

Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Protection of others

Elective surgery after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection must be safe for staff, other patients and the public [16, 17, 18, 19]. Therefore, adherence to self‐isolation guidelines is imperative. Symptoms of COVID‐19 present 4–5 days following infection with SARS‐CoV‐2, and it is most contagious in the 2 days before and the 5 days after the onset of symptoms [20]. In asymptomatic and mild to moderately symptomatic patients, it is rare for the virus to be cultured beyond 10 days after symptom onset, which underlies both UK and World Health Organization recommendations for self‐isolation of 10 days following a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR test [13, 21, 22, 23]. In the severely ill or severely immunocompromised patients, infectivity may continue for longer [20, 24]. In the severely ill, the risk of replication‐competent virus is approximately 5% at 15 days after symptom onset and extremely rare at 20 days [25, 26]. Therefore, to protect staff, other patients and members of the public, patients should self‐isolate for 10 days with mild to moderate disease, or 15–20 days with severe illness. This applies to any attendance for hospital services. Those who are severely immunocompromised (online Supporting Information Appendix S1) may need specialist advice on duration of self‐isolation. Of note, PCR positivity does not correlate with secretion of live virus, so is of little or no value in assessing the risk of infectivity in the 3 months after confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

Planned surgery should not be considered during the period that a patient may be infectious, and when emergency surgery is required during this period, full transmission‐based precautions should be undertaken [27, 28].

### Minimizing the risk of aerosol contamination during elective lung resection surgery [^1112fd3s]. Annals of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, the conduct of elective cancer surgery has become an issue because of the need to balance the requirement to treat patients with the possibility of transmission of the virus by asymptomatic carriers. A particular concern is the potential for viral transmission by way of aerosol which may be generated during perioperative care. There are currently no guidelines for the conduct of elective lung resection surgery in this context.

Methods

A working group composed of 1 thoracic surgeon, 2 anesthesiologists and 1 critical care specialist assessed the risk for aerosol during lung resection surgery and proposed steps for mitigation. After external review, a final draft was approved by the Committee for the Governance of Perioperative and Surgical Activities of the Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, in Montreal, Canada.

Results

The working group divided the risk for aerosol into 6 time-points: (1) intubation and extubation; (2) Lung isolation and patient positioning; (3) access to the chest; (4) conduct of the surgical procedure; (5) procedure termination and lung re-expansion; (6) chest drainage. Mitigating strategies were proposed for each time-point.

Conclusions

The situation with COVID-19 is an opportunity to re-evaluate operating room protocols both for the purposes of this pandemic and similar situations in the future. In the context of lung resection surgery, specific time points during the procedure seem to pose specific risks for the genesis of aerosol and thus should be the focus of attention.

### Plastic surgery practices amidst global COVID-19 pandemic: Indian consensus [^117LVNgw]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic having spread globally has profound implications on medical and surgical care, which is given by the health care providers. At this time, though there are guidelines and recommendations for medical management of these patients, there is a lack of guidance on how a plastic surgeon should approach the COVID-19 suspect or infected patient who presents either in an elective or emergency setting. We aim to provide a consensus guideline based on the current recommendations of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the pooled experience of the major centers performing plastic and reconstructive surgery in India.

Methods

The current guidelines and recommendations on the COVID-19 pandemic were studied from both government and nongovernment sources including ICMR. The problems in the specialty of plastic surgery were categorized into four groups and for each group, separate and individual guidelines have been formulated.

Guidelines

Consensus guidelines have been formulated for the specialty of Plastic and Reconstructive surgery. The patients requiring plastic surgery service have been categorized into four groups of acute, subacute, chronic, and late category. Acute cases are the ones who require intervention within 24–48 h. Subacute cases are the ones who require intervention in the next 3–10 days, while the chronic are the ones who need plastic surgery preferably within a month. The late category are the ones who need surgery within the next six months. This has been done based on the urgency and priority of surgical intervention titrated against the risks of operating and inadvertently acquiring the exposure of COVID-19-positive patients.

Conclusion

Currently, in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, there are no clear guidelines specific to the vast majority of patients who come for a plastic surgery intervention. This puts the patients at risk due to the impending plastic surgery problem while at the same time it poses a risk of exposure to COVID-19 for the surgical team. Consensus guidelines are presented, to steer the plastic surgeon in his work, in the wake of COVID-19 crisis. The guidelines are based on firm scientific evidence from the reputed research and regulatory bodies and have been made in consonance with plastic surgery experts around the country, so that these practices best suit the needs of the patients, while being mindful of resource limitations and infection risks. The approach of "delayed conservative treatment" works best in the present case scenario.

Clinical practice guidelines are increasingly important to guide clinical care. However, they can vary widely in quality, and many recommendations are based on low-level evidence. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for new flexible formats for rigorously developed guidelines. Future guideline development should be standardised, graded, registered, and updated to ensure that they are 'living' works in progress.

### Postoperative in-hospital morbidity and mortality of patients with COVID-19 infection compared with patients without COVID-19 infection [^116c2ap3]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Several small studies have suggested that patients with positive test results for COVID-19 infection may experience worse perioperative outcomes and increased mortality after surgery. However, those studies were underpowered and lacked generalizability and comparative cohorts. This study used data from a national database to compare the clinical outcomes of surgical patients testing positive for COVID-19 infection with those of a matched sample of surgical patients testing negative for COVID-19 infection. Elucidating the comparative surgical risk profiles of patients with and without COVID-19 infection would help health care systems to improve preoperative guidelines and clinicians to better inform patients in shared medical decision making before surgery.
