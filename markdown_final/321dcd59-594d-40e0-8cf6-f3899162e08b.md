## Question

Infectious colitis diet

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dietary management of infectious colitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and distinguishing infectious colitis from inflammatory bowel disease. Then, I should verify the acute-phase priorities, especially rehydration and when to use lactose restriction. Next, I will examine the timing and composition of refeeding after rehydration. After that, I should consider symptom-targeted adjustments, micronutrient needs, and the role of probiotics. Finally, I will integrate special populations, monitoring, and a practical phased plan, while double-checking where I might be overextending IBD-specific guidance to infectious colitis and correcting it explicitly.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and why it matters for diet advice. Infectious colitis is an acute diarrheal illness caused by invasive or inflammatory enteric pathogens such as Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shiga toxin–producing E. coli, or Clostridioides difficile, and the management hinges on identifying the pathogen and treating appropriately, whereas inflammatory bowel disease is chronic and immune-mediated, so conflating the two risks misapplying chronic-disease diet strategies to an acute infection context [^111UYCmB] [^1139YrQz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronic dietary patterns; I need to ensure the acute-phase priorities are addressed first. The immediate goals are rehydration and correction of electrolytes, with oral rehydration as first-line when tolerated and intravenous fluids for dehydration or inability to maintain oral intake, and I should confirm that early refeeding is safe once rehydration begins rather than prolonged fasting, which does not help recovery [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the role of lactose restriction because this is often overgeneralized. A lactose-free diet can modestly shorten the duration of diarrhea in young children with acute gastroenteritis, but this is not a blanket rule for all infectious colitis; lactose restriction should be individualized based on symptoms of lactose intolerance or persistence of diarrhea beyond about two weeks, and it is not a primary therapy for the infection itself [^115BopXz].

> I will now examine the timing and composition of refeeding after rehydration. Early resumption of an age-appropriate usual diet within about 12 hours of starting rehydration is recommended and is as safe as delayed feeding, so I should avoid instructing patients to withhold solid foods for 24 hours, which lacks supportive evidence and may delay recovery [^115BopXz].

> Next, I should review symptom-targeted dietary adjustments during the acute phase. Small, frequent meals with adequate fluids, temporary reduction of excess fat and simple sugars, and a short-term decrease in high-fiber foods can mitigate stool frequency and abdominal discomfort during active diarrhea, but I need to ensure these are framed as short-term strategies rather than sustained restrictions, and I should tailor to tolerance as symptoms abate [^115BopXz].

> Let me consider micronutrient and nutrition risk issues that commonly accompany acute colitis. I should confirm that patients are screened for dehydration and electrolyte derangements, and I need to remember that while infectious colitis is acute, patients with underlying IBD or malnutrition risk may warrant broader micronutrient surveillance; in IBD populations, vitamin D and iron deficiency are common and B12 deficiency is pertinent with ileal disease or resections, so if the patient has IBD overlap or prolonged symptoms, those IBD-focused monitoring principles can be sensibly applied [^111UYCmB] [^116rS93n].

> But wait, what about probiotics; I should double-check the evidence before recommending them. For acute infectious diarrhea, some guidelines suggest probiotics may be reasonable in select contexts, yet high-quality evidence is heterogeneous and strain-specific, and for C. difficile infection specifically, major guidelines make no recommendation and advise against routine probiotic use outside trials, so I should not routinely prescribe probiotics for infectious colitis without a clear indication or trial context [^114ghHtb] [^1117RViA] [^113AhdH4].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and contexts. In infants and young children, continued breastfeeding or formula feeding should be maintained throughout the diarrheal episode with early return to age-appropriate solids after rehydration, and in older adults or the immunocompromised, I should maintain a lower threshold for escalation to IV fluids and closer monitoring for dehydration and complications, aligning with general infectious diarrhea guidance and supportive care frameworks [^115BopXz].

> Let me reconsider whether any IBD-specific diet advice is creeping in here, because that would be a mistake for acute infectious colitis. Exclusive enteral nutrition, Mediterranean-style patterns, and long-term fiber strategies are IBD-specific and not indicated for acute infectious colitis; I should explicitly correct any inclination to import those chronic-disease diet prescriptions into this acute setting and keep the focus on rehydration, early refeeding, and short-term symptom-guided adjustments [^111B5MyE] [^112uFYEf] [^115BopXz].

> Next, I should review a practical phased approach and make sure it aligns with evidence. Phase 1 emphasizes oral rehydration with low-osmolar solutions and small, frequent intake; Phase 2 introduces early refeeding with easily tolerated foods such as bananas, rice, applesauce, toast, oatmeal, boiled potatoes, lean poultry or fish, and yogurt if lactose is tolerated; Phase 3 expands to a regular diet over several days as diarrhea abates, with gradual reintroduction of fiber and normalization of fat and lactose based on tolerance, and I should warn against restrictive fad diets like BRAT beyond the first couple of days due to nutritional inadequacy [^115BopXz].

> I should double-check monitoring and follow-up elements that signal the need to escalate care. Daily assessment of stool frequency and character, urine output, and signs of dehydration should guide continuation of oral rehydration versus IV therapy, and persistent diarrhea beyond about two weeks, fever, blood in stool, severe abdominal pain, or signs of systemic toxicity should prompt repeat evaluation for ongoing infection, C. difficile, or alternative diagnoses and reconsideration of lactose intolerance or other comorbidities [^115BopXz] [^111UYCmB].

> In summary, I need to ensure the core message remains precise: prioritize timely rehydration, resume an age-appropriate usual diet early after rehydration, use lactose restriction selectively rather than routinely, apply short-term symptom-targeted adjustments, avoid importing chronic IBD diet strategies into acute infectious colitis, and tailor care for special populations while monitoring closely for deterioration or nonresponse that warrants further diagnostic workup [^115BopXz] [^111B5MyE].

For infectious colitis, prioritize **hydration with oral rehydration solutions** [^notfound] and **early refeeding** with a low-residue, lactose-free diet [^115BopXz] as symptoms improve. Avoid **high-fiber, spicy, fatty, caffeine, and alcohol** until diarrhea resolves, and limit lactose if it worsens symptoms. Gradually return to a normal diet over 1–2 weeks, and use a registered dietitian for individualized guidance [^notfound].

---

## Dietary management during acute phase

During the acute phase, **hydration** is critical to replace fluid and electrolyte losses; oral rehydration solutions (ORS) are first-line, and intravenous fluids are indicated for severe dehydration or when oral intake is not tolerated. Early refeeding — resuming an age-appropriate diet within 12–24 hours after rehydration — supports recovery and maintains nutritional status [^115BopXz]. A **low-residue, lactose-free diet** helps reduce stool frequency and gastrointestinal irritation; lactose restriction is reasonable if symptoms persist beyond 2 weeks or if lactose intolerance is suspected [^114RtzQ6].

---

## Foods to include

Recommended foods include:

- **BRAT foods**: Bananas, rice, applesauce, toast — bland, low-fiber, and easy to digest.
- **Lean proteins**: Boiled or steamed chicken, turkey, fish, eggs.
- **Cooked vegetables**: Carrots, zucchini, squash, potatoes (peeled, well-cooked).
- **Simple carbohydrates**: White rice, plain pasta, crackers.
- **Probiotics**: Yogurt with live cultures (if lactose-tolerant) or supplements may aid microbiome recovery [^116ytSe2].

---

## Foods to avoid

Avoid the following foods during the acute phase:

- **High-fiber foods**: Raw fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds.
- **Spicy foods**: Chili peppers, hot sauces, heavily seasoned dishes.
- **Fatty foods**: Fried foods, high-fat meats, full-fat dairy.
- **Lactose-containing foods**: Milk, cheese, ice cream (if lactose intolerant).
- **Caffeine and alcohol**: Coffee, tea, energy drinks, alcoholic beverages.

---

## Dietary management during recovery phase

As symptoms improve, gradually reintroduce a normal diet over 1–2 weeks. Begin with **low-fiber foods** and slowly increase fiber as tolerated. Reintroduce lactose-containing foods only if tolerated, and continue to avoid spicy, fatty, caffeine, and alcohol until fully recovered.

---

## Special considerations

- **Infants and children**: Continue breastfeeding or formula; reintroduce age-appropriate foods after rehydration [^115BopXz].
- **Elderly patients**: Monitor for dehydration and malnutrition; consider nutritional supplements if intake is inadequate.
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Strict food safety and individualized nutrition plans are essential.

---

## Role of a registered dietitian

A registered dietitian provides **individualized nutrition plans** based on patient-specific factors (age, comorbidities, severity) and ensures adequate intake of calories, protein, vitamins, and minerals during recovery [^112kXQtX].

---

## Summary of dietary recommendations

| **Phase** | **Recommended foods** | **Foods to avoid** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute | - ORS <br/> - BRAT <br/> - Lean proteins <br/> - Cooked vegetables <br/> - Simple carbs <br/> - Probiotics | - High-fiber <br/> - Spicy <br/> - Fatty <br/> - Lactose <br/> - Caffeine <br/> - Alcohol |
| Recovery | - Gradual reintroduction of normal diet <br/> - Low-fiber initially <br/> - Lactose if tolerated | - Spicy <br/> - Fatty <br/> - Caffeine <br/> - Alcohol |

---

Dietary management of infectious colitis centers on **hydration**, **early refeeding**, and a **low-residue, lactose-free diet** during the acute phase, with gradual normalization as symptoms resolve. Individualized guidance from a registered dietitian supports recovery and prevents complications [^115BopXz].

### Current recommendations on the role of diet in the aetiology and management of IBD [^11626hgv]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Diet is a key modifier of risk of inflammatory bowel disease development and potentially a treatment option in patients with established disease. International organisations in gastroenterology and inflammatory bowel disease have published guidelines for the role of diet in disease onset and its management. Here, we discuss the major overarching themes arising from these guidelines and appraise recent literature on the role of diet for inflammatory bowel disease prevention, treatment of active disease and maintenance of remission, considering these themes. Except for exclusive enteral nutrition in active Crohn's disease, we currently possess very little evidence to make any further dietary recommendations for the management of inflammatory bowel disease. There is also currently uncertainty on the extrapolation of epidemiological dietary signals on risk of disease development and preclinical experiments in animal models to management, once disease is established. Until high-quality evidence from clinical research becomes available, the only specific recommendations for inflammatory bowel disease we might safely give are those of healthy eating which apply for the general population for overall health and well-being.

Current guidelines and best practice advice

The management of IMDC follows the guidelines from organizations such as the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). A summary of best practice advice and recommendations is shown below:
Infectious causes of diarrhea should be excluded first before treatment of suspected IMDC.
Prompt diagnosis and treatment are required as symptoms and disease severity can escalate rapidly within days.
Grade 1 diarrhea typically requires supportive treatment while continuing ICI therapy as the symptoms are generally mild and self-limited: Supportive treatment includes temporary use of antidiarrheal agents as needed, such as loperamide or cholestyramine. Patients are also recommended adequate oral hydration and dietary modifications with a lactose-free diet and reduced caffeine. For symptoms persisting beyond 2 weeks, corticosteroid therapy may be considered; 9 mg of budesonide daily for at least 4 weeks is a common approach. Prednisone can be also administered for budesonide-resistant cases.
For grade 2 or 3 diarrhea, ICI interruption is recommended, and hospitalization is necessary if systemic symptoms such as fever or dehydration are present. First-line treatment consists of systemic corticosteroid therapy that should be tapered over 4–6 weeks after symptom improvement. A return to grade 1 diarrhea is considered improvement. Prednisone (1–2 mg/kg) is usually administered and has shown effectiveness in 87.5% of patients. Resuming anti-CTLA4 drugs after improvement is not recommended because of a high risk of recurrence, but anti-PD1/PDL1 drugs can be restarted as monotherapy.
For grade 4 diarrhea, ICIs should be stopped, hospitalization is required for monitoring, and intravenous corticosteroids should be started immediately. Intravenous methylprednisolone (1–2 mg/kg) is a standard practice.
Patients with any diarrhea grade and corticosteroid resistance should be considered for escalation to biological agents (infliximab or vedolizumab).
Early stool testing for inflammatory markers such as lactoferrin and calprotectin may help stratify high-risk patients for endoscopic evaluation. Recommended in patients with grade 2 or higher diarrhea/colitis or selected patients with less severe symptoms.
The diagnosis and severity of ICI-induced colitis should be confirmed by endoscopic evaluation before initiation of high-dose systemic glucocorticoids.
In patients with predominant symptoms of pain, fever, or bleeding, abdominal imaging can be performed to exclude other serious complications. Abdominal imaging should not be performed routinely in patients presenting with diarrhea alone.
Hospitalized patients should be reassessed daily to determine their eligibility for discharge. A patient can be discharged if they meet all of the following criteria: grade 1 diarrheal symptoms (< 4 stools per day), resolution of severe abdominal pain, tolerance of oral diet, and normalization of vital signs.

### Diet in the pathogenesis and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases [^116sgjfK]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Some of the most common symptoms of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, which include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. It is therefore not surprising that clinicians and patients have wondered whether dietary patterns influence the onset or course of IBD. The question of what to eat is among the most commonly asked by patients, and among the most difficult to answer for clinicians. There are substantial variations in dietary behaviors of patients and recommendations for them, although clinicians do not routinely endorse specific diets for patients with IBD. Dietary clinical trials have been limited by their inability to include a placebo control, contamination of study groups, and inclusion of patients receiving medical therapies. Additional challenges include accuracy of information on dietary intake, complex interactions between foods consumed, and differences in food metabolism among individuals. We review the roles of diet in the etiology and management of IBD based on plausible mechanisms and clinical evidence. Researchers have learned much about the effects of diet on the mucosal immune system, epithelial function, and the intestinal microbiome; these findings could have significant practical implications. Controlled studies of patients receiving enteral nutrition and observations made from patients on exclusion diets have shown that components of whole foods can have deleterious effects for patients with IBD. Additionally, studies in animal models suggested that certain nutrients can reduce intestinal inflammation. In the future, engineered diets that restrict deleterious components but supplement beneficial nutrients could be used to modify the luminal intestinal environment of patients with IBD; these might be used alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents, or as salvage therapy for patients who do not respond or lose responsiveness to medical therapies. Stricter diets might be required to induce remission, and more sustainable exclusion diets could be used to maintain long-term remission.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the role of probiotics in the management of gastrointestinal disorders [^114fXGqn]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines — methodology and scope emphasize standardized question formulation, evidence appraisal, and intended users. The AGA process for developing clinical practice guidelines follows the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and best practices as outlined by the National Academy of Science (formerly Institute of Medicine), and A priori, the Guideline Panel and methodologist identified and formulated clinically relevant questions about the use of probiotic formulations for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases (not prebiotic use). Each research question identified the population, intervention, comparison, and patient-important outcomes. Although the quality of evidence (Table 1) was a key factor in determining the strength of the recommendations (Table 2), the Panel also considered the balance between the benefits and harms of the interventions, as well as patients' values and preferences, resource use (ie, cost), health equity, acceptability, and feasibility (the Evidence to Decision Framework). The target audience for this guideline includes health care providers, dietitians, and patients, and the guidelines include recommendations for specific populations, including adults, children, and neonates. The panel prioritized conditions in which probiotics are commonly considered and focused on patient-important outcomes, stating they prioritized Clostridioides difficile–associated diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, infectious gastroenteritis, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and focused on patient-important outcomes, such as induction and maintenance of disease, treatment of disease, prevention of sepsis, and all-cause mortality. The authors also note feasibility limits, stating we were not able to assess the viability of each formulation reported in the studies, as this information was not routinely available.

### Dietary management of IBD – insights and advice [^116XRbat]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Medium credibility.

The current general interest in the use of food choice or diet in maintaining good health and in preventing and treating disease also applies to patients with IBD, who often follow poor or nutritionally challenging dietary plans. Unfortunately, dietary advice plays only a minor part in published guidelines for management of IBD, which sends a message that diet is not of great importance. However, a considerable evidence base supports a focused and serious attention to nutrition and diet in patients with IBD. In this Review, a step-wise approach in the evaluation and management of these patients is proposed. First, dietary intake and eating habits as well as current nutritional state should be documented, and corrective measures instituted. Secondly, dietary strategies as primary or adjunctive therapy for the reduction of inflammation and/or prevention of relapse of IBD should be seriously contemplated. Thirdly, use of diet to improve symptoms or lessen the effects of complications should be considered. Finally, dietary advice regarding disease prevention should be discussed when relevant. An increasing need exists for applying improved methodologies into establishing the value of current and new ways of using food choice as a therapeutic and preventive tool in IBD.

### Diet and inflammatory bowel disease: review of patient-targeted recommendations [^115kwFte]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Patients have strong beliefs about the role of diet in the cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and in exacerbating or alleviating ongoing symptoms from IBD. The rapid increase in the incidence and prevalence of IBD in recent decades strongly suggests an environmental trigger for IBD, one of which may be dietary patterns. There are several pathways where diet may influence intestinal inflammation, such as direct dietary antigens, altering the gut microbiome, and affecting gastrointestinal permeability. However, data that altering diet can change the natural history of IBD are scarce, and evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD are lacking. Patients, therefore, seek nonmedical resources for dietary guidance, such as patient support groups and unverified sources on the Internet. The aim of this review is to identify patient-targeted dietary recommendations for IBD and to critically appraise the nutritional value of these recommendations. We review patient-targeted dietary information for IBD from structured Internet searches and popular defined diets. Patient-targeted dietary recommendations focus on food restrictions and are highly conflicting. High-quality dietary intervention studies are needed to facilitate creation of evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD.

### Approach to the patient with infectious colitis: clinical features, work-up and treatment [^111UYCmB]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide the definition, causes, and current recommendations for workup and treatment of acute infectious colitis in adults, a common medical problem of diverse cause.

Recent Findings

The management of acute colitis in adults depend upon establishment of cause. Most forms of infectious colitis are treatable with antimicrobials. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by guided culture on PCR-positive pathogens can often confirm active infection while standard culture methods provide isolates for antibiotic susceptibility testing, subtyping, and Whole Genome Sequencing.

Summary

Patients with colitis may be suffering from a range of etiologies including infectious colitis, neutropenic colitis, drug-induced colitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The present review was prepared to provide an approach to prompt diagnosis and management of acute colitis to prevent severe complications (e.g. dehydration and malnutrition, or toxic megacolon) and provide recommendations for antimicrobial therapy.

### Dietary guidance from the international organization for the study of inflammatory bowel diseases [^1136Fj65]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent evidence points to a plausible role of diet and the microbiome in the pathogenesis of both Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Dietary therapies based on exclusion of table foods and replacement with nutritional formulas and/or a combination of nutritional formulas and specific table foods may induce remission in CD. In UC, specific dietary components have also been associated with flare of disease. While evidence of varying quality has identified potential harmful or beneficial dietary components, physicians and patients at the present time do not have guidance as to which foods are safe, may be protective or deleterious for these diseases. The current document has been compiled by the nutrition cluster of the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IOIBD) based on the best current evidence to provide expert opinion regarding specific dietary components, food groups and food additives that may be prudent to increase or decrease in the diet of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases to control and prevent relapse of inflammatory bowel diseases.

### AGA clinical practice update on diet and nutritional therapies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^115gWS27]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) dietary guidance notes that, at present, it is not known which dietary components of the Mediterranean diet that are emphasized vs those that are minimized underlie its overall efficacy in improving the health of patients with IBD. Specific dietary components that patients with IBD should be cautioned to avoid are sugar-sweetened beverages, which have been linked to etiopathogenic risk and a more severe multiyear clinical course of IBD in a recent prospective cohort study. IBD-specific diet and nutrition guidance for patients and caregivers are available from Crohn's and Colitis Canada and Crohn's and Colitis Foundation, and in ulcerative colitis (UC), decrease in red and processed meat may reduce flares.

### Practical guideline on obesity care in patients with gastrointestinal and liver diseases-joint ESPEN / UEG guideline [^114NR66s]. Clinical Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to patients with obesity (nutrition), ESPEN/UEG 2023 guidelines recommend to increase protein intake to 1.2–1.5 g/kg adjusted body weight/day in adult patients with IBD with active disease and obesity. Provide protein in patients with IBD in remission with obesity similar (0.8–1 g/kg adjusted body weight/day in adults) to that recommended for the general population since protein requirements in remission are generally not elevated unless sarcopenia or malnutrition is present. Consider increasing protein intake (1.2–1.5 g/kg adjusted body weight/day) in patients with IBD in remission with obesity and sarcopenia or with a high risk of malnutrition after malnutrition screening and assessment are conducted.

### Dietary therapy in the management of inflammatory bowel disease: a lasting legacy and a new frontier [^111DxYhp]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

This article highlights the evolving role of dietary strategies in the management of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Advances in understanding diet's influence on IBD pathogenesis and disease progression have renewed interest in the role of diet in the treatment of IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition remains the gold standard, but whole food diets that mimic the composition of EEN or eliminate foods that negatively impact the intestinal microbiome and immune response have shown promise. Additional research that includes larger patient populations and objective data is needed to expand applicability and develop patient-centered recommendations.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^116th9vU]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

5.3 Diet and IBD

Good Practice Recommendation 20. IBD patients should be encouraged to eat a varied diet that meets their energy, macro- and micronutrient requirements. All who are at risk of malnutrition should have dietitian or nutrition team review, and where nutritional requirements cannot be met, supplementation with enteral or parenteral nutrition are indicated (Agreement: 100%).

Dietary patterns and food consumption vary hugely across the world and the diet is very different in countries with a high prevalence of IBD compared with countries with a low prevalence. From epidemiological evidence, when people migrate from a country with a low prevalence of IBD to a country with a high prevalence they are at increased risk of developing IBD, thus incriminating environmental changes. Dietary components that have been associated with an increase in the risk of or relapse of IBD include cereals, dietary fibre, sugar, fat, fruit, vegetables and protein. However, no one dietary component is consistently blamed. Thus, until strong scientific evidence supports a defined diet, patients with IBD should be advised to eat a varied diet to meet their energy and nutrient requirements, including dietary fibre. The diet (box 8) should be based on local healthy eating guidelines and include a wide variety of fruit and vegetables, cereals, grains, nuts and seeds, protein-rich foods with a moderation/reduction of high fat, particularly animal fat, high sugar and processed (cured, salted or smoked) meats. Patients with stricturing Crohn's disease may need to alter their intake of dietary fibre and fibrous foods for symptomatic management of strictures and may need supplementation with enteral or parenteral nutrition to achieve their energy and nutritional requirements. Management of short gut or intestinal failure due to Crohn's disease is covered well elsewhere.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — Best Practice Advice 1 states that, unless there is a contraindication, all patients with IBD should be advised to follow a Mediterranean diet rich in a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, monounsaturated fats, complex carbohydrates, and lean proteins and low in ultraprocessed foods, added sugar, and salt for their overall health and general well-being. No diet has consistently been found to decrease the rate of flares in adults with IBD, and a diet low in red and processed meat may reduce ulcerative colitis flares, but has not been found to reduce relapse in Crohn's disease.

Patients should also be counselled about dietary precautions when travelling, managing their medication, dealing with diarrhoea and travel insurance. They should be advised not to stop immunosuppressive therapy during an exacerbation of symptoms or potential infection. In fact, immunosuppressed IBD patients who may be travelling abroad need to be optimised medically to try and prevent opportunistic infection where possible.

Good Practice Recommendation 26. IBD patients travelling abroad should be advised to take adequate supplies of medication with them and should not stop their immunosuppressive therapy. Those on immunosuppressive drugs should be advised to have a low threshold for treating possible traveller's diarrhoea with quinolones or azithromycin (Agreement: 95.7%).

Travellers with IBD to developing countries (particularly if likely to be staying in accommodation with poor sanitation) are advised to carry a fluoroquinolone course (such as ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily) for empirical self-treatment of traveller's diarrhoea. Azithromycin is comparable to quinolones for self-treatment of traveller's diarrhoea in certain circumstances: (i) patients who take a fluoroquinolone as part of their treatment for IBD; (ii) travellers to countries where endemic bacteria are known to have high levels of fluoroquinolone resistance; (iii) patients who have no response to a quinolone within 36–48 hours; (iv) pregnant women and children < 16 years (for whom a fluoroquinolone is contraindicated). Currently, there is no evidence to support empirical treatment with rifaximin. Overall, the immunocompromised traveller with diarrhoea should have a lower threshold than immune competent travellers for initiating self-therapy, but stool samples should be obtained for microbiology in patients whose diarrhoeal symptoms do not respond to initial antibiotics. All patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they do not respond to simple measures. Returning travellers with diarrhoea should have stool tests for infection and a full blood count for eosinophilia. Travel and opportunistic infection are covered in more detail in recent ECCO guidance.

### A gastroenterologist's guide to probiotics [^112GoQaT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

The enteric microbiota contribute to gastrointestinal health, and their disruption has been associated with many disease states. Some patients consume probiotic products in attempts to manipulate the intestinal microbiota for health benefit. It is important for gastroenterologists to improve their understanding of the mechanisms of probiotics and the evidence that support their use in practice. Clinical trials have assessed the therapeutic effects of probiotic agents for several disorders, including antibiotic- or Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and the inflammatory bowel diseases. Although probiotic research is a rapidly evolving field, there are sufficient data to justify a trial of probiotics for treatment or prevention of some of these conditions. However, the capacity of probiotics to modify disease symptoms is likely to be modest and varies among probiotic strains-not all probiotics are right for all diseases. The current review provides condition-specific rationale for using probiotic therapy and literature-based recommendations.

### Diet as a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease: is it ready for prime time? [^115ofuaL]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diet remains an important topic for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), yet few guidelines for dietary recommendations exist. There is a growing interest in the use of diet as treatment or adjuvant therapy for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Here, we highlight the latest evidence on the use of diet for treatment of symptoms, active disease and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

Recent Findings

The Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED) and the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) are studied diets that have gained popularity, but there is growing interest in the use and efficacy of less restrictive diets such as the Mediterranean diet. Recent data suggest healthful dietary patterns alone, with an emphasis on whole foods that are high in vegetable fibre and that promote less consumption of ultra-processed foods may also help achieve remission in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

Summary

In this review, we summarize the literature on diet as treatment for IBD. We highlight the latest clinical dietary studies, randomized clinical trials, as well as new and emerging diets for the treatment of IBD.

### Use of probiotics in gastrointestinal disorders: what to recommend? [^116ytSe2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Perturbation of bacterial microflora of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may play an important role in the pathophysiology of some GI disorders. Probiotics have been used as a treatment modality for over a century. They may restore normal bacterial microflora and effect the functioning of the GI tract by a variety of mechanisms. Probiotics are not currently regulated and only few randomized controlled trials exist investigating their efficacy in different GI disorders. They are available in a variety of formulations and delivery systems making interpretation and comparison of studies even more difficult. The efficacy of probiotics, either as a single strain or a combination of probiotics, has been tested in antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile colitis, infectious diarrhea, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, pouchitis, and irritable bowel syndrome, among other disorders. Results of the studies are reviewed in this article and recommendations for probiotic use in these disorders are made. Although probiotics appear to be generally safe in an outpatient setting, the situation may be different in immunocompromised, hospitalized patients who may be at a greater risk of developing probiotic sepsis. No studies exist addressing the issue of safety specifically. Many questions regarding use of probiotics in GI disorders remain to be answered in future studies, such as most optimal doses, duration of treatment, physiological and immunological effects, efficacy of specific probiotics in specific disease states, and safety in debilitated patients.

### A prospective, randomized, controlled, exploratory study of comprehensive dietary advice in ulcerative colitis: impact on disease activity and quality of life [^114RtzQ6]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The impact of food on relapse in ulcerative colitis has not been clearly defined. The aim of this prospective, randomized-controlled study was to evaluate the impact of comprehensive dietary guidelines on the clinical course of the disease and quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis.

Materials and Methods

Patients were allocated randomly to an intervention or a control group. Participants in the intervention group were provided dietary guidelines in the form of an educational booklet that was recommended for use for 4–6 weeks during disease flare, that patients eat little and often (four to six times a day), drink adequate fluids, decrease excess intake of fat, decrease simple carbohydrates and decrease high-fibre foods during flare. Validated and study-designed questionnaires were used to compare patients' perceived quality of life, colitis activity scores and eating habits before and following the dietary advice provided.

Results

Overall, 112 patients completed the study. Study participants were asked to complete the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index together with the Food Frequency Questionnaire at 0, 6 and 24 weeks. At 24 weeks, there was a mean reduction in the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index score in the intervention group compared with an increase in the score in the control group [-1.304 (P = 0.0108) vs. 0.875 (P = 0.0249)]. There was a mean increase in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire score in the intervention group compared with a reduction in the score in the control group [7.17 (P = 0.126) vs. -3.44 (P = 0.205)]. A total of 69% of patients in the intervention group found the dietary advice significantly or moderately helpful.

Conclusion

The study suggests that there is likely to be a link between the dietary advice provided and symptomatic improvement. The effect of diet may not occur through the addition or the elimination of single nutrients; rather, each food consumed combines many nutrients that allow for a synergistic or an antagonistic action when present in a certain composition.

Environmental and lifestyle factors play an important role in the natural history of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. A group of international experts from the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases voted on a series of consensus statements to inform the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The recommendations include avoiding traditional cigarette smoking in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, screening for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychosocial stressors at diagnosis and during flares (with referral to mental health professionals when appropriate), and encouraging regular physical activity as tolerated. Patients using dietary approaches for treatment of their IBD should be encouraged to adopt diets that are best supported by evidence and involve monitoring for the objective resolution of inflammation. We recommend formal assessment for obesity and nutritional deficiencies, and patients should be encouraged to maintain a normal body-mass index. A shared decision-making approach to contraception should include the consideration of IBD-related factors, and risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Long-term or frequent use of high-dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided. For primary prevention of disease in the offspring of patients with IBD, we recommend avoiding passive exposure to tobacco, using antibiotics judiciously, and considering breastfeeding when able.

### Recommendations for probiotic use [^114ghHtb]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Probiotics are live microbial organisms that are administrated as supplements or in foods to benefit the host. It is the recommendation that they may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of acute diarrhea in adults and children, the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults and children, and the maintenance of remission and prevention of pouchitis. Although early results indicate that probiotics may also be useful in immunologic modulation to prevent atopy, treatment of radiation intestinal disease, vaginosis, ulcerative colitis, and the irritable bowel syndrome, the studies available are not sufficient to say they are definitely helpful. Even fewer data are available to recommend probiotics for the treatment of H pylori and Crohn disease and for the prevention of cardiovascular risk factors or other degenerative diseases. Clearly, larger and better-designed studies of probiotics are necessary, including comparative and dose-ranging trials.

### Approach to the patient with infectious colitis [^1139YrQz]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide current recommendations for evaluation and treatment of patients with infectious colitis. Infectious colitis is diagnosed in someone with diarrhea and one or more of the following: fever and/or dysentery, stools containing inflammatory markers such as leukocytes, lactoferrin, or calprotectin, or positive stool culture for an invasive or inflammatory bacterial enteropathogen including Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) or Clostridium difficile, or colonic inflammation by endoscopy.

Recent Findings

Standard stool culture should be performed in patients with infectious colitis. Epidemiologic findings including prior international travel, shellfish-associated diarrhea, living in parasite-endemic regions may suggest the need for specialized studies of etiology. When STEC is suspected as a pathogen because only low grade or no fever is seen in a patient with acute dysentery, a competent laboratory should look for E. coli O157:H7 and Shiga toxin directly in stool.

Summary

Once laboratory diagnosis is made, pathogen-specific antimicrobial therapy should be initiated for all forms of infectious colitis other than STEC. For empiric treatment of febrile dysenteric diarrhea invasive bacterial enteropathogens (Shigella, Salmonella, and Campylobacter) should be suspected and adults may be treated empirically with 1000mg azithromycin in a single dose.

### Inpatient management of inflammatory bowel disease-related complications [^117W8A2M]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in therapeutic options, a sizeable proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease require hospitalization or surgery during their lifetime. While current treatment guidelines for the management of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease cover the spectrum of disease severity and behavior, management of acute complications of inflammatory bowel disease can present unique challenges that are not always addressed in these guidelines. In this review, the authors provide a comprehensive summary of the existing literature focused on management of patients hospitalized with complications of inflammatory bowel disease. Proposed management algorithms are provided to guide clinicians through common scenarios to determine the most appropriate interventions - escalation of medical therapies, non-surgical therapeutic interventions (drainage of intra-abdominal abscess or endoscopic balloon dilation) or surgery. Prevention of complications is proposed through a multi-disciplinary approach that involves surgeons, dieticians, radiologists, pathologists and infectious disease consultants.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^112gyJ4j]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the principal forms of inflammatory bowel disease. Both represent chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which displays heterogeneity in inflammatory and symptomatic burden between patients and within individuals over time. Optimal management relies on understanding and tailoring evidence-based interventions by clinicians in partnership with patients. This guideline for management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults over 16 years of age was developed by Stakeholders representing UK physicians (British Society of Gastroenterology), surgeons (Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland), specialist nurses (Royal College of Nursing), paediatricians (British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition), dietitians (British Dietetic Association), radiologists (British Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology), general practitioners (Primary Care Society for Gastroenterology) and patients (Crohn's and Colitis UK). A systematic review of 88247 publications and a Delphi consensus process involving 81 multidisciplinary clinicians and patients was undertaken to develop 168 evidence- and expert opinion-based recommendations for pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgical interventions, as well as optimal service delivery in the management of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Comprehensive up-to-date guidance is provided regarding indications for, initiation and monitoring of immunosuppressive therapies, nutrition interventions, pre-, peri- and postoperative management, as well as structure and function of the multidisciplinary team and integration between primary and secondary care. Twenty research priorities to inform future clinical management are presented, alongside objective measurement of priority importance, determined by 2379 electronic survey responses from individuals living with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, including patients, their families and friends.

### Diet therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases: a call to the dining table [^117FsuMR]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

There is vigorous interest among patients, caregivers, clinicians, and scientists to identify useful dietary interventions for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Through the Cochrane Collaboration, we recently performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of dietary interventions for the induction or maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) to assess the latest state of research. The current quality of evidence was formally graded to be low or very low for various methodological reasons, such as small sample sizes, heterogeneity among studies, and incomplete reporting. There are nonetheless emerging observational studies that progressively advance our knowledge and provide hope for a role of diet among traditional therapies to improve inflammation and symptoms. Further investments and concerted efforts in research are needed to significantly move the needle in identifying effective dietary therapies for IBD.

### The impact of diet on Clostridioides difficile infection: a review [^112nDGxj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the paucity of studies on nutritional interventions for the prevention or treatment of CDI, studies of the benefits of diet in other gastrointestinal disorders suggest that it could be fruitful to explore dietary intervention for C difficile further. For instance, in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic inflammatory condition of the intestinal tract, diet therapy has proven to be of great benefit. In pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, exclusive enteral nutrition is more efficient than steroids for inducing short-term remission and promoting mucosal healing in patients with mild to moderate disease. Other dietary interventions, such as the "Crohn's disease exclusion diet" and the "specific carbohydrate diet", exclude specific foods and food additives known to be proinflammatory. Both diets have demonstrated clinical and mucosal improvements in patients with IBD. Other studies have evaluated the role of the "Western" diet on inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis. Fritsch et al performed a cross-over study assessing the impact of a low-fat/high-fiber diet compared to an improved standard American diet, comprised of higher amounts of fruits, vegetables, and dietary fibers. Patients on the low-fat/high-fiber diet showed decreased inflammatory markers and alterations in the intestinal microbiome, suggesting improved intestinal dysbiosis compared to those on the improved standard American diet. Similar to rodent studies, other human studies have focused on the role of SCFAs in patients with IBD. Di Sabatino et al demonstrated that patients with mild to moderate Crohn's disease who were treated with daily oral sodium butyrate supplements had decreased disease activity and inflammation and improved endoscopic and histologic findings after 8 weeks. Likewise, Vernero et al showed that 83.3% of patients with ulcerative colitis treated with mesalamine and oral butyrate were in remission after 12 months of treatment compared to 47.6% of patients receiving mesalamine alone.

Various studies in healthy persons have demonstrated the ability of dietary modifications to alter the composition of gut metabolites. A randomized controlled trial by Deehan et al comparing the effects of 3 resistant starches (maize, potato, and tapioca) showed dose-dependent increases in butyrate and propionate in persons who consumed maize or tapioca. Since butyrate has been shown in vitro and in mouse models to be protective against CDI, such interventions may be beneficial for preventing and treating CDI. However, since recurrent CDI is associated with a highly disturbed gut microbiome that may not contain the appropriate taxa for metabolizing dietary elements to beneficial metabolites, testing of potentially promising interventions directly in relevant CDI populations is essential.

### Nutritional interventions for the treatment of IBD: current evidence and controversies [^112mB4RD]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

The role of diet in the pathogenesis of IBD

Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases of unknown aetiology, characterized by a recurrent inflammatory condition. The pathophysiology is multifactorial and complex, involving an inappropriate immune activation of the gut mucosa in genetically susceptible individuals, triggered by an altered composition of the gut microbiota. The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has increased worldwide in developed nations and more recently in developing countries. This rapid increase in the incidence of IBD over the last half-century, particularly in developing countries, clearly points to the role of changing environmental factors intrinsically implicated in disease development. Genes cannot change within such a short time frame, thus disease susceptibility remains almost identical over several generations. The differing role of genetics and the environment in disease development is clearly reflected by epidemiological data on immigrants from low- to high-IBD-incidence regions: where, the second generation of immigrants has the same risk of developing IBD as the local population living for generations in the same area. A western lifestyle, including changes in dietary habits, urbanization and industrialization, has been proposed as one explanation for this worldwide increase in IBD.

Description

Diet plays a critical role in human health, but especially for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Guidance about diet for patients with IBD are often controversial and a source of uncertainty for many physicians and patients. The role of diet has been investigated as a risk factor for IBD etiopathogenesis and as a therapy for active disease. Dietary restrictions, along with the clinical complications of IBD, can result in malnutrition, an underrecognized condition among this patient population. The aim of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update (CPU) is to provide best practice advice statements, primarily to clinical gastroenterologists, covering the topics of diet and nutritional therapies in the management of IBD, while emphasizing identification and treatment of malnutrition in these patients. We provide guidance for tailored dietary approaches during IBD remission, active disease, and intestinal failure. A healthy Mediterranean diet will benefit patients with IBD, but may require accommodations for food texture in the setting of intestinal strictures or obstructions. New data in Crohn's disease supports the use of enteral liquid nutrition to help induce remission and correct malnutrition in patients heading for surgery. Parenteral nutrition plays a critical role in patients with IBD facing acute and/or chronic intestinal failure. Registered dietitians are an essential part of the interdisciplinary team approach for optimal nutrition assessment and management in the patient population with IBD.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the CPU Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. The best practice advice statements were drawn from reviewing existing literature combined with expert opinion to provide practical advice on the role of diet and nutritional therapies in patients with IBD. Because this was not a systematic review, formal rating of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations was not performed. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Unless there is a contraindication, all patients with IBD should be advised to follow a Mediterranean diet rich in a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, monounsaturated fats, complex carbohydrates, and lean proteins and low in ultraprocessed foods, added sugar, and salt for their overall health and general well-being. No diet has consistently been found to decrease the rate of flares in adults with IBD. A diet low in red and processed meat may reduce ulcerative colitis flares, but has not been found to reduce relapse in Crohn's disease. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with IBD who have symptomatic intestinal strictures may not tolerate fibrous, plant-based foods (ie, raw fruits and vegetables) due to their texture. An emphasis on careful chewing and cooking and processing of fruits and vegetables to a soft, less fibrinous consistency may help patients with IBD who have concomitant intestinal strictures incorporate a wider variety of plant-based foods and fiber in their diets. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Exclusive enteral nutrition using liquid nutrition formulations is an effective therapy for induction of clinical remission and endoscopic response in Crohn's disease, with stronger evidence in children than adults. Exclusive enteral nutrition may be considered as a steroid-sparing bridge therapy for patients with Crohn's disease. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Crohn's disease exclusion diet, a type of partial enteral nutrition therapy, may be an effective therapy for induction of clinical remission and endoscopic response in mild to moderate Crohn's disease of relatively short duration. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Exclusive enteral nutrition may be an effective therapy in malnourished patients before undergoing elective surgery for Crohn's disease to optimize nutritional status and reduce postoperative complications. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: In patients with IBD who have an intra-abdominal abscess and/or phlegmonous inflammation that limits ability to achieve optimal nutrition via the digestive tract, short-term parenteral nutrition may be used to provide bowel rest in the preoperative phase to decrease infection and inflammation as a bridge to definitive surgical management and to optimize surgical outcomes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: We suggest the use of parenteral nutrition for high-output gastrointestinal fistula, prolonged ileus, short bowel syndrome, and for patients with IBD with severe malnutrition when oral and enteral nutrition has been trialed and failed or when enteral access is not feasible or contraindicated. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: In patients with IBD and short bowel syndrome, long-term parenteral nutrition should be transitioned to customized hydration management (ie, intravenous electrolyte support and/or oral rehydration solutions) and oral intake whenever possible to decrease the risk of developing long-term complications. Treatment with glucagon-like peptide-2 agonists can facilitate this transition. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: All patients with IBD warrant regular screening for malnutrition by their provider by means of assessing signs and symptoms, including unintended weight loss, edema and fluid retention, and fat and muscle mass loss. When observed, more complete evaluation for malnutrition by a registered dietitian is indicated. Serum proteins are no longer recommended for the identification and diagnosis of malnutrition due to their lack of specificity for nutritional status and high sensitivity to inflammation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: All patients with IBD should be monitored for vitamin D and iron deficiency. Patients with extensive ileal disease or prior ileal surgery (resection or ileal pouch) should be monitored for vitamin B12 deficiency. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: All outpatients and inpatients with complicated IBD warrant co-management with a registered dietitian, especially those who have malnutrition, short bowel syndrome, enterocutaneous fistula, and/or are requiring more complex nutrition therapies (eg, parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition, or exclusive enteral nutrition), or those on a Crohn's disease exclusion diet. We suggest that all newly diagnosed patients with IBD have access to a registered dietitian. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Breastfeeding is associated with a lower risk for diagnosis of IBD during childhood. A healthy, balanced, Mediterranean diet rich in a variety of fruits and vegetables and decreased intake of ultraprocessed foods have been associated with a lower risk of developing IBD.

When should feeding be initiated following rehydration — recommendations and evidence: Human milk feeding should be continued in infants and children throughout the diarrheal episode (strong, low), and resumption of an age-appropriate usual diet is recommended during or immediately after the rehydration process is completed (strong, low). Evidence includes that early feeding (within 12 hours of beginning rehydration) was as safe and effective as later feeding among children aged < 6 years old with acute diarrhea, and a meta-analysis of 33 trials involving children < 5 years of age found that a lactose-free diet reduced the duration of diarrhea by an average of 18 hours and reduced treatment failure by one half. Although the BRAT diet and avoidance of dairy are commonly recommended, supporting data for those interventions are limited, and instructing patients to refrain from eating solid food for 24 hours does not appear to be useful.

### Opening the doors of precision medicine: novel tools to assess intestinal barrier in inflammatory bowel disease and colitis-associated neoplasia [^115hYmAW]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Notably, the complex host-microbiome-food interplay can directly impact the effect of dietary interventions on the barrier. Metabolites produced by commensal organisms, including in response to diet, can affect host metabolic processes, potentially leading to protective or pathogenic consequences. A multi-OMIC phenotyping can provide deeper insights into the dynamic interaction among diet, the microbiome and the gut and circulating metabolome, elucidating how dietary compounds modulate microbiome composition and alter host metabolism. These approaches are promising for tailoring dietary therapeutic interventions to individual patients.

In conclusion, interventions aimed at modulating the intestinal barrier and the gut-brain axis, targeting the microbiome and the epithelial and vascular barrier components, represent promising avenues for personalised therapeutic interventions, leading to improved outcomes in patients with IBD and colitis-associated neoplasia. Nonetheless, available data are mainly from animal studies and in vitro research, and to date, no drug has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency for modulating the barrier. Dietary interventions offer a complementary approach to bolstering intestinal barrier function and enhancing disease management strategies.

### Diet fuelling inflammatory bowel diseases: preclinical and clinical concepts [^116VjbvZ]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Collectively, excessive intake of specific food constituents in a Western diet may be a potent trigger of gut dysbiosis in humans (eg, by increased intake of calories derived from fat, digestible carbohydrates, animal protein and food additives), and IBD-associated dysbiosis exerts inflammatory functions in genetically susceptible mice. However, several aspects are poorly resolved in this context. For example, what is the specific impact of blooming pathobionts or loss of symbionts in human IBD and can this be therapeutically exploited? Critical mechanistic insights are probably best exemplified by studies on adherent invasive E. coli. Moreover, current human studies rarely delineate, which genetic susceptibility is required to elicit diet-induced gut inflammation, with or without dysbiosis, in patients at risk for IBD. And finally, other environmental influences (possibly also in early life) impact gut microbial functions, such that the diet emerges as one, but not sole rheostat of dysbiosis in IBD. Despite these unresolved issues it was conceived that a specific dietary pattern could be used to reverse microbial perturbation and to ameliorate gut inflammation in IBD, which has been explored by recent dietary intervention trials.

### Antibiotics and probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: when to use them? [^117AXn9v]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics and probiotics are often used as adjunctive therapy in inflammatory bowel disease. However, data are limited and randomised controlled trials are too inconsistent to provide generalised recommendations for their use in all patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Antibiotics are best used in the management of infectious complications and fistulas in Crohn's disease and, perhaps, in reducing the intensity of inflammation in luminal disease. Ciprofloxacin, metronidazole and rifaximin have been most widely used and studied. On the other hand, there appears to be a limited role for antibiotics in ulcerative colitis (UC). Probiotics are most effective in pouchitis, and may have a role in the initial therapy and maintenance of remission in mild UC; the probiotic cocktail VSL#3 has been the most widely studied. There is scant evidence of efficacy for probiotics in Crohn's disease.

4.2.3 Nutritional therapy

Statement 34. We suggest that Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) may be used to induce remission in mild to moderate Crohn's disease patients where avoidance of corticosteroid is desired, and in those who are motivated to adhere strictly to EEN for up to 8 weeks (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 86.4%).

Statement 35. We recommend that polymeric feeds are as effective as elemental or semi-elemental feeds in treatment of Crohn's disease, and improve adherence (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 86.7%).

4.2.3.1 Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN)

Meta-analysis has shown that EEN is as effective as corticosteroids at inducing remission in 73% of paediatric patients on an intention to treat basisbut not in adults. In paediatrics, it is considered the primary treatment option to induce disease remission, and has added value in that it not only improves nutritional status but also benefits growth. In adults, although studies have been small and underpowered, there does seem to be a consistent message that, where tolerated, EEN can be effective at inducing remissioneven in the presence of complications. There is increasing evidence that EEN can alter the microbiome, with differences in those who have a long-term response.

Tips on the use of EEN are shown in box 3. In practice, EEN is not frequently used in adult populations. This is reportedly due to a lack of high-quality evidence for its useand limited access to dietetic expertise within an IBD multidisciplinary team (MDT). Where avoidance of corticosteroids is considered appropriate and patients are motivated to try dietary alternatives, EEN should be considered with appropriate dietetic support.

### Raising the bar in ulcerative colitis management [^111hmUPM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Regardless of the therapeutic choices made, it is also essential to ensure optimal patient engagement and compliance, which in turn will lead to a better recognition of flare symptoms and self-management. Additionally, monitoring everyday life aspects and disease burden, such as nutritional status and diet, is crucial. Several emerging studies are investigating the role of diet in patients with IBD and the potential benefits of nutritional counseling in UC management. Future clinical research is needed to evaluate the impact of dietary recommendations on therapeutic outcomes and maintain adequate nutrition(Figure 1).

UC, ulcerative colitis.

Another relevant aspect in current and future UC management is the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on clinical practice. As infrastructure evolves, AI-powered disease measurement tools may enable procedures to be performed locally and analyzed via cloud-based platforms, enhancing standardization and objectivity of care. Recent advancements have seen AI replicate expert endoscopic interpretation with efficiency and near-perfect reproducibility. Moreover, AI holds promise for histologic interpretation of remission and provides real-time histologic information to IBD endoscopists without the need for biopsy.

ABSTRACT

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), namely, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are lifelong and incurable chronic inflammatory diseases affecting 6.8 million people worldwide. By 2030, the prevalence of IBD is estimated to reach 1% of the population in Western countries, and thus there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies to reduce the burden of this disease. Microbiome dysbiosis is at the heart of the IBD pathophysiology, and current research and development efforts for IBD treatments have been focused on gut microbiome regulation. Diet can shape the intestinal microbiome. Diet is also preferred over medication, is safe, and has been proven to be an effective strategy for the management of IBD. Therefore, although often overlooked, dietary interventions targeting the microbiome represent ideal treatments for IBD. Here, I summarize the latest research on diet as a treatment for IBD from infancy to adulthood, compile evidence of the mechanisms of action behind diet as treatment, and, lastly, provide insights into future research focusing on culturally tailored diets for ethnic minority groups with increased incidence of IBD yet underrepresented in nutrition research.

Discussion

Currently, most patients are treated for ulcerative colitis with medication, while a few may undergo surgery if their condition requires it. Although medication can temporarily relieve disease activity, most patients believe that medication is insufficient to control the disease or maintain the disease in remission for a protracted duration. In addition, chronic intestinal inflammation affects multiple systems, causing a wide range of symptoms and complications. Treatment with drugs over the long term can be problematic, with side effects and progressive effectiveness loss. Moreover, the onset and therapeutic effect of UC treatment are greatly influenced by the environment, of which diet is an important factor. Exploring the influence of diet between the pathogenesis and treatment of UC makes more sense for long-term disease management, including reducing incidence, alleviating symptoms, improving response to conventional treatments, avoiding medication side effects, and decreasing disease burden. Additionally, dietary guidance may be beneficial to improve their overall quality of life.

### Diet and microbiome-directed therapy 2.0 for IBD [^115Mwym1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises chronic and relapsing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by dysregulated immune responses to the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome and diet are key environmental factors that influence the onset and progression of IBD and can be leveraged for treatment. In this review, we summarize the current evidence on the role of the gut microbiome and diet in IBD pathogenesis, and the potential of microbiome-directed therapies and dietary interventions to improve IBD outcomes. We discuss available data and the advantages and drawbacks of the different approaches to manipulate the gut microbiome, such as fecal microbiota transplantation, next-generation and conventional probiotics, and postbiotics. We also review the use of diet as a therapeutic tool in IBD, including the effects in induction and maintenance, special diets, and exclusive enteral nutrition. Finally, we highlight the challenges and opportunities for the translation of diet and microbiome interventions into clinical practice, such as the need for personalization, manufacturing and regulatory hurdles, and the specificity to take into account for clinical trial design.

Crohn's disease (CD) is chronic immune-related disease of the gastrointestinal tract hypothesized to be caused by an interplay of genetic predisposition and environmental exposures. With the global incidence increasing, more patients are exploring dietary exposures to explain and treat CD. However, most patients report minimal nutritional education from their provider, and providers report few nutritional resources to help them educate patients. This highlights the previous deficit of literature describing the role and influence of diet in CD. To address this need, this article reviews available literature on the possible roles of diet in the pathogenesis, exacerbation, and treatment of CD.

### Management of inflammatory bowel disease… [^112ZVxWP]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Dietary and Nutritional Factors Lactose malabsorption is present in 35 percent of patients with Crohn's disease 12 and 20 percent of patients with ulcerative colitis. 13 Since the symptoms of lactose malabsorption can be confused with those of active inflammatory bowel disease, the presence of this digestive disorder should be elicited by the history and, if necessary, appropriate laboratory tests. Lactose has no effect on the activity of inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, lactose consumption does not need to be prohibited in all patients with this diagnosis. Alternative calcium supplementation should be used in patients who are on a lactose-restricted diet. Low-fiber diets do not alter the course of inflammatory bowel disease. However, these diets can be helpful in patients with active symptoms, stenoses and/or obstructive symptoms. Vitamin deficiencies, especially vitamin B 12 deficiency, may occur in patients with Crohn's disease or previous ileal resection.

Iron deficiency is also relatively common in patients with Crohn's disease. Folate deficiency can occur as a result of poor dietary intake or the interference of sulfasalazine with folate metabolism. Occasionally, inflammatory bowel disease can present with an anemia that does not respond to iron replacement therapy. Recently, concomitant administration of synthetic erythropoietin has been shown to be beneficial in treating this refractory anemia.
14. In patients with active colitis, significant protein calorie malnutrition with low serum protein and albumin levels is indicative of severe disease that may require hospitalization and intravenous hyperalimentation therapy. Chronic severe malnutrition in patients with short-bowel syndrome due to massive surgical resection of the small intestines is an indication for home intravenous hyperalimentation therapy.

Enteral hyperalimentation with elemental or oligomeric formulas has been used as primary therapy for active Crohn's disease, especially in Europe. Comparative randomized trials have shown that this nutritional therapy is as effective as or slightly less effective than corticosteroid therapy. 15 However, enteral diets tend to be unpalatable and expensive, factors that have limited their use. 18 A dosage of 4 g per day has the most benefit, but it requires taking 16 tablets per day. A dosage of 2 to 3 g per day is effective in patients with active ulcerative colitis. In a dosage of 1 to 2 g per day, mesalamine is equal to sulfasalazine in maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis. 19.
