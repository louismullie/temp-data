## Question

Can octeotride help hematoschezia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether octreotide can help hematochezia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what hematochezia implies clinically and how urgently we should act. Then, I should verify the likely etiologies that respond to octreotide versus those that do not. Next, I will review the strength of evidence for octreotide in those responsive conditions, including dosing and duration. After that, I need to check guideline positions and any conflicting data. Finally, I will consider safety, contraindications, and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with clear next steps for evaluation and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct: hematochezia is bright red blood per rectum, which can reflect brisk lower GI bleeding or, when massive, even a very rapid upper GI source. I should not jump to conclusions about location without correlating hemodynamics and nasogastric aspirate if unstable, because unstable patients with hematochezia may still have an upper GI source and require upper endoscopy first [^112wtBbE].

> Now, I need to identify the scenarios where octreotide is most likely to help. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — octreotide is not a general hemostatic for all lower GI bleeding. Its clearest benefit is in portal hypertensive bleeding, including esophagogastric varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy/colopathy, where somatostatin analogs reduce splanchnic inflow and portal pressure and are first-line vasoactive therapy in acute variceal hemorrhage [^116n5YaY] [^111PEAPB] [^114rZFGp].

> Next, I should review the evidence for angiodysplasia, because that is the other context where octreotide is frequently considered. Wait, let me verify the quality of data: earlier observational and pooled analyses suggested reduced transfusions and rebleeding with somatostatin analogs, but these were small and heterogeneous. However, the OCEAN randomized trial showed that long-acting octreotide reduced transfusion requirements by about 10 units per year versus standard of care in transfusion-dependent angiodysplasia, which meaningfully shifts the evidence base toward benefit in refractory cases [^113W6Jqw] [^112H5ovG].

> I should confirm dosing and duration so the recommendation is actionable. For acute variceal bleeding, guidelines endorse an IV bolus of 50 mcg followed by 50 mcg/hour for 2–5 days, ideally started before endoscopy and continued until hemostasis is secured. Shorter 1-day courses after successful banding appear noninferior to 5 days in a recent RCT, but I need to be cautious about extrapolating that to all settings and default to guideline-concordant 2–5 days unless a multidisciplinary team supports a shorter course in a carefully selected patient [^115XstJp] [^1119ewtb] [^112hJuyw]. For angiodysplasia, long-acting octreotide 20 mg IM monthly is the regimen supported by the RCT and is reasonable for at least 6–12 months in transfusion-dependent patients after or when endoscopic therapy is not feasible or has failed [^112jCPaY].

> But wait, what if the hematochezia is from diverticular bleeding, ischemic colitis, infectious colitis, malignancy, or anorectal sources like hemorrhoids or fissures? I should double-check: octreotide has no proven benefit in these non-variceal, non-angiodysplastic etiologies, and guidelines do not recommend it for non-variceal lower GI bleeding. In such cases, supportive care, colonoscopic diagnosis and therapy, surgery or IR as indicated, and disease-specific management are the mainstays, not somatostatin analogs [^112wtBbE].

> I need to ensure safety is addressed. Octreotide is generally well tolerated, but I should monitor for biliary sludge and cholelithiasis, glucose dysregulation, thyroid suppression, and bradycardia or conduction effects, especially with IV therapy or in patients on beta-blockers. These risks are usually manageable with monitoring, but they reinforce the need to reserve octreotide for appropriate indications and durations [^111WN5bH] [^113GkBPc] [^111s1ig4].

> Let me synthesize: yes, octreotide can help hematochezia, but only when the bleeding source is portal hypertensive (varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy/colopathy) or when it is due to refractory angiodysplasia causing transfusion-dependent anemia. It is not effective for common non-variceal, non-angiodysplastic causes of hematochezia, and it should be integrated with guideline-directed resuscitation, endoscopic therapy, and etiologic management rather than used in isolation [^116n5YaY] [^114ghUwu] [^112wtBbE].

> Practically, I should confirm hemodynamic stability, exclude an upper GI source if instability or risk features are present, and pursue colonoscopy for localization and therapy when feasible. If angiodysplasia is identified and bleeding remains refractory despite endoscopic treatment, a trial of long-acting octreotide is reasonable. If portal hypertensive colopathy or rectal varices are suspected, initiate IV octreotide promptly alongside antibiotics and plan for definitive endoscopic or radiologic therapy. If the source is non-angiodysplastic and non-portal hypertensive, octreotide should be avoided and management should follow disease-specific pathways [^112wtBbE] [^114ghUwu] [^116n5YaY].

---

Octreotide can help hematochezia when it is due to **portal hypertensive bleeding** (e.g. varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy/colopathy) [^116n5YaY] or **angiodysplasia** [^114ghUwu], by reducing splanchnic blood flow and promoting hemostasis. It is **not effective for common lower GI bleeding sources** such as diverticulosis, ischemia, malignancy, or anorectal causes, and is not recommended for routine hematochezia management [^112wtBbE]. Use octreotide only when the etiology is portal hypertensive or angiodysplasia-related, and combine with endoscopic therapy and supportive care [^115aVUFf].

---

## Mechanisms of action relevant to hematochezia

Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, reduces gastrointestinal bleeding through **several mechanisms**:

- **Splanchnic vasoconstriction**: Reduces portal venous pressure and mesenteric blood flow, beneficial in portal hypertensive bleeding [^114FARRG].

- **Inhibition of secretions**: Decreases gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal secretions, potentially stabilizing clots.

- **Enhanced platelet aggregation**: May improve platelet function, aiding hemostasis in vascular malformations [^1142QfMd].

---

## Clinical evidence for octreotide in hematochezia

### Portal hypertensive bleeding

- **Variceal hemorrhage**: Octreotide is first-line for acute variceal bleeding, reducing transfusion needs and improving hemostasis [^116n5YaY] [^115gkiZN].

- **Portal hypertensive colopathy**: Case reports show octreotide controls acute bleeding from portal hypertensive colopathy, especially when TIPS or beta-blockers are not feasible [^117R2qGv].

- **Rectal varices**: Octreotide is used for rectal variceal bleeding, though evidence is limited and endoscopic therapy remains key [^1146GiCM].

---

### Angiodysplasia

- **Refractory angiodysplasia**: Octreotide reduces transfusion requirements and rebleeding in transfusion-dependent angiodysplasia, including small-bowel disease [^114ghUwu] [^112H5ovG].

- **Systematic reviews**: Somatostatin analogs reduce transfusion needs in angiodysplasia, with octreotide showing superiority in some analyses [^1153mZey] [^117PgDiW].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

Octreotide is **not effective for common lower GI bleeding etiologies** such as diverticulosis, ischemic colitis, malignancy, or anorectal sources, and is not recommended for routine hematochezia management [^112wtBbE]. Contraindications include hypersensitivity to octreotide or its components, and caution is advised in patients with cardiac disease, gallstone disease, or glucose intolerance [^115aKNXM] [^111WN5bH].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines support octreotide for **variceal bleeding** and suggest its use in refractory angiodysplasia; it is not recommended for routine lower GI bleeding management [^116n5YaY] [^112wtBbE]. Expert consensus emphasizes etiologic diagnosis and targeted therapy, reserving octreotide for specific indications.

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Clinical scenario** | **Evidence supporting octreotide** | **Strength of evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Portal hypertensive bleeding (varices, PHG) | Strong evidence; first-line therapy | High |
| Angiodysplasia (refractory) | Moderate evidence; reduces transfusions | Moderate |
| Routine lower GI bleeding (diverticulosis, ischemia, malignancy, anorectal) | No evidence of benefit | Low |

---

Octreotide can help hematochezia in **portal hypertensive bleeding** and **refractory angiodysplasia**, but is not effective for common lower GI bleeding causes. Use should be **etiology-specific**, combined with endoscopic and supportive care, and guided by clinical judgment and available evidence.

### Pro / con debate: octreotide has an important role in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin? [^1167PeBM]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Whether it is the primary reason for admission or a complication of critical illness, upper gastrointestinal bleeding is commonly encountered in the intensive care unit. In this setting, in the absence of endoscopy, intensivists generally provide supportive care (transfusion of blood products) and acid suppression (such as proton pump inhibitors). More recently, octreotide (a somatostatin analogue) has been used in such patients. However, its precise role in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding is not necessarily clear and the drug is associated with significant costs. In this issue of Critical Care, two expert teams debate the merits of using octreotide in non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Initial assessment and management of patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^114VZvT6]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a substantial clinical and economic burden, with an estimated mortality rate between 3% and 15%. The initial management starts with hemodynamic assessment and resuscitation. Blood transfusions may be needed in patients with low hemoglobin levels or massive bleeding, and patients who are anticoagulated may require administration of fresh frozen plasma. Patients with significant bleeding should be started on a proton-pump inhibitor infusion, and if there is concern for variceal bleeding, an octreotide infusion. Patients with UGIB should be stratified into low-risk and high-risk categories using validated risk scores. The use of these risk scores can aid in separating low-risk patients who are suitable for outpatient management or early discharge following endoscopy from patients who are at increased risk for needing endoscopic intervention, rebleeding, and death. Upper endoscopy after adequate resuscitation is required for most patients and should be performed within 24 hours of presentation. Key to improving outcomes is appropriate initial management of patients presenting with UGIB.

### Effects of a somatostatin analogue in occult gastrointestinal bleeding: a case report [^113b7KGR]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2004). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a patient with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding and anaemia, who required repeated transfusions for about 1 year. Because of the absence of a certain diagnosis and of a surgical approach indication, we established long-acting octreotide therapy, obtaining clinical stabilisation and interruption of the transfusional need. Withdrawal of long-acting somatostatin analogue therapy was associated with renewal of bleeding that was again successfully stopped by continuous i.v. somatostatin administration followed by re-establishment of the long-acting octreotide therapy. We suggested, in absence of surgical indications and when only palliative therapies are available, a therapeutic approach with long-term SMS analogues in patients with lower digestive bleeding of a known or unknown source.

Table 2 — evidenced-based algorithm for initial management of suspected portal hypertensive bleeding specifies to ensure adequate vascular access with 2 large-bore peripheral intravenous cannulae or central venous access and provide fluid resuscitation with colloid or crystalloid, and to assess airway protection with tracheal intubation advised for active hematemesis, inability to maintain or protect airway, and to enable optimal sedation for endoscopic therapy. Vasoactive therapy includes octreotide initial intravenous bolus of 50 μg (can be repeated in first hour if ongoing bleeding) followed by continuous intravenous infusion of octreotide 50 μg/h for 2–5 d (may stop after definitive hemostasis achieved), and somatostatin analogs inhibit gastric acid secretion so co-administration of proton pump inhibitor is not required. Antibiotic prophylaxis is emphasized, with intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g/24 h (maximal duration 7 d) since prophylactic antibiotics reduce infections, rebleeding, and mortality. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy is outlined: transfuse at Hgb threshold of 7 g/dL and goal maintenance Hgb of 7–9 g/dL, with restrictive transfusion associated with favorable effect on hepatic venous pressure gradient, decreased mortality, and decreased rate for early rebleeding; avoid overuse of blood products in cirrhosis given risks including precipitation of portal venous thrombosis. Urgent endoscopic assessment for source control should follow stabilization, within 12 h of presentation, and consider erythromycin before emergency endoscopy (250 mg intravenous, 30–120 min before) to optimize visualization with QT interval check; patients with acute variceal hemorrhage should be managed within the intensive care unit or other well-monitored units given mortality risk and care complexity.

### Standard of care versus octreotide in angiodysplasia-related bleeding (the OCEAN study): a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^114ghUwu]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Gastrointestinal angiodysplasias are vascular anomalies that may result in transfusion-dependent anemia despite endoscopic therapy. An individual patient data meta-analysis of cohort studies suggests that octreotide decreases rebleeding rates, but component studies possessed a high risk of bias. We investigated the efficacy of octreotide in reducing the transfusion requirements of patients with angiodysplasia-related anemia in a clinical trial setting.

Methods

The study was designed as a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Patients with angiodysplasia bleeding were required to have had at least 4 red blood cell (RBC) units or parental iron infusions, or both, in the year preceding randomization. Patients were allocated (1:1) to 40-mg octreotide long-acting release intramuscular every 28 days or standard of care, including endoscopic therapy. The treatment duration was 1 year. The primary outcome was the mean difference in the number of transfusion units (RBC + parental iron) between the octreotide and standard of care groups. Patients who received at least 1 octreotide injection or followed standard of care for at least 1 month were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. Analyses of covariance were used to adjust for baseline transfusion requirements and incomplete follow-up.

Results

We enrolled 62 patients (mean age, 72 years; 32 men) from 17 Dutch hospitals in the octreotide (n = 31) and standard of care (n = 31) groups. Patients required a mean number of 20.3 (standard deviation, 15.6) transfusion units and 2.4 (standard deviation, 2.0) endoscopic procedures in the year before enrollment. The total number of transfusions was lower with octreotide (11.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.5–16.5) compared with standard of care (21.2; 95% CI, 15.7–26.7). Octreotide reduced the mean number of transfusion units by 10.2 (95% CI, 2.4–18.1; P = 0.012). Octreotide reduced the annual volume of endoscopic procedures by 0.9 (95% CI, 0.3–1.5).

Conclusions

Octreotide effectively reduces transfusion requirements and the need for endoscopic therapy in patients with angiodysplasia-related anemia.

Palliative and end of life care

Focus on remote monitoring of patient-reported outcome measures.
Provide treatment to optimise symptoms and quality of life.
Consider referral to palliative care when there is ≥ 70% risk of death within 1 year.
Prioritise minimising pain and avoiding opioid-induced constipation.
For diarrhoea/bloating consider an empirical trial of rifaximin for 1 week/a bile acid sequestrant for 10 days/PERT for 10 days.
Consider early adjunctive iron support including parenteral iron in patients with bleeding.
For malignant bowel obstruction consider corticosteroids and octreotide. Only insert a nasogastric tube if the patient wants to try this and other measures to relieve obstructive symptoms have failed.
Palliative venting gastrostomy can relieve symptoms and improve quality of life in the absence of extensive peritoneal or gastric serosal disease.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of suspected small-bowel bleeding [^1129GHZk]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Medium credibility.

Specific therapy for small-bowel bleeding sources is etiology based: Lesions within reach of a standard endoscope can be treated with electrocautery, argon plasma coagulation, injection therapy, mechanical hemostasis (eg, hemoclips or bands), or a combination of these techniques; more distal vascular lesions such as angiectasias may be approached via push enteroscopy or device-assisted enteroscopy (DAE), and treatment decreases blood loss and the need for blood transfusions. Masses or tumors likely require surgical intervention, and management of massive bleeding should be coordinated with surgery and interventional radiology; after appropriate endoscopic and imaging studies, clinically stable patients with iron deficiency may be managed with iron therapy alone and followed clinically, although iron supplementation or blood transfusions may be required in some patients with comorbidities or those not ideal for repeat endoscopy. Hormonal therapy for angiectasias largely has been abandoned because of lack of efficacy in randomized controlled trials, whereas octreotide and low-dose thalidomide have shown some benefit in eliminating the need for blood transfusions and iron supplementation in chronic blood loss from angiectasias and can be considered when endoscopic therapy is not possible or bleeding continues after endoscopic therapy.

### Octreotide for acute variceal bleeding [^113EjU33]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the use o f octreotide for acute variceal bleeding.

Data Sources

Articles were obtained through computerized searches involving MEDLINE (from 1997 to October 2000). Additionally, several textbooks containing information on the diagnosis and management of acute variceal bleeding were reviewed. The bibliographies of retrieved publications and textbooks were reviewed for additional references.

Study Selection

All randomized studies and pharmacoeconomic evaluations that used octreotide therapy for acute variceal bleeding were considered. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses involving other therapies for treating variceal bleeding were also reviewed for possible inclusion.

Data Extraction

The primary outcomes extracted from the literature were persistent or recurrent bleeding, need for endoscopic intervention or balloon tamponade, and mortality.

Data Synthesis

Although both endoscopic therapies and medications are used to control bleeding and rebleeding episodes, the endoscopic approach has the additional goal of obliterating the varix. Since rebleeding episodes are common as long as the varix is present, endoscopic and medication therapies cannot be considered interchangeable based on bleeding control alone. However, octreotide by continuous intravenous infusion has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements as both an initial intervention (until definitive sclerotherapy can be performed) or as adjunctive therapy to endoscopic measures. Octreotide can be started quickly, has a relatively rapid onset of action, and does not require someone with endoscopy training to initiate. Additionally, octreotide is relatively free of significant adverse effects.

Conclusions

While additional investigations are needed, particularly in the area of pharmacoeconomics, there is substantial evidence that octreotide is an efficacious therapy with relatively few adverse effects when used in the management of acute variceal bleeding.

### Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding: diagnostic and therapeutic approach [^114zpNQ6]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) is defined as an intermittent or continuous loss of blood in which the source has not been identified after upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. It constitutes a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the general internist and the gastroenterologist. This article provides an overview of the etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic modalities of OGIB including push enteroscopy, double balloon enteroscopy, wireless capsule endoscopy, enteroclysis, angiography, bleeding scanning with labeled red blood cells, and surgery with intraoperative enteroscopy. Therapeutic modalities including iron replacement, combined hormones, octreotide acetate, therapeutic endoscopy, and surgery are also discussed. In addition, a rational approach to patients with OGIB according to the clinical presentation is presented herein.

### Long-term efficacy of octreotide in the prevention of recurrent bleeding from gastrointestinal angiodysplasia [^116bDin5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Preliminary studies suggested that octreotide may be therapeutic in bleeding angiodysplasia. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of long-term octreotide therapy in the prevention of rebleeding from gastrointestinal angiodysplasia.

Methods

A cohort of 32 patients diagnosed with bleeding from angiodysplasia was treated with octreotide 50 mu 12 h subcutaneously for a 1–2 yr period. This cohort was compared with an external control group (38 patients who had received placebo [1 tablet/day] in a concurrent randomized clinical trial for the same period.

Results

Two patients of the octreotide group were lost to follow-up. Treatment failure occurred in seven of 30 (23%) patients in the octreotide group and in 17 of 35 (48%) in the placebo group (three dropouts before first visit) (P = 0.043). The actuarial probability of remaining free of rebleeding at 1 and 2 yr of follow-up was 77% and 68%, respectively, for the octreotide group and 55% and 36%, respectively, for the placebo group (log rank P = 0.030). Multivariate proportional hazards-regression analysis showed that octreotide therapy and previous bleeding episodes were positive and negative predictors of efficacy, respectively. No significant differences between the groups were observed according to number of bleeding episodes (0.4 ± 0.7 vs 0.9 ± 1.5, P = 0.070) and transfusion requirements (1.1 ± 2.6 vs 0.7 ± 1.5 units); however, iron requirements were lower in the octreotide than in the placebo group (22 ± 62 vs 166 ± 267 units; P < 0.001). Likewise, major adverse events (1 vs 1) and mortality (0 vs 1) were similar between groups.

Conclusions

This study suggests that octreotide treatment may be beneficial in preventing rebleeding from gastrointestinal angiodysplasia.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^116yizK2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Small bowel bleeding — supportive care and antithrombotic management emphasize that supportive care with iron given orally or intravenously is a mainstay of treatment for mild small intestinal bleeding, and in more severe bleeding transfusion of packed red blood cells (RBCs) is an essential element of treatment; although anticoagulation has been associated with an increased risk of recurrent bleeding, there is no prospective data showing that withdrawal of anticoagulation therapy is beneficial; in a 2009 analysis, risk factors for recurrent bleeding after double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) included small bowel vascular disorders and comorbid conditions, but not the usage of anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapy, and a 2010 follow-up showed predictors included transfusional requirements and number and type of vascular lesions, but not anticoagulant usage; there is no data that cessation of antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk for recurrent bleeding; overall, specific medical treatment is poorly developed, hormonal therapy has not been shown to be helpful, and thalidomide and octreotide have been shown to have some benefit.

Gastrointestinal bleeding can result in significant morbidity. Scintigraphy plays an important role in detecting, localizing, and grading the bleed. Effective scintigraphic evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding can be complicated by its intermittent nature and the patient's hemodynamic instability. Dynamic evaluation, delayed imaging, and an understanding of the labeling process are necessary tools to help improve detection rate and localization.

Somatostatin analogs

Increasingly, studies have shown that octreotide is an effective option for the management of bleeding from angiodysplasia and should be strongly considered in those with recurrent bleeding despite endoscopic intervention. Octreotide is a somatostatin analog whose reported mechanism of action includes decreasing splanchnic blood flow, inhibiting angiogenesis, improving platelet aggregation and increasing vascular resistance.

A review by Jackson and Gerson found that somatostatin analogs were effective in reducing recurrent bleeding episodes and transfusion requirements with a pooled OR of 14.5 (95%CI 5.9–36). A 2010 meta-analysis of studies reporting the use of somatostatin analogs in the treatment of angiodysplasia determined a clinical response of 76%, with a weighted mean difference in transfusion requirements before and after treatment of −2.2 (95%CI −3.9 to −0.5). Another study followed patients with recurrent GI bleeding secondary to angiodysplasia after at least 6 months of treatment with a somatostatin analog. Following treatment, the rate of bleeding episodes was reduced from 73% to 20%, the number of transfusions needed dropped from a median of 10 to 2, and the mean hemoglobin increased from a median of 7 to 10 g/dL. Similarly, a prospective study evaluated the efficacy of 1-year octreotide treatment in patients with chronic bleeding secondary to angiodysplasia. Complete response without the need for transfusion or iron supplementation was achieved in 69% of patients, a partial response in 8% of patients and no response in 23% of patients.

A 2017 study evaluated the use of combination endoscopic therapy and the somatostatin analog lanreotide compared to endoscopic therapy alone in patients with refractory iron deficiency anemia secondary to small-bowel angioectasia. Combination therapy led to statistically significant reduction in transfusion requirements and bleeding episodes with an increase in hemoglobin compared with the other group.

One case series reported 3 patients with CKD and recurrent bleeding secondary to diffuse GI angiodysplasia that responded to 6 months of octreotide therapy. However, no formal studies have examined the efficacy of octreotide in treating angiodysplasia in patients with comorbid CKD.

### Long-acting octreotide is effective in controlling rebleeding angiodysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract [^115ZyxsR]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Management of bleeding angiodysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract is often a major clinical problem. Lesions are frequently multiple, not detectable or missed during conventional endoscopy and patients are sometimes at high risk for complications because of advanced age and serious concomitant disorders.

Aims

To determine the efficacy of a new formulation of somatostatin analogue (octreotide long-acting) in management of recurrent bleeding angiodysplasia in patients resistant to endoscopic treatment and not suitable for surgery.

Patients and Methods

Three patients with recurrent bleeding angiodysplasia of gastrointestinal tract were treated with long-acting octreotide administered intramuscularly 20 mg monthly to each individual. The number of admissions for acute bleeding, hospital stay and number of blood units transfused before and after treatment (followup: 15–17 months) were regularly monitored.

Results

In each patient, a relevant decrease in number of hospital admissions, duration of hospital stay, number of administered blood units was seen and mean haemoglobin values significantly increased in all of them after introducing long-acting octreotide therapy.

Conclusions

This is the first report on use of long-acting octreotide in bleeding angiodysplasia of gastrointestinal tract. Data suggest that long-acting octreotide is a safe drug and is successful in controlling recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to angiodysplasia in elderly patients not eligible for surgical or endoscopic therapy.

Among the current hospitalization, routine medical treatment according to the 2015 ACG clinical guideline, was performed in all patients. The patients with present bleeding, were treated with hemostatic drug (octreotide, Novartis Pharma AG, Switzerland), intravenous iron, transfusion of packed RBCs and so on. For those with yellow feces or negative results of fecal occult blood, intravenous iron and RBC transfusion were given according to the clinical needs. Patients were discharged when they met the following criteria: (1) with yellow feces or negative results of fecal occult blood; (2) HB levels were stable and > 70 g/L; (3) without anemia related severe symptoms. The post-endoscopic adverse events were recorded in detail. The lengths of stay (LOSs) were recorded and compared between groups.

All patients were followed up by outpatient or telephone interview at least once every 2 months after discharge, and the ranges of follow-up were at least 12 months. Blood routine and stool routine were reviewed to assess the patient's condition. Iron was given orally for the patients with anemia after discharge. The patients were instructed to proactively seek medical attention when they suffered bleeding occurrence. Re-admissions were recommended when patients met one of the following conditions: (1) hematochezia without spontaneous remission; (2) melena for ≥ 3 days, with positive result of fecal occult blood, and without spontaneous remission; (3) a decrease in the HB level by > 20 g/L from baseline; (4) the HB level < 70 g/L; (5) with anemia-associated severe symptoms. Within 12 months after discharge, the frequency of bleeding occurrence, the volume of RBC transfusion, and the times of hospitalization were evaluated. Subsequently, the rates of re-bleeding, re-admission and RBC transfusion after discharge were evaluated and compared between groups. In addition, the rates of hospitalization and RBC transfusion after discharge were compared to those before admission in different groups.

Palliative and end of life care

Clinical practice guidance

Focus on remote monitoring of patient-reported outcome measures.
Provide treatment to optimise symptoms and quality of life.
Consider referral to palliative care when there is ≥ 70% risk of death within 1 year.
Prioritise minimising pain and avoiding opioid-induced constipation.
For diarrhoea/bloating consider an empirical trial of rifaximin for 1 week/a bile acid sequestrant for 10 day/PERT for 10 days.
Consider early adjunctive iron support including parenteral iron in patients with bleeding.
For malignant bowel obstruction consider corticosteroids and octreotide. Only insert a nasogastric tube if the patient wants to try this and other measures to relieve obstructive symptoms have failed.
Palliative venting gastrostomy can relieve symptoms and improve quality of life in the absence of extensive peritoneal or gastric serosal disease.

It can be difficult to determine when someone is in their last year of life and when to adopt a more pragmatic approach to their care, managing symptoms and using interventions which focus only on improving quality of life. However, within this uncertainty, sensible guidance around common problems and symptoms, and links to helpful resources, are useful. An early referral to palliative care services for additional support to maintain quality of life and advocate further interventions is beneficial. Acute admission to hospital should be considered as a trigger for referral. An important aim of palliative care should be to avoid unnecessary attendance at hospital as it is commonly reported that patients in the last phase of their life have poor experiences in hospital and frequently have no clear benefits from their attendance.

Macmillan Cancer Support have multiple resources for education of patients and carers, including ideas for managing symptoms as well as general management strategies.

Bowel obstruction

Decision-making for partial or complete bowel obstruction is complex so specialist advice is required. There is a potential useful role for venting gastrostomy and parenteral nutrition. If the patient has good performance status and parenteral nutrition is a possibility, the advice of a gastroenterologist-led nutrition team should be sought at the earliest opportunity. The role of colonic stenting is controversial. The majority will not be suitable for surgery. However, if the patient is not actively dying, it should be considered if the patient has good functional status (ASA grade < 3) and for whom the reversal of enteral failure might make therapeutic options available.

works by replacing the function of factor VIII, rather than replacing the missing clotting factor VIII directly. It can be used to either prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in people with hemophilia A. This treatment product can be given by injection under the skin. Patients who use Hemlibra ® for prophylaxis and use clotting factor concentrates to treat breakthrough bleeds can still develop an inhibitor. Traditional laboratory inhibitor testing methods do not work when testing for inhibitors in patients on Hemlibra ®; as such, a specialized testing method called the chromogenic Bethesda assay is needed. ®. DDAVP® or Stimate® DDAVP ® and Stimate ® are medications that are similar to a hormone that occurs naturally in the body. The medications release factor VIII from where it is stored in the body tissues.

For people with mild, as well as some cases of moderate, hemophilia, this can work to increase the person's own factor VIII levels so that they do not have to use clotting factors to stop bleeding episodes. DDAVP ® can be given through a vein and Stimate ® via a nasal spray. Roctavian® Roctavian ® is a gene therapy that was approved by the FDA on June 29, 2023, for the treatment of severe hemophilia A in adults. Roctavian ® is made of a virus modified to carry a gene for clotting factor VIII. It is given once as an injection into a vein. The virus carries the gene to cells in the body. Liver cells that get the gene make more factor VIII to increase the levels of factor VIII in the blood. This helps prevent bleeding.

Follow-up results

Each enrolled patient received a follow-up more than 12 months after discharge. None of the enrolled patients died within 12 months after discharge. All the patients who suffered re-bleeding were treated properly. In the control group, an 85-year-old male patient died 13 months after the discharge due to advanced age and anemia related cardiovascular accident and a 74-year-old female patient with liver cirrhosis died 48 months after the discharge due to advanced age and hepatic failure. In the EIS group, a 70-year-old male patient with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma died of hepatic failure 15 months after the discharge. However, there was no bleeding occurrence in this patient during the follow-up time.

Treatments of re-bleeding after discharge

Octreotide or thalidomide was recommended for all patients with recurrent bleeding after discharge, because they refused repeated endoscopic examinations of small bowel. Considering the high cost, these patients had very low acceptance of long-term octreotide use; and they were more inclined to the temporary use of octreotide after bleeding occurrence. Among these patients, a 67-year-old female in the control group received long-acting octreotide therapy after her discharge for frequent melena. In China, the use of thalidomide in the treatment of SBAs is off-label; and it also has a lot of side effects; thus, the patient's acceptance of long-term thalidomide use is very low. Even so, all the patients who suffered re-bleeding were treated properly in the follow-up.

In the control group, 60% of patients (21/35) experienced 1–4 times of re-bleeding and most patients required treatment of octreotide and RBC transfusion. Among the re-bleeding patients of EIS group, while 3 patients suffered 1 time of melena with spontaneous remission, the other 4 patients experienced melena or hematochezia resolved by treatment of octreotide. No new causes of bleeding were identified by examinations in these 7 patients. Most re-bleeding patients presented with chronic or intermittent bleeding and none of them experienced active massive uncontrollable hemorrhage after discharge.

### Octreotide for acute esophageal variceal bleeding: a meta-analysis [^115gkiZN]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Studies of octreotide have not demonstrated a consistent benefit in efficacy or safety compared with conventional therapies. This study statistically pooled existing trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of octreotide for esophageal variceal hemorrhage.

Methods

We identified randomized trials of octreotide for variceal hemorrhage from computerized databases, scientific meeting abstracts, and the manufacturer of octreotide. Blinded reviewers abstracted the data, and a meta-analysis was performed.

Results

Octreotide improved control of esophageal variceal hemorrhage compared with all alternative therapies combined (relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51–0.77); vasopressin/terlipressin (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42–0.81); or no additional intervention/placebo (among patients that received initial sclerotherapy/banding before randomization) (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.32–0.67). Octreotide had comparable efficacy to immediate sclerotherapy for control of bleeding (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.55–1.62), fewer major complications than vasopressin/terlipessin (RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11–0.87), and a complication profile comparable to no intervention/placebo (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.72–1.55). No specific alternative therapy demonstrated a mortality benefit.

Conclusions

These results favor octreotide over vasopressin/terlipressin in the control of esophageal variceal bleeding and suggest it is a safe and effective adjunctive therapy after variceal obliteration techniques. Trials are needed to determine the optimal dose, route, and duration of octreotide treatment.

### Chronic intermittent rectal… [^111o6CKK]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding can present in several forms, depending on the rate of blood loss: microscopic blood loss presents as iron-deficiency anemia or hemoccult-positive stools; hematemesis is vomiting of fresh blood; "coffee-ground" emesis is vomiting of altered black blood; melena is black tarry stools; hemochezia is the passing of red blood via the rectum. If bleeding stops or hemodynamic stability is achieved, colonic preparation may precede colonoscopy to increase visibility and diagnostic yield. A technetium-99m–tagged red blood cell scan is a nuclear study best suited for identifying slow-bleeding sources with rates of 0. 1 to
0. 4 mL per minute. 6, 11, 12, 16, 22 However, this test is not as accurate as arteriography in identifying the exact location of a bleeding site.

When arteriography is used in association with a technetium-99m–tagged red blood cell blush, the sensitivity of the arteriogram is increased to 61 to 72 percent. 22 One five-year, retrospective study 33 of technetium-99m–tagged red blood cell scans showed that an "immediate blush" had a 60 percent positive predictive value for an associated positive angiogram. A "delayed blush" correlated with a predictive value of 93 percent for a negative angiogram. This finding suggests that a positive "immediate blush" is a good indication for urgent angiography or surgery, while a delayed blush or negative technetium-99m–tagged red blood cell scan is an indication for observation and elective colonoscopy 33, 34. When the source of bleeding cannot be identified by endoscopic, radiographic, or nuclear intervention, the patient may need exploratory laparotomy.

45 comparing capsule endoscopy with barium-contrast upper gastrointestinal series with SBFT found capsule endoscopy to have a superior diagnostic yield in identifying obscure bleeding sites. Capsule endoscopy is painless and well tolerated, and requires no sedation. 34, 43 Although capsule endoscopy is helpful in identifying pathologic lesions, it must be followed by endoscopy or surgery for tissue diagnosis and treatment of significant sources of bleeding. 42 Capsule endoscopy is contraindicated in patients when bowel stricture is suspected. 34, 42, 46.

### Treatment of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia and unmet needs [^116xFr32]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal angiodysplasia (GIAD) may either be asymptomatic or induce overt or obscure bleeding with a high risk of recurrence. Numerous therapeutic options are available but evidence bases are lacking.

Aim

We conducted a comprehensive review of pharmacological and endoscopic treatments for previous or active bleeding GIAD and established the unmet needs of the clinicians.

Methods

Clinical trials, series, and reports, having been selected through PubMed inquiry, manual searching, and reference list reviewing, were classified by levels of evidence.

Results

Controlled studies focusing on GIAD treatment, excluding other GI vascular malformations, are rare. Endoscopic destruction, preferably using non-contact endoscopic techniques, is most often proposed as a first-line treatment for GIAD (expert level). In addition, APC is preferred over Nd:Yag laser due to the lower risk of perforation (expert level). Pharmacological treatments for GIAD are considered either when endoscopy fails to access the AD or in order to prevent rebleeding for "chronic bleeding patients". Octreotide and oestroprogestative treatments are the best evaluated drugs; however, no appropriate comparison on cost-effectiveness and tolerance has been performed.

Conclusions

The most effective therapeutic strategy for bleeding GIAD is currently inconclusive, and new trials should be performed to address unmet needs.

Drug treatment pre-endoscopy in suspected variceal bleeding

Antibiotic prophylaxis

Bacterial infections are identified in 35–66% of patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleedingand patients with cirrhosis and UGIB are at increased risk of rebleeding and mortality. Empirical antibiotic treatment reduces this risk, with a meta-analysis of 12 trials and 1241 patients reporting reduced mortality (risk ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.98), rebleeding (0.53, 0.38 to 0.74), and length of hospital stay. The choice of antibiotic should be determined by local resistance patterns and continued for up to seven days.

Vasoactive drugs

Vasopressors, including somatostatin, its analogue octreotide, and terlipressin, reduce portal pressures via splanchnic vasoconstriction. Two randomised controlled trials of 205 and 76 patients, have shown that these drugs improve bleeding control at the time of endoscopy (P = 0.012 and P = 0.034, respectively), reduce mortality and the need for rescue treatment in the first randomised controlled trial (P = 0.05), and reduce mortality at 15 days in the second randomised controlled trial (P = 0.035). No difference in control of bleeding has been identified between the different drugs. Current guidelines recommend commencing a vasoactive drug at presentation in suspected variceal bleeding with a suggested course of two to five days. Contraindications include cardiac or severe vascular disease.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^114evqZF]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Initial management — pre-endoscopic pharmacologic adjuncts and nasogastric tube use for suspected NVUGIB emphasize that erythromycin or metoclopramide may be given intravenously before endoscopy to improve visualization, with data favoring erythromycin, but both should be used cautiously in patients with prolonged QT intervals. Use of octreotide is not recommended in NVUGIB, and prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated. The use of nasogastric tubes is controversial because use does not impact clinical outcomes; lavage can assist blood removal and suggests emergent endoscopy if continuous and copious bright red blood returns, but a negative lavage should not delay endoscopy, particularly if other parameters suggest active NVUGIB.

### Two for the price of one: a dual treatment benefit of long-acting octreotide in occult bleeding and diuretic intractable ascites [^114n5Bw5]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Transfusion-dependent anaemia and portal hypertension are recognised complications of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The anaemia is a result of chronic bleeding from gastrointestinal telangiectasias, which are usually multiple and located throughout the gastrointestinal tract. As a result, treatment with argon plasma coagulation via gastroscopy and or colonoscopy is often insufficient to prevent ongoing blood loss. Portal hypertension in HHT occurs as a result of blood shunting between the hepatic artery and the portal vein within the liver. The somatostatin analogue octreotide has been used as a treatment for bleeding angiodysplasia; however, its possible role as a treatment for diuretic intractable ascites secondary to portal hypertension has not been previously established. The authors report a case that apparently illustrates a dual benefit of long-acting octreotide in the management of both occult bleeding and refractory ascites in a patient with HHT.

### MASCC multidisciplinary evidence-based recommendations for the management of malignant bowel obstruction in advanced cancer [^113i227A]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in malignant bowel obstruction — MASCC suggestion, dosing, and outcomes: Suggestion: The use of steroids may be helpful in MBO (level of evidence: III; grade: B). Corticosteroids likely have anti-inflammatory and anti-secretory effects that may decrease intestinal wall edema, promote salt and water absorption, and help with acute management of pain, nausea, and vomiting. For dosing, a dose between 4 and 16 mg of dexamethasone daily may be considered, and in cases of no symptomatic improvement in 3 to 5 days, discontinuation should be considered. Observational data from a Japanese claims cohort of 3,090 adults with MBO treated with octreotide reported that among the 1595 with nasogastric tubes, adding corticosteroids was associated with higher odds of tube removal within four days (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.08–1.23). A Cochrane meta-analysis of three double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving 89 patients found a trend favoring corticosteroids for resolution of BO within 10 days (relative risk of 0.51 (95% CI 0.19–1.43)), with the number needed to treat six, no effect on mortality at one month, and a very low incidence of adverse events, while the use of the lowest effective dose for the shortest period should be considered. In a multi-center randomized trial of octreotide for vomiting in MBO, dexamethasone (8 mg daily, intravenously) with ranitidine and hydration was the standardized supportive therapy.

### Opportunities to improve symptom control with somatostatin congeners in GEP-NETs: a review of key issues [^113NtbCi]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Use as a Supplement to Receptor Radionuclide Therapy

Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with 177 Lu‐dotatate is often considered to improve symptom control in patients with progressive disease and well‐differentiated NETs who have detectable SSR expression and adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function. PRRT efficacy may not be durable, however, and it is often followed by additional SSA therapy, as full resolution of CS‐related symptoms is rarely achieved.

There are theoretical concerns regarding competition between SSAs and PRRT treatment for SSR binding. Therefore, guidelines suggest that long‐acting SSAs be interrupted at least 4 weeks before PRRT. Short‐acting octreotide can be administered as needed for symptom control up to 24 hours before PRRT administrations. Additionally, when octreotide is used around a cycle of PRRT, it should be given immediately after completion of the cycle to avoid binding competition.

Obstruction

Small‐bowel obstruction interferes with food intake and can cause nausea and diarrhea in patients with nonoperable terminal cancer. Palliative care is often paramount to these patients, but antiemetics, steroids, and anticholinergics are often insufficient to control symptoms. Octreotide IR has been shown to help control vomiting, one of the most distressing symptoms experienced by some terminal patients.

Clinical trial results for the use of octreotide IR in patients with small‐bowel obstruction have been mixed. Early data and open‐label, single‐arm studies show overwhelming evidence for the benefits of octreotide, especially in patients with gynecologic and urologic cancers. In initial small‐scale studies using a continuous infusion of 300 μg/day, vomiting was generally controlled rapidly, with 92.8% patients achieving at least a partial response and 71.4% able to resume oral food intake. However, placebo‐controlled studies often find similar improvements in both frequency of symptoms and QoL outcomes between octreotide and placebo‐controlled groups. Despite these mixed results, some societal guidelines, like ESMO, recommend administering octreotide IR, either subcutaneously or via continuous infusion, to treat refractory symptoms.

### Octreotide for severe acute bleeding from portal hypertensive colopathy: a case report [^117R2qGv]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old man developed severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding. He was classified as Child-Pugh grade C. Colonoscopy revealed multiple angiodysplasia-like lesions and mucosal friability throughout the entire colon (portal hypertensive colopathy, PHC). Haemostasis was immediately achieved with octreotide treatment, although melaena recurred after discontinuation of the infusion. Propranolol treatment before discontinuation of octreotide infusin prevented the recurrence of bleeding from PHC. Octreotide is a safe and effective treatment for severe acute bleeding from PHC, especially if the patient is not a candidate for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or treatment with a beta-blocker due to the severity of liver disease or haemodynamic instability. However, a sufficient reduction of portal pressure by propranolol or other medical treatment may be needed in order to discontinue octreotide infusion without the recurrence of bleeding.

### Long acting release-octreotide as "rescue" therapy to control angiodysplasia bleeding: a retrospective study of 98 cases [^115qbZsz]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal angiodysplasias are an important cause of difficult to manage bleeding, especially in older patients.

Aim

To retrospectively evaluate the long-term efficacy of long acting release-octreotide in controlling angiodysplasia bleeding.

Methods

98 patients with a history of bleeding due to gastrointestinal angiodysplasias lasting over 2 years were retrospectively selected among those treated from January 2000 to December 2008. All patients had received octreotide 0.1mg tid for 28 days and, then from day 14, long acting release-octreotide 20mg monthly, for 6 months.

Results

The mean follow-up was 78 months. In all patients mean haemoglobin levels significantly increased and the number of bleeding episodes, hospitalizations, patients requiring blood transfusions and units of transfused red cells significantly decreased, compared to the two-year observation period before starting therapy. According to outcome patients were classified as: 40 full responders (40.8%), 32 relapsers (32.6%) and 26 poor responders (26.5%). At multivariate analysis age > 65 years, male sex, chronic antiplatelet therapy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic renal failure were the only covariates independently associated with poor response to therapy.

Conclusion

Our study suggests that long acting release-octreotide could be used as rescue therapy to control bleeding due to gastrointestinal angiodysplasias in patients not suitable for endoscopic or surgical treatments.

### Somatostatin and its analogues in peptic ulcer bleeding: facts and pathophysiological aspects [^11722TwR]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Peptic ulcer bleeding remains a common medical emergency and despite recent advances in management is still associated with high mortality. Endoscopic treatment remains the cornerstone for the effective management of high-risk patients. Recent evidence suggests that potent antisecretory drugs that inhibit gastric acid secretion, such as proton pump inhibitors, may be of help alone or in combination with endotherapy in the management of peptic ulcer bleeding. Somatostatin appears to offer a distinct advantage over antisecretory drugs, as it inhibits both acid and pepsin secretion and combines these effects with a reduction in gastroduodenal mucosal blood flow which seems to be important in the pathophysiology of peptic ulcer bleeding. Additionally, the inhibition of pepsin secretion might induce a decreased proteolytic activity preventing the dissolution of freshly formed clots at the site of bleeding. Despite its theoretical advantages, there has been very little evidence in the recent past in setting of randomised, controlled, clinical trials. In reviewing the available data, we found that the efficacy of somatostatin and its analogue octreotide are different in the control of peptic ulcer bleeding and this might be due to the different distribution of its receptors through the GI tract. Further studies are needed to define the exact role, if any, of somatostatin and its analogues, in high-risk patients with peptic ulcer bleeding and this might be a rather interesting area for future research.

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^114FARRG]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Somatostatin and octreotide

Somatostatin causes selective splanchnic vasoconstriction and reduces portal pressure and portal blood flow. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue. The mechanism of action of these two agents is not clear. Inhibition of glucagon increases vasodilatation rather than a direct vasoconstrictive effect and post-prandial gut hyperaemia is also reduced. The actions of octreotide on hepatic and systemic hemodynamics are transient, making continuous infusion necessary. Octreotide is given as a 50 μg bolus followed by an infusion of 25–50 μg/h. Somatostatin is given as a 250 mg intravenous bolus followed by an infusion of 250 mg/h. Somatostatin and octreotide have been shown to be as effective as terlipressin in acute variceal bleeding in a meta-analysis. Seo et al in a large RCT of 780 patients comparing these three agents failed to show a difference in treatment success (range 83.8–86.2%), rebleeding (range 3.4–4.4%) and mortality (range 8–8.8%). A low systolic blood pressure at presentation, high serum creatinine level, active bleeding in the emergency endoscopy, gastric variceal bleeding and Child–Pugh grade C were independent factors predicting 5-day treatment failure.

Antibiotics

Antibiotics that provide Gram-negative cover are one of the interventions which positively influence survival in variceal haemorrhage as shown in a Cochrane meta-analysis of 12 placebo-controlled trials (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98). Antibiotics were also shown to reduce bacterial infections (RR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.97) and early rebleeding (RR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74). Therefore, short-term antibiotics should be considered standard practice in all cirrhotic patients who have a variceal bleed, irrespective of the presence of confirmed infection. Third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone (1 g IV, daily), have been shown to be more effective at reducing Gram-negative sepsis than oral norfloxacin, but choice of antibiotics must be dictated by local resistance patterns and availability.

### Gastric angiodysplasia in a child with bernard-soulier syndrome: efficacy of octreotide in long-term management [^1167mHEe]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal angiodysplasia in association with Bernard-Soulier syndrome has been previously described in adults. The authors report on a 14year-old boy presenting with massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to a large gastric angiodysplasia, in whom medical history and laboratory investigations were consistent with Bernard-Soulier syndrome. The vascular lesion was so widespread that surgical or endoscopic therapy was not considered. Therefore, treatment with octreotide, a somatostatin analog, was commenced, following a short course of tranexamic acid and proton pump inhibitor. During the 16-month follow-up with octreotide therapy, no occult or gross bleeding occurred. This case illustrates the utility of using octreotide for the long-term treatment of children with bleeding disorders and angiodysplasia.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^117PgDiW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Small-bowel angioectasias and iron-deficiency anemia — In patients undergoing small-bowel evaluation for IDA, angioectasias have a diagnostic yield of 20% to 40%, and a meta-analysis of 14 studies and 623 patients found an overall rebleeding rate of 34% and 45% for small-bowel angioectasias. Radiofrequency ablation is considered experimental and, in a case series, a 20% rebleeding rate over a 6-month period was observed; adjunct medical therapy with somatostatin analogues may reduce transfusion requirements and rebleeding although the evidence is not robust, with octreotide noted to be more effective than lanreotide. There have been 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antiangiogenic therapy with thalidomide showing reductions in transfusions and rehospitalizations secondary to bleeding and a dose-dependent reduction in rebleeding measured 1 year after treatment, but with significant adverse reactions; therefore, use of antiangiogenic therapy should be reserved for those who have failed all other forms of therapy and should be given by providers with experience with thalidomide.

### Drugs in focus: octreotide use in children with gastrointestinal disorders [^113oT8Ww]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, has been used for more than 20years in children with gastrointestinal bleeding, chylothorax or chylous ascites, intestinal lymphangiectasia, pancreatitis, intestinal dysmotility, and severe diarrhoea; however, until now, there is a lack of randomised clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of this compound in childhood. Hence, we aimed to review the literature in order to determine the evidence of its use and safety in children, using PubMed from 2000 to 2021 with the search terms "octreotide" and "children" and "bleeding or chylous ascites or chylothorax or acute pancreatitis or lymphangiectasia or diarrhoea or intestinal dysmotility".

Corticosteroids

Suggestion: The use of steroids may help with the acute symptoms of MBO and can be used for short-term benefit (level of evidence: III; grade: B).

The role of corticosteroids in MBO is complex, and the mechanism of action is not completely understood. Corticosteroids likely have an anti-inflammatory and anti-secretory effect, which may help decrease intestinal wall edema, promote salt and water absorption in MBO and, therefore, help with acute management of pain, nausea, and vomiting. Dexamethasone is generally the preferred corticosteroid given its potent anti-inflammatory effect and lack of sodium-retaining properties. The optimal dose of corticosteroids for MBO management is not well established. A dose between 4 and 16 mg of dexamethasone daily may be considered. In cases of no symptomatic improvement in 3 to 5 days, discontinuation should be considered.

Unselected and uncontrolled case series have reported a benefit of corticosteroids for the management of BO, yet it is challenging to attribute whether the resolution of MBO related symptoms is due to the medication or potential spontaneous resolution. Moreover, some of these reports look at combination strategies of corticosteroids with other therapies, which makes it challenging to attribute the resolution of MBO to the corticosteroid therapy per se. A retrospective cohort study retrieved information from a Japanese national medical claims database that included 3,090 adult patients with MBO treated with octreotide. Octreotide alone, in combination with H 2 antagonists, proton pump inhibitor, or corticosteroids, was administered in 53%, 14%, 11%, and 12% of patients, respectively. A secondary endpoint of the study was the assessment of nasogastric tube removal at 4 days. Of the 1595 patients who underwent a nasogastric tube insertion, those receiving corticosteroids with octreotide had a higher odds ratio (OR) of nasogastric tube removal within four days of insertion compared to those who did not receive corticosteroids (OR 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–1.23).

### Long-time octreotide in an adolescent with severe haemorrhagic gastrointestinal vascular malformation [^113twQuk]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal vascular malformations are a rare cause of acute or chronic blood loss. Usually they are treated by endoscopic obliteration or surgical resection. When such a therapy is inapplicable, pharmacotherapy may be required. At the age of 15 years, our female patient suffered from transfusion dependent recurrent gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to multiple gastrointestinal vascular malformations. Gastroscopy, coloscopy and capsule endoscopy revealed numerous foci making both endoscopic obliteration and complete surgical resection impossible. Neither regular transfusions nor substitution with coagulation factors were helpful. However, subcutaneous octreotide resulted in immediate stop of bleeding. Initial treatment by daily subcutaneous injections was followed by monthly depot application. Over 3 years only 2 transfusions had to be given. The patient required thyroxin substitution, otherwise, no side effects occurred and the girl had a good quality of life. The authors conclude that octreotide is safe and effective in gastrointestinal angiodysplasias inaccessible to endoscopy or surgery.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and efficacy of octreotide injection in the pediatric population have not been demonstrated.

No formal controlled clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of octreotide injection in pediatric patients under age 6 years. In post-marketing reports, serious adverse events, including hypoxia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death, have been reported with octreotide injection use in children, most notably in children under 2 years of age. The relationship of these events to octreotide has not been established as the majority of these pediatric patients had serious underlying co-morbid conditions.

The efficacy and safety of octreotide injection using the octreotide acetate for injectable suspension formulation was examined in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6 month pharmacokinetics study in 60 pediatric patients age 6 to 17 years with hypothalamic obesity resulting from cranial insult. The mean octreotide concentration after 6 doses of 40 mg octreotide acetate for injectable suspension administered by intramuscular (IM) injection every 4 weeks was approximately 3 ng/mL. Steady-state concentrations was achieved after 3 injections of a 40 mg dose. Mean body mass index (BMI) increased 0.1 kg/m2in octreotide acetate for injectable suspension-treated subjects compared to 0.0 kg/m2in saline control-treated subjects. Efficacy was not demonstrated. Diarrhea occurred in 11 of 30 (37%) patients treated with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension. No unexpected adverse events were observed. However, with octreotide acetate for injectable suspension at 40 mg once a month, the incidence of new cholelithiasis in this pediatric population (33%) was higher than that seen in other adult indications such as acromegaly (22%) or malignant carcinoid syndrome (24%), where octreotide acetate for injectable suspension was 10 mg to 30 mg once a month.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of octreotide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6 Renal Impairment

In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, the half-life of octreotide may be increased, necessitating adjustment of the maintenance dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Tranexamic acid in treatment-resistant chronic transfusion-dependent gastrointestinal angiodysplasia bleeding [^116Vcdjb]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A small proportion of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia bleeding leads to chronic blood cell transfusion dependency. There are no guidelines supporting decision-making among various treatments in patients with gastrointestinal angiodysplasia bleeding. When endoscopic argon plasma coagulation is ineffective, the angiogenesis inhibitors thalidomide and octreotide can be considered. We describe a 77-year-old woman who had side effects of these angiogenesis inhibitors, which caused her to have continued bleeding. She was successfully treated with tranexamic acid with a substantial decrease in need for red blood cell transfusions.

Acute variceal hemorrhage — vasoactive agents and dosing are outlined, and only one of these four agents should be used. Octreotide is given as an initial IV bolus of 50 micrograms (can be repeated in first hour if ongoing bleeding) followed by continuous IV infusion of 50 μg/hr for 2–5 days. Vasopressin is delivered as a continuous IV infusion 0.2–0.4 U/min; can be increased to 0.8 U/min, and it should always be accompanied by IV nitroglycerin at a starting dose of 40 μg/min, which can be increased to a maximum of 400 μg/min, adjusted to maintain a systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, with a duration of 24 hours. SMT (somatostatin) is given as an initial IV bolus 250 μg (can be repeated in the first hour if ongoing bleeding) and a continuous IV infusion of 250–500 μg/hr for 2–5 days. Terlipressin dosing is initial 48 hours: 2 mg IV every 4 hours until control of bleeding, then maintenance: 1 mg IV every 4 hours to prevent rebleeding for 2–5 days.

RX (Treatment)

We recommend intravenous terlipressin is given to all patients with suspected cirrhosis/variceal bleeding. However, caution should be exercised in patients with ischaemic heart disease or peripheral vascular disease

Level of evidence: High

Level of recommendation: Strong

Agreement: 100%

Bundle recommendation: Intravenous terlipressin 2 mg four times a day in case of suspected variceal bleeding (80% agreement)

Variceal bleeding should be suspected in patients presenting with AUGIB who have known cirrhosis or have clinical parameters that would suggest cirrhosis. The UK variceal bleed guidelines recommend administering terlipressin or somatostatin as soon as variceal bleeding is suspected, for up to 5 days or until attainment of haemostasis, with octreotide as an alternative. The efficacy of intravenous terlipressin in variceal bleeding has been presented in a Cochrane meta-analysis of 22 RCTs (n = 1609). Seven studies (n = 443) compared terlipressin to placebo, of which five were considered to be high quality. This showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with placebo (34% relative risk reduction), improved haemostasis and reduced transfusion requirement. Similar results were found in an updated meta-analysis in 2012. A more recent multicentre RCT (n = 780) reported non-inferiority of terlipressin compared with octreotide and somatostatin, with no difference in outcomes of haemorrhage control, rebleeding and mortality. The BSG/BASL cirrhosis bundle suggests caution in patients with known ischaemic heart disease or peripheral vascular disease and mandatory ECG assessment in patients aged over 65 years.

### Successful use of long-acting octreotide for intractable chronic gastrointestinal bleeding in children [^113MG8MR]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Octreotide reduces splanchnic blood flow and is effective in controlling gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) caused by portal hypertension. Monthly long-acting octreotide (OCT-LAR) with an efficacy and safety profile similar to subcutaneous daily administration presents an attractive option for long-term therapy. We report our experience with OCT-LAR for severe/recurrent GIB in children with portal hypertension secondary to chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis who were unresponsive to standard interventions.

Methods

A total of 9 patients, 7 boys, who received OCT-LAR between 2000 and 2009 were studied retrospectively (median age at first bleeding 21 months, range 1 month-14.5 years). The dose (2.5–20 mg intramuscularly monthly) was extrapolated from that used in adult acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumours (10–60 mg/mo). Response to treatment was assessed by comparing the number of bleeding events, hospital admissions for acute bleeding, and number of blood units required during the year before and year after starting OCT-LAR.

Results

OCT-LAR led to a reduction in the number of bleeding episodes in all of the children and to cessation of bleeding in 7. Two children listed for transplantation because of severe GIB were removed from the list. No serious adverse effects immediately attributable to OCT-LAR were observed. One child developed growth hormone deficiency and hypothyroidism during a prolonged period of treatment with subcutaneous octreotide before commencing OCT-LAR.

Conclusions

OCT-LAR can control severe intractable recurrent GIB in children with portal hypertension. Prospective randomised controlled trials and pharmacokinetic studies are indicated to establish the optimum dose and length of treatment of OCT-LAR and confirm its efficacy and long-term safety in children.

### Bevacizumab for refractory gastrointestinal angiodysplasia: a case report and literature review [^112G5VQd]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Angiodysplasias are vascular malformations of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, responsible for up to 5% of cases of all GI bleeding. They are characterized by tortuous and ectatic blood vessels in the submucosa or mucosa, lined by endothelium without smooth muscle. The pathophysiology of angiodysplasia is multifactorial and includes obstruction of submucosal veins, mucosal ischemia leading to angiogenesis, and abnormalities in platelet adhesion and aggregation. Risk factors for the development of angiodysplasia include older age (> 60 years of age), cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis, chronic kidney disease, liver cirrhosis, and diabetes.

Patients with angiodysplasia often present with iron-deficiency anemia due to occult blood loss or with overt GI bleeding requiring transfusions and hospital admissions, significantly impacting quality of life. Most patients have multiple angiodysplasias, and the majority (> 60%) of angiodysplasias causing obscure overt blood loss are localized in the duodenum and jejunum. Small bowel angiodysplasias can be challenging to diagnose, but can be found on extended esophagogastroscopy with a pediatric colonoscope, capsule endoscopy, or double or single balloon enteroscopy.

Endoscopic treatment by argon plasma coagulation (APC) is considered first-line treatment for symptomatic angiodysplasia. However, recurrence rates exceeding 40%, and up to 80% in the small bowel, have been reported. Recurrence can be caused by angiodysplasias not initially detected or treated during the index endoscopy, or by the neoformation of angiodysplasias. Therefore, systemic pharmacological treatment may be necessary.

Octreotide or thalidomide has shown promising results in randomized clinical trials, leading to a reduction of transfusion units and the number of bleeding episodes. However, suboptimal response (less than 50% reduction of bleeding episodes or transfusion requirement) and side effects were frequent with both treatments (approximately 40 and 65%, respectively). Octreotide mainly shows cholecystolithiasis and glucose dysregulation requiring adjustments in glucose-lowering therapies. Thalidomide may induce neuropathy, and its availability in certain countries may be limited.

### Incidence and management of gastrointestinal bleeding with continuous flow assist devices [^113m4iy4]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs) have emerged as the standard of care for patients in advanced heart failure (HF) requiring long-term mechanical circulatory support. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding has been frequently reported within this population.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 101 patients implanted with the Heart Mate II from January 2005 to August 2011 was performed to identify incidence, etiology, and management of GI bleeding. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was conducted to identify related risk factors.

Results

A significant incidence of GI bleeding (22.8%) occurred in our predominantly destination therapy (DT) (93%) population. Fifty-seven percent of the patients with bleeding episodes bled from the upper GI (UGI) tract (with 54% bleeding from gastric erosions and 37% from ulcers/angiodysplasias), whereas 35% of patients bled from the lower GI (LGI) tract. Previous history of GI bleeding (odds ratio [OR], 22.7; 95% CI, 2.2–228.6; p = 0.008), elevated international normalized ratio (INR) (OR, 3.9; CI, 1.2–12.9; p = 0.02), and low platelet count (OR, -0.98; CI, 0.98–0.99; p = 0.001) were independent predictors of GI hemorrhage. Recurrent bleeding was more common in older patients (mean, 70 years; p = 0.01). The majority of bleeders (60%) rebled from the same site. Management strategies included temporarily withholding anticoagulation, decreasing the speed of LVADs, and using octreotide. Octreotide did not impact the amount of packed red blood cells used, rebleeding rates, length of hospital stay, or all-cause mortality. Only 1 patient died as a direct consequence of GI bleeding.

Conclusions

Multiple factors account for GI bleeding in patients on CF-VADs. A previous history of bleeding increases risk significantly and warrants careful monitoring.

### Octreotide therapy for control of acute gastrointestinal bleeding in children [^112hn1ko]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the outcomes of octreotide use in children with gastrointestinal bleeding with or without portal hypertension.

Methods

The medical charts of children who received continuous octreotide infusion for the indication of gastrointestinal bleeding from January 1995 to December 2000 were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

Twenty-one children with portal hypertension received octreotide infusions (1–2 microg/kg/h) during 35 gastrointestinal bleeding episodes. The duration of infusion ranged from 19 hours to 7 days. Bleeding ceased in 71% of children. Post-treatment rebleeding occurred in 52%, and the mortality was 19%. Response to octreotide, rebleeding, and mortality did not differ significantly between patients with or without intrinsic liver disease. Twelve children with gastrointestinal bleeding unrelated to portal hypertension received octreotide during 14 episodes. The duration of octreotide ranged from 3 hours to 36 days. Fifty percent of children had resolution of bleeding during the infusion. Post-treatment rebleeding occurred in 29%, and the mortality was 50%. No major adverse events were observed in either group.

Conclusions

A high rate of bleeding control was achieved with octreotide during acute gastrointestinal bleeding in children with portal hypertension. However, controlled studies are needed for more definitive description of its clinical effects. The role of octreotide is less clear in gastrointestinal bleeding unrelated to portal hypertension.

### Colonic angiodysplasia: a culprit of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding in a patient with Heyde syndrome [^115VSE2i]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Radionuclide scanning is the most sensitive radiographic test for GI bleeding, able to detect bleeding greater than a 0.1 mL/min. After injection of the technetium-99m pertechnetate-labelled red cells, a 60-minute dynamic scan is obtained, followed by static 2D planar images at intervals for several hours if no tracer accumulation is seen on the initial dynamic study. If bleeding is suspected on subsequent static imaging, an SPECT is performed for more accurate localisation. For these reasons, scintigraphy is useful for patients with obscure and intermittent bleeding, including those with suspected GI angiodysplasia. The 1999 AGA algorithm suggests a nuclear scan following upper and lower GI endoscopy for obscure overt GI bleeding. The disadvantage of a radionuclide scan is the inability to perform therapy, and a positive scan should be followed up shortly with angiography or colonoscopy for haemostasis. Delaying the therapeutic procedure may reduce the window for localisation and management of the lesion due to the intermittent nature of bleeding.

Various modalities have been used for treatment of bleeding angiodysplasias, including administration of octreotide or hormonal therapy, angiographic embolisation, endoscopic methods or surgical resection. Of the endoscopic techniques, argon plasma coagulation and bipolar or heater probe electrocoagulation have been best described in the literature, with argon plasma coagulation recommended as first-line endoscopic therapy. Mechanical haemostasis with endoscopic clips has not been well reported. Takahashi et al previously documented a case of successful endoscopic clipping for bleeding from colonic angiodysplasia in a case of Heyde syndrome. Aortic valve replacement has been shown to improve angiodysplastic bleeding in patients with aortic stenosis, although the angiodysplasia has been reported to persist months later.

A 2014 meta-analysis of 831 patients with angiodysplasia, including 623 patients treated via endoscopy, showed a 36% rebleeding rate at a median of 22 months from endoscopic therapy. It may, therefore, be important to follow-up these patients over the longer-term.

### Lack of difference among terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide in the control of acute gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage [^113MNNYX]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Vasoactive drugs are recommended to be started as soon as possible in suspected variceal bleeding, even before diagnostic endoscopy. However, it is still unclear whether the therapeutic efficacies of the various vasoactive drugs used are comparable. The aim of this prospective, multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial was to characterize the effects of terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide when they are initiated before endoscopic treatment in patients with acute variceal bleeding. Patients with liver cirrhosis and significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding were randomly assigned to receive early administration of terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide, followed by endoscopic treatment. Patients with nonvariceal bleeding were excluded after endoscopy. The primary endpoint was 5-day treatment success, defined as control of bleeding without rescue treatment, rebleeding, or mortality, with a noninferiority margin of 0.1. In total, 780 patients with variceal bleeding were enrolled: 261 in the terlipressin group; 259 in the somatostatin group; and 260 in the octreotide group. At the time of initial endoscopy, active bleeding was noted in 43.7%, 44.4%, and 43.5% of these patients, respectively (P = 0.748), and treatment success was achieved by day 5 in 86.2%, 83.4%, and 83.8% (P = 0.636), with similar rates of control of bleeding without rescue treatment (89.7%, 87.6%, and 88.1%; P = 0.752), rebleeding (3.4%, 4.8%, and 4.4%; P = 0.739), or mortality (8.0%, 8.9%, and 8.8%; P = 0.929). The absolute values of the lower bound of confidence intervals for terlipressin versus somatostatin, terlilpressin versus octreotide, and octreotide versus somatostatin were 0.095, 0.090, and 0.065, respectively.

Conclusion

Hemostatic effects and safety did not differ significantly between terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide as adjuvants to endoscopic treatment in patients with acute gastroesophageal variceal bleeding.

### Practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal problems arising as a result of treatment for cancer [^111qzV3C]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Subacute bowel obstruction

Experience suggests that important medical causes include abnormal electrolyte balance, opioid drugs, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, excessive faecal loading, severe fat malabsorption and excessive dietary fibre.

A trial of antibiotics and/or a low-fat diet (if steatorrhoea is present) and/or treatment with a bile acid sequestrant as appropriate may help. If the radiology suggests focal colonic faecal loading or a colonic site of obstruction or there is iron deficiency anaemia, colonoscopy should be considered. Excess fibre in the diet may precipitate subacute obstruction if a stricture is present. Some patients are very sensitive to opiates and can have prolonged colonic inertia even following small doses.

If low-fibre diets are indicated they should be prescribed by a qualified dietitian, should initially be time limited and the clinical benefit from the diet reviewed. Additional laxatives may be required. Data may emerge for the role of hyperbaric oxygen in treating patients with subacute obstruction due to radiation-induced fibrosis from the national ongoing HOT 2 trial (EudraCT No 2008-002152-26).

Surgery with a view to releasing adhesions or resecting strictures after previous pelvic radiotherapy can be particularly challenging because of dense abdominal fibrosis, and carries significantly higher risks of complications (eg, anastomotic leakages, postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis and intestinal fistulation) than surgery in a non-irradiated patient. Such surgery should be performed only by experienced surgeons with a low threshold for proximal faecal diversion. If an enteric motility disorder is also present (not uncommon), surgery may not lead to resolution of the symptoms.

Obstruction due to recurrent cancer

If cancer is present, the nature of the intervention should be influenced by the expected prognosis of the recurrence. Selected patients with no ascites, life expectancy > 2 months and good performance status may benefit from palliative decompressive surgery, but placement of self-expanding metal stents (if possible) appears to offer a better outcome. Expert medical management with opioids, antispasmodics (eg, hyoscine butyl bromide), antiemetics, antisecretory agents (eg, octreotide), corticosteroids and nasogastric tubes or venting gastrostomies can be effective in helping to control symptoms. Early input from surgeons and palliative care specialists should be sought.

Chronic syndromes: key facts

Symptoms are unreliable at identifying the underlying cause
Many cancer treatments have systemic effects and are not limited by normal anatomical boundaries
Patients may not report even severe symptoms reliably
Patients and clinicians may differ as to what constitute significant symptoms.

### Multicenter evaluation of octreotide as secondary prophylaxis in patients with left ventricular assist devices and gastrointestinal bleeding [^112BhwRP]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is one of the most common complications after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device implantation. More than one third of patients with incident bleed go on to develop recurrent GI bleeding. Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, is proposed to reduce the risk of recurrent GI bleeding in this population.

Methods and Results

This multicenter, retrospective analysis evaluated 51 continuous-flow left ventricular assist device patients who received secondary prophylaxis with octreotide after their index GI bleed from 2009 to 2015. All patients had a hospitalization for GI bleed and received octreotide after discharge. Patient demographics, medical and medication history, and clinical characteristics of patients who rebled after receiving octreotide were compared with non-rebleeders. These data were also compared with matched historical control patients previously enrolled in the HMII (HeartMate II) clinical trials, none of whom received octreotide, to provide a context for the bleeding rates. Twelve patients (24%) who received secondary octreotide prophylaxis developed another GI bleed, whereas 39 (76%) did not. There were similar intergroup demographics; however, significantly more bleeders had a previous GI bleeding history before left ventricular assist device placement (33% versus 5%; P = 0.02) and greater frequency of angiodysplasia confirmed during endoscopy (58% versus 23%; P = 0.03). Fewer patients in this study experienced a recurrent GI bleed compared with a matched historical control group that did not receive octreotide (24% versus 43%; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Patients with continuous-flow left ventricular assist device receiving secondary prophylaxis with octreotide had a significantly lower GI bleed recurrence compared with historical controls not treated with octreotide. Additional prospective studies are needed to confirm these data.

### Hematochezia in a patient with liver cirrhosis [^1171FrmX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite the lack of standardised clinical care pathways, it is generally accepted that the treatment of rectal varices focuses on the amelioriation of the underlying pathology- that is the portal hypertension. In cases where the bleeding is especially profuse, the majority consensus seems to be on rapid interventional decompression of the mesenteric circulation either by radiological or surgical means. However, in patients whose only symptom is rectal bleeding and whose general medical condition has yet to be physiologically and/or pharmacologically optimized, we suggest that endoscopic intervention may have a role similar to its use in managing patients with bleeding oesophageal varices.

### Bevacizumab for refractory gastrointestinal angiodysplasia: a case report and literature review [^113grKKM]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, symptomatic gastrointestinal (GI) angiodysplasia is treated with argon plasma coagulation (APC) via endoscopic procedures, supplemented with octreotide or thalidomide treatment. However, suboptimal response and side effects are often seen. Bevacizumab, an angiogenesis inhibitor, may provide an alternative systemic therapy for patients with refractory GI angiodysplasia. A 75-year-old male patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension due to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease presented with recurrent anemia and overt GI bleeding. Initial endoscopic findings showed a combination of portal hypertensive gastropathy and GI angiodysplasia. Anemia persisted despite repeated APC and octreotide. After transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, portal hypertensive gastropathy resolved; however, GI angiodysplasia remained and caused refractory symptomatic anemia and overt bleeding. Finally, we resorted to off-label bevacizumab in the absence of other viable treatment options. The patient initially responded to treatment but has needed top-up dosing, the effect of which remains to be evaluated. In conclusion, we describe our initial experience with off-label bevacizumab in the treatment of refractory GI angiodysplasia. Based on our experience and literature, bevacizumab may be a viable option for patients with refractory GI angiodysplasia, which should be further evaluated in future studies before it can be implemented in clinical practice.

### Hematochezia in a patient with liver cirrhosis [^1146GiCM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

Haematochezia requiring acute management is an uncommon problem in patients with portal hypertension (0.5–3.6%) and so treatment paradigms are not well established. Initial medical management following the same principles as that for esophagogastric gastric is generally recommended on both theoretical and empiric grounds and therefore we firstly tried pharmacologically reduction of the patient's portal pressure by instituting both a β-blocker and a synthetic analogue of vasopressin while also addressing his abnormal coagulation. Failure of the bleeding to lessen however mandated an attempt at more definitive intervention. Given that this episode represented the patients first episode of decompensation on a background of Child's B liver disease, we were reluctant to proceed directly to formal mechanical portal vein decompression (by means of portosystemic shunt created either by a Transjugular Intrahepatic approach [i.e. TIPS] or open operation) and therefore considered the available endoscopic treatments proposed in the literature.

Endoscopic band ligation has previously been shown by others to be effective in exactly this scenario albeit in small case seriesas indeed has endoscopic sclerotherapy. Some authors however have expressed concern that the latter procedure risks exacerbation of bleeding when the varices demonstrate red colour signs (as may be seen to be present in image one). While the long-term efficacy of either method is uncertain, such endoscopic intervention has been reported to provide an effective means of short-term relief of rectal bleeding without recourse to formal portal vein decompression in patients with cirrhosis whose main clinical issue is hematochezia. Our own experience encourages us to continue to utilise this therapeutic means in such circumstances.

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: expert review [^114zZw6h]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Variceal hemorrhage — initiation of vasoactive therapy is guided by Best Practice Advice 1, which states that vasoactive drugs should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of variceal hemorrhage is suspected or confirmed, preferably before diagnostic and/or therapeutic endoscopy. Acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH) is described as a major complication of cirrhosis with an in-hospital mortality rate of 4%–13% and a 6-week mortality rate of 7%–43% and accounts for approximately 70% of all upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis. Vasoactive drugs for AVH can be divided into somatostatin and its analogs (octreotide in most countries) and vasopressin and its analogs (terlipressin); these agents work via vasoconstriction in the splanchnic circulation and thereby reduce portal pressure, can halt acute hemorrhage in up to 80% of cases, and are given intravenously.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of octreotide acetate IV (also known as Sandostatin, Sandostatin LAR Depot, Bynfezia Pen):
- **Abnormal ECG, AV block**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as octreotide has been associated with an increased risk of cardiac conduction abnormalities and other ECG changes, including QT prolongation, axis shift, early repolarization, low voltage, R/S transition, and early R wave progression. Octreotide IV has been associated with an increased risk for higher degree AV blocks.
- **Bradycardia**: use caution in patients taking bradycardia-inducing drugs, such as β-blockers.
- **Cholelithiasis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as octreotide may inhibit gallbladder contractility and decrease bile secretion, potentially leading to gallbladder abnormalities, sludge, and associated complications such as cholecystitis, cholangitis, and pancreatitis. Monitor patients periodically.
- **Decreased serum cyclosporine levels**: use caution in patients taking cyclosporine.
- **Decreased serum vitamin B12**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as octreotide has been associated with an increased risk of decreased vitamin B12 levels and abnormal Schilling test results. Monitor serum vitamin B12 levels.
- **Hypothyroidism**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as octreotide may suppress the secretion of TSH. Monitor thyroid function periodically.
- **Increased blood glucose, decreased blood glucose**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as octreotide may alter the balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, insulin, glucagon, and GH, resulting in hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or diabetes mellitus. Monitor blood glucose levels. Adjust insulin and other antidiabetic treatment accordingly.
- **Increased serum bromocriptine levels**: use caution in patients taking bromocriptine.
- **Increased serum drug levels**: use caution in patients taking drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and having a narrow therapeutic index, such as quinidine and terfenadine.
- **Steatorrhea, fat malabsorption**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as somatostatin analogs, including octreotide, may cause steatorrhea, stool discoloration, diarrhea, and fat malabsorption.

### Neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111MAPTJ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

NCCN Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors — carcinoid syndrome hormone control states that carcinoid syndrome primarily occurs in patients with metastatic well-differentiated NETs originating in the distal small intestine and proximal colon (midgut), with signs and symptoms including flushing, diarrhea, wheezing (rare), and CHD. Carcinoid crisis is a potentially life-threatening form often triggered by tumor manipulation or anesthesia and is typically associated with hypotension, diarrhea, and blood pressure fluctuation; in patients with carcinoid syndrome, invasive procedures should ideally be performed in centers with experienced anesthesiologists. During surgical procedures for patients who develop hemodynamic instability that could indicate carcinoid crisis, octreotide should be available as needed; doses of octreotide (100–500 mcg IV) can be used, potentially followed by IV infusion of octreotide (50–300 mcg/h). Therapeutic levels of octreotide would not be expected to be reached for 10–14 days after LAR injections. Short-acting SC octreotide PRN can help address suboptimal symptom control quickly, and vasopressors can be used for severe and/or prolonged hypotension. Prophylactic administration of octreotide prior to surgery can be utilized although intraoperative complications can still arise, and the routine use of prophylactic octreotide has been called into question. Refractory flushing or diarrhea is defined as suboptimal symptom control in the setting of long-acting SSAs (octreotide LAR or lanreotide) used in approved doses. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Updated strategies in the management of acute variceal haemorrhage [^1134phDW]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article reviews the most recent studies regarding the management of acute esophageal variceal haemorrhage.

Recent Findings

New randomized control trials and meta-analyses confirmed the role of early transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in the management of acute variceal haemorrhage in Child-Pugh C (10–13) and B patients with active bleeding. A recent randomized controlled trial focused on the duration of vasoactive therapy showed no difference between 2 and 5 days of octreotide. A randomized trial showed decreased use of blood products for the correction of coagulopathy using a thromboelastography-guided approach (vs. conventional parameters) as well as decreased bleeding rates when compared with standard of care. A meta-analysis found that for rescue of variceal bleeding, self-expanding metallic stents were more efficacious and safer than balloon tamponade. In addition, studies showed that Child-Pugh C patients and those with hepatic vein pressure gradient more than 20 were at the highest risk of treatment failure, while model for end-stage liver disease was highly predictive of in-hospital mortality.

Summary

In patients with severe coagulopathy and uncontrolled bleeding, TEG-based transfusion strategies are recommended. Antibiotics should be used for all cirrhotic patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, but should be tailored in accordance to local resistance patterns. Early TIPS for high-risk patients has been shown to have a significant survival benefit. Certain aspects of the management of variceal bleeding remain poorly studied such as the role of early TIPS in Child-B patients as well as strategies for rescue therapy in patients who are not TIPS candidates, and require further investigation.

### Hemorrhoids screening and treatment prior to LVAD: is it a necessity? [^1166bScK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

In Case 1, patient had HAL post LVAD implant, yet this was complicated by cardiac arrest and death despite many efforts to resuscitate the patient. That being said, in Case 2 we opted for hemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL) before LVAD implantation, despite the patient's clinical status. Thus avoided any fatal complications related to bleeding or a second procedure (e.g. HAL) post LVAD implant.

HAL is an operation started in 1996 by Morinaga et al. for the surgical treatment of moderate grade and prolapsed hemorrhoids. It centers around the treatment of hemorrhoids by cutting off the blood supply with guidance from a Doppler probe. Hence, this procedure is a low risk, less invasive and efficacious procedure, making it a good alternative to conventional haemorrhoidectomy or stapled haemorrhoidopexy in the short and medium term as endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Care (NICE). According to the 2014 ESC/ESA Guidelines on non-cardiac surgery, heart failure is a well-recognized factor for peri-operative and post-operative cardiac events, while patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 30% might be at a greater risk. However since HAL is less invasive than conventional open hemorrhoidectomy, it was the procedure of choice in our patient considering the potential for a related GI complication before LVAD implantation. It should be noted, that Jeong et al, in there one year follow up of patients post dopppler-guided HAL, noted a recurrence rate including re-bleeding of 14%. However this large number was higher than previously published reports.

Secondary prevention strategies for GI bleed post LVAD implantation had been discussed, including treating Helicobacter pylori, daily proton pump inhibitor use, limiting non steroidal anti inflammatory use and sub cutaneous octreotide injection to treat angiodysplasia. Also lowering pump speed was suggested as an approach to limit bleeding. Based on the 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Guidelines for Mechanical Circulatory Support: "reducing the pump speed for continuous flow pumps in the setting of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to arteriovenous malformations may be considered". Considering that angiodysplasia is caused by reduced pulsatility, thus decreasing pump speed can result in increase pulsatility and decreased angiodysplasia formation. Also repeated transfusion of vWF has been reported to control bleeding caused by angiodysplasia, however it is not recommended yet.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^114rZFGp]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) — guidance statements 48–51 outline management: Patients with greater than mild PHG should be presumed to have clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) and should therefore be considered for prophylactic nonselective beta-blockers (NSBB) to prevent decompensation; this intervention may also prevent hemorrhagic complications or iron-deficiency anemia from severe PHG. In acute bleeding from severe PHG, vasoactive therapy (e.g., somatostatin, somatostatin analogs such as octreotide, or terlipressin if available) for 2–5 days at doses used for variceal bleeding should be considered. NSBB are recommended to prevent rebleeding from PHG and PH-related polyps. If bleeding from PHG becomes transfusion-dependent despite NSBB, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement should be considered.

Table 1
Study details and baseline demographics of the patients in the included studies

One hundred nineteen patients were included in the RR meta-analysis (4 studies, 60 patients in the control group and 59 in the intervention group). The mean age was 65.2 years and 66.0 years for the control and intervention groups, respectively. The 2 groups also showed similar sex distributions (63.3% vs. 69.5% males for the control and intervention groups, respectively). All studies with control groups reported the hemostatic agent(s) used, which included: endoscopic hemoclip application, thermal treatment, pharmacotherapy (fluids, blood, octreotide, adrenaline injection), and/or adrenaline injection.

A total of 1280 patients (1161 patients from single-arm and 119 from dual-arm studies) were included in the proportional meta-analysis. Of these, 1220 patients received Hemospray and 60 received other hemostatic agents. There was no significant age difference between Hemospray recipients and non-Hemospray recipients (67.7 and 63.0 years. respectively, P = 0.43). There was no significant difference regarding the sex distribution of Hemospray and non-Hemospray recipients (57% and 68% males, respectively, P = 0.08). Among Hemospray recipients, the median Rockall score was 6.6, the median Blatchford score was 10.5 and the median hemoglobin at time of treatment was 8.0 g/dL. In the control group, the median Rockall score was 7.1, the median Blatchford score was 10.5 and the median hemoglobin at time of treatment was 8.0 g/dL. No significant differences were found.

### Medical and endoscopic therapies for angiodysplasia and gastric antral vascular ectasia: a systematic review [^114eV6ds]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Few studies have compared the efficacy and complications of endoscopic or medical therapies for bleeding angiodysplasias or gastric antral vascular ectasias (GAVE). We conducted a systematic review to evaluate therapies.

Methods

We performed a PubMed search for studies (written in English from January 1, 1980, through January 1, 2013) of medical or endoscopic treatment of bleeding angiodysplasias and GAVE. Measured outcomes included levels of hemoglobin, transfusion requirements, rebleeding rates, complications, treatment failures, and overall mortality.

Results

We analyzed data from 63 studies that met inclusion criteria; 50 evaluated endoscopic treatment (1790 patients), 13 evaluated medical treatment (392 patients), and 12 were comparative studies. In patients with angiodysplasias, the combination of estrogen and progesterone did not significantly reduce bleeding episodes, compared with placebo (0.7/y vs 0.9/y, respectively), and increased mortality, compared with conservative therapy (33% vs 21%). A higher percentage of patients receiving octreotide were free of rebleeding at 1 and 2 years vs placebo (77% vs 55% and 68% vs 36%, respectively; P = 0.03). Thalidomide reduced the number of bleeding episodes (-8.96/y), compared with iron therapy (-1.38/y, P < .01), but neither treatment reduced mortality. More patients with GAVE treated by endoscopic band ligation were free from rebleeding (92%) than those treated with argon plasma coagulation (32%, P = 0.01).

Conclusions

In a systematic review, we found a low quality of evidence to support treatment of angiodysplasias with thalidomide or the combination of estrogen and progesterone and insufficient evidence to support treatment with octreotide. There is also insufficient evidence for endoscopic therapy of angiodysplasia or GAVE. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to study the efficacy and complications of medical and endoscopic treatments for patients with angiodysplasias or GAVE.

### Octreotide for recurrent intestinal variceal bleeding in patients without portal hypertension [^113YoEKe]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

We report on the efficacy of octreotide acetate in two patients with intestinal phlebectasia and no evidence of portal hypertension or mesenteric thrombosis. Patient 1 was a 46-year-old woman with primary pulmonary arterial hypertension. She required repeated transfusions for recurrent episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Intraoperative enteroscopy revealed wide-spread small bowel phlebectasia and intestinal resection was not performed. Blue rubber-bleb syndrome, portal hypertension and mesenteric thrombosis were ruled out. Octreotide acetate long-acting release was started. A transient interruption in treatment was followed by severe overt GIB. This was effectively controlled with continuous infusion of octreotide acetate. After this episode, octreotide acetate long-acting release was resumed and no further episodes of GIB have been reported until the most recent follow up (total duration of 74 months). Patient 2 was a 51-year-old woman with a history of recurrent GIB requiring multiple blood transfusions since young adulthood with negative endoscopic investigations. An enteroscopy showed numerous submucosal serpiginous varices in the colon and the terminal ileum. All putative causes including portal hypertension or mesenteric thrombosis were ruled out. Monthly intramuscular injections of long-acting octreotide acetate were initiated, and no GIB occurred since then (27 months of follow up). Somatostatin analogues are known to reduce splanchnic blood flow, to increase vascular resistance, to enhance platelet aggregation; and are thus efficacious in preventing GIB secondary to various vascular lesions (portal hypertension, intestinal angiodysplasia and blue rubber-bleb syndrome). These case reports suggest that they are also effective in preventing GIB in intestinal phlebactasia without portal hypertension.

### One versus five days of octreotide infusion for acute esophageal variceal bleeding: a randomized controlled trial [^112hJuyw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The optimal duration of octreotide infusion for esophageal variceal bleeding remains unclear. We aimed to compare the efficacy of 1-day versus 5-day octreotide infusion combined with endoscopic therapy, with the primary outcome of early (5-day) re-bleeding under a non-inferiority framework and secondary outcomes of 6-week re-bleeding and all-cause mortality.

Methods

This nationwide, multicenter, non-inferiority, open-label, randomized, controlled trial included 220 patients with cirrhosis and acute esophageal variceal bleeding who underwent endoscopic band ligation in five tertiary-care and three university-based hospitals across Thailand. They received a 1-day (n = 109) or 5-day (n = 111) regimen of continuous octreotide infusion after successful endoscopy. Re-bleeding, transfusion requirements, and mortality were assessed.

Results

The majority of participants were men (180/220), and the average age was 56 years. The 5-day re-bleeding (1.83% vs. 1.80%, p ≥ 0.99), 6-week re-bleeding (8.26% vs. 10.81%, p = 0.52), and 6-week all-cause mortality (5.50% vs. 6.31%, p = 0.80) rates were similar between the 1- and 5-day groups. The event-rate difference in early re-bleeding was 0.03%, indicating non-inferiority (95% CI, 3.50–3.56%). Patients in the 1-day group required significantly fewer blood transfusions and had a shorter time to oral diet and shorter hospital stay.

Conclusions

Following successful endoscopic band ligation, the 1-day regimen of octreotide had a non-inferior effect compared to the standard 5-day regimen in the prevention of 5-day re-bleeding and exhibited no significant differences in the prevention of 6-week re-bleeding and all-cause mortality.

### Management of small bowel angioectasias diagnosed during video capsule endoscopy [^1153mZey]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Noninvasive management

Somatostatin analogs

Somatostatin analogs reduce splanchnic blood flow, enhance platelet aggregation and exert anti-angiogenic effects. Long-acting octreotide (octreotide-LAR) can be administered at a starting dose of 20mg monthly, intramuscularly, for a minimum of 6 months. Lanreotide is the more expensive of the 2 and, unlike octreotide, can be administered subcutaneously in addition to intramuscularly; this is especially useful in patients on anticoagulant treatment. Intramuscular lanreotide is formulated in 30 mg vials administered at 28-day intervals. Somatuline Autogel is the subcutaneous form of lanreotide, available in 60-mg, 90-mg, and 120-mg vials. Unlike octreotide, lanreotide requires dose adjustments in renal impairment.

According to a recent systematic review of 11 studies with moderate-to-high quality evidence, somatostatin analogs reduce the red blood cell transfusion requirement in patients with angioectasias. Patients included were solely on somatostatin analog therapy for SBAs, and previous treatment with APC was recorded. They were studied for a median treatment period of 12 months and followed-up for a year after treatment. One study used short-acting somatostatin analogs administered subcutaneously t.i.d. while others used the long-acting formulations described above. The primary endpoint in most of the studies was a reduction in red blood cell transfusion requirement compared to baseline: 83% of patients had a reduction of more than 50%. Octreotide was found to be superior to lanreotide in terms of treatment response (P = 0.02). Pasireotide is mentioned in one study included in the systemic review, and is inferior to octreotide as it binds least to the somatostatin receptor type 2. Unfortunately, most studies describe the use of somatostatin analogs following a failure of endoscopic therapy. There are also, until the time of writing, no available studies directly comparing octreotide to lanreotide. The side-effect rate for octreotide and lanreotide has recently been reported as 38%. The commonest reported adverse events are loose stools, cholelithiasis, flatulence, and administration site reaction.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^116Fxm8P]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, more specifically with respect to indications for specialist consultation, ASGE 2014 guidelines recommend to obtain surgical and radiologic consultation in patients with severe hematochezia unable to be stabilized for endoscopy or if endoscopic evaluation failed to reveal a bleeding source.

Somatostatin analogs may be used as sole agents, but are also administered as additional therapy following APC. One small study noted that the need for DBE was reduced significantly in patients on different doses of lanreotide. Patients on lanreotide also experienced a decrease in bleeding episodes and transfusion requirements, as well as an improvement in hemoglobin. These findings did not correlate with either the dose of lanreotide administered or the timing of initiation of lanreotide. Prior to this study, Jackson et al identified 4 studies of somatostatin analog use for the management of SBAs refractory to endoscopic therapy. All 4 studies administered octreotide at different doses and dosing intervals. Bleeding cessation rates increased significantly following the introduction of somatostatin analogs, with a pooled odds ratio of 14.52.

Further studies are required to shed light on the use of somatostatin analogs as monotherapy, especially in patients ineligible for DAE. A study published in 2022 included 16 patients with untreated SBAs treated solely with subcutaneous octreotide at 100 μg daily. The results are promising, as they demonstrated a significant reduction in rebleeding rates (P = 0.002), hemoglobin reduction and transfusion requirements. Future research will also need to concentrate on dosing and duration of treatment with somatostatin analogues, since trials so far have not been uniform, making it difficult to draw a comparison.

Immunomodulatory therapy

Thalidomide downregulates the expression of VEGF at both protein and mRNA levels. It has been used in the management of SBAs at doses of 50–200 mg daily via the oral route. In terms of re-bleeding rates, thalidomide has demonstrated promising results. Adverse events are reported in around 70% of patients receiving thalidomide and lenalidomide, and include length-dependent neuropathy, teratogenicity and thromboembolic events. In view of these adverse event rates, thalidomide and lenalidomide are not used routinely in daily clinical practice.

Bevacizumab

Bevacizumab is an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody. It has been used successfully to treat refractory SBAs in 2 patients diagnosed with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Its use has also been described in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Its most severe adverse effect is bowel perforation, which is estimated to have an incidence of 5.4%. More recently, a small series involving 21 patients demonstrated that bevacizumab is useful for refractory SBA, as well as gastric antral vascular ectasia, as it reduced transfusion, intravenous iron and endoscopy requirements. Decreased blood pressure control was reported as an adverse effect. In view of the side-effect profile, one should be cautious in its prescription.
