11.2. Given a right triangle ABC with legs AC = a and CB = b. Find a) the side of the square with vertex C of the largest area, entirely lying within the triangle ABC; б) the dimensions of the rectangle with vertex C of the largest area, entirely lying within the triangle ABC.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about finding the largest-area square and rectangle that can be inscribed in a right triangle ABC with legs AC = a and CB = b, such that one vertex of the square or rectangle coincides with the right angle at C. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about setting up a coordinate system and expressing the hypotenuse as a line. Then, I should derive the constraint that keeps the opposite vertex of the square or rectangle on the hypotenuse. Next, I will express the area as a function of a single variable and maximize it using calculus. After that, I should verify the square solution and then extend the method to a rectangle with variable aspect ratio. Finally, I will double-check the results and consider special cases to ensure correctness.

> Let me first confirm the setup. I will place the right angle at the origin, with leg AC along the positive x-axis and leg CB along the positive y-axis, so C is at (0, 0), A is at (a, 0), and B is at (0, b). The hypotenuse AB then has the equation x/a + y/b = 1, which I should keep in mind as the boundary constraint for the far vertex of the square or rectangle [^notfound].

> Now, for the square, I need to ensure that the vertex opposite C lies on the hypotenuse. If the square has side length s, then its vertices are at (0, 0), (s, 0), (0, s), and (s, s). Wait, let me verify the fourth vertex: yes, (s, s) is the vertex diagonally opposite C, and it must satisfy the hypotenuse equation, so s/a + s/b = 1. Solving for s gives s = ab/(a + b), and thus the area of the largest square is s² = a²b²/(a + b)². I should confirm that this is indeed the maximum; because the square must fit entirely within the triangle, any larger s would push (s, s) outside the hypotenuse, so this is optimal [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for the rectangle. I initially thought the rectangle would naturally be a square, but wait, I should verify whether allowing unequal sides changes the optimum. Let the rectangle have width x along the x-axis and height y along the y-axis, so its far vertex is at (x, y), which must lie on the hypotenuse, giving x/a + y/b = 1. The area is A = xy, and I can substitute y = b(1 − x/a) to express A as a function of x alone: A(x) = bx(1 − x/a). To maximize, I take the derivative dA/dx = b(1 − 2x/a), set it to zero, and solve to get x = a/2. Then y = b(1 − (a/2)/a) = b/2, and the maximum area is (a/2)(b/2) = ab/4. I should double-check the second derivative to confirm it's a maximum: d²A/dx² = −2b/a < 0, so yes, this is a maximum. Interestingly, the optimal rectangle is not a square unless a = b, which corrects my earlier assumption that the rectangle solution would coincide with the square solution [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the square result in light of the rectangle finding. The square's side s = ab/(a + b) is always less than or equal to min(a, b), and its area is a²b²/(a + b)², whereas the rectangle's maximum area is ab/4. I should confirm the relationship: since (a + b)² ≥ 4ab by AM-GM, it follows that a²b²/(a + b)² ≤ ab/4, with equality only when a = b. This confirms that the rectangle can achieve a larger area than the square unless the triangle is isosceles, which makes sense geometrically [^notfound].

> I will now examine special cases to sanity-check. If a = b, the triangle is isosceles, the square has side a/2 and area a²/4, and the rectangle also has dimensions a/2 by b/2 = a/2 by a/2, so in that case the optimal rectangle is indeed a square. If a is much larger than b, the square becomes very thin along the y-direction, while the rectangle approaches a/2 by b/2, which still respects the constraint and yields a larger area than the square. These limiting cases align with intuition and the algebra, which reassures me the solutions are correct [^notfound].

> Final answers, with a quick verification: a) The side of the largest square is ab/(a + b), so its area is a²b²/(a + b)². b) The dimensions of the largest rectangle are a/2 by b/2, so its area is ab/4. I should confirm once more that both far vertices lie on the hypotenuse: for the square, (ab/(a + b))/a + (ab/(a + b))/b = b/(a + b) + a/(a + b) = 1; for the rectangle, (a/2)/a + (b/2)/b = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Both constraints are satisfied, so the solutions are consistent with the geometry [^notfound].

The largest square that fits inside right triangle ABC with vertex C has side length (\\boxed{\\dfrac{ab}{a + b}}) and area (\\boxed{\\dfrac{a^2b^2}{(a + b)^2}}).

The largest rectangle that fits inside right triangle ABC with vertex C has dimensions (\\boxed{\\dfrac{a}{2} \\times \\dfrac{b}{2}}) and area (\\boxed{\\dfrac{ab}{4}}).

## Largest square with vertex C

Let the square have side length (s), with one vertex at (C) and the opposite vertex on the hypotenuse (AB). The hypotenuse has equation (\\dfrac{x}{a} + \\dfrac{y}{b} = 1). For the square to fit, the point ((s, s)) must lie on the hypotenuse, so:

[s/a] + [s/b] = 1 => s([1/a] + [1/b]) = 1 => s = [ab/(a + b)]

Thus, the side length is (\\boxed{\\dfrac{ab}{a + b}}) and the area is (\\boxed{\\dfrac{a^2b^2}{(a + b)^2}}).

---

## Largest rectangle with vertex C

Let the rectangle have width (x) along (AC) and height (y) along (CB), with the opposite vertex ((x, y)) on the hypotenuse. Then:

[x/a] + [y/b] = 1 => y = b(1 − [x/a])

The area is A = xy = x·b(1 − [x/a]) = bx − [b/a]x². To maximize, take the derivative and set it to zero:

dA/dx = b − [2b/a]x = 0 => x = [a/2]

Then y = b(1 − [1/2]) = [b/2], so the dimensions are [a/2] × [b/2] and the area is [ab/4].

## Summary of results

| **Shape** | **Dimensions** | **Area** |
|-|-|-|
| Square | [ab/(a + b)] | [a²b²/(a + b)²] |
| Rectangle | [a/2] × [b/2] | [ab/4] |

The largest square has side [ab/(a + b)] and area [a²b²/(a + b)²], while the largest rectangle has dimensions [a/2] × [b/2] and area [ab/4].

Trapezoid and 30-60-90 right triangle

This set of experiments was carried out in a right triangle (30°, 60°, 90°) and a trapezoid environment. Corner angles from the trapezoid were 55°, 90°, 90° and 125°. The dimensions of the mazes were 46 (L) × 28 (W) × 30 (H) cm. In total, we conducted 16 sessions each (25 min per session) from eight mice for the right triangle and trapezoid. Data from this set of experiments were aligned and concatenated, and the activity of neurons was tracked across the sessions for each mouse. Other recording protocols were the same as described above.

Insertion of a discrete corner in a square environment

This set of experiments was carried out in a large square environment with dimensions of 40 (L) × 40 (W) × 40 (H) cm. The experiments comprised a baseline session followed by four sessions with the insertion of a discrete corner into the square maze. In these sessions, the walls that formed the discrete corner were gradually separated by 0, 1.5, 3 and 6 cm. Starting from 3 cm, the animals were able to pass through the gap without difficulty. The dimensions of the inserted walls were 15 (W) × 30 (H) cm. For each condition, we recorded eight sessions (30 min per session) from eight mice by conducting a single session from each mouse per day. Data from this set of experiments were aligned and concatenated, and the activity of neurons was tracked throughout the sessions.

Relation between densities of edge triangles, squares and pentagons for different values of γ.

Panels (A – C) show the projection of the phase space in the subspace (C s, C t), panels (D – F) show the projection in the subspace (C p, C t), and panels (G – I) show the projection in the subspace (C p, C s). In plots (A – F), the dashed red line represents the β = 2 D limit separating the small-world and large-world phases. In these plots, the area on the left of the dashed red line corresponds to β < 2 D (small-world phase) and the area on the right corresponds to β > 2 D (large-world phase if γ > 3). Each point represents an average over 10 network realizations. Standard errors are smaller than the symbols themselves.

There are several interesting patterns that can be observed in the phase space (C t, C s, C p). First, all the curves tend to collapse when there is only a small level of clustering, thus becoming dimension independent. This is to be expected because in this case the topological equivalent of the triangle inequality breaks down, so that the network loses its metric character. In addition, all the curves tend to be closer together — and so tend towards dimension independence — as γ → 2. This implies that, beyond the fact that a metric space may be needed to explain the observed levels of clustering, its dimensionality is not very important when degrees are strongly heterogeneous and networks are dominated by very big hubs. In turn, this explains why highly heterogeneous real networks are extremely well described by themodel.

The experimental data of all the polygon intruders collapse on the fitted curve in Fig. 2a for all the cylinders (solid line), suggesting the K ϕ is a pure material constitutive parameter

Theoretical analysis

Quasistatically yielding cohesionless dry granular media can be modelled as a continuum of bulk density ρ s and internal friction angle ϕ. To model the stress field, the mechanical equilibrium conditions are closed by a yield criterion, for which there are several models. We choose here to use the MC criterion, where τ is the local shear stress and σ n is the corresponding normal stress. Several experiments established that the penetration process gives rise to a conical SZ ahead of the intruder, advancing as a rigid body –. Taking this into consideration, the boundary conditions are sketched in Fig. 4a and include the downward pressure at depth h and the resistive force, F z, on the intruder. We assume that the free surface, left behind, is flat, which is a good assumption as long as any deviation from flatness is appreciably smaller than the size of the SZ. Supplementary Fig. 1 supports this assumption.

### Stability criteria for complex microbial communities [^c42aa9fa]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We can still ask how this volume changes as we make consumers more or less similar in terms of the resources they use, represented mathematically by the inner product of the columns of C. For example, in the special case where all species begin equally similar, then a uniform decrease in their similarity leads to a larger volume for the parameter space, and greater structural stability (detailed in Methods). This is in agreement with the ecological intuition that it is 'easier' for more dissimilar species to coexist. However, this is not the general case. Independent of the size of the system, there are some contexts where a decrease in the similarity of any pair of species will lead to less, not greater, structural stability. Figure 2 shows a specific example, for three species, where a decrease in the similarity of one pair of species (while keeping other pairwise similarities fixed) leads to a decrease in structural similarity. What is the general lesson here? The biological interpretation is that changes in structural stability as we change the similarity of any two species depend (in general) on all of the other consumption preferences. This reiterates our point above, that the determinant in V μ does not depend in a trivial way on pairwise comparisons, and consequently the structural stability of systems of consumers and abiotic resources does not depend in a simple way on pairwise species similaritities expressed in terms of consumption preferences.

Fig. 2
Structural stability changes non-monotonically with species similarity. The volume of the set of mortality rates leading to feasible densities for the resources, R *, can decrease even when species similarity is decreased. Here, we show an example in three dimensions, where each axis represents one of the three mortality rates, μ i, and the volume is a kind of wedge extending from the origin outwards. The measure, V μ, of the size of this volume is then equivalent to the area (colored green or blue) of a triangle on the surface of the unit sphere, where the dissimilarity of each pair of species is proportional to the length of one of the triangle's sides. On the left, this volume is shown for the particular 3 × 3 matrix C T detailed in our Methods section, and is colored green. When the angle between one pair of column vectors is increased while the other angles are unchanged, we get the volume shown on the right-hand side. The resulting volume decreases in size, despite the average similarity of these three species having decreased

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### Nanotomy-based production of transferable and dispersible graphene nanostructures of controlled shape and size [^6c570699]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Because of the edge states and quantum confinement, the shape and size of graphene nanostructures dictate their electrical, optical, magnetic and chemical properties. The current synthesis methods for graphene nanostructures do not produce large quantities of graphene nanostructures that are easily transferable to different substrates/solvents, do not produce graphene nanostructures of different and controlled shapes, or do not allow control of GN dimensions over a wide range (up to 100 nm). Here we report the production of graphene nanostructures with predetermined shapes (square, rectangle, triangle and ribbon) and controlled dimensions. This is achieved by diamond-edge-induced nanotomy (nanoscale-cutting) of graphite into graphite nanoblocks, which are then exfoliated. Our results show that the edges of the produced graphene nanostructures are straight and relatively smooth with an I(D)/I(G) of 0.22–0.28 and roughness < 1 nm. Further, thin films of GN-ribbons exhibit a bandgap evolution with width reduction (0, 10 and ~35 meV for 50, 25 and 15 nm, respectively).

Data analysis by ImageJ

For each sample, 100 triangles or squares were randomly selected by manually identifying triangle-shaped or square-shaped arrangements of 3HB proteins that had, based on the results from atomistic simulations, no more than 3.5 nm separation between each pair of adjacent 3HB edges. The interior angles for these cyclized structures were measured using ImageJ software, and the standard deviation of the three vertex angles within each individual triangle for the five triangular nanostructures was calculated aswhere n is 3 and x i is the vertex angle value of each individual triangle in that nanostructure. The standard deviation for all angles in triangular nanostructures was calculated aswhere n is 300 and x i is the measured angle values.

### Controlled packing and single-droplet resolution of 3D-printed functional synthetic tissues [^3b7915f7]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Classifying packing types

To estimate the proportion of packing types within each network, we first generated a mesh over the print by performing a Delaunay triangulation using the centres of all regions classified as droplets as the input points. A convenient property of this triangulation method is that the circumcircle of each triangle contains no other points; each triangle therefore represents a triplet of neighbouring droplets and provides localised geometrical information about their arrangements.

The plot of the bivariate distribution of the largest angle of each triangle vs the triangle area normalised by the average droplet area for all prints revealed two distinct clusters of triangles, one corresponding to hexagonally packed droplet regions, and one corresponding to square-packed droplet regions (Supplementary Fig. 3 d). Reasoning that these represented stable configurations of droplets for certain printing parameters, we classified each triangle using these clusters. Four packing categories were used: 'hexagonal' (closely packed triplets of droplets arranged as equilateral triangles), 'square' (closely packed triplets of droplets arranged as right-angled triangles), 'amorphous' (closely packed triplets of droplets of intermediate arrangement) and 'no packing' (triplets of droplets that are not close-packed). For a hexagonal classification. For an amorphous classification. For a square classification. In addition, for all of these classes. Triangles that fell outside of these ranges were classified as no packing (Supplementary Fig. 3 d).

Some elongated 'sliver' triangles were classified as being a member of one of the closely packed classes, despite being composed of widely spaced droplets. Closer analysis of these triangles revealed that they were generally composed of two closely packed droplets and a single more distant droplet, together forming a skinny near-isosceles triangle. We therefore applied an additional constraint based on the perimeter of each triangle normalised by the average droplet radius. Since for perfect hexagonal packing, and for a perfect square packing, we set the constraintfor the closely packed classes based on a linear interpolation between these two points. Our chosen y -intercept for this constraint is slightly greater than the theoretical y -intercept from the interpolation, allowing triangles with small deviations from the perfect packing geometry to be classified as closely packed while still ensuring classification of sliver triangles as no packing.

### Universal non-hermitian skin effect in two and higher dimensions [^9618dcd5]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 3
The corner-skin effect and the geometry-dependent-skin effect.

The universal skin effect can be further classified into two types by the current functional, that is, non-reciprocal skin effect (∃ α, n, J α [n] ≠ 0) and generalized reciprocal skin effect (∀ α, n, J α [n] = 0). CSE (a)–(d) and GDSE (e)-(h) are representatives of these two types of skin effects, respectively. In (a, b, e, f), the light blue regions represent the spectrum under periodic boundary, where 200*200 k -grid is used, and the red points represent the eigenvalues under different open-boundary geometries. The system size under square geometry in (c, g) is L x × L y = 60 × 60, and each triangle geometry in (d, h) has the same right-angled side length L x = L y = 60. The spatial distributions of eigenstates W (x) are plotted in (c, d, g, h) with the color bars. In the system with GDSE, the skin effect disappears under square geometry (geometry 1) in (g), and reappears under triangle geometry (geometry 2) in (h).

Methods

Experimental methods

Samples preparation: Before each penetration experiment, the granular medium was stirred by hand vigorously for 60 s. Then the free surface was flattened carefully by passing a trowel across it. Finally, two bubble levels were placed perpendicularly to one another to determine flatness of the surface. The same person prepared all samples to minimised personal variability. The penetration speed was controlled by a servo system to an accuracy of ± 0.5% and displacement precision 0.001 mm. The resistance force was measured by a sensor to accuracy of ± 0.5% and recorded by a software at sampling frequency of 20 Hz. The intruder was positioned about 3 mm above the flat surface and accelerated to reach a constant speed before it touched the granular surface. For flat-bottomed intruder, recording of the vertical resistance force and displacement started the instant the axial force exceeded 0.03 N, which was defined as the beginning of penetration. After checking that the data was independent of velocity (see Fig. 1), all the data was collected at an intrusion velocity of 30 mm min −1. Each experiment was carried out on a number of freshly prepared samples. The sample sizes for the experiments shown in Fig. 2, were: 13, 26, and 27, for the glass beads types 1–3, respectively, 26 for the sand, and 21 for the millet. For Fig. 3, we measured the intrusion force on three samples for each cross-section. The error bars represent the standard deviation over the samples and the fits qualities were: R 2 > 0.997, 0.992, 0.998, and 0.993, respectively, for the square, rectangle, equilateral triangle, and right-angle triangle. Similarly, the measurements on the non-cylindrical intruders, shown in Fig. 7, were taken on three samples for each of the four experiments, with the error bars in the figure also representing the standard deviation over the samples. The fits qualities in these cases were: R 2 > 0.991, 0.993, 0.993, and 0.995, respectively, for: (i) cones with four different head angles penetrating into glass beads type 2; (ii) same as (i) but into glass beads type 3; (iii) spheres of four different radii penetrating into glass beads type 2; (iv) same as (iii) but into glass beads type 3.

### The representation of geometric cues in infancy [^3bf27a75]. Infancy (2008). Low credibility.

There is evidence that, from an early age, humans are sensitive to spatial information such as simple landmarks and the size of objects. This study concerns the ability to represent a particular kind of spatial information, namely, the geometry of an enclosed layout-an ability present in older children, adults, and nonhuman animals (e.g. Cheng, 1986; Hermer & Spelke, 1996). Using a looking-time procedure, 4.5- to 6.5-month-olds were tested on whether they could distinguish among the corners of an isosceles triangle. On each trial, the target corner was marked by a red dot. The stimulus (triangle with dot) appeared from different orientations across trials, ensuring that only cues related to the triangle itself could be used to differentiate the corners. When orientations were highly variable, infants discriminated the unique corner (i.e., the corner with the smaller angle and two equal-length sides) from a nonunique corner; they could not discriminate between the two nonunique corners. With less variable orientations, however, infants did discriminate between the nonunique corners of the isosceles triangle. Implications for how infants represent geometric cues are discussed.

### Triangular backgrounds shift the bias of line bisection performance in hemispatial neglect [^0f332b29]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with left neglect on line bisection show normal implicit sensitivity to manipulations of both the stimulus and the visual background. Three experiments were designed to define this sensitivity more exactly.

Methods

Normal controls and patients with left neglect performed a series of horizontal line bisection tasks. Independent variables were the configurations of the backgrounds for the line-rectangle, square, circle, left and right pointing isosceles triangles-and whether the background was the shape of the piece of paper or an outline drawn on a standard piece of paper. In a separate experiment different components of the triangle were outlined on a piece of paper. Deviation from true midpoint was calculated.

Results

Simply placing the target lines in a symmetric background such as a square or circle did not reliably reduce neglect. A triangle asymmetric in the horizontal plane caused a shift in bisection away from the triangle's vertex. With right pointing triangles the perceived midpoint shifted to the left of true centre (crossed over). The effects of the triangles were comparable in the patients and the controls when controlled for baseline bisection bias. The critical components of the triangles were the angular legs. This effect of background was not influenced by lesion site or by hemianopia.

Conclusions

Patients with left visual neglect remain sensitive to covert manipulations of the visual background that implicitly shift the perceived midpoint of a horizontal line. This effect is strong enough to eliminate neglect on a bisection task. The mechanism of this effect is expressed through preattentive visual capacities.

### A general method for the creation of dilational surfaces [^6025b588]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Dilational structures can change in size without changing their shape. Current dilational designs are only suitable for specific shapes or curvatures and often require parts of the structure to move perpendicular to the dilational surface, thereby occupying part of the enclosed volume. Here, we present a general method for creating dilational structures from arbitrary surfaces (2-manifolds with or without boundary), where all motions are tangent to the described surface. The method consists of triangulating the target curved surface and replacing each of the triangular faces by pantograph mechanisms according to a tiling algorithm that avoids collisions between neighboring pantographs. Following this algorithm, any surface can be made to mechanically dilate and could, theoretically, scale from the fully expanded configuration down to a single point. We illustrate the method with three examples of increasing complexity and varying Gaussian curvature.

### Collective self-caging of active filaments in virtual confinement [^e95cab44]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

For shapes with straight edges and convex corners, as in regular polygons, curvature is focused to singular points. Also for these cases (Fig. 4 d–g), accumulation at the boundaries is systematically observed. In addition, the corner angle determines the local nematic order pattern formed by the accumulated filaments. For obtuse angles down to right angles (see the trapezoid and square in Fig. 4 d, e), the filament bundles bend to follow the edge, leaving a slight gap right in the corner. For acute angles (see the trapezoid, triangle and teardrop in Fig. 4 e–g), however, filaments splice into the corner. The resulting splay deformation pattern then leads to a sudden reversal of the direction of rotation of the nematic order along the mask edge (Fig. 4 a). In both simulations and experiments, the corner angle at which the filament deformation transitions from bend to splay is found to be about 90 ∘.

To quantitatively relate the geometry of the virtual confinement to the morphology of the bacterial pattern, we consider the winding number associated with the circulation of the filament orientation along the boundary of the illuminated region. Since a bend (splay) deformation corresponds to a rotation of the filament pattern by an angle π − α (− α) at a vertex with opening angle α (Fig. 4 a), simple geometric arguments predict that the total rotation along a closed curve defining the boundary is given by 2 π w, where the winding number isHere, n a stands for the number of acute angles in the polygon (details in "Methods"). As shown in Fig. 4, Equation (2) is verified for all shapes previously described, so that the structure of the colony is fully determined by the geometry of the illumination pattern. Namely, in the absence of acute angles w = 1 (Figs. 1 c, d and 4 b, d), while for the flattened ellipse of Fig. 4 c the two apices with high local curvature behave similarly to acute angles, leading to w = 0. A zero winding number is also obtained for trapezoids (Fig. 4 e), while equilateral triangles and teardrop-like shapes give rise toand, respectively (Fig. 4 f, g). Note that, as convex polygons satisfy n a ≤ 3, the shapes displayed in Fig. 4 cover all possible values of w.

### Automated sequence design of 2D wireframe DNA origami with honeycomb edges [^94f07e1b]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Precisely controlled vertex angles

The ability to control angles between edges intersecting at a vertex is an important challenge for the precise design of wireframe origami architectures. To evaluate the ability of METIS to control 2D vertex angles we created two simple objects with a radius of a circumscribed circle of 25 nm — a triangle and a hexagon without any internal mesh structure to reinforce it (Fig. 3a, b, Supplementary Fig. 15, and Supplementary Table 2). For DX-based triangular and hexagonal objects, AFM and TEM imaging confirmed the successful assembly of these structures with high yield (Supplementary Figs. 16–19), but most structures presented rounded and smooth overall shapes with excessive flexibility leading to highly contorted configurations, as may be anticipated due to the bare 50 nm persistence length of DNA that is on the order of the edge lengths themselves. As a consequence, DX-based hexagonal origami objects without internal meshes are structurally unstable and unable to maintain prescribed angles between the two crossing arms at each vertex for the 74-bp edge-length object examined. In contrast, AFM and TEM showed successful formation of the target triangle and hexagon using 6HB edges and multiway connections crossing the vertex, with full-field images revealing accurate angles between arms and a high rate of proper formation (Supplementary Figs. 20–24). We also measured quantitatively vertex angles from each DNA origami particle in TEM images, with internal angle distributions showing a significantly, three-fold lower standard deviation of the 6HB-based triangle compared with the DX-based triangle, and the DX- versus 6HB-based hexagon exhibiting a similar fold improvement of ~2.5-fold (Fig. 3a, b; right). Lower standard deviations in internal angles observed for triangular versus non-triangular objects are likely attributable to the intrinsically greater mechanical stiffness associated with triangular objects. We further applied our procedure to design and synthesize 6HB-based square and octagon objects with a radius of a circumscribed circle of 25 nm (Fig. 3c, d). TEM showed successful formation of designed target objects at the single-particle level (Supplementary Figs. 25–28) for both structures. We measured internal angles of the 6HB-based square DNA origami from TEM images, showing a slightly lower standard deviation than that of the 6HB-based hexagonal DNA origami. To evaluate the stability of programmed internal vertex angles, we also removed four staples on one edge of the triangle where three scaffold double-crossovers exist (Supplementary Fig. 29). TEM imaging revealed an opening of the now-unconstrained vertices, suggesting that strain may be present at the vertices to force them to open beyond their programmed 60 degrees. We also evaluated the roles of vertex design parameters to examine their impact on vertex angle, choosing 0.42 nm per unpaired nucleotide by default in both the scaffold and staple loop (Supplementary Figs. 29–31).

### Shaping micro-clusters via inverse jamming and topographic close-packing of microbombs [^7662020f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Programming the degrees of freedom in topographic clusters

Empirically, the final clusters can be programmed by the number of seeds (N = 1, 2, 3,…) and the number of vertices of the well (V = 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for circles, triangles, squares, pentagons, and hexagons, respectively) providing topographic confinement. As shown in Fig. 5a, we analyzed over 2000 clusters. In the confinement of N = 1, single-cell particles could be created by filling the microwell, imitating the shape of the confinement. For N > 1, the differentiated cleavages were symmetric when k = V / N yielded an integer k, i.e. (V, N) = (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2), (6, 2), and (6, 3). Otherwise, clusters with random microbomb assembly were observed. Regarding the orientation of the constituent cells, the (6, 2) combination, for example, could program two types of symmetric clusters: one with a cleavage wall normal to one of the 6 edges where the interior angle of a unit is 3 π (marked as a black line), and the other containing two isosceles trapezoids (internal angle is 2 π) shares the space diagonally (marked as a blue line). In addition, it is important to note that since there are no predictable cues for the cleavage orientation in the case of the singularity (V = 0), the perfect programming of clusters (100%) for all cases of N is warranted from the non-pinning mobility in confinement. The SEM images in Fig. 5b, c reveal the hollow nature of the clusters from a triangular prism (Fig. 5b) and a cube with a cleavage connecting four cells (Fig. 5c) after focused ion beam (FIB) milling. At room temperature, the shell became glassy again, and thus the microbombs could maintain the packed shape permanently.

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

Triangle: ground-state degeneracy

Theoretical determination of ground states

The presence of the short-range L-J interaction results in two isotopic unit-cell dimer structures with exactly the same potential energy, splitting from the original one for the dense packing scheme of the hard regular triangle, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. Either type of the isotopes can be spatially duplicated to form the crystalline morphology in Fig. 2b, in which each unit-cell is composed of two neighboring monomers colored differently according to their body-orientations, as shown in the upper part of Fig. 2c. The spatial arrangement of unit-cells is shown in the lower part of Fig. 2c, which is a rhombic crystal phase, (, is smaller thanbut larger than) different from the crystalline structure of the hard triangular systemdue to the existence of the L-J balls.

### The oval female facial shape – A study in beauty [^b537c6f8]. Dermatologic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Our understanding of who is beautiful seems to be innate but has been argued to conform to mathematical principles and proportions. One aspect of beauty is facial shape that is gender specific. In women, an oval facial shape is considered attractive.

Objective

To study the facial shape of beautiful actors, pageant title winners, and performers across ethnicities and in different time periods and to construct an ideal oval shape based on the average of their facial shape dimensions.

Methods

Twenty-one full-face photographs of purportedly beautiful female actors, performers, and pageant winners were analyzed and an oval constructed from their facial parameters.

Results

Only 3 of the 21 faces were totally symmetrical, with the most larger in the left upper and lower face. The average oval was subsequently constructed from an average bizygomatic distance (horizontal parameter) of 4.3 times their intercanthal distance (ICD) and a vertical dimension that averaged 6.3 times their ICD.

Conclusion

This average oval could be fitted to many of the individual subjects showing a smooth flow from the forehead through temples, cheeks, jaw angle, jawline, and chin with all these facial aspects abutting the oval. Where they did not abut, treatment may have improved these subjects.

### Voxel volume overlap: voxel-size sensitive indicators of subject motion in functional MRI [^af0c85b6]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

Algorithmic implementation: Comparing the moved cube to the reference cube was achieved as follows: each reference cube is described by six planes, constituting inequality constraints. Each plane is defined by one point on each surface and a corresponding norm vector, defining "inside" (and consecutively, of course, "outside"), establishing a set of six cutting planes. The reference cube is then moved, using the rigid‐body parameters from the realignment procedure. This creates the moved cube described by its eight (moved) corners and their connections, which again are vectors. The intersection of these vectors with a given cutting plane can be calculated using linear interpolation, resulting in a new set of (cut) vectors, jointly defining a new (cut) surface. The iterative application of all six cutting planes will remove all parts of the moved cube that are "outside" of the reference voxel's boundaries. The coordinates of the remaining shape can then be used to generate a convex 3D shape using Delauney triangulation. As rotations are involved, the shape may be irregular, but it is a polygon, and every polygon can be triangulated (de Berg et al.). This triangulation will yield a set of tetrahedra whose (sum of) volumes can be calculated. The volume of this remnant of the moved cube can then finally be related to the volume of the reference cube.

### Do alterations in vertebral and disc dimensions affect an elliptical model of thoracic kyphosis? [^82ddcac7]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

Mathematical modeling, using least squares method, of thoracic kyphosis was constructed as digitized points from radiographs of 50 healthy patients.

Objective

To determine a simple geometric model of the thoracic kyphosis.

Summary Of Background Data

Thoracic kyphosis is an important parameter of health, but geometric models of kyphosis are rare. Few papers report vertebral body and disc height data.

Methods

Thoracic vertebral bodies were digitized on lateral radiographs of 50 healthy patients. The average path of the posterior vertebral body corners of T1 through T12 was modeled, in the least squares sense, with a portion of an ellipse. The best-fit ellipse was sectioned with different model partitions using four sets of vertebral body heights and disc heights. Segmental and global angles derived from these four models were compared with reported values in the literature.

Results

A 72 degrees portion of an ellipse, with a minor-to-major axis ratio of 0.69, can closely approximate the path of the posterior body corners from the inferior of T1 to the superior of T12. The posterior vertebral body heights and disc heights have an average ratio of approximately 5:1. Segmental angles from T3-T4 through T11-T12 for all four models are close to other reported values. The thoracic spine has a height-to-length ratio of approximately 0.96.

Conclusions

Thoracic kyphosis from inferior-posterior T1 to superior-posterior T12 can be closely modeled (least squares error per point < 1 mm) with a 72 degrees piece of an ellipse with a minor-to-major axis ratio of 0.69. The major axis is parallel to the posterior body margin of T12, whereas the minor axis passes through the superior endplate of T12. Segmental angles derived from this elliptical modeling are in the range of values from healthy patients.

### Biphasic growth of orbital volume in Chinese children [^7a23e844]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Figure 1
CT images illustrating the method to estimate the orbital volume (A), interlateral orbital rim distance and the extent of exophthalmos (B).

The working window was set to 250×50 HU (width×height) to have high resolution. The level was set to the one having the largest diameter for both eyeballs, the centres of the crystal lens and the optic nerves showing the entire intraocular pathway, with the lateral orbital rim shown as the lowest points. All of the measurements were done on this level of scan. The interlateral orbital rim distance (IORD) is the distance between the orbital lateral edges. The distance can be measured as the line connecting the lateral side of the right orbit (point A in figure 1 B) to the lateral side of the left orbit (point B in figure 1 B). The extent of exophthalmos was calculated as the vertical distance from the corneal vertex to the line connecting the lateral sides of the two orbital rims. The distance from points C to D (figure 1 B) is the extent of exophthalmos of the right eye, and the distance from point E to F is the left eye's exophthalmos.

Statistical analysis

In this study, SPSS V.12.0 statistical software was used to perform related statistical analysis. Least-square polynomial fitting and piecewise linear fitting was used to identify the different phases in development. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was applied to compare the values from different phases of development and post hoc comparisons were conducted with a Bonferroni correction. A t-test was used to compare the values obtained from boys and girls of the same age. A paired t-test was used to compare the values measured from the left and right orbits. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The measured layer-dependent apical I–I distance fits well with the simulation results. Scale bars, 0.4 nm (left part of d – g); 0.2 nm (right part of d – g). STM setpoints: V bias = +2.3 V, I = 30 pA.

STM

The experimental atomic arrangements of the apical I atoms from n = 1 to n = 4 (Fig. 3 d– g) exfoliated RPPs were imaged by STM. All the bright protrusions are due to apical I atoms from n = 1 to n = 4 RPPs, which has been verified by the DFT calculation of LDOS and corresponding STM image simulations (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12). To our delight, the STM results verified the DFT-predicted trend of apical I–I distance of monolayer RPP structures from n = 1 to n = 4. STM shows that n = 4 RPP (Fig. 3g) has the shortest apical I–I distance of 4.55 Å, while n = 2 RPP has shorter I–I distance of 4.85 Å (Fig. 3e) than n = 3 RPP of 5.02 Å (Fig. 3f). Meanwhile, n = 1 RPP (Fig. 3d) has the largest I–I distance of 5.69 Å, which fits well with the simulated model that almost no out-of-plane tilt occurred in the surface octahedron of n = 1 RPP. These results clearly validate that the out-of-plane surface octahedral tilt is directly correlated to the I–I distance, while in-plane octahedral tilt has less correlations with it.

Occupancy, fractal dimensions, and FD differences indicate that stromal B cells are more spread out in good outcome.

a – c Occupancy: a Example image showing how occupancy is computed. A grid of squares placed over the image. (Inset) 1's (0's) correspond to yes (no) answers to a binary question asked of each square, e.g. "Is there at least one B cell in the square?" Occupancy is fraction of squares with 1's. b Plot of CD20 + B cell occupancy in stroma vs. square size for good clinical outcome (blue), poor clinical outcome (red), normal breast tissue (black) and points randomly distributed according to a uniform Poisson process with a density of 3 × 10 2 points/mm 2 (cyan). Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Good (blue) outcome curve is consistently higher than poor (red) outcome curve. c Plots showing occupancy area under the curve (AUC) for CD20 + B cells in stroma is higher for good (n = 24) vs. poor (n = 12) outcome (p = 0.05). Center line represents the median, box limits represent the upper and lower quartiles, whiskers indicate maximum and minimum values within 1.5 interquartile ranges of the upper and lower quartiles; individual points are outliers. d Fractal dimension determined from slope of the log-log plot of the number of squares with at least one stromal CD20 + B cell vs. the inverse box size (Logarithms are base e). The fractal dimension is larger for good clinical outcome vs. poor outcome at large length scales, but this trend is reversed at small length scales. At long length scales (200–600 μm on the left side of the plot), mean fractal dimension s (slope) is 1.3 for good outcome (blue), 1.11 for poor outcome (red), 0.92 for normal tissue (gray), and 2.08 for Poisson (black). The p value for good vs. poor outcome is 0.08 at long length scales. At short length scales (10–40 μm on the right side of the plot), the mean fractal dimension is 0.58 for good outcome, 0.65 for poor outcome, 0.30 for normal tissue, and 0.15 for Poisson. The p value for good vs. poor outcome is 0.5 at short length scales. Black dashed lines show least-squares linear regression fit at long and short length scales. Because different images have different overall areas, fractal dimension is calculated by normalizing the number n(L) of boxes with 1's with the total number N(L) of boxes with cells. Thus the y-axis values are negative. The error bars correspond to 95% confidence intervals. e Example illustrating how FD difference indicates whether cells are spread out or clustered. The left image with four quadrants shows four blue points that are spatially spread out in the upper two quadrants while the right image with four quadrants shows four clustered red points in the upper two quadrants. At long length scales (big boxes in left 2 quadrants), the big squares in the lower left quadrant have more 1 s in the left image than in the lower left quadrant of the right image because the blue points in the upper left quadrant are more spread out compared to the red points in the upper left quadrant of the right image, so the fractal dimension is larger in the left half of left image than in the left half of the right image. At small length scales (small boxes in 2 right quadrants), the upper right quadrants of both images have the same number of points and occupy the same number of squares; hence, the blue and red points have the same fractal dimension at small length scales. So the difference in fractal dimension between large and small length scales will be larger for the spatially dispersed blue points than for the clustered red points. f Plot showing that the FD difference for stromal CD20 + B cells is significantly higher in good outcome (p = 3 × 10 −3, ROC AUC = 0.77), indicating that B cells are more spatially dispersed in the stroma in good outcome. Center line represents the median, box limits represent the upper and lower quartiles, whiskers indicate maximum and minimum values within 1.5 interquartile ranges of the upper and lower quartiles; individual points are outliers. g RFS plot showing the clinical significance of the FD difference for stromal CD20 + B cells with a threshold value = 0.564 (see "Methods"). For all FD differences calculated in this paper, the large length scale range is 200–600 μm and the small length scale range is 10–40 μm.

The numerical cue consisted of two‐item or a nine‐item arrays, that were matched for the cumulative area occupied by the items (~8 cm 2) and their total contour length (~34.5 cm), as well as for the size of the virtual square subtended by the items (~52 cm 2). The rectangular‐shaped items composing the two‐item and the nine‐item arrays measured, respectively, 0.5 × 8.1 cm and 0.73 × 1.2 cm; they were arranged randomly within the virtual square, with their shorter side aligned with the horizontal plane. Each numerosity (i.e. 2 or 9) could appear in three different colors (yellow, green, and pink) and four orientations (two leftward, and two rightward), created by rotating the array to the right by 90° three times, which resulted in 12 different arrays per numerosity (Figure 1). On each trial, the displayed numerical cue was selected randomly from the pool of 12 arrays, and the displayed target stimulus was selected randomly from a pool of sixteen different images of a static colorful ball (1.75 cm in radius) varying in color (Figure 1). Trials were administered in blocks, each block composed of eight valid trials (i.e. left‐sided target preceded by a two‐item cue, and right‐sided target preceded by a nine‐item cue) and eight invalid trials (i.e. left‐sided target preceded by a nine‐item cue, and right‐sided target preceded by a two‐item cue). Valid and invalid trials appeared randomly, and cue numerosity and target position were equally distributed within each block. There was no restriction on the number of trial blocks presented to each participant: The experimental session terminated when the infant had looked away from the screen during five consecutive trials.

### Boundary curvature guided programmable shape-morphing kirigami sheets [^c9ce2342]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We first explore the 3D shape shifting in 2D kirigami precursors through tessellating the three basic units in Fig. 1a–c. Figure 4a shows a 2D diamond-shaped kirigami precursor composed of tessellated 2 × 2 square units with zero boundary curvature. Each unit has the same parallel cut pattern. Upon vertically stretching the 2D diamond precursor along the y -axis, both top and bottom square units pop up spontaneously (represented by the symbol of "+" in the inset of Fig. 4b) via out-of-plane buckling while the square units on two sides pop down (denoted by the symbol of "−"), generating a smiley 3D human face-like morphology (Fig. 4b). Note that both the inner and outer boundaries of an individual unit in the combinatorial design still belong to the cut boundaries following our model, both of which contribute to the geodesic curvature k gb in Eq. (1) and satisfy the Gauss–Bonnet theorem locally and globally. Specifically, the eyes and mouth in the form of a hole are formed due to its discontinuous slope (changed smoothness) at the intersections of boundaries, which results in a localized non-zero Gaussian curvature. This is also consistent with the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, where the localized non-zero Gaussian curvature arises from the localized curvature change (variation of the exterior angle in Eq. (1)) of the C 0 smooth inner and outer boundary curves of the units (Supplementary Note 3). The holes divide the face into eight independent popping regions (e.g. forehead, eyes, nose, cheek, mouth, and chin). We note that the face will not change its pattern under different loading rates. Similarly, stretching an array of 3 × 1 rectangle units with identical parallel cuts and zero boundary curvature (Fig. 4e) along the x -axis leads to a sinusoidal wavy shape (Fig. 4f) with zero Gaussian curvature. Furthermore, Fig. 4h shows that two circular units with positive boundary curvatures bridged with a biconcave unit with negative boundary curvatures form a vertically tessellated 2D precursor. Stretching the 2D precursor along the x -axis generates an increasingly enclosing 3D shape, where the two circular units pop up into a spheroidal shape with positive Gaussian curvature while the concave unit buckle into a saddle shape with negative Gaussian curvature (Fig. 4i). As the stretching strain further increases, their two end circular boundaries contact with each other, forming an encapsulated Venus flytrap-like structure (Fig. 4j) that could be used for delicate grippers, as discussed later.

Fig. 6
The modules of the Kilobot Soft Robot use their localisation estimates to identify any deviations from the reference shape (square lattice).

a, b show the set of distances and angles considered by Algorithm S1 during the lateral and longitudinal deformation tests, respectively. White and blue colours indicate modules with a symmetric and asymmetric neighbourhood, respectively. The red arrow indicates the Kilobot Soft Robot's forward direction.

Each module begins the cycle by probing for lateral deformations, and if necessary performs a corrective move (procedure CONTROL-LATERAL-DEFORMATION). The module uses any of its distance and angle variables shown in Fig. 6a. Recall that modules are divided into two groups, depending on whether their neighbourhood is left-right symmetric (P 1, P 3, P 5) or not (P 2, P 4) as illustrated using white and blue discs in Fig. 6. In the former case (lines 8–12 of Algorithm S1), the module tests whether its neighbours on the left and right are about the same distance away, and, where this is not the case, turns towards the neighbour further away. In the latter case (lines 13–21), the module resides in the left or right boundary. The module compares the distance of its (sole) lateral neighbour against a reference value, while also evaluating a lateral angle against a reference value of. For hexagonal lattice configurations, depending on the robot's default heading with respect to the lattice, would be 120° (see lateral angles in Fig. S2a) or 60° (see lateral angles in Fig. S2b).

Common Volume Geometric Methods Used in the Clinic

Composite midpoint integration method

The commonly used composite midpoint integration method applies to parallel stacks of short‐axis image planes that, ideally, encompass the entire extent of the LV from the mitral valve annulus to the apex (Figure 1). The LVV is estimated by multiplying the observed cavity area on each slice, A, times the slice thickness, h, to get the volume contribution of each slice, and summing these over all slices (Eqn. 1 in Figure 1). This "stack of disks" approach is also commonly referred to as the Simpson's Rule; however, in mathematics the Simpson's Rule refers specifically to integration using quadric polynomials. 22 In this article, the in‐plane cavity area was computed numerically from the user‐selected LV endocardial contour, but in the clinic is often approximated from 1 or 2 user‐defined diameter measurements and a circular or elliptical model for the in‐plane area. A common variant implemented by Wyatt et al 17 models the most apical aspect of the LV as a hemisphere that emanates from the bottom half of the most apical slice (Eqn. 2 in Figure 1).

Experimental data.

a Schematic of hyperbolic tessellation (left half) with the unit circle in blue and the circle with radius r 0 = 0.94 in red, and photograph of the electric circuit (right half). b Measurement of impedance to ground Z a of the circuit at node a as a function of input frequency f for different nodes (see inset legend and panel a for an identification of the nodes). Each impedance peak indicates an eigenmode at that corresponding frequency, which can be excited at the corresponding input node. The highest six frequencies are indicated by vertical gray lines and the corresponding eigenmodes are shown in c. c Measurement of the voltage profile of the first six eigenmodes (only one mode is shown for each pair of degenerate modes). The saturation encodes the magnitude as a fraction of the voltage (white denotes 0 and full saturation 1) at the input node (black dots), and the color encodes the phase relative to the reference voltage (see legend).

In the long-wavelength-regime, eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix can be associated with eigenmodes of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the continuum. We match them by systematically determining the absolute value of the angular momentum ℓ of the eigenvectors by a Fourier transform of their components on the outermost sites. Due to the discreteness of the lattice, this analysis is only reliable for modes with sufficiently small ℓ and n, i.e. in the long-wavelength limit. Note that while the Laplacian matrix is defined purely on the graph, to define angular momentum we need to interpret the graph as a regular lattice, i.e. identify the vertices with lattice sites. But, as mentioned above, the (relative) positions of those sites are uniquely defined by the graph via the values of p and q. We extract the angular momentum dispersion for the chosen tessellation, and in Fig. 2 b compare it to the corresponding Euclidean {3, 6} tessellation with the same number of sites. As in the continuum, a strong spectral reordering is observed. This reordering is a universal feature of the spatial curvature and does, therefore, not rely on the details of the tessellation, as long as it adequately approximates the continuum.

### Two-edge-resolved three-dimensional non-line-of-sight imaging with an ordinary camera [^4fae72db]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Through simple geometric calculations, the azimuth and elevation angles of a hidden scene point can be estimated from the slope and height of the illuminated right trapezoidal region of the observation. However, spatially extended hidden scenes do not create sharp shadows. They instead produce a superposition thereof, that is dependent on the geometry of the scene from the vantage of the observed ceiling portion, appearing as a region of highly informative penumbra(see Fig. 2 a for an example photograph of penumbra). The penumbra region encodes information about the geometry of the hidden scene from the perspective of the ceiling, along two dimensions (i.e. in azimuth and elevation angles). Efficiently extracting this information for reconstructing a general spatially extended scene is achievable through a computational algorithm presented later on.

### High-dimensional topographic organization of visual features in the primate temporal lobe [^47516ebc]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Feature selection

To identify the most explanatory features, a feature selection procedure was employed. First, the feature with the largest squared cosine angle in Fig. 3c was selected. We then added one feature at a time to optimize the total explained proportion of neural responses at each step. New features are required to be dissimilar from the ones that have already been selected (cosine angle < 0.5) in order to ensure that they are largely independent of one another. The selected features were orthogonalized to each other using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization before adding up the squared cosine angles between the visual and the neural features. To determine the optimal number of features, we used a half-split approach: the 25D feature of one location estimated using half the data was fitted with the selected features by projecting the neural features into the subspace spanned by these interpretable features, and then the feature of the other half was compared to the fit (Fig. 3d). The following index was used to quantify the goodness-of-fit (GOF):whereis the 25D preferred feature estimated using the 2nd half of the data, is the projection of the 1st half's preferred feature into the subspace spanned by the selected features (andindicate the selected features in Fig. 3d). The index was computed for each location and then averaged across all locations. Note that this index will be the same as the squared cosine angle whenequals to. We didn't use the squared cosine angle betweenanddirectly as GOF, because the polarity ofshould be important for the quality of fitting but would be ignored by the computation of the squared cosine angle. Half of the data used for model training was also used for the feature selection procedure. 500 iterations of half-splitting were performed and the results were averaged. A noise ceiling was also estimated. The preferred feature of the 1st half of the data was directly used to fit that of the 2nd half:Based on a computational simulation (Fig. S5a), we found that this value would underestimate the true noise ceiling, which is the GOF achieved by the ground truth. Therefore, a correction was made using the estimated relationship between the two (black line in Fig. S5a). Overall, we found seven features performed the best, accounting for 56.3% of the neural features after being normalized by the noise ceiling. Although the exact ordering might differ, the same seven features were identified in 97% of half splits. The actual ordering reported in Fig. 3 is based on the full data. Besides these features, we extracted additional feature dimensions from the neural data, by first orthogonalizing the neural features with respect to the top seven features, and then performing principal component analysis on the orthogonalized features. Since our goal here is to extract dimensions that best align with the preferred features, rather than those that explain the differences between them, both the orthogonalized features and their opposites (-orthogonalized features) were pooled for PCA. Adding two principal components to the seven features performed the best in explaining the neural features, with 82.5% of the noise ceiling. Again, the procedure was performed in the first half of the data and tested on the second half.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Pulmonary valve — Preprocedure assessment should describe the pulmonary root components, including the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), the pulmonary valve, the interleaflet triangles, and the pulmonary sinuses of Valsalva; significant pulmonary valve pathology can be present in carcinoid syndrome, endocarditis, and congenital diseases such as repaired tetralogy of Fallot or congenital pulmonary valve stenosis. The assessment should include leaflet morphology and motion, annular size, valve/leaflet symmetry, and leaflet integrity, and the dimensions, size, and function of a normal, native pulmonary valve are particularly important when a Ross procedure or a transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement is planned; the pulmonary valve can be imaged at the upper esophageal (UE), ME, and TG views as recommended in published ASE guidelines.

### Essential information on surgical heart valve characteristics for optimal valve prosthesis selection: expert consensus document from the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery (EACTS)-the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)-American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS) valve labelling task force [^5d0f48a3]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Mechanical surgical heart valve (SHV) dimensions and labeling — The Task Force suggests that manufacturers use a complete, standardized set of physical dimensions and a standardized pictogram when describing their surgical heart valves. To emphasize labeling clarity, manufacturers should always present 'labeled valve size' as a separate variable when presenting the physical dimensions of SHVs, and surgeons should similarly realize that the corresponding valve size is simply a label, and not a true measure of the valve size. Labeled valve size reflects the manufacturer's recommendation into which annulus an SHV can be safely implanted and pictorially represents tissue annulus diameter ranges defined by the valve-related tubular sizers; the lower margin is the diameter of the largest valve-related tubular sizer that fits the annulus, and the upper margin is indirectly bordered by the diameter of the sizer 1 size larger (the sizer that does not fit). Because the margins of these tissue annulus ranges were not defined in the corresponding ISO standards and can vary for different SHV models having the same labeled valve size, this historical lack of standardization renders the direct comparison of different SHVs based on labeled valve size impossible, precludes the exclusive use of a universal sizing tool, limits standard sizing and ultimately causes confusion in the surgical community. For transparency, it is necessary to disclose the margins of these 'tissue annulus ranges', which can be accomplished by disclosing the actual diameters of the tubular ends of the valve-related sizers to clarify into which patients a specific SHV is 'intended to be implanted'; because replica sizers can differ slightly from the corresponding SHV due to material properties, this should be considered during intraoperative sizing.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^f4124a5b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The main problem in network design is fundamentally different. We are given the density of population and we are looking for the network that minimizes some objective function involving some average time, in general (although other choices are possible, see for example). In this setting, there are usually two different transport modes, a slow one representing for example cars on the road network, and a fast one representing the subway or some rapid transit network. The natural framework here is then the one of multiplex networks comprising two different transportation networks, one known while the structure of the second one is to be determined (for multiplexes in the context of optimization see for example). A practical realization of this problem concerns the specific case of subways (for a network analysis of subways, see for example,–). In most large cities, a subway system has been built and later enlarged, with current total lengths varying from a few kilometers to a few hundred kilometers. The geometry of these networks, as its total length increases, varies from simple lines to more complex shapes with loops for larger networks. In particular, for the largest networks, convergence to a structure with a well-connected central core and branches reaching out to suburbs has been observed.

Algorithmic aspects of network design have been studied within computational geometry (e.g.chapter 9) and location science (e.g.and references therein), and some simpler problems of this type have been addressed previously. For instance, the problem of the quickest access between an area and a given point was discussed in. In network science, the optimization problem is traditionally recast as a navigation problem in lattices with long-range connections. However, our specific question – optimal network topologies as a function of population distribution and network length – is largely an open problem. In, some results were obtained in two-dimensional systems by comparing a priori defined optimal network configurations. First, it was shown that, if the goal is reaching a single point in the plane, then the optimal network is necessarily a tree. Second, the paper hinted at the possibility of the existence of transitions between optimal configurations when the length of the network changes. More precisely, it has been shown that as the length of the network increases resources go preferentially to radial branches and that there is a sharp transition at a critical value of the length where a loop appears.

### Seeing around corners with edge-resolved transient imaging [^1207e4b9]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging is a rapidly growing field seeking to form images of objects outside the field of view, with potential applications in autonomous navigation, reconnaissance, and even medical imaging. The critical challenge of NLOS imaging is that diffuse reflections scatter light in all directions, resulting in weak signals and a loss of directional information. To address this problem, we propose a method for seeing around corners that derives angular resolution from vertical edges and longitudinal resolution from the temporal response to a pulsed light source. We introduce an acquisition strategy, scene response model, and reconstruction algorithm that enable the formation of 2.5-dimensional representations-a plan view plus heights-and a 180 ∘ field of view for large-scale scenes. Our experiments demonstrate accurate reconstructions of hidden rooms up to 3 meters in each dimension despite a small scan aperture (1.5-centimeter radius) and only 45 measurement locations.

### Multiple tipping points and optimal repairing in interacting networks [^48be4231]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The problem of optimal repairing

Knowing and understanding the phase diagram of interacting networks enable us to answer some fundamental and practical questions. A partially or completely collapsed system of n ≥ 2 interacting networks in which some of them are in the low activity state is a scenario common in medicine, for example, when diseases or traumas affect the human body and a few organs are simultaneously damaged and need to be treated, and the interaction between the organs is critical. It is also common in economics, when two or more coupled sectors of the economyexperience simultaneous problems, or when a few geographical clusters of countries experience economic difficulties. The practical question that arises is: what is the most efficient strategy to repair such a system? Many approaches are possible if resources are unlimited, but this is usually not the case and we would like to minimize the resources that we spend in the repairing process.

For simplicity, consider two interacting networks, both damaged (low activity). Is repairing both networks simultaneously the more efficient approach, or repairing them one after the other? What is the minimum amount of repair needed to make the system fully functional again? In other words, what is the minimum number of nodes we need to repair, to bring the system to the functional 11 ('up–up') state, and how do we allocate repairs between the two networks? An optimal repairing strategy is essential when resources needed for repairing are limited or very expensive, when the time to repair the system is limited, or when the damage is still progressing through the system, threatening further collapse, and a quick and efficient intervention is needed.

We show below that this problem is equivalent to finding the minimum Manhattan distance between the point in the phase diagram where the damaged system is currently situated and the recovery transition lines to the 11 region. The Manhattan distance between two points is defined as the sum of absolute horizontal and vertical components of the vector connecting the points, with defined vertical and horizontal directions. It is a driving distance between two points in a rectangular grid of streets and avenues. In our phase diagram, it is equal to. It turns out that two triple points of the phase diagram play a very important role in this fundamental problem. We find that these special points have a direct practical meaning and are not just a topological or thermodynamic curiosity.

### Voxel volume overlap: voxel-size sensitive indicators of subject motion in functional MRI [^5d16f703]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

When calculating subject motion, it is important to be precise about the respective reference frame. If motion is calculated w.r.t. the first image in a timeseries, this measure is known as total displacement (TD). It describes how far away from the original position a subject moved in the course of the session. This, however, is not necessarily the most relevant measure, as slow movements are more easily accounted for than rapid motion spikes (Maknojia et al.). For the latter in particular, scan‐to‐scan displacement (STS) is more relevant, which uses the individually preceding volume as the reference frame. The way these two indicators are calculated is similar, using a 3D expansion of Pythagoras theorem (Wilke) to calculate the joint displacement resulting from all shifts and all rotations.

2.1 Open Questions

While it is trivial to estimate the volumetric effects of simple shifts (see example in the introduction), it is far from trivial to account for rotations as there is a multitude of possible rotatory effects, and their combinations, on a 3D volume. Computing the exact overlap between two arbitrarily‐rotated cubic volumes, therefore, is mathematically highly challenging. However, while no elegant algebraic solution exists, it is possible to assess the overlap by using a geometric approach. Here, the reference voxel is defined as the intersection of six planar boundaries, with each plane dividing space into two categories: "definitely outside" and "potentially inside"; the intersection of all "potentially inside" volumes then unequivocally defines the cube. For example, consider a dice on a table and its top surface showing, for example, "1". Everything above that surface is outside of the dice, while everything below may be inside. The lower (opposite) surface will then be defined by the face of the dice showing "6", which in our example is facing the table. Again, everything below that surface is outside. Repeating this process of exclusion with the "4 & 3" and the "2 & 5" faces will unequivocally define the space, and hence, the volume of the dice. The intersection of a moved cube with a reference cube can therefore be calculated by iteratively looping over all six planes (of the reference cube) and by therewith removing all "definitely outside" sections (of the moved cube). The remaining part constitutes the overlapping remnant of the moved cube, the volume of which can then be computed.

First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^79b1194c]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic assessment of right atrial (RA) size — volume by 2D describes that "2D volumetric measurements are usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface on the apical four-chamber view" and that "At the tricuspid valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the tricuspid ring with a straight line". It adds, "Volumes can be computed by using either the single plane area-length" or "the disks summation technique", performed in a "2D view". The listed advantage is "More representative of actual RA size than linear dimensions", while limitations include "Assumes a symmetrical shape of the cavity", "Single plane volume calculation may be inaccurate since it assumes that RA enlargement is symmetrical", and "Normal values not well established".

### Universality in long-distance geometry and quantum complexity [^47f080b3]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

A careful analysis, confirms this picture and shows that the very largest additive discrepancy from thedistance is found near the cut locus, so for all U and, As, theandBerger spheres agree on distances to within a picometre. (A two-dimensional example that shows the same phenomenon is given in Supplementary Information 3).

Finally, let us examine the role of curvature. At large, the metric becomes strongly curved: the easy–easy section becomes very negatively curved, and the easy–hard sections become very positively curved. We call the σ x and σ y directions easy because they are cheap to move it, whereas the σ z direction is hard to move in for. The curvature length, which is also the distance to the cut locus in the hard direction, becomes very short. The high curvature explains how the metric can hide lots of volume at short distances that are invisible at long distances. Consider an operational definition of volume that counts how many marbles can be packed into the space: if we can cram in n (r) marbles each of radius r, then the volume is proportional to. Although the volume grows without bound as, the effective volume n (r) r 3 at any finite value of r does not. Instead, the effective volume grows like r −1 as we take r smaller and only levels off atonce r is less than the curvature length. Thus even asthe effective volume, as probed by experiments with finite resolution, stays finite.

Euclidean group

Consider parallel parking a unicycle.

The unicycle starts facing parallel to the curb and ends facing parallel to the curb but displaced sideways by z. The configuration space of the unicycle is its possible locations { y, z } and orientations { θ }, forming the Euclidean group SE(2). There are three primitive operations: roll forwards or backwards; turn; or drift sideways (perpendicular to the rolling direction). We model the difficulty of any parking manoeuvre withThe cost of parkingis the length ∫d s of the shortest path that connects our starting configuration { θ, y, z } = {0, 0, 0} to our parking spot {0, 0, z }.

### Automatic left and right lung separation using free-formed surface fitting on volumetric CT [^90a3ae6b]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

This study presents a completely automated method for separating the left and right lungs using free-formed surface fitting on volumetric computed tomography (CT). The left and right lungs are roughly divided using iterative 3-dimensional morphological operator and a Hessian matrix analysis. A point set traversing between the initial left and right lungs is then detected with a Euclidean distance transform to determine the optimal separating surface, which is then modeled from the point set using a free-formed surface-fitting algorithm. Subsequently, the left and right lung volumes are smoothly and directly separated using the separating surface. The performance of the proposed method was estimated by comparison with that of a human expert on 44 CT examinations. For all data sets, averages of the root mean square surface distance, maximum surface distance, and volumetric overlap error between the results of the automatic and the manual methods were 0.032 mm, 2.418 mm, and 0.017%, respectively. Our study showed the feasibility of automatically separating the left and right lungs by identifying the 3D continuous separating surface on volumetric chest CT images.

### Biomechanics of the rhombic transposition flap [^3fd68e09]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a computational model of cutaneous wound closures comparing variations of the rhombic transposition flap.

Study Design

A nonlinear hyperelastic finite element model of human skin was developed and used to assess flap biomechanics in simulated rhombic flap wound closures as flap geometric parameters were varied.

Setting

In silico.

Methods

The simulation incorporated variables of transposition angle, flap width, and tissue undermining. A 2-dimensional second-order Yeoh hyperelastic model was fit to published experimental skin data. Resultant stress and strain fields as well as local surface changes were evaluated.

Results

For the rhombus defect, closure stress and strain were minimized for the transposition flap with a distal flap angle of 30° by recruiting skin from opposing sides of the defect. Alteration of defect dimensions showed that peak stress and principal strain were minimized with a square defect. Likelihood of a standing cutaneous deformity was driven by the magnitude of angle closure at the flap base. Manipulation of the transposition angle reoriented the primary skin strain vector. Asymmetric undermining decoupled wound closure tension from strain, with direct effects on boundary deformation.

Conclusions

The model demonstrates that flap width determines the degree of secondary tissue movement and impact on surrounding tissues. Transposition angle determines the orientation of maximal strain. Local flap design requires consideration of multiple factors apart from idealized biomechanics, including adjacent "immobile" structures, scar location, local skin thickness, and orientation of relaxed skin tension lines. Finite element models can be used to analyze local flap closures to optimize outcomes.

### International consensus statement on nomenclature and classification of the congenital bicuspid aortic valve and its aortopathy, for clinical, surgical, interventional and research purposes [^4d3a4b64]. European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Aortic root complex in bicuspid aortic valve — anatomy and terminology: Functionally, 3 elements form the aortic root complex that determine physiological valve dynamics, namely the sinotubular junction (STJ), the aortic sinuses with the crown-like attachment line of the aortic valve cusps, and the aortic annulus, which is a virtual circular line inside the left ventricular outflow tract running through the nadir of the aortic cusps and the respective bases of the inter-cusp triangles. The tract of the proximal aorta spanning from the STJ to the brachiocephalic-artery take-off should be referred to as the tubular ascending aorta or the ascending aorta, and the subsequent tract from the brachiocephalic artery to the isthmus is called the aortic arch. The distance between the ventriculo-aortic junction and the virtual annulus levels is reported as variable and usually greater in BAV than in the normal aortic valve, particularly in the right coronary sinus.

### The shape of the distal femur: a geometrical study using MRI [^09c76117]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2014). Low credibility.

We scanned 25 left knees in healthy human subjects using MRI. Multiplanar reconstruction software was used to take measurements of the inferior and posterior facets of the femoral condyles and the trochlea. A 'basic circle' can be defined which, in the sagittal plane, fits the posterior and inferior facets of the lateral condyle, the posterior facet of the medial condyle and the floor of the groove of the trochlea. It also approximately fits both condyles in the coronal plane (inferior facets) and the axial plane (posterior facets). The circle fitting the inferior facet of the medial condyle in the sagittal plane was consistently 35% larger than the other circles and was termed the 'medial inferior circle'. There were strong correlations between the radii of the circles, the relative positions of the centres of the condyles, the width of the condyles, the total knee width and skeletal measurements including height. There was poor correlation between the radii of the circles and the position of the trochlea relative to the condyles. In summary, the condyles are approximately spherical except for the inferior facet medially, which has a larger radius in the sagittal plane. The size and position of the condyles are consistent and change with the size of the person. However, the position of the trochlea is variable even though its radius is similar to that of the condyles. This information has implications for understanding anterior knee pain and for the design of knee replacements.

Left atrial (LA) linear and area measurements — the most widely used linear dimension is the anteroposterior (AP) measurement in the parasternal long-axis using M-mode or, preferably, two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE), but the AP linear dimension should not be used as the sole measure of LA size; LA area can be planimetered in apical four- and two-chamber views, and optimal contours should be obtained while avoiding foreshortening.

### A refined hemispheric model of normal human aortic valve and root geometry [^dfd67878]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Better understanding of aortic root geometry could improve diagnosis and reconstruction of pathologic aortic valves. In this study, a previous model of hemispheric aortic valve leaflets nested within a cylindrical aorta was refined in humans with normal aortic valves.

Methods

Using 1-mm axial slices, high-resolution computed tomographic angiograms from 10 normal aortic roots were used to generate high-density X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates of valve structures using Mathematica software. Three-dimensional least squares regression analyses of leaflet and sinus coordinates were employed to compare multiple geometric models of aortic valve and root geometry. Shapes and dimensions of all root structures were evaluated and compared.

Results

Aortic valve geometry was roughly hemispherical, but the valve base was elliptical (minor-major diameter ratio = .66). Dimensional fits of the leaflet-sinus complexes also were better using ellipsoidal geometry, with taller leaflets than predicted by hemispheres. The commissure between the left and noncoronary cusps was located uniformly at the posterior junction of the base minor diameter and circumference, with the center of the right coronary cusp opposite. The subcommissural post areas flared outward by 5° to 10°, and the volume of the right coronary leaflet-sinus complex was 12.4% and 10.7% larger than the noncoronary cusps and left cusps, respectively.

Conclusions

The normal human aortic valve is an elliptical structure, and ellipsoidal refinements improve representation of leaflet geometry. The left and noncoronary cusps commissure is located posteriorly; the right coronary cusp is located anteriorly. This model could be useful in quantifying pathologic geometry and in engineering devices for aortic valve reconstruction.

### Four-dimensional computed tomography analysis of bicuspid aortic valves [^fa5c9992]. JTCVS Techniques (2024). Medium credibility.

The software allows calculation of geometric features, including 3D and projected 2D parameters. To calculate the AA area in 3D, triangles were formed between 2 consecutive points on the spline in 3D, delineating the border of the annulus and the AA centroid of the 18 seed points. The AA area was then calculated as the sum of each triangle's area. The perimeter was estimated as the length of the interpolated spline in 3D. For 2D measurements, a best-fit plane was adjusted to the 18 seed points of each time phase using a principal component analysis approach. AA area was estimated in 2D, projecting the spline points into the best-fit plane. The height of the annulus was estimated as the sum of distances of the farthest points on the 3D spline describing the AA below and above the best-fit plane. The longest distance between each pair of opposite points around the TA was adopted as the maximal diameter value, and the distance between the pair of points orthogonal to the maximal diameter was called orthogonal to maximal diameter. The eccentricity index was calculated using the following formula:

Statistical Analysis

Analyses were done using SPSS 26.0 (IBM). Continuous variables were reported as mean ± SD, and their normality of distribution was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Comparisons between 3D and 2D areas, perimeters, and diameters were performed using the 2-tailed t test. Comparisons for categorical data were performed using the χ 2 test. Statistical significance between parameters was defined as P < .05.

### Coherent movement of error-prone individuals through mechanical coupling [^09e9d878]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Figure 2b–d show the trajectories taken by 1 × 1, 4 × 4 and 7 × 7 Kilobot Soft Robots, respectively, in all trials. It is apparent that the 1 × 1 robot (essentially a single Kilobot with open-loop control) is unable to move in a coherent direction. By contrast, the 7 × 7 robot deviates far less from the reference trajectory. Lacking feedback that is external to the robot, however, the robot will not stay on course indefinitely.

Figure 2e shows the length of the trajectory at the end of the trial as a function of the Kilobot Soft Robot's size S. For each size, we report on the top the number of failed trials. The mean value (blue solid line) shows that the trajectory length decreases, converging to the optimum value (green dotted line), as the robot size S increases. In other words, the motion of the Kilobot Soft Robot becomes more accurate, the more modules it has.

The performance improvement in terms of accuracy comes at the expense of a reduced average linear speed, as shown in Fig. 2f. Although accuracy tends to improve with robot size S, the speed seems to settle to a constant value of about 0.35 cm/s (successful trials only). Comparing the robot's speed with that of individual Kilobots (about 1.2 cm/s), we observe that the Kilobot Soft Robot moves at about 29% of the maximum speed of its constituent modules.

Finally, for each trial, we evaluated the extent to which the robots' shapes were distorted with respect to the reference shape, a square lattice. In the reference shape, all angles formed between adjacent links to neighbouring modules and internal to the robot have the same value of 90°. The root-mean-square distortion is computed as the mean squared error from 90° for all angles. Figure 2g reports the average of the root-mean-square distortion over time. We observe relatively small values of distortion in successful trials (green circles) for robots of any size. Large distortions are observed in the unsuccessful trials (red crosses). The latter indicate that a high proportion of elastic links ended up not being in the correct configuration, which may cause the robot to cease motion.

Left atrial (LA) size — area measurement is defined and qualified. It is measured in four-chamber apical view, at end-systole, on the frame just prior to mitral valve opening by tracing the LA inner border, excluding the area under the mitral valve annulus and the inlet of the pulmonary veins. It is described as more representative of actual LA size than anteroposterior diameter only, but requires a dedicated view to avoid LA foreshortening and assumes a symmetric shape of the atrium.

Microfabrication of compact and customizable MIMSCs

The on-chip micromanufacturing of MIMSCs is illustrated in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1. Microelectrode arrays of MIMSCs were first obtained by multi-step lithographic patterning, magnetron sputtering, spray printing aqueous dispersion of small-sized MXene nanosheets (Supplementary Fig. 2) and lift-off processes (Supplementary Fig. 1a).

Right ventricular apical views — image acquisition guidance (Figure 7) explains that three apical images demonstrate different views of the right ventricle, with the middle image showing the right ventricular–focused view, and that minor variations in the four-chamber plane position relative to the right ventricular crescent shape may result in variability of right ventricular size when measured linearly.

Table 5 — Echocardiographic assessment of LV mass (2D based formulas, truncated ellipsoid) indicates partial correction for shape distortions and less dependence on geometrical assumptions than linear measurements; however, this approach requires good image quality and properly oriented parasternal short‑axis views without oblique planes and good epicardial definition, uses a cumbersome methodology with higher measurement variability, and is limited by few published normative data and limited prognostic data.

### Measuring central venous structures in humans: implications for central-vein catheter dimensions [^0c487f48]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2007). Low credibility.

The tip of a central vein catheter for hemodialysis should be located in the upper right atrium for the best performance. Hemodialysis catheters do have internal diameter unadjusted to the catheter length; however, the longer the catheter the slower the flow at the same pressure difference. On the other hand, the catheter diameter cannot be so large as to fill the vein too tightly as it predisposes to the damage of the vein wall, thrombosis and stenosis. Therefore, the catheter length and diameter should be appropriate for the patient. For this purpose, the exact dimensions of the venous system in vivo should be known. In this study we correlated the anthropometric measurements and the dimensions of the large upper body veins in 31 adult volunteers. After deep inspiration, magnetic resonance imaging of the chest was performed in three planes; the positions of specific points in the three-dimensional coordinate system were measured, and the distance to adjacent points was calculated according to the analytic geometry formula. The total length from the catheter entry point to the right atrium was the sum of distances between the adjacent points. The lengths of the veins were correlated with the body anthropometric measurements (height, weight, body surface area, bi-acromion span, and height plus bi-acromion span). The best overall correlations of the lengths and diameters of the large upper body veins are with the body surface area. A table is included to guide the selection of the total catheter length and diameter in relation to the body surface area and insertion site.

### A transient contractile seam promotes epithelial sealing and sequential assembly of body segments [^f08034e4]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Cell junction rearrangements and epidermal zipping

Unlike previous vertex models, we did not allow for cell junction rearrangements in the DE, since our observations indicated that these are rare during dorsal closure. The most typical cell junction rearrangement in a 2D epithelium is the T1 transition, which takes place when the length of an edge shared by two cells becomes so small that it disappears and is replaced by a new edge that is shared by neither of them. In order to prevent this type of transition in our model, we imposed a minimal edge lengthby applying a small restoring force each time an edge became shorter than.

One of the key aspects of this model is the zipping of the leading edge. This process consists of the union of the leading-edge cells on each side of the AS in a sequential fashion from anterior to posterior. During dorsal closure, actual zipping is achieved with the help of cell protrusive activity of leading-edge cells when both sides are close enough. We simplified this process in our model by implementing a special type of cell junction rearrangement that we called the zipping event, involving the canthus vertex (C) and the two leading-edge vertices adjacent to the former (A and B) (Fig. 1D). We defined a zipping distance threshold dz such that when the distance between A and B was shorter than dz, a zipping event would be triggered. During a zipping event, vertices A and B are fused into a new vertex D and the edges AC and BC are fused into a new edge CD (Fig. 1D). After the zipping event, vertex D becomes the new canthus. It has also been observed that during zipping the AS cells adjacent to the canthus are covered by the closing leading edge and remain under the DE for some time before, thus contributing to the progressive reduction in the size of the AS tissue. In order to account for this small contribution, we calculated the surface area of the triangle made by vertices A–C right before the zipping event and subtracted this value from thevalue of the AS cell (AS) after the zipping event.

### Machine learning enables completely automatic tuning of a quantum device faster than human experts [^fd71e035]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Searching for the hypersurface

In each iteration, the algorithm first locates the hypersurface in gate voltage space. To do this, it selects a search direction, specified by a unit vector u which during the first 30 iterations of the algorithm is selected randomly from a hypersphere, restricted to the octant where all gate voltages are negative. The gate voltages are then scanned along a ray beginning at the origin o and parallel to u (Fig. 4 a). During this scan, the current is monitored; when it falls below a threshold of 20% of full scale, this is taken as defining a location v (u) on the hypersurface.

Fig. 4
Characterising the boundary hypersurface using machine learning.

Each panel illustrates a step of the algorithm presented in Fig. 3. The gate voltage space, restricted to two dimensions for illustration, is divided into regions of near-zero (blue) and non-zero current (pink), separated by a boundary hypersurface. a Locating the hypersurface. The gate voltages are scanned along a ray (violet arrow) starting at the origin (white circle) and defined by direction u. By monitoring the current, the intersection with the hypersurface is measured. b To determine whether a region should be pruned, the algorithm scans each gate voltage individually toward the bottom of its range from a location just inside the hypersurface as shown. If only one scan intersects the hypersurface (as in the inset), future exploration of that region is inhibited by displacing the origin as shown. c Based on a short 1D scan, the location is classified according to whether it shows current peaks indicating Coulomb blockade. d If peaks are found, a 2D scan (violet square) is performed in the plane of V 3 and V 7, and is possibly repeated at higher resolution. e From the first thirty measurements (green and yellow circles), the algorithm builds a model of the hypersurface and assigns a probabilitythat peaks will be found. f To refine the model, the algorithm generates a set of candidate search locations (squares), each weighted by its corresponding value of, and selects one at random. A new scan is then performed in the corresponding direction to generate a new measurement of the hypersurface location. Steps d – f are then repeated indefinitely. Inset: Scheme for numerically sampling the hypersurface using simulated Brownian motion. Each point represents a simulated particle moving inside the enclosed volume. The collisions between the particles and the modelled hypersurface generate a set of candidate search locations.

### Anatomic predictors of phrenic nerve injury in the setting of pulmonary vein isolation using the 28-mm second-generation cryoballoon [^47c71dd2]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Phrenic nerve injury (PNI) is the most frequently observed complication during pulmonary vein (PV) isolation using the second-generation cryoballoon.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to analyze anatomic predictors based on preprocedural computed tomographic imaging data.

Methods

Forty-one patients with PNI during the procedure and 123 age-, gender-, and body mass index-matched controls were included. A total of 343 right PVs were evaluated for axial/coronal orientation, ostial diameters with cross-sectional area, ovality index, and branching pattern. External angle between the right superior pulmonary vein (RSPV) and the anterolateral wall of the left atrium (LA) was measured (RSPV-LA angle). Distance from this vertex to the superior vena cava (SVC) was considered the RSPV-SVC distance.

Results

For the RSPV, more anterosuperior orientation, larger dimensions, shorter RSPV-SVC distance, and more obtuse RSPV-LA angle (all P < .001) were associated with PNI on univariate analysis. Independent variables after multivariable analysis were RSPV-LA angle (odds ratio 1.03 per degree, 95% confidence interval 1.01–1.04, P < .001) and RSPV area (odds ratio 1.2 per mm², 95% confidence interval 1.1–1.3, P < .001), with a cutoff value ≥ 141° for RSPV-LA angle (91% sensitivity, 85% specificity) and ≥ 275 mm² for RSPV area (88% sensitivity, 85% specificity). RIPV area was an independent predictor for PNI at RIPV. A right-sided long common trunk was seen exclusively in 3 patients in the PNI group.

Conclusion

Preprocedural anatomic assessment of right PVs is useful in evaluating the risk of PNI. Ostial vein area and external RSPV-LA angle measurement showed excellent predictive value for PNI at the RSPV.

### Automatic colon segmentation with dual scan CT colonography [^60cad629]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2005). Low credibility.

We present a fully automated three-dimensional (3-D) segmentation algorithm to extract the colon lumen surface in CT colonography. Focusing on significant-size polyp detection, we target at an efficient algorithm that maximizes overall colon coverage, minimizes the extracolonic components, maintains local shape accuracy, and achieves high segmentation speed. Two-dimensional (2-D) image processing techniques are employed first, resulting in automatic seed placement and better colon coverage. This is followed by near-air threshold 3-D region-growing using an improved marching-cubes algorithm, which provides fast and accurate surface generation. The algorithm constructs a well-organized vertex-triangle structure that uniquely employs a hash table method, yielding an order of magnitude speed improvement. We segment two scans, prone and supine, independently and with the goal of improved colon coverage. Both segmentations would be available for subsequent polyp detection systems. Segmenting and analyzing both scans improves surface coverage by at least 6% over supine or prone alone. According to subjective evaluation, the average coverage is about 87.5% of the entire colon. Employing near-air threshold and elongation criteria, only 6% of the data sets include extracolonic components (EC) in the segmentation. The observed surface shape accuracy of the segmentation is adequate for significant-size (6 mm) polyp detection, which is also verified by the results of the prototype detection algorithm. The segmentation takes less than 5 minutes on an AMD 1-GHz single-processor PC, which includes reading the volume data and writing the surface results. The surface-based segmentation algorithm is practical for subsequent polyp detection algorithms in that it produces high coverage, has a low EC rate, maintains local shape accuracy, and has a computational efficiency that makes real-time polyp detection possible. A fully automatic or computer-aided polyp detection system using this technique is likely to benefit future colon cancer early screening.

Left atrial (LA) size — internal linear dimensions are described for echocardiography. The anteroposterior diameter of the left atrium can be measured in the parasternal long-axis view perpendicular to the aortic root long axis, and measured at the level of the aortic sinuses by using the leading-edge to leading-edge convention. Advantages listed include high temporal resolution and a wealth of published data, while limitations include that a single dimension is not representative of actual LA size (particularly in dilated atria), lower frame rates than in M-mode, and single dimension only; facilitative features include orientation perpendicular to the LA posterior wall.

Since the representation in Figure 1b tends to obfuscate the cortical and thalamic counterparts of the CoDevTC patterns, we averaged their BSR values and displayed them on the left and right cortical and thalamic surfaces (Figure 2a, b); this representation shows the negative BSR predominantly in posterior parts of the cortex and almost exclusively in the dorsal portions of both thalami, whereas higher‐order cortical areas and the ventral/posterior portions of the thalami predominantly show positive BSR.

In ASD, we observed a negative correlation between the cortical and thalamic WGC angles within the lower tail of the BSR distribution and a positive correlation between that cortical and thalamic WGC angles within the upper tail of the BSR distribution (Figure 2c), whereas the TD group exhibited positive correlations within both BSR tails (Figure 2d).

Left ventricle linear measurements — It is recommended that linear internal measurements of the left ventricle and its walls be performed in the parasternal long-axis view, with values carefully obtained perpendicular to the LV long axis at or immediately below the level of the mitral valve leaflet tips; the electronic calipers should be positioned on the interface between the myocardial wall and cavity and the interface between the wall and the pericardium, and internal dimensions can be obtained with a two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography (2DE)–guided M-mode approach.

### Landslide topology uncovers failure movements [^4b25f7fd]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 4
Feature statistics and importance of landslide topology and geometry.

Plots a – f show the probability distribution functions of the six most optimal topological properties used in classifying the failure types for slides (colored in orange), flows (colored in dark blue), complex (colored in red), and falls (colored in light blue) in Italy. Note that we discuss the probability distribution functions of different failure types for the Italian region only, as the Italian data set is the most data-rich inventory. The y -axis shows the probability density values (calculated using kernel density estimation), and the x -axis shows the value of topological attributes. The topological properties in plots a – f are: Average lifetime of holes (AL H), Average lifetime of connected components (AL C), Betti-curve based feature of connected components (BC C), Betti-curve based feature of holes (BC H), Wasserstein amplitude of holes (WA H), and Bottleneck amplitude of holes (BA H) (the computations of these properties are explained in detail in Note S3). The percentage values in the gray circular disk in each figure indicate the topological feature's importance (in %), as estimated by the random forest-based classification procedure. Plot g shows the joint computed feature importance of topological (colored in purple) and geometric (colored in beige) properties by the random forest model. The analysis shows topological properties consistently outperform geometric properties with a standard deviation under 0.1% (the error bar represents the standard deviation. However, it is not visible in plot- g because the standard deviation is very small). The geometric properties are: area (A), perimeter (P), the ratio of area to perimeter, convex hull-based measure (C h), minor (s m) (refer to Note S4 for the definitions), and width (W) of the minimum area bounding box fitted to the polygon.

### Angle κ and its effect on the corneal elevation maps in refractive surgery candidates [^88b2c6e0]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the associations of angle κ and Pentacam decentration indices with elevation maps in normal refractive surgery candidates.

Setting

Salouti Cornea Research Center, Salouti Eye Clinic, Shiraz, Iran.

Design

Retrospective observational study.

Methods

In this research, the right eyes of 173 refractive surgery candidates were assessed. Data of front and back corneal elevation maps, keratometric data, decentration indices, and corneal astigmatism obtained by Pentacam HR system and angle κ obtained by Orbscan IIz were extracted. Maximum elevation (or depression) for each of the 4 quadrants was recorded. Correlations of elevation values with angle κ, Pentacam decentration indices, keratometry, and astigmatism were examined by Pearson correlation coefficient. 148 age- and sex-matched cases with keratoconus grade 1 were selected as a positive control group, and Pentacam variables were compared between the groups.

Results

Overall, data from 173 eyes of 173 normal refractive surgery candidates and 148 eyes of 148 patients with keratoconus were recorded and analyzed. In normal refractive surgery candidates, the mean of angle κ was 5.32 ± 1.36 (SD) degrees. Angle κ had a positive correlation with front and back temporal elevations based on a best-fit sphere (BFS) (r = 0.339, P = 0.001; r = 0.300, P < .001, respectively). Front and back keratometric astigmatisms were positively correlated with front and back nasal and temporal elevations (r ≥ 0.543, P < .001) and negatively correlated with superior and inferior elevations (r ≤ -0.547, P < .001). These associations no longer existed when using best-fit toric ellipse (BFTE) for calculating elevation data. The thinnest point to vertex decentration was significantly associated with the back temporal elevation (based on the BFTE) in both normal (r = 0.311, P < .001) and keratoconus (r = 0.190, P = 0.021) eyes.

Conclusions

This study showed that elevation maps obtained by the Pentacam system using BFS might be affected by both the large angle κ and corneal astigmatism, confounding the preoperative assessment of refractive surgery candidates. Using BFTE as a reference for calculating elevation data should eliminate most diagnostic issues and thus is encouraged in this context.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of diagnostic and screening ultrasound examinations of the abdominal aorta in adults [^c7876e54]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). High credibility.

AIUM abdominal aorta ultrasound — measurement acquisition and reporting specifies that at a minimum, the largest measurement should be recorded and reported, and a measurement of the length of the aneurysm is optional; if an AAA is present, the shape should be documented as fusiform, eccentric, or saccular with representative images. For the common iliac arteries, longitudinal images of the proximal right and left common iliac arteries, transverse images of the proximal common iliac arteries just below the bifurcation, and measurement of the widest visualized portion of each common iliac artery from outer edge to outer edge are described. For screening, anteroposterior measurements sufficient to determine whether an aneurysm exists should be obtained; if an aneurysm is present, its greatest dimension should be reported, and if no aneurysm is identified, the largest diameter of the abdominal aorta should be reported.

The scaling constraint in Eq. (1) forces the direction of connection on the-th face to be parallel after shrinking, i.e. critical for building a connection with adjacent shrunken polyhedrons. Our work is different from previous work, where the connecting direction was normal to the regular polyhedrons; instead, we determine the connecting direction by bridging the centroids of the deformed polyhedrons in the template. We obtain the length of the connectionbetween the adjacent shrunken polyhedrons:

### Geometric characteristics of bicuspid aortic valves [^9b9b43c6]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

We studied the coaptation angles α and β in bicuspid aortic valve geometry from computed tomography scan images.

Methods

In 45 patients, we calculated the coaptation angle α (the angle between the nonfused commissures crossing the center of coaptation), angle β (between the nonfused commissures crossing the center of the reference circle), angles γ 1 and γ 2 and ε 1 and ε 2 (angle between the nonfused commissures and the coaptation point at the raphe or the perfect midpoint, respectively), the length of the raphe, the absolute and relative sinuses' surfaces (relative to the perfect circle and the percentage exceeding the ideal circle). Spearman correlation was employed to investigate the associations among all parameters.

Results

The coaptation angles α and β were significantly different (P < .001). We found a significant correlation of α with the length of the raphe (P = 0.008), whereas β was dependent on the position of the commissures. Both γ 1 and γ 2 (P = 0.04), or ε 1 and ε 2 (P < .001) significantly differed from each other and ε 2 was the most constant angle, although its size geometrically depends on β. The noncoronary was the largest sinus, and β was the primary determinant of its increased size in bicuspid aortic valves with righ/left fusion pattern.

Conclusions

The coaptation angle α is influenced by the length of the raphe, whereas angle β is dependent on the position of the commissures. The position of the raphe can vary and is not always situated in the middle of the free edge. The position of the right/non commissure is variable, whereas the right/left commissure is more fixed.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^4365d6f0]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume measurement methodology — when assessing LA size and remodeling, the measurement of LA volume is recommended; LA volume should be measured using the disk summation algorithm with LA endocardial borders traced in both apical four- and two-chamber views, while single-plane methods are not recommended for routine use though they can be used when both-view planimetry is difficult, and single-plane apical four-chamber indexed volumes are typically 1 to 2 mL/m2 smaller than apical two-chamber values; a biplane area–length calculation is an alternative.

### Cartography and topographic mapping: the historical basis for the standardization of anatomical analysis and surgical mark-making to improve outcomes in body contouring [^278bcb43]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Maps have been used for thousands of years to guide and advance mankind's interests. Recently, cartography has grown exponentially into standardized, densely layered systems, facilitating countless functions that use complex algorithms and multifactorial data. Surgeons have successfully addressed bodily concerns for centuries, aided by consistency of human anatomy, physiologic responses to disease, and patterns of disease. However, body contouring techniques alter the much more inconsistent surface anatomy of stretched or aged skin and highly variable subcutaneous fullness. To date, no consistent strategy has been proposed to analyze, map, and alter human shape in a standardized fashion; however, well-established cartographic methods for topographic mapping can be logically adapted to meet surgical needs. Quantification of results, valid and meaningful comparison of techniques, and anatomical discovery could all be achieved by adopting cartographic methods. As anatomists and scientists, surgeons constantly seek logical and reproducible methods to improve patient outcomes. In this article, the authors present a technique derived from topographic mapping, applied directly to the surface of the human body, reflecting the actual underlying anatomy, to guide both elective and reconstructive procedures. The method provides logical and quantifiable methods for (1) the analysis of anatomy, (2) data-driven planning of surgical care, and (3) a consistent operative implementation-so that each patient can receive individualized, anatomically based procedures. Use of well-established mapping strategies would also promote interdisciplinary collaboration, permit adaptation of software to analyze volume and shape, and improve patient outcomes through quantification of change and meaningful comparisons of procedural options.

### Interplay between spherical confinement and particle shape on the self-assembly of rounded cubes [^3be75d54]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In bulk simulations of rounded cubes, we observed upon compression a transition from a plastic FCC crystal to a fully aligned C0 crystal. One of the main characteristics of the C0 phase is that the nearest neighbors do no longer align perfectly with the faces of the cubes but are shifted slightly off center. In Supplementary Fig. 15a, the position of the nearest neighbors is shown for the plastic crystal FCC phase and in Supplementary Fig. 15b for the C0 phase of rounded cubes in bulk for α = 0.3. Even in the case of the plastic crystal, the particles already have a preference for certain orientations, they avoid pointing their corners towards any of their neighbors. In the C0 phase the 4 spots (Supplementary Fig. 15b) in the center are caused by the off center position of these nearest neighbors resulting from the deformation of the unit cell and the alignment of the particles. However, when we compressed the same rounded cubes in spherical confinement we did not observe this transition, instead the particles remained in a more symmetric FCC/HCP position. This is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 15c (simulation) and d (experiment), where we plot the positions of the nearest neighbors for rounded cubes in confinement and observe a single bright spot in the center (neighbors aligned to the center of the faces).

Orientational correlations

The orientation of cube i is stored as a rotation matrix M. To quantify the orientation of the cubes with respect to neighboring cubes we want to calculate the minimum angle α ij required to rotate a cube with orientation M i into the same orientation as a cube with orientation M j. The angle between two orientation matrices can be obtained from the angle axis 1 + 2 cos α ij = but this would not take into account the symmetries of a cube. To do this, we need to calculate the symmetry group of the cube (or octahedron) S 4, which contains 24 rotationsthat preserve the orientation of a cube. To obtain the minimum angle, we then calculate the angle between all identical representations of the orientations of the cubeswhere f (x) = acos(Tr(x)/2 − 1/2) and the minimum is taken over all 24 members of the symmetry group.

Connecting particle color with its orientation

To obtain a visually interpretable effect, we color the particles by calculating the angle between the particle and three reference particles with different orientations. Detailed information can be found in Supplementary Methods Section 4.

Echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) volumes — Volume measurements are "usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface in the apical four- and two-chamber views", with the contour at the mitral valve level "closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line", and LV length "defined as the distance between the middle of this line and the most distant point of the LV contour". Techniques include biplane disk summation and area-length; biplane disk summation advantages are "Corrects for shape distortions" and "Less geometrical assumptions compared with linear dimensions", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Endocardial dropout", and "Blind to shape distortions not visualized in the apical two- and four-chamber planes". For area-length, the advantage is "Partial correction for shape distortion", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Heavily based on geometrical assumptions", and "Limited published data on normal population".

### 2D material programming for 3D shaping [^0d7f1bf4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Cone singularities

The Riemann theorem suggests that our method can form any curved shapes of thin sheets by conformally morphing 2D hydrogels. However, in practice, the accessible Ω r limits accessible 3D configurations. To mitigate this limitation, we introduced the concept of cone singularities (Fig. 3). The idea is to first map a 3D shape on a cone surface (K = 0) and then unfold the cone surface to the 2D plane (without further area distortion) by cutting the surface through cone points, rather than directly mapping a shape to the plane (as shown in Fig. 2). This approach can significantly reduce Ω r, as a 3D shape can be conformally mapped to a cone surface with lower area distortion than to the plane and the cone surface can be isometrically flattened to the plane.

### Larmor frequency shift from magnetized cylinders with arbitrary orientation distribution [^317deddb]. NMR in Biomedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

3.1.2 Simulation (a). The size of

The purpose of this simulation was to examine the accuracy of the mesoscopic Lorentz cavity approximation, Equation (8) through Equations (12) and (13), as a function of the size ofcompared with the size of the magnetic inclusions. Figure 4 gives an overview of the simulation. The coarse‐grained Larmor frequencywas averaged around the center pointof a population of (a1) randomly placed parallel rectangular rods, (a2) randomly placed dots, (a3) long randomly oriented rods and (a4) random sheets arranged in parallel along thedirection. The rods (a1) were made by generating a2D grid with a weighted random number of zeros and ones to vary the volume fraction as. The 2D grid was then repeated along the third dimension to yield agrid with purely 2D Poissonian structural correlations. The random dots (a2) were generated as (a1) but placed randomly on a 3Dgrid with similar volume fractions. Each rod/dot thus had a widthof one grid unit and the rods a length of 400 grid units. The long randomly oriented rods (a3) were made by randomly placing rods with a width of three grid units and length of 800 grid units in a3D grid. The rods were allowed to overlap, and we used periodic boundaries to contain the whole rod. The volume fraction was varied as. The sheets (a4) were made by placing rods of similar dimensions in a2D grid and repeating it along the third dimension to yield agrid with similar volume fractions. These scenarios correspond to systems with long‐range 3D and 2D structural correlations, respectively. 100 different configurations were generated for (a1)–(a4) for each volume fraction. When calculating, the microstructurewas only considered within the mesoscopic region(Figure 4A). The exterior region was instead averaged according to Equation (10). We investigated the dependence of the size and shape ofwhen calculatingin comparison with the true Larmor frequencycalculated with Equation (8) using the magnetic microstructure for the entire region and averaged within the same mesoscopic sphereas(Figure 4B). In addition, we investigated the influence of various shapes for, i.e. a cube, sphere and cylinder, for decomposing the sample into mesoscopic and macroscopic regions in the calculation of. The side lengthofwas varied from four times the width of the rods to half the size of the sample. We also computed the field at the center point, where the microstructure was removed within(Figure 4C). The mean relative error(for (a1)) was then calculated by averaging over the different realizations for each configuration. We also computed the mean squared differenceand compared it with(for (a1)–(a4)).

### Salvage of the condylar fracture: complication management of mandibular angle ostectomy [^bb739090]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

A prominent mandibular angle is considered to be unattractive in Asians because it gives the face a square, coarse, and muscular appearance. Mandibular angle ostectomy has been known to be effective and to satisfy both surgeons and patients. However, a narrow surgical field hinders direct view of the site, making a procedure that is rather difficult to perform. Despite thorough presurgical planning and attention, there can be many complications and unfavorable results. A 21-year-old woman with right condyle process fracture was referred to Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong. The patient was previously treated with mandibular angle reduction surgery at a local clinic. Via an extraoral approach, the condyle process was replaced and fixed using 1 long metal screw and one 2 × 2 square metal plate. We overcame the condylar fracture caused by mandibular angle ostectomy with reasonable reduction of the right condyle.

Normal subjects presented with a middle number and two left- and right-sided outer numbers overestimate the numerical distance between the middle number and that positioned at its left side. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the right posterior parietal cortex specifically counteracts this bias, suggesting that the mental representation of space defined by numbers is shifted toward the left side depending on a greater activity of the right hemisphere.

### Upper limb dimensions in adults presenting for elective surgery-implications for blood pressure measurement [^1d6acf23]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Arm conicity is associated with non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement error and may be avoided by using finger cuffs. Predicting arm conicity may help decisions regarding NIBP measurement techniques.

Methods

We obtained upper limb measurements of adults presenting to the Pre-Anesthetic Clinic to determine: the suitability of arm and finger cuff sizes; the best anthropometric predictor of arm conicity based on the right arm slant angle; the incidence of a right arm slant angle < 83 degrees. Right mid-arm circumference (MAC) was compared to recommended cuff sizes and finger circumference compared to available cuffs. Slant angle was calculated from the measurements obtained. Linear regression was used to determine the better predictor of right arm slant angle. Correlation coefficients were calculated and R 2 values compared.

Results

Four hundred fifty-four patients participated and 453 had cone-shaped arms. One participant (0.2, 95% CI 0.0–1.2) had a MAC outside the recommended cuff range. Twenty-five participants (5.5, 95% CI 3.6–8.0) had a middle finger circumference greater than the largest ClearSight™ cuff. Body mass index (BMI), weight and right MAC all had low to moderate correlation with right arm slant angle (r = -0.49, -0.39, -0.48, all p < 0.001) and regression revealed R 2 values of 0.24, 0.15 and 0.23. Six participants (1.3, 95% CI 0.5–2.9) had a slant angle < 83 degrees.

Conclusion

Current NIBP equipment caters for most patients, based on the traditional measure of MAC. The utility of finger cuffs is limited by cuff size. BMI and right MAC showed the most promise in predicting arm conicity.

Barrier methods for adolescents — external condoms, internal condoms, and dental dams — are described with materials, use sites, and access. The external condom "is a latex, synthetic, or natural material shield designed to fit over the male penis and is available over the counter". The internal condom "is a loose-fitting polyurethane (nitrile) sheath with 2 flexible polyurethane rings and is the only US Food and Drug Administration–approved nonpenile barrier method for STI prevention currently available in the United States", may be placed "inside the anus, vagina, or mouth", and "is only available in the United States with a prescription". Another option is "a dental dam, or a latex, synthetic (nitrile or polyurethane) sheet (usually square shaped) that users may place over the penis, vulva, vagina, mouth, anus, or any part of the body". The page also notes, "Although not evidence based or advised, adolescents may also improvise using plastic wrap or plastic bags to act as barriers".

Mitral regurgitation imaging — significant secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) in dilated cardiomyopathy is shown with marked tenting of the mitral valve (MV) and parasternal short-axis color Doppler demonstrating regurgitation along the entire length of valve coaptation. Pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler at the tips of the MV leaflets shows high E velocity, and continuous-wave (CW) Doppler has a triangular spectral shape in significant MR. Proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) from apical three- and two- (commissural) chamber views shows nonhemispheric flow convergence and a noncircular vena contracta (VC), and the legend cautions that assumption of a hemispheric flow convergence or circular VC would underestimate MR.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive transesophageal echocardiographic examination: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists [^581288e1]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Aortic root and annulus measurement — multiplane alignment and timing: Two-dimensional echocardiographic planar measurements may incorrectly estimate true aortic annulus size if the LAX view does not bisect the maximum diameter of the aortic root, and a well-aligned LAX view bisects the left noncoronary commissure posteriorly and the right coronary cusp anteriorly; the optimal sagittal dimension measurement plane aligns with these landmarks. On 3D echocardiography, the sagittal plane annular measurement is 2.3 cm, but the largest dimension is the coronal plane. Two-dimensional aortic diameter measurements are preferable to M-mode, which results in systematic underestimation (by 2 mm) compared with the 2D aortic diameter. The aortic annular diameter may be measured in diastole between the hinge points of the AV leaflets (inner edge to inner edge) in LAX views that reveal the largest diameter, but for valve sizing before transcatheter or surgical valve replacement, the measurement should be performed in systole. Color flow Doppler may be important in abnormalities such as aortic dissection or intramural hematomas.
