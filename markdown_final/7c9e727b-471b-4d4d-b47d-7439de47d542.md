## Question

In what ways might an inherited RBC Disorders Panel impact patient care?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking in what ways an inherited RBC Disorders Panel might impact patient care across the clinical journey. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when to trigger panel testing in the diagnostic pathway. Then, I should evaluate diagnostic yield and how often the molecular result changes the clinical label. Next, I will consider family and reproductive implications, including carrier testing and prenatal options. After that, I need to appraise how genotype informs individualized management and transfusion strategies. Finally, I should review limitations, variants of uncertain significance, incidental findings, logistics, and the need for multidisciplinary care and ongoing surveillance, ensuring I verify each point against the best available guidance and evidence before drawing conclusions [^113twZmP] [^1135ftir].

> Let me first confirm when an NGS panel should be triggered in the work‑up of suspected inherited RBC disorders; traditionally, we start with CBC, smear, reticulocytes, and specialized functional or biochemical assays, but I need to check whether earlier panel use can shorten the diagnostic odyssey without compromising quality. The membrane disorders review explicitly emphasizes accurate and timely diagnosis and highlights the role of modern genetic testing to avoid inappropriate interventions, which supports moving NGS earlier once basic hematology excludes common acquired causes, while ensuring phenotypic correlation remains integral to interpretation [^111z6yPq]. Hold on, I should also verify feasibility and analytic performance; clinical‑grade panel validation and coverage‑aware reporting are achievable, and real‑world programs show routine uptake in practice, reinforcing that earlier panel deployment is operationally realistic when embedded in a thoughtful algorithm [^114TbJHC] [^112mYKN6].

> Next, I should review diagnostic yield and whether panels identify conditions missed by phenotype‑first pathways; wait, let me verify the numbers. Targeted panels for rare inherited anemias solved about 38.6% of undiagnosed cases, often revising prior labels, while broader bone marrow failure panels in mixed cohorts had more modest yields but still resolved or redirected care for a meaningful subset, underscoring heterogeneity in yield by pretest phenotype and gene content [^114fCnpP] [^1135ftir]. I should double‑check how these results affect care; studies consistently report that securing a molecular diagnosis changes management plans, surveillance, and counseling, but interpretation must be phenotype‑anchored given the discovery of numerous variants of uncertain significance on genetic evaluation [^114fCnpP] [^111z6yPq].

> Now, how does a panel change the clinical label in ways that matter; let me consider concrete examples and verify them. Misclassification between congenital dyserythropoietic anemia and Diamond‑Blackfan anemia, or missing pyruvate kinase deficiency due to confounding enzyme assay results in transfused patients, are well‑documented; panel‑confirmed PK deficiency prompts guideline‑driven management refinements, including careful consideration of splenectomy and targeted monitoring, while early recognition of membranopathies like hereditary xerocytosis enables proactive iron overload surveillance and avoidance of harmful splenectomy when risk is elevated [^117NSHiT] [^111fw121] [^111z6yPq]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wrote "PIEZO1 or GARDEN variants", but I should correct myself — this should read PIEZO1 or KCNN4 (Gardos channel) variants; that self‑correction matters because it points to the specific channelopathy guiding iron monitoring and splenectomy decisions [^111z6yPq].

> I will now examine carrier detection and reproductive choices; hold on, I should verify what best‑practice says for haemoglobinopathies and whether targeted NGS facilitates planning. Guidelines emphasize that initial carrier identification in haemoglobinopathies relies on hematologic and biochemical screening, but DNA analysis is recommended in complex or unclear cases, and at‑risk couples can be offered prenatal diagnosis or preimplantation genetic diagnosis once parental variants are characterized — a workflow that a panel can expedite by defining the familial variants before conception counseling [^1133XZGx]. Let me consider scope; molecular testing complements, not replaces, first‑line hematology screens, but for atypical results and complex coinheritance, early genotyping clarifies risk and enables timely counseling and reproductive decision‑making aligned with patient preferences and local practices [^113VNYBf].

> Next, I should review cascade testing in families; let me verify recommendations across analogous inherited hematologic disorders. Once a causative variant is found in the proband, offering targeted testing to first‑degree relatives is recommended to uncover silent carriers and mildly affected individuals — this is standard in conditions like Diamond‑Blackfan anemia and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and translates directly to inherited RBC disorders, where early identification of at‑risk relatives informs surveillance and reproductive planning [^115T9BCS] [^1139QjeL]. I need to ensure the process includes genetic counseling and appropriate phenotypic review, given variable expressivity and intermittent hematologic manifestations reported in these syndromes [^115T9BCS].

> Let me consider how genotype directs day‑to‑day management; I should confirm condition‑specific implications. In HS and related membranopathies, distinguishing classic spectrin/ankyrin/band 3 defects from dehydrated states helps avoid inappropriate splenectomy and prompts targeted monitoring for complications like iron overload in xerocytosis, reflecting genotype‑phenotype management algorithms now endorsed in contemporary reviews [^111z6yPq]. For PK deficiency, current international guidelines urge individualized decisions on splenectomy and structured monitoring for iron burden, bone health, and pregnancy considerations, reinforcing that panel‑confirmed diagnosis can pivot care from default interventions to evidence‑based, genotype‑aware strategies [^111fw121].

> But wait, what about transfusion support and alloimmunization risk once a molecular diagnosis of a hemoglobinopathy or chronic hemolytic anemia is established; I should check the latest guidance. Guideline panels recommend, at minimum, ABO, RhDCcEe, and K‑compatible RBCs for patients with SCD and thalassemia even without existing alloantibodies, and they strongly endorse selecting antigen‑negative units for any known clinically significant antibody, acknowledging very low certainty for broader prophylactic matching beyond these basics and substantial operational variability across settings [^112eTvRt] [^111KZXig]. Hold on, I should verify applicability; while an RBC‐disorder NGS panel does not typically genotype blood group loci, confirming the underlying disease and fostering early hematology–transfusion collaboration facilitates appropriate antigen matching policies and patient education, with global guidance emphasizing feasibility constraints and equity considerations, especially in low‑ and middle‑income settings [^113WVens] [^113axe6v].

> I need to check the challenges that NGS introduces, especially variants of uncertain significance and secondary findings; let me verify the scope. Genetic evaluation in RBC membranopathies commonly uncovers VUS that require careful clinical correlation and, at times, functional studies, underscoring the need to integrate phenotype, laboratory data, and expert review when interpreting panel reports [^111z6yPq]. Additionally, comprehensive hematology panels can reveal secondary findings relevant to cancer predisposition or early hematologic disease, which necessitate pretest counseling, clear consent processes, and defined pathways for disclosure and follow‑up to avoid unintended harm and to capitalize on preventive opportunities [^1135ftir].

> Next, I should review operational and access considerations; wait, let me verify what real‑world programs have demonstrated about logistics. Saliva or buccal swab–based kits with remote sample collection, including neonatal scenarios, have been used to broaden access and reduce phlebotomy barriers, with clinician‑attested informed consent and large‑scale uptake reported; nonetheless, detailed phenotypic data are often lacking and should be actively collected to strengthen genotype‑phenotype interpretation and quality assurance [^11165e72] [^116g1nK7]. I need to ensure that local pathways include explicit consent language, data sharing agreements, and mechanisms to integrate results into multidisciplinary care plans to translate testing into outcomes [^11165e72].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations of targeted panels; coverage gaps and noncoding variants can lead to false negatives if not anticipated. Clinical‑grade reporting requires per‑base coverage analytics to document the discoverability of known mutations, and some disorders, such as DBA, may be driven by noncoding variants that escape typical panel designs, arguing for exome or genome escalation in unresolved but highly suspicious cases and for iterative panel updates as knowledge evolves [^114TbJHC] [^116uiWfg]. Let me reconsider the preanalytical and interpretive pitfalls in hemoglobinopathy diagnostics; persistent error rates across proficiency testing and the complexity of coinheritance signal that molecular confirmation in atypical cases is not just helpful but often essential to prevent misclassification and downstream management errors [^114L4LHf] [^113VNYBf].

> I should confirm the role of specialist networks and multidisciplinary care; early and accurate labeling is only as useful as the care pathways it unlocks. Rare anemia guidance urges referral to specialized centers and participation in expert networks and MDTs to coordinate surveillance for complications like iron overload and endocrine sequelae and to align treatment decisions with evolving consensus, mirroring broader moves in inherited hematology toward centralized expertise and updated international standards [^116ApezM] [^115bvaUx]. In parallel, family evaluations should involve clinical genetics to structure cascade testing, counsel on variable expressivity, and navigate reproductive options consistent with patient values and local regulations [^115T9BCS] [^1133XZGx].

> Stepping back, I should double‑check that the overall care impact is coherent: earlier panel testing, when guided by phenotype and paired with expert interpretation, shortens time to diagnosis, corrects mislabels, enables cascade and reproductive planning, and drives genotype‑informed management while embedding transfusion strategies that respect current evidence and operational realities; the trade‑offs include VUS management, occasional secondary findings, and the need for robust consent and data integration, all of which are manageable within modern multidisciplinary frameworks [^114fCnpP] [^111z6yPq] [^112eTvRt] [^1135ftir].

Inherited RBC Disorders Panels improve patient care by enabling **early, accurate diagnosis** of hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, and enzymopathies [^114fCnpP], supporting **targeted management** and reducing diagnostic delays [^1135ftir]. They guide **individualized transfusion strategies**, including extended antigen matching [^112eTvRt], to reduce alloimmunization and transfusion reactions [^113WVens] [^114m8LT8]. Panels also inform genetic counseling [^115T9BCS], carrier detection, and reproductive planning [^1133XZGx] and help avoid unnecessary treatments, such as inappropriate splenectomy or iron therapy [^111z6yPq]. Overall, they enable **earlier intervention** [^116R9gQZ], prevent complications, and improve quality of life.

---

## Early and accurate diagnosis

Diagnostic precision improves as panels provide **rapid, accurate molecular diagnoses** [^114fCnpP] for hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, and enzymopathies, reducing reliance on sequential, inconclusive tests [^115RTLeK]. Reduced diagnostic delay results from **early molecular diagnosis** [^1135ftir], which shortens diagnostic odysseys and enables **timely intervention** while helping prevent complications [^114fCnpP].

---

## Personalized treatment strategies

Targeted therapy is feasible because molecular diagnosis enables **individualized management**, including tailored transfusion regimens [^114m8LT8], iron chelation, and consideration of curative options such as HSCT or gene therapy [^114fCnpP]. Accurate diagnosis enables the **avoidance of inappropriate treatments**, preventing unnecessary interventions — such as inappropriate splenectomy [^114T4r7Z] or iron therapy — and reducing patient harm and healthcare costs [^111z6yPq].

---

## Improved transfusion management

Panels guide **extended antigen matching** to include ABO, RhDCcEe, and Kell for patients with hemoglobinopathies [^112eTvRt], reducing alloimmunization and transfusion reactions [^113WVens]. This approach **reduces alloimmunization** [^113WVens] by lowering risk and improving transfusion safety and outcomes [^114m8LT8].

---

## Genetic counseling and family planning

Panels enable **carrier detection**, supporting informed reproductive decisions [^113PNc4g] and prenatal diagnosis [^1133XZGx]. Additionally, **family screening** through genetic counseling [^115T9BCS] identifies at-risk relatives [^1133XZGx], supporting early intervention and prevention.

---

## Prevention of complications

Early intervention is possible because **early diagnosis** and targeted management [^114fCnpP] can prevent complications such as iron overload [^111z6yPq], organ damage [^111fw121], and hemolytic crises. Panels also guide **monitoring and surveillance** strategies [^115bvaUx], enabling timely detection and management of complications [^114fCnpP].

---

## Cost-effectiveness and healthcare resource utilization

Reduced healthcare costs result from **early diagnosis** and **targeted management** [^114fCnpP], which decrease hospitalizations, transfusions, and complications, thereby improving resource utilization [^116R9gQZ]. Furthermore, **efficient diagnostic pathways** are achieved [^114fCnpP] as panels streamline testing [^115RTLeK], reducing unnecessary tests and procedures.

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Variants of uncertain significance (VUS)**: Panels may identify VUS [^111z6yPq], requiring careful interpretation and counseling.

- **Ethical considerations**: Genetic testing raises ethical issues, including informed consent, privacy, and potential discrimination.

- **Access and equity**: Limited access to genetic testing and counseling services may exacerbate healthcare disparities.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^1133XZGx]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Within the context of managing the health burden of haemoglobinopathies, laboratory diagnosis plays a critical role, identifying carrier couples and offering them reproductive choices. Haemoglobinopathies are unique among genetic diseases because detection of carriers is possible through haematological and biochemical tests rather than DNA analysis. Thus, it is recommended that with current technologies, carrier detection be mandatory using haematological and biochemical tests. However, DNA analysis should be employed to determine carrier status in complex cases or when haematological or biochemical results are unclear.

Depending on acceptable practices in each society, at-risk couples can be offered the reproductive choice to avoid the birth of affected children or prepare for the possible birth of a severely affected child. Available options to avoid having affected children include changing partner choice before marriage, remaining childless after marriage, or opting for gamete donation or adoption. However, couples rarely choose these options. It is more common for at-risk couples to avoid the birth of an affected child by opting for conventional prenatal diagnosis in early pregnancy or before pregnancy by choosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD).

Both conventional prenatal diagnosis and PGD involve prior variant characterization in the parents and subsequent fetal (or embryo) DNA analysis. Thus, genetic services for haemoglobinopathies require close collaboration.

Heterogeneous red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders and hydration defects often present with the common clinical findings of hemolytic anemia, but they may require substantially different management based on their pathophysiology. An accurate and timely diagnosis is essential to avoid inappropriate interventions and prevent complications. Advances in genetic testing availability within the last decade, combined with extensive foundational knowledge on RBC membrane structure and function, now facilitate the correct diagnosis in patients with a variety of hereditary hemolytic anemias (HHAs).

Studies in patient cohorts with well-defined genetic diagnoses have revealed complications such as iron overload in hereditary xerocytosis, which is amenable to monitoring, prevention, and treatment, and demonstrated that splenectomy is not always an effective or safe treatment for any patient with HHA. However, a multitude of variants of unknown clinical significance have been discovered by genetic evaluation, requiring interpretation by thorough phenotypic assessments in clinical and/or research laboratories. Here we discuss genotype-phenotype correlations and corresponding clinical management in patients with RBC membranopathies and propose an algorithm for the laboratory workup of patients presenting with symptoms and signs of hemolytic anemia, with a clinical case that exemplifies such a workup.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: An updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^113WVens]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) antigen matching beyond ABO and RhD is commonly recommended for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassaemia. We present an updated systematic literature review to inform evidence-based guidelines on RBC matching. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool was used to develop recommendations. Six new observational studies (four prospective, two retrospective) were identified. The six studies reported on 583 patients in total, including cross-over designs, with sample sizes from 10 to 343. Studies were heterogeneous, utilizing varying degrees of RBC matching and different definitions for 'extended' matching. All reported on alloimmunisation, with one study reporting on molecular matching. The reported prevalence of alloimmunisation using limited matching was 0%–50% and with extended matching was 0%–24%. Eighty-two patients were alloimmunised before study entry. The risk of bias across studies was moderate to critical.

The guideline panel recommends that ABO, RhDCcEe, and K-compatible RBCs are selected for individuals with SCD and thalassaemia, even in the absence of alloantibodies, and that RBCs which are antigen-negative to already existing clinically significant antibodies are chosen. There is a need for comparative research to define the benefit, impact, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility of extended RBC matching strategies to prevent alloimmunisation.

### A novel 33-gene targeted resequencing panel provides accurate, clinical-grade diagnosis and improves patient management for rare inherited anaemias [^114fCnpP]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of rare inherited anaemias is challenging, requiring a series of complex and expensive laboratory tests. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been used to investigate these disorders, but the selection of genes on individual panels has been narrow, and the validation strategies used have fallen short of the standards required for clinical use. Clinical-grade validation of negative results requires the test to distinguish between a lack of adequate sequencing reads at the locations of known mutations and a real absence of mutations. To achieve a clinically-reliable diagnostic test and minimize false-negative results, we developed an open-source tool (CoverMi) to accurately determine base-coverage and the 'discoverability' of known mutations for every sample. We validated our 33-gene panel using Sanger sequencing and microarray. Our panel demonstrated 100% specificity and 99.7% sensitivity. We then analyzed 57 clinical samples: molecular diagnoses were made in 22 out of 57 (38.6%), corresponding to 32 mutations of which 16 were new. In all cases, accurate molecular diagnosis had a positive impact on clinical management. Using a validated NGS-based platform for routine molecular diagnosis of previously undiagnosed congenital anaemias is feasible in a clinical diagnostic setting and improves precise diagnosis, thereby enhancing management and counseling of the patient and their family.

### How I manage children with Diamond-Blackfan anaemia [^115T9BCS]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). High credibility.

Screening of family members

Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (DBA) is generally assumed to be inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, although an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern has been suggested in some families. As genetic penetrance is variable and the clinical spectrum is wide, affected family members can be easily missed clinically.

It is therefore recommended to screen parents of DBA patients to search for silent carriers or asymptomatic patients and to identify potentially affected siblings. In DBA patients with a known molecular defect, this can be done by genetic testing of the family members, whereas in patients with no known molecular defect, it is advisable to perform a complete blood count (including reticulocytes and mean cell volume) and eADA activity. Given that haematological manifestations can be intermittent, a complete family history should be obtained, including details of congenital anomalies, non-specific haematological findings, and malignancies.

While the initial work-up can be performed by the treating physician, it is recommended to involve the clinical geneticist to perform an extended family evaluation and genetic counselling.

### Modified Delphi panel consensus recommendations for management of severe aplastic anemia [^113ggeWF]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

We recommend obtaining PNH flow cytometry and single-nucleotide polymorphism array genetic testing for chromosome arm 6p loss of heterozygosity clone, because both of these findings are highly predictive of the diagnosis of immune-mediated AA and can be helpful for exclusion of an IBMF. PNH granulocyte clones of > 1% have ∼100% positive predictive value for AA, whereas PNH granulocyte clones of > 0.1% were estimated to have 95% specificity and a 91% positive predictive value for the diagnosis of AA. In contrast, rare PNH-like cells and PNH populations of < 0.1% are less specific and have been observed in patients with confirmed IBMF.

- **Testing in patients aged ≤ 40 years**: For testing for IBMF (Figure 1 A), we recommend chromosome breakage analysis for Fanconi anemia (FA) and telomere length analysis for telomere biology disorders, two of the most common groups of IBMFs.

- **Testing in patients aged 41- to 60 years**: These tests can be considered depending on individual patient circumstances, family history, or clinical presentation.

- **Germ line genetic testing**: Germ line genetic testing is warranted in patients with a high index of suspicion for an IBMF. These include patients who have a clinical diagnosis of FA based on positive chromosome breakage tests and patients with a high clinical suspicion of FA but have a negative chromosome breakage test. An estimated 10% to 25% of patients with FA have somatic reversion mosaicism and a less severe hematologic presentation; these patients may be missed because of a false-negative chromosome breakage test on peripheral blood lymphocytes and require testing of chromosome break.

### Risk assessment and genetic counseling for hematologic malignancies-practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^116yXekg]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

Hematologic malignancies (HMs) are a heterogeneous group of cancers impacting individuals of all ages, increasingly recognized in association with various germline predisposition syndromes. Given the myriad of malignancy subtypes, expanding differential diagnoses, and unique sample selection requirements, evaluation for hereditary predisposition to HM presents both challenges and exciting opportunities in the ever-evolving field of genetic counseling. This practice resource has been developed as a foundational resource for genetic counseling approaches to hereditary HMs and aims to empower genetic counselors who encounter individuals and families with HMs in their practice.

### Evolutionary history of sickle-cell mutation: Implications for global genetic medicine [^117ExpmV]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

Sickle-cell disease (SCD) is a group of blood disorders caused by mutations in HBB that promote haemoglobin (Hb) polymerization and sickling of red blood cells. The most common and most clinically severe form of SCD is sickle-cell anaemia (SCA, MIM: 603903), caused by homozygosity of the sickle-cell gene variant [HBB; c.20T > A, p. Glu6Val; OMIM: 141900 (HBB-β S)], or the co-inheritance of HBB-β S and β 0-thalassaemia. Although the HBB-β S is estimated to have originated more than 7000 years ago, with high recessive lethality and excess mortality of 50–90%, it has persisted in appreciable frequencies because of the protection that heterozygotes have against severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria.

The classical HBB-like gene cluster haplotypes remain a rich source of information for variable SCD clinical expressions and for interpreting regional and global human migrations. An estimated 300,000 babies are born each year with SCD worldwide, with nearly 75% of the births occurring in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Therefore, as global population expansion and migration rates are predicted to double in the next three decades, it is expected that the HBB-β S frequency will increase and reach places previously naïve to it. Moreover, increased awareness, newborn screening programs, and comprehensive care, including emerging therapeutics and curative interventions, will contribute to increased SCD survival and the global presence of the HBB-β S variant. This urges the need to understand the historical distribution of the gene in an evolutionary context.

### Managing sickle cell disease and related complications in pregnancy: Results of an international Delphi panel [^111j33QU]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

- **Consensus on transfusion targets**: Panelists were not aligned on the hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit levels to target when recommending prophylactic transfusion therapy for a pregnant patient with sickle cell disease (SCD). A consensus (9 of 12, 75.0%) was reached on a pretransfusion target. However, 8 of 12 panelists (66.7%) would not choose automated red blood cell exchange (aRBCx) over simple transfusion (ST) and modified/partial red blood cell exchange (mRBCx) to prevent alloimmunization, presuming the same method of red blood cell phenotyping/genotyping; thus, a consensus was not reached.

- **Recommendations for blood products**: Consensus was reached on recommending sickle trait–negative (10 of 12, 83.3%) and leukocyte-reduced (pre-storage) blood products (9 of 12, 75.0%) for pregnant individuals with SCD.

- **Transfusion modality preferences**: For prophylactic transfusions, most panelists (10 of 12, 83.3%) would recommend peripheral venous access whenever possible. Consensus (9 of 12, 75.0%) was also reached that even if venous access is difficult, the same transfusion modality would be recommended using different access. None of the panelists would change their decision to recommend transfusion in this case.

### Improving diagnostic precision, care and syndrome definitions using comprehensive next-generation sequencing for the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes [^116R9gQZ]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Phenotypic overlap among the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFSs) frequently limits the ability to establish a diagnosis based solely on clinical features. More than 70 IBMFS genes have been identified, which often renders genetic testing prolonged and costly. Since correct diagnosis, treatment, and cancer surveillance often depend on identifying the mutated gene, strategies that enable timely genotyping are essential.

- **Methods**: To overcome these challenges, we developed a next-generation sequencing assay to analyze a panel of 72 known IBMFS genes. Cases fulfilling the clinical diagnostic criteria of an IBMFS but without identified causal genotypes were included.

- **Results**: The assay was validated by detecting 52 variants previously found by Sanger sequencing. A total of 158 patients with unknown mutations were studied. Of 75 patients with known IBMFS categories (e.g. Fanconi anemia), 59% had causal mutations. Among 83 patients with unclassified IBMFSs, we found causal mutations and established the diagnosis in 18% of the patients. The assay detected mutant genes that had not previously been reported to be associated with the patient phenotypes. In other cases, the assay led to amendments of diagnoses. In 20% of genotype cases, the results indicated a cancer surveillance program.

- **Conclusions**: The novel assay is efficient, accurate, and has a major impact on patient care.

### A novel 33-gene targeted resequencing panel provides accurate, clinical-grade diagnosis and improves patient management for rare inherited anaemias [^117NSHiT]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Use of the ORCP to make an accurate molecular diagnosis had life-changing impacts for several patients and their families, particularly for patients P9 and P54. For these patients, a new diagnosis of PK deficiency led to transfusion independence and cessation of iron chelation following splenectomy. PK deficiency had previously been missed due to repeatedly normal PK enzyme levels, a well-recognized pitfall, especially in transfusion-dependent patients.

For patient P44, who was initially misdiagnosed as CDA-I, the correct diagnosis of DBA significantly changed the prognosis, response to therapy, and genetic counseling offered to the family. This case was atypical for DBA, as there was initial reticulocytosis and erythroid hyperplasia observed in three separate marrow aspirations, leading DBA not to be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Targeted NGS offers several advantages over traditional specialized investigations used to diagnose congenital anaemia. Firstly, the risk of a wrong diagnosis is reduced given the practical and technical limitations of biochemical assays and EM interpretation without molecular confirmation. Indeed, our study shows that misdiagnosis of CDA-I is fairly common, as the degree of bone marrow dyserythropoiesis in haemolytic conditions, although noted in previous case reports, remains under-appreciated. Cases of CDA-I submitted for molecular analysis were not felt to show CDA-I-specific features when reviewed by our specialist pathologist, highlighting the difficulty of relying on morphological findings alone to make a diagnosis.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: who and how to test [^111fhkxR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals to pediatric and adult hematology practices. The differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most cases are acquired, particularly in adults, but many can be inherited, and some may have manifestations affecting other organ systems. The first step — defining whether the symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up — can be as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is excessive? How low a platelet count is concerning?

Once the decision to pursue further studies is made, the diagnostic process can become complex due to the increasing number of available laboratory tests. This article outlines a general approach for evaluating patients suspected of having an inherited platelet disorder. Included are two clinical vignettes as introductions to the diagnostic approach for such conditions. The rationale for different types of clinically available tests is described, alongside their limitations and the challenges frequently encountered during result interpretation. Guidance is also provided on the expected phenotype concerning bleeding severity and thrombocytopenia, correlated with the disorder's etiology. The goal is to furnish practicing hematologists with a practical framework applicable to their daily practice.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^116ApezM]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

CDA-I remains a rare disorder, sharing similar hurdles and obstacles faced by patients with other rare conditions. The implementation of gene panels as part of routine testing is expected to reduce delays in diagnosis. An earlier diagnosis should enable treatment before iron overload and related organ damage develop. Due to its rarity, CDA-I patients should have at least annual reviews at a center specializing in rare anemias, with access to specialized monitoring and multidisciplinary meetings. Clinicians involved should be part of national and international networks of experts who collaborate to provide optimal care and facilitate research developments.

EuroBloodNet, a European rare disease network, supports trans-national efforts and knowledge sharing. Patients with rare conditions also benefit from the support offered by national patient networks. A recent James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership highlighted the top research question important to these patients and their families: "Would a national formal network of clinicians with expertise and/or a national MDT (multidisciplinary team meeting) improve care for patients with rare inherited anemias?" Therefore, collaboration between clinicians, patients, and research partners is critical to ensuring optimal clinical care for CDA-I.

### An empirical estimate of carrier frequencies for 400+ causal Mendelian variants: Results from an ethnically diverse clinical sample of 23,453 individuals [^111M7QJo]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: The multiplex platform used for screening is the Universal Genetic Test (Counsyl, South San Francisco, CA). It employs high-throughput genotyping to identify disease-causing variants and corresponding wild-type alleles. A total of 417 disease-causing mutations linked to 108 recessive diseases were assayed and interpreted via fluorescent sequences. A subset of the diseases identifiable through this platform is listed in Supplementary Table S1 online. Previous reports indicate that the platform's analytical performance compares favorably with traditional single-gene testing methods. It's important to note that our reported disease carrier frequencies are lower bounds, as there are variants for each disease that the assay platform does not test.

- **Study population**: The study consisted of 23,453 individuals. Referral sources included family practitioners, geneticists, genetic counselors, obstetricians, perinatologists, and reproductive endocrinologists. All patients provided documented informed consent, including consent to research, which is on record at our facility. Institutional review board exemption applies due to the de-identification of the data presented (45 CFR part 46.101(b)(4)). Genetic counseling was made available at no cost to all tested individuals. Funding was performed as a fee-for-service, typically reimbursed through third-party payers.

- **Disease panels**: Diseases identifiable via the test platform range in severity from mild to incompatible with life. Nearly every disease can be considered severe, as they are associated with infant or child mortality.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: An updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^115cUkx1]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

The guideline panel recognized the paucity of evidence favoring the use of extended matching strategies. Well-designed, adequately resourced studies are needed to inform how to reduce alloimmunization and hence the risks related to transfusion, especially in vulnerable patient groups who rely on transfusion as a primary treatment for their conditions. Specific matching strategies, if implemented, may need to be further adapted for different areas of the world depending on donor profiles.

### Uncovering the genetic etiology of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes using a custom-designed next-generation sequencing panel [^1135ftir]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2024). High credibility.

Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) are a group of heterogeneous disorders that account for approximately 30% of pediatric cases of bone marrow failure and are often associated with developmental abnormalities and cancer predisposition. This article reports the laboratory validation and clinical utility of a large-scale, custom-designed next-generation sequencing panel, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) IBMFS panel, for the diagnosis of IBMFS in a cohort of pediatric patients. This panel demonstrated excellent analytic accuracy, with 100% sensitivity, ≥ 99.99% specificity, and 100% reproducibility on validation samples.

In 269 patients with suspected IBMFS, this next-generation sequencing panel was used for identifying single-nucleotide variants, small insertions/deletions, and copy number variations in mosaic or nonmosaic status. Sixty-one pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (54 single-nucleotide variants/insertions/deletions and 7 copy number variations) and 24 hypomorphic variants were identified, resulting in the molecular diagnosis of IBMFS in 21 cases (7.8%) and exclusion of IBMFS with a diagnosis of a blood disorder in 10 cases (3.7%). Secondary findings, including evidence of early hematologic malignancies and other hereditary cancer-predisposition syndromes, were observed in 9 cases (3.3%).

The CHOP IBMFS panel was highly sensitive and specific, with a significant increase in the diagnostic yield of IBMFS. These findings suggest that next-generation sequencing-based panel testing should be a part of routine diagnostics in patients with suspected IBMFS.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: An updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^113axe6v]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Implications for low-middle income countries: A 2021 global survey estimated that the number of patients living with SCD was 7.74 million worldwide (95% CI 6.5–9.2), of whom 5.7 million (95% uncertainty interval 4.8–6.6) lived in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where, according to one recent systematic review, transfusion for SCD is the second most common reason for transfusion overall. Approximately 7% of transfused SCD patients in SSA may have clinically significant RBC alloantibodies. In high-resource countries, it is often standard practice to provide patients with haemoglobinopathies with extended matched RBC units. However, this can be challenging in low/low-middle income countries (LMIC) due to several factors: the genetic diversity of blood group antigens among patients and donors, limited blood supply, and scarce testing resources. This situation is exacerbated by the insufficiency of antigen testing, even for common RBC antigens such as RhD, RhCcEe, and K, and the lack of historical records (even within single institutions), making it difficult to achieve the same standard of care in these regions. Ethnic differences between blood donors and recipients in different regions of the world may further limit the value of common generalizable recommendations. The higher prevalence of Ro (short notation of the Rh system cDe haplotype) in people of African ancestry compared with other populations may have specific implications for RhD and RhCcEe matching, as potential donors from this background are more likely to be RhCcEe, as well as K, matched to patients with SCD.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on haemochromatosis [^116iZ1Ty]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly in relation to genetic testing, the EASL 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining genetic testing for hemochromatosis. This should be done after informed consent for genetic testing has been obtained and is advised for adult patients with a positive family history of first-degree relatives with hemochromatosis.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: An updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^113BuwBK]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Other initiatives to reduce alloimmunisation should continue to be considered. These include patient education, the provision of alert cards which can be presented at each hospital visit to ensure the use of appropriate antigen‐negative RBCs, and data sharing of red cell immunohematology test results between hospitals. This is especially important in the absence of centralised transfusion records, which increases the risk of delayed HTRs from antibodies that show anamnesis and are not detectable on the antibody screen.

It should, however, be noted that alloantibody formation can occur despite extended RBC matching and other measures detailed above. For instance, alloantibodies may be formed in 1.2% of pregnancies, with clinically significant antibodies less commonly seen at 0.4%, in the absence of any transfusions being given. Furthermore, even extended antigen matching will not be able to match all 362 currently recognised RBC antigens. While high-frequency and clinically significant antigens are aimed to be included in all extended matching strategies, less frequently occurring RBC antigens still have the potential to cause alloimmunisation when discrepancies in recipient and donor RBC antigens occur.

It should also be recognised that disparity in donor/recipient RBC antigens may vary globally. This has implications for readers and clinicians interpreting data from studies with different countries of origin. If, for example, donor and recipient populations are well matched, recipients might be more likely to get antigen‐matched units by chance.

### Diagnosis of inherited bleeding disorders in the genomic era [^114tLbSF]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Inherited bleeding disorders affect between 1 in 1,000 individuals for the most common disorder, von Willebrand Disease, to only 8 reported cases worldwide of alpha-2-antiplasmin deficiency. Those with an identifiable abnormality can be divided into disorders of coagulation factors (87%), platelet count and function (8%), and the fibrinolytic system (3%). Of the patients registered in the UK with a bleeding disorder, the remaining 2% are unclassifiable.

In addition to bleeding symptoms, patients with an inherited bleeding disorder can manifest other abnormalities, making an accurate and complete diagnosis that reflects the underlying molecular pathology important. Although some inherited bleeding disorders can still be easily diagnosed through a combination of careful clinical assessment and laboratory assays of varying degrees of complexity, there are many where conventional approaches are inadequate. Improvements in phenotyping assays have enhanced our diagnostic armoury, but genotyping now offers the most accurate and complete diagnosis for some of these conditions. The advent of next-generation sequencing technology has meant that many genes can now be analysed routinely in clinical practice. Here, we discuss the different diagnostic tools currently available for inherited bleeding disorders and suggest that genotyping should be incorporated at an early stage in the diagnostic pathway.

### A novel 33-gene targeted resequencing panel provides accurate, clinical-grade diagnosis and improves patient management for rare inherited anaemias [^114TbJHC]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). High credibility.

Here, we report the development and application of a novel clinical-grade open-source tool for evaluation of 'per-base coverage' in a 33-gene targeted NGS panel (Oxford Red Cell Panel, ORCP) used to provide a clinical diagnosis to patients with unexplained anaemia. Specifically, we aimed to:

- **Demonstrate feasibility**: Achieving clinical-grade validation of a targeted re-sequencing panel for congenital anaemias.
- **Develop open-source tool**: Evaluation of read coverage.
- **Assess diagnostic yield**: This strategy for congenital anaemias.
- **Assess clinical impact**: Results generated using this approach.

To select the genes for inclusion in the ORCP, we chose to take a relatively unbiased approach by including causative genes for conditions where anaemia may be part of a wider bone marrow failure syndrome, as well as those for specific red cell disorders, such as Diamond–Blackfan Anaemia (DBA) and Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anaemia (CDA).

### Emqn best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^113M5u29]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Haemoglobinopathies constitute the most common recessive monogenic disorders worldwide, and the treatment of affected individuals presents a substantial global disease burden. Carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis represent valuable procedures that identify couples at risk for having affected children, so that they can be offered options to have healthy offspring. Molecular diagnosis facilitates prenatal diagnosis and definitive diagnosis of carriers and patients, especially in "atypical" cases who often have complex genotype interactions. However, the haemoglobin disorders are unique among all genetic diseases in that identification of carriers is preferable by haematological (biochemical) tests rather than DNA analysis. These best practice guidelines offer an overview of recommended strategies and methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of haemoglobinopathies, and emphasize the importance of appropriately applying and interpreting haematological tests in supporting the optimum application and evaluation of globin gene DNA analysis.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: Transfusion support [^114m8LT8]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Red cell transfusions remain a mainstay of therapy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but pose significant clinical challenges. Guidance for specific indications and administration of transfusion, as well as screening, prevention, and management of alloimmunization, delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs), and iron overload may improve outcomes.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to develop evidence-based guidelines to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about transfusion support for SCD and the management of transfusion-related complications.

- **Methods**: The American Society of Hematology formed a multidisciplinary panel that was balanced to minimize bias from conflicts of interest and included a patient representative. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes. The Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Research Program supported the guideline development process. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to form recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

- **Results**: The panel developed 10 recommendations focused on red cell antigen typing and matching, indications, and mode of administration (simple versus red cell exchange), as well as screening, prevention, and management of alloimmunization, DHTRs, and iron overload.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of panel recommendations were conditional due to the paucity of direct, high-certainty evidence for outcomes of interest. Research priorities were identified, including prospective studies.

### Diagnosis and clinical management of enzymopathies [^112fShRx]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Low credibility.

At least 16 genetically determined conditions qualify as red blood cell enzymopathies. They range in frequency from ultrarare to rare, with the exception of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, which is very common. Nearly all these enzymopathies manifest as chronic hemolytic anemias, with an onset often in the neonatal period. The diagnosis can be quite easy, such as when a child presents with dark urine after eating fava beans, or it can be quite difficult, such as when an adult presents with mild anemia and gallstones.

In general, four steps are recommended:

- **Recognizing chronic hemolytic anemia**: Identify symptoms and laboratory markers indicative of chronic hemolytic anemia.
- **Excluding acquired causes**: Rule out non-genetic origins of the symptoms to ensure accurate diagnosis.
- **Excluding hemoglobinopathies and membranopathies**: Differentiate between similar conditions to focus on enzymopathies.
- **Pinpointing which red blood cell enzyme is deficient**: Utilize one or multiple enzyme assays; alternatively, DNA testing against an appropriate gene panel can combine steps three and four for efficiency.

Most patients with a red blood cell enzymopathy can be managed with good supportive care, including blood transfusion, iron chelation when necessary, and splenectomy in selected cases. However, some patients have serious extraerythrocytic manifestations that are difficult to manage. In the absence of these, red blood cell enzymopathies are, in principle, amenable to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy/gene editing.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: An updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^112grSX2]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

This updated literature review and evidence-based clinical practice guideline continue to struggle to make recommendations for a beneficial role of extended matching of RBCs for patients with SCD and thalassemia, a group with significant transfusion exposure and a high burden of clinically relevant alloimmunization. This largely results from the lack of high-quality evidence and uncertainty about whether extended matching reduces the risk of alloimmunization or HTRs in this patient population.

Our review has highlighted multiple research needs. Above all, well-designed studies, with clear analysis plans for reporting alloimmunization rates in the context of pre-study baseline transfusion information, are required. Research priorities should include:

- **Improving our understanding**: How patient factors, such as ethnicity and genetic modifiers of alloimmunization risk (which may vary globally) and the clinical context in which transfusions are administered (e.g. episodic or chronic, elective or during acute illness) may influence the role of extended matching.

- **Identifying which patients benefit most**: Whether subgroups of patients might be better suited to different policies for extended matching.

- **Evaluating the clinical and operational impact**: The effect of implementing policies for extended prophylactic matching on patients with existing alloantibodies.

- **Assessing the impact of genotyping technologies**: How genotyping technologies may affect the ability to deliver extended matched RBCs and better define the need/ability to match for variants.

### Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency: 2015 status report [^117V481g]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Since pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) was first described 55 years ago, our understanding of the red cell defect, the clinical and genetic variability, supportive care, and potential complications has expanded. Despite this understanding, supportive care continues as the main clinical strategy, and evidence for monitoring complications is lacking. In a rare disease with many potential complications, guidelines for supportive care and monitoring are critical. It is our hope that the international Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency Natural History Study will improve our understanding of this rare anemia. As our understanding of PKD is enhanced, we anticipate a faster rate of progress in the discovery of new therapeutic interventions.

### Advances in understanding the mechanisms of erythropoiesis in homeostasis and disease [^11469hHp]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Anaemia, or decreased blood haemoglobin, is the most common blood disorder, often characterized by reduced red blood cell (RBC) numbers. RBCs are produced from the differentiation and commitment of haematopoietic stem cells to the erythroid lineage by a process called erythropoiesis. Coordination of erythropoietin receptor signalling with several erythroid transcription factors, including GATA1, is essential for this process.

A number of additional players critical for RBC production have been identified in recent years. Major technological advances, such as the development of RNA interference, genetically modified animals including zebrafish, and imaging flow cytometry, have led to these discoveries. The emergence of -omics approaches in combination with the optimization of ex vivo erythroid cultures has also produced a more comprehensive understanding of erythropoiesis.

Here we summarize studies describing novel regulators of erythropoiesis that modulate erythroid cell production in the context of human erythroid disorders involving hypoxia, iron regulation, immune-related molecules, and the transcription factor FOXO3.

### Genetic predisposition to hematologic malignancies: Management and surveillance [^115f8RGi]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

As individuals with germline predisposition to hematologic malignancies are diagnosed with increasing frequency, the need for clinical surveillance has become apparent. Unfortunately, few prospective data are available, so recommendations are based on collective experience and expert consensus. There is general agreement to advocate for expert consultation or referral of patients to centers with expertise in these syndromes, since presentations and disease progression can be subtle, and treatment strategies must be tailored. Here, we summarize and integrate expert consensus recommendations and medical management considerations for the patient newly diagnosed with a leukemia predisposition disorder. Indications to consider additional studies and referral for allogeneic stem cell transplantation are also discussed.

For this paper, cases reported formally and anecdotally to the authors in their screening and diagnostic roles have been selected to demonstrate areas where errors have occurred, and caution should be exercised. The cases demonstrate that it is vital that the performance and limitations of the techniques used, along with the phenotypic presentation of cases where haemoglobin variants and/or thalassaemias are co-inherited, are understood by those performing result interpretation. Those who deliver the service, as well as those who receive reports and provide results and counseling, should be aware of the complexity of the topic.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: An updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^112eTvRt]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) antigen matching beyond ABO and RhD is commonly recommended for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassaemia. We present an updated systematic literature review to inform evidence-based guidelines on RBC matching. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool was used to develop recommendations. Six new observational studies (4 prospective, 2 retrospective) were identified, reporting on 583 patients in total, including cross-over designs, with sample sizes ranging from 10 to 343. These studies were heterogeneous, utilizing varying degrees of RBC matching and different definitions for 'extended' matching. All reported on alloimmunisation, with one study specifically reporting on molecular matching.

The reported prevalence of alloimmunisation using limited matching was 0%-50%, while with extended matching, it was 0%-24%. Notably, 82 patients were alloimmunised before study entry. The risk of bias across studies was moderate to critical. The guideline panel recommends that ABO, RhDCcEe, and K-compatible RBCs are selected for individuals with SCD and thalassaemia, even in the absence of alloantibodies. Additionally, RBCs which are antigen-negative to already existing clinically significant antibodies should be chosen. There is an expressed need for comparative research to define the benefit, impact, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility of extended RBC matching strategies to prevent alloimmunisation.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: An updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^1175HcDL]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

For this guideline, we wanted to understand the values and preferences of patient representatives with lived experiences of haemoglobinopathies as patients, caregivers, or patient advocates. Patient representatives indicated that high value should be placed on avoiding the adverse effects of alloimmunisation associated with RBC transfusion without compromising the timely supply of blood as needed (e.g. during surgery or in emergencies). The patient representatives were aware of the value of conserving resources related to RBC transfusions and the ongoing need to ensure that the blood donor population appropriately reflected the serological needs of transfused patients, which will vary globally. Patient representatives acknowledged the importance of a diverse and appropriately sized donor pool and being able to ensure rare blood is allocated equitably, which are considerable challenges, particularly in low- and middle-resource country settings.

The GRADE evidence assessment for studies reporting the proportion of patients developing clinically significant antibodies and the volume/units of RBCs transfused is presented in Table 3. As seen in the table, the certainty of evidence to recommend an extended matching strategy for both outcomes is very low. This is due to the high risk of bias (RoB) across studies reporting on both outcomes and high inconsistency due to treatment arms not being equal in size across studies, different follow-up times, and indirectness, as some studies did not report the standard of care.

### Sickle cell disease: Current activities, public health implications, and future directions [^113zoPsX]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder caused by abnormal hemoglobin that damages and deforms red blood cells (RBCs). The abnormal red cells break down, causing anemia, and obstruct blood vessels, leading to episodes of severe pain and multiorgan ischemic damage. SCD affects millions of people throughout the world and is particularly common among people whose ancestors come from sub-Saharan Africa.

Sickle cell trait (SCT) is an inherited condition in which both normal hemoglobin and sickle hemoglobin are produced in the RBCs. SCT is not a type of sickle cell disease, and people with SCT are generally healthy. In SCD, clinical severity varies, ranging from mild and sometimes asymptomatic states to severe symptoms requiring hospitalization. Symptomatic treatments exist, but there is no cure for SCD.

Although there has been extensive clinical and basic science research in SCD, many public health issues such as blood safety surveillance, compliance with immunizations, follow-up of newborns with positive screening tests, stroke prevention, pregnancy complications, pain prevention, quality of life, and thrombosis in people with SCT remain unaddressed.

Currently, efforts are underway to strengthen SCD-related activities within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). At the time of writing, several activities have been or are being conducted by centers within the CDC, including quality assurance of newborn screening tests for SCD, morbidity and mortality studies, genetic studies, and studies focusing on the protective effects of SCT for malaria.

### A novel 33-gene targeted resequencing panel provides accurate, clinical-grade diagnosis and improves patient management for rare inherited anaemias [^115RTLeK]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Typically, the diagnosis of unexplained congenital anaemia involves sequential investigations, including routine haematological and biochemical tests, followed by specialized tests (e.g. red cell enzyme assays, bone marrow morphology) and, finally, testing of individual genes directed by these investigations. Our targeted panel may allow the diagnostic pathway to be shortened by performing NGS before specialized investigations. For many patients, this could dramatically reduce the time to diagnosis and the number of expensive, complex tests, as specific confirmatory tests can be targeted to individual patients to confirm the molecular diagnosis. Indeed, the average time to diagnosis for the five new/changed diagnoses in our study was 3.3 years, rather than 3 months had NGS been available earlier. However, we acknowledge that several strategies will be needed to increase the diagnostic yield of targeted NGS for congenital anaemia before this approach will replace conventional diagnostic approaches. In particular, we plan to include a larger number of red cell enzyme genes and add red cell membrane genes to the panel. Furthermore, the diagnostic utility of such panels depends on a regular process of review to accommodate relevant newly identified pathogenic and modifying mutations in genes and their promoters and regulatory elements. It is likely that whole exome sequencing or whole genome sequencing, which provide a much more comprehensive, unbiased approach, will replace targeted sequencing in the future. At present, however, the use of a restricted, targeted panel remains relevant.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^113QBwuA]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Haematology results should be reported following a complete evaluation of all relevant haematological parameters. Reporting must comply with local legislation, regulations, and acceptable practice. The report should be written clearly to avoid misinterpretation and, if possible, accompanied by relevant informational materials. This is particularly important for health practitioners in non-endemic countries who may lack experience with haemoglobinopathies.

It is advised that the report recommend the referral of carrier couples or affected children to a relevant healthcare professional and encourage testing to be offered to additional family members. Recommended formats for reporting haematology results can be found in the UK NHS Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia: Handbook for Laboratories.

### Real-world insights from a cohort of approximately 2000 individuals who were analysed using a freely available next-generation sequencing anaemia screening programme [^111WUkxf]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Diagnostic techniques for hereditary haemolytic anaemias (HHAs) are diverse, including red blood cell (RBC) indices, reticulocyte counts, osmotic fragility, and eosin-maleimide binding tests or measurement of RBC enzyme activity. However, some methods are technically complex or unavailable to non-specialist centres, making definitive diagnoses difficult. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) may provide a platform to diagnose a range of HHAs and overlapping clinical entities through extensive, simultaneous evaluation of multiple disease-causing genes. Inaccurate diagnosis of HHAs can have serious implications, highlighting the potential clinical utility of NGS in supplementing routine diagnostic techniques.

A real-world diagnostic programme for patients with a suspected HHA disease or carrier status, excluding haemoglobinopathies, has been available since 2018 (ARUP Laboratories® 2018–2020, AnemiaID®/Revity, Inc.® 2020–present) to provide a diagnosis using an NGS panel of HHA-associated genes. Here, we describe genetic testing results from this real-world programme to evaluate the clinical utility of NGS in supporting the diagnosis of suspected HHAs. In total, this programme evaluated 2003 individuals between 3 December 2020 and 23 February 2023.

The clinical indication for testing varied among patients, ranging from unexplained or unspecified anaemia or hyperbilirubinaemia to specific diagnoses indicated by prior clinical testing. It also included patients with a family history of haemolytic anaemia. Individuals were referred for testing based on clinicians' judgment, and the subm

### Red cell membrane disorders: Structure meets function [^114Qx2xX]. Blood (2020). Low credibility.

The mature red blood cell (RBC) lacks a nucleus and organelles characteristic of most cells, but it is elegantly structured to perform the essential function of delivering oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from all other cells while enduring the shear stress imposed by navigating small vessels and sinusoids. Over the past several decades, the efforts of biochemists, cell and molecular biologists, and hematologists have provided an appreciation of the complexity of RBC membrane structure, while studies of the RBC membrane disorders have offered valuable insights into structure-function relationships.

Within the last decade, advances in genetic testing and its increased availability have made it possible to substantially build upon this foundational knowledge. Although disorders of the RBC membrane due to altered structural organization or altered transport function are heterogeneous, they often present with common clinical findings of hemolytic anemia. However, they may require substantially different management depending on the underlying pathophysiology. Accurate diagnosis is essential to avoid emergence of complications or inappropriate interventions.

We propose an algorithm for laboratory evaluation of patients presenting with symptoms and signs of hemolytic anemia with a focus on RBC membrane disorders. Here, we review the genotypic and phenotypic variability of the RBC membrane disorders in order to raise the index of suspicion and highlight the need for correct and timely diagnosis.

### Modified Delphi panel consensus recommendations for management of severe aplastic anemia [^1174vjkM]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

Therapy for acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA) should not be delayed while awaiting test results to rule out inherited bone marrow failure (IBMF) syndromes, unless there are clinical features suggestive of an IBMF. The following tests should be obtained for all patients:

- **Comprehensive diagnostic tests**:
	- A complete blood count with differential
	- Review of peripheral blood smear
	- Reticulocyte count
	- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) assessment by flow cytometry of peripheral blood
	- Bone marrow (BM) biopsy and aspirate with karyotype

- **Cytogenetic analyses**:
	- Given the poor growth of cytogenetics culture in cases of aplastic anemia (AA) and to exclude hypocellular myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for MDS-associated cytogenic abnormalities is recommended.

- **Genetic evaluations**:
	- Somatic next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panels for genes frequently mutated in hematologic malignancies have become standard in the evaluation of suspected BM failure.
	- Although somatic mutations are commonly seen in both AA and in hypocellular MDS, the inclusion of somatic NGS sequencing panels, supported by commonly used practice guidelines, can help with baseline assessment. This includes identification of MDS-defining variants and can be informative prognostically and in longitudinal follow-up of clonal evolution.

- **HLA tissue typing**:
	- HLA tissue typing should be ordered upfront for patients of all ages who are candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

- **Ancillary studies**:
	- Comprehensive ancillary studies to exclude transient etiologies of pancytopenia (e.g. nutritional deficiencies or viral and other infections) should also be conducted in all patients.

Results

- **Search results and study selection**: A total of 3432 references were identified and screened, as presented in Figure 1. Of these, 1832 were excluded as duplicates. In total, 1600 references underwent screening review, following which 1499 were excluded. The remaining 101 references underwent full-text review, of which 93 were excluded, and eight references were considered for inclusion. Of the eight screened for full text, six references were identified for data extraction and were included in the qualitative review. All were observational studies. The evidence for the original 2018 guideline was based on 18 references (17 clinical studies and one cost-effectiveness study).

- **Figure 1**: PRISMA flow chart.

- **Study details**: Of the six new studies identified, three reported on patients with a range of different thalassaemia genotypes (most commonly HbE/ß-thalassaemia, then Hb H disease), one reported on patients with SCD, and two studies included both populations. Four studies were prospective observational, and two were retrospective observational. Two of the six studies were from Italy, two were from Thailand, and two were from the United States.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary spherocytosis [^114T4r7Z]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with regard to clinical severity, protein defects, and mode of inheritance. It is relatively common in Caucasian populations; most affected individuals have mild or only moderate haemolysis. There is usually a family history and a typical clinical and laboratory picture, so the diagnosis is often easily made without additional laboratory tests. Atypical cases may require the measurement of erythrocyte membrane proteins to clarify the nature of the membrane disorder, and in the absence of a family history, occasionally molecular genetic analysis will help to determine whether inheritance is recessive or non-dominant. It is particularly important to rule out stomatocytosis, where splenectomy is contraindicated because of the thrombotic risk.

- **Management**: Mild HS can be managed without folate supplements and does not require splenectomy. Moderately and severely affected individuals are likely to benefit from splenectomy, which should be performed after the age of 6 years, with appropriate counselling about the infection risk. In all cases, careful dialogue between doctor, patient, and the family is essential. Laparoscopic surgery, when performed by experienced surgeons, can result in a shorter hospital stay and less pain.

**Key points**: Diamond-Blackfan anemia syndrome (DBAS) is characterized by pure red cell aplasia, with 30% of cases undiagnosed, likely due to noncoding variants. Molecular diagnoses of DBAS require careful analysis beyond the coding regions, which are typically not fully covered or analyzed by clinical testing.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: An updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^111KZXig]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

- **Recommendation 2**: Patients with SCD who have one or more clinically significant alloantibodies should be transfused with RBCs negative for the corresponding antigens (low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

- **Evidence summary and rationale**: No study from the updated review assessed an alternative strategy to matching for known alloantibodies in SCD. However, the risk of re-exposing patients to antigens they were previously sensitized against has been well-established, with risks of HTRs and additional antibody formation. Therefore, RBCs that are antigen-negative to the corresponding antibody should be selected for patients who have developed a clinically significant antibody, even if this antibody is no longer currently detectable.

	- It is unsurprising that there is limited evidence in this area, as it has been a standard international practice to provide RBCs which are antigen-negative to the corresponding antibody for many decades. Studies of transfusing RBCs with antigens to an existing alloantibody by intent would likely be ethically unacceptable unless the antibody had been previously established to be clinically insignificant (e.g. via monocyte monolayer assay). Although the evidence here is weak, a strong recommendation is made, as in the previous guideline, to account for case reports demonstrating the serious consequences of HTRs, particularly in SCD.

### Clinical experience with multigene carrier panels in the reproductive setting [^111qgmXn]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2018). Low credibility.

Limitations

This retrospective study comprises the experience of one commercial laboratory. Indications for testing were not evaluated, and some patients may have been tested due to a family history, which could result in a higher likelihood of a positive result. Business factors, such as increased sales in certain geographic regions, may shift the demographic characteristics of the tested population and skew the view of ordering patterns. This laboratory experience was limited to samples tested within the United States, and there may be a limited ability to generalize our findings to other countries. Positivity rates are impacted by detection rates, and like all carrier testing panels, detection rates are not uniform across all diseases tested. The assay used for this study is not diagnostic, and follow‐up information was not collected. Specifically, some positive hemoglobinopathy evaluations may have been due to iron deficiency anemia and not alpha‐thalassemia trait status. Therefore, we cannot say for certain that all patients with positive hemoglobinopathy results were true carriers; however, they were treated as at risk since follow‐up testing to further define their carrier status was recommended. This supports our conclusion that increased clinical support and education should be a consideration when choosing panel testing.

Future directions

While population‐based carrier testing for some diseases has been a routine part of prenatal care since the 1970s, the increasing use of expanded carrier testing panels and ACOG's latest carrier testing recommendations underscore the need for ongoing evaluation of testing strategies.

### Clinical implementation of genetic testing in adults for hereditary hematologic malignancy syndromes [^114tq9jh]. Genetics in Medicine (2022). High credibility.

As research on hereditary hematologic malignancy syndromes (HHMS) accumulates, cancer genetics clinics are identifying more adult hematology patients with an inherited component to their disease. However, investigations for HHMS are complex, and there is no formal consensus on genetic testing criteria.

We developed genetic testing criteria for adult hematology patients through a comprehensive literature review and our experience at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. We validated our criteria by applying them retrospectively to patients referred to our clinic for HHMS assessment.

Our genetic testing criteria are comprehensive of myeloid malignancies, lymphoid malignancies, and bone marrow failure, including age at diagnosis, family history, and genetic test results in blood and bone marrow. Of the 104 patients who met the criteria, 26% had at least one actionable variant in any gene associated with an increased risk of cancer, and 13% had an actionable variant resulting in an HHMS diagnosis. A total of 15 patients had incidental findings, including 11 patients with a pathogenic variant associated with carrier status for an autosomal recessive disorder and four patients with a mosaic result.

Our high gene positivity rate shows the utility of a broad approach to germline testing in an adult hematology population.

### Targeted mutation screening of 292 candidate genes in 38 children with inborn haematological cytopenias efficiently identifies novel disease-causing mutations [^111opR1C]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Considering the inherent difficulties often experienced with the conventional diagnostic evaluation of childhood cytopenias, their prevalent genetic origin, the plethora of potentially involved genes, and the heterogeneous types and distribution of mutations, the reassuring results presented herein strongly argue for the implementation of such targeted sequencing screening programmes in the initial diagnostic work-up of such diseases.

### Molecular diagnosis of thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies: An ACLPS critical review [^113VNYBf]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

To describe the use of molecular diagnostic techniques for patients with hemoglobin disorders.

- **Methods**: A clinical scenario is presented in which molecular diagnosis is important for genetic counseling. Globin disorders, techniques for their diagnosis, and the role of molecular genetic testing in managing patients with these disorders are described in detail.

- **Results**: Hemoglobin disorders, including thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies, are among the most common genetic diseases, and the clinical laboratory is essential for the diagnosis of patients with these abnormalities. Most disorders can be diagnosed with protein-based techniques such as electrophoresis and chromatography. Since severe syndromes can result from the inheritance of combinations of globin genetic disorders, genetic counseling is important to prevent adverse outcomes. Protein-based methods cannot always detect potentially serious thalassemia disorders; in particular, α-thalassemia may be masked in the presence of β-thalassemia. Deletional forms of β-thalassemia are also sometimes difficult to diagnose definitively with standard methods.

- **Conclusions**: Molecular genetic testing serves an important role in identifying individuals carrying thalassemia traits that can cause adverse outcomes in offspring. Furthermore, prenatal genetic testing can identify fetuses with severe globin phenotypes.

### Current clinical practices and challenges in molecular testing: A GOAL Consortium Hematopathology Working Group report [^111Gm4XR]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

- **Hematologic malignancy NGS panel design**: Figure 1 illustrates the design of NGS panels offered for hematologic malignancies by responding laboratories. Subfigure A presents a bar chart showing the number of NGS panels, including a single comprehensive cancer panel, a single comprehensive HMP, and two or more panels. Subfigure B displays a bar chart indicating the range of genes offered, from small panels with 21 to 50 genes to large panels with more than 300 genes. The number of genes offered is further stratified based on the number of NGS panels: respondents with a single comprehensive cancer panel, respondents with a single comprehensive HMP, and a combined group of respondents with more than one panel. Subfigure C generally shows excellent coverage of myeloid processes, requiring no more than five additional genes for most NGS panels. Subfigure D illustrates moderate coverage of lymphoid processes with a wider range of genes needed.

The number of genes included in the panels varied significantly from more than 300 genes (4 out of 18 [22.2%]) to 21 to 50 genes (2 out of 18 [11.1%]; Figure 1B). The four laboratories covering more than 300 genes offer or will offer testing through comprehensive cancer panels. Among the seven laboratories using a comprehensive HMP, panel sizes ranged from 21 to 50 genes to 201 to 250 genes. Gene lists for panels used to test hematologic malignancies were obtained from 13 laboratories. Two gene lists were used for comprehensive cancer panels, each covering more than 300 genes, and 11 for comprehensive HMPs, ranging in size from 21 to 50 genes to 201 to 250 genes.

### An 18-year review of hemoglobinopathy proficiency testing: Recommendations from the College of American Pathologists Hematology and Clinical Microscopy Committee [^114L4LHf]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The College of American Pathologists Hematology and Clinical Microscopy Committee implemented a hemoglobinopathy proficiency testing and education program to monitor and assess the performance of participating laboratories.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the performance of clinical laboratories for hemoglobinopathy proficiency testing from 2005 to 2023.

- **Design**: The hemoglobinopathy challenges are composed of clinical case summaries and electrophoretic and chromatographic gel and tracing images. The participants are asked to determine (1) what hemoglobin chain is affected and (2) the hemoglobinopathy diagnosis.

- **Results**: A total of 365 to 676 laboratories were enrolled in the proficiency testing program each year. Overall, the error rates for determination of the affected globin chain and a hemoglobinopathy diagnosis ranged from 0.6% to 56.5% and 0.5% to 86.5%, respectively. Twenty-three of 66 surveyed hemoglobinopathies (34.8%) had an error rate exceeding the consensus threshold of 20%. The globin gene detection error rate of the compound hemoglobinopathies was significantly higher when compared with just the α (P = .01) and β (P = .003) gene disorders. However, the error rate for the overall compound α/β-globin interpretation, although high at 23%, was not statistically significant when compared with just the α- or β-globin chain disorders. In repeat testing of the variants, there was no consistent improvement in performance.

- **Conclusions**: The program participants demonstrated variable performance, with one-third of the surveys exceeding the 20% error rate.

### Second international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^1139QjeL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, specifically regarding genetic testing, the HHT-WG 2020 guidelines recommend referring patients for genetic testing for HHT for several purposes:

- **To identify the causative mutation**: This applies to families with clinically confirmed HHT.

- **To establish a diagnosis in relatives**: This includes relatives of a patient with a known causative mutation, covering asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients and those desiring prenatal testing.

- **To assist in establishing the diagnosis**: This is relevant for patients not meeting clinical diagnostic criteria.

### Real-world insights from a cohort of approximately 2000 individuals who were analysed using a freely available next-generation sequencing anaemia screening programme [^116g1nK7]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

NGS provides a rapid, practical approach to the genetic diagnosis of HHAs and similar conditions, especially for patients in whom direct RBC testing may be inconclusive. Performing the test in the physician's office using saliva/cheek swabs, without phlebotomy, offers a practical diagnostic option, especially for neonates. In some clinical cases, such as ambiguous aetiology of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, NGS testing can allow physicians to make rapid diagnoses. In addition, kits can be mailed to, and samples generated at, patients' homes for wider access to testing; the lack of costs incurred by patients/insurers with the programme further improves testing access. There was widespread interest in the programme, with now over 6800 patients tested since 2020.

In conclusion, the programme testing results presented here demonstrate that NGS is a valuable platform for supporting HHA diagnostic workups, which may allow for earlier diagnosis and intervention, and more appropriate genetic counselling of patients with these conditions. However, as detailed phenotypic data were not available for this study, further research is needed to determine the correlation of NGS results with clinical characteristics, both in the United States and globally.

### Diagnosis and management of pyruvate kinase deficiency: International expert guidelines [^111fw121]. The Lancet Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is the most common cause of chronic congenital non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of one in 100,000 to one in 300,000 people. PK deficiency results in chronic haemolytic anaemia, with wide-ranging and serious consequences affecting health, quality of life, and mortality.

The goal of the International Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency was to develop evidence-based guidelines for the clinical care of patients with PK deficiency. These clinical guidelines were developed using GRADE methodology and the AGREE II framework. Experts were invited after considering their area of expertise, scholarly contributions in PK deficiency, and country of practice for global representation.

The expert panel included 29 expert physicians (including adult and paediatric haematologists and other subspecialists), geneticists, laboratory specialists, nurses, a guidelines methodologist, patients with PK deficiency, and caregivers from ten countries. Five key topic areas were identified. The panel prioritized key questions, and a systematic literature search was conducted to generate evidence summaries that were used in developing draft recommendations.

The expert panel then met in person to finalize and vote on recommendations according to a structured consensus procedure. An agreement of greater than or equal to 67% among the expert panel was required for the inclusion of a recommendation in the final guideline. The expert panel agreed on 31 total recommendations across five key topics.

### A novel 33-gene targeted resequencing panel provides accurate, clinical-grade diagnosis and improves patient management for rare inherited anaemias [^112GAPSf]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of rare inherited anaemias is challenging, requiring a series of complex and expensive laboratory tests. Targeted next-generation sequencing has been used to investigate these disorders, but the selection of genes on individual panels has been narrow, and the validation strategies used have fallen short of the standards required for clinical use. Clinical-grade validation of negative results requires the test to distinguish between a lack of adequate sequencing reads at the locations of known mutations and a real absence of mutations.

To achieve a clinically reliable diagnostic test and minimize false-negative results, we developed an open-source tool (CoverMi) to accurately determine base coverage and the "discoverability" of known mutations for every sample. We validated our 33-gene panel using Sanger sequencing and microarray. Our panel demonstrated 100% specificity and 99.7% sensitivity. We then analyzed 57 clinical samples: molecular diagnoses were made in 22/57 (38.6%), corresponding to 32 mutations, of which 16 were new. In all cases, accurate molecular diagnosis had a positive impact on clinical management.

Using a validated-based platform for routine molecular diagnosis of previously undiagnosed congenital anaemias is feasible in a clinical diagnostic setting. It improves precise diagnosis and enhances the management and counselling of the patient and their family.

### The current state of sickle cell trait: Implications for reproductive and genetic counseling [^113PNc4g]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Sickle cell trait (SCT) is unique among the carrier states identified during newborn screening. Unlike other heterozygous states for rare recessive diseases, SCT is exceedingly prevalent throughout regions of the world, making sickle cell disease one of the most common monogenetic diseases worldwide. Because of this high frequency, reproductive counseling is of paramount importance. In addition, unlike other carrier states, SCT seems to be a risk factor for several clinical complications, such as extreme exertional injury, chronic kidney disease, and venous thromboembolism. Increasing knowledge about these clinical outcomes can help inform genetic counseling recommendations. Expanding research and clinical efforts are needed to ensure that the promises of modern and precision medicine can be delivered to the millions of SCT carriers and their children.

### High-throughput sequencing approaches for diagnosing hereditary bleeding and platelet disorders [^113twZmP]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). High credibility.

Hereditary bleeding and platelet disorders (BPDs) are characterized by marked genetic heterogeneity, which is far greater than previously appreciated. The list of genes involved in the regulation of megakaryopoiesis, platelet formation, platelet function, and bleeding has been growing rapidly since the introduction of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) approaches in research. Thanks to the gradual adoption of HTS in diagnostic practice, these discoveries are improving the diagnostic yield for BPD patients, who may or may not present with bleeding problems and often exhibit other clinical symptoms unrelated to the blood system.

However, it was previously found that screening for all known etiologies provides a diagnostic yield of over 90% when the phenotype closely matches a known BPD but drops to 10% when the phenotype is indicative of a novel disorder. Thus, further research is needed to identify currently unknown etiologies for BPDs. Novel genes are likely to be implicated in BPDs, and new modes of inheritance, including digenic inheritance, are likely to play a role in some cases. Additionally, identifying and interpreting pathogenic variants outside exons is a looming challenge that can only be tackled with an improved understanding of the regulatory landscape of relevant cell types and with the transition from targeted sequencing to whole-genome sequencing in the clinic.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^116214YP]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Screening is distinct from definitive diagnosis in that the purpose of screening is to test for a defined set of conditions using simple haematological/biochemical tests. Screening programme strategies use first- and second-line methods in order to obtain a reliable diagnosis, albeit essentially a presumptive diagnosis. If an unequivocal, definitive diagnosis is required, characterization methods based on either protein or DNA analysis must be used.

With the thalassaemias, screening will detect most cases of raised Hb A2 β-thalassaemia trait. However, there are often samples that present with haematology that is not consistent with typical β-thalassaemia trait, and furthermore, there is no specific screening test of high-enough sensitivity for the clear identification of heterozygous α-thalassaemia, which is usually indicated once other states have been excluded. Definitive diagnosis of atypical cases and α-thalassaemia can only be made by DNA analysis.

When an abnormal haemoglobin is identified by screening methodology, the results obtained constitute a presumptive identification of the variant haemoglobin. It is important to remember that with phenotypic screening, it is possible that some rarer conditions will not be detected, and this has to be taken into account in the interpretation and reporting of results. For all samples, screening using haematological methods precedes genetic diagnosis.

Good laboratory practice also includes the minimization of clerical errors, particularly a danger in haematology.

### New monogenic disorders identify more pathways to neutropenia: From the clinic to next-generation sequencing [^114ZVGru]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Neutrophils are the most common type of leukocyte in human circulating blood and constitute one of the chief mediators for innate immunity. Defined as a reduction from a normal distribution of values, neutropenia results from a number of congenital and acquired conditions. Neutropenia may be insignificant, temporary, or associated with a chronic condition with or without a vulnerability to life-threatening infections. As an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, neutropenia may be associated with transformation to myeloid malignancy. Recognition of an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome may be delayed into adulthood.

The list of monogenic neutropenia disorders is growing, heterogeneous, and bewildering. Furthermore, greater knowledge of immune-mediated and drug-related causes makes the diagnosis and management of neutropenia challenging. Recognition of syndromic presentations and especially the introduction of next-generation sequencing are improving the accuracy and expediency of diagnosis as well as their clinical management. Furthermore, identification of monogenic neutropenia disorders is shedding light on the molecular mechanisms of granulopoiesis and myeloid malignancies.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance of Diamond-Blackfan anaemia syndrome: International consensus statement [^115bvaUx]. The Lancet Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (DBA), first described over 80 years ago, is a congenital disorder of erythropoiesis with a predilection for birth defects and cancer. Despite scientific advances, this chronic, debilitating, and life-limiting disorder continues to cause a substantial physical, psychological, and financial toll on patients and their families. The highly complex medical needs of affected patients require specialised expertise and multidisciplinary care. However, gaps remain in effectively bridging scientific discoveries to clinical practice and disseminating the latest knowledge and best practices to providers.

Following the publication of the first international consensus in 2008, advances in our understanding of the genetics, natural history, and clinical management of DBA have strongly supported the need for new consensus recommendations. In 2014 in Freiburg, Germany, a panel of 53 experts, including clinicians, diagnosticians, and researchers from 27 countries, convened. With support from patient advocates, the panel met repeatedly over subsequent years, engaging in ongoing discussions. These meetings led to the development of new consensus recommendations in 2024, replacing the previous guidelines. To account for the diverse phenotypes, including presentation without anaemia, the panel agreed to adopt the term DBA syndrome.

- **Diagnostic criteria**: We propose new simplified diagnostic criteria, describe the genetics of DBA syndrome and its phenocopies, and introduce major changes in therapeutic standards. These changes include lowering the prednisone maintenance dose to a maximum of 0.3 mg/kg.
