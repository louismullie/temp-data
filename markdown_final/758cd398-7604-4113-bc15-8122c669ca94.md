## Question

During an EGD, a mid-esophageal biopsy showed 14 eosinophils, while the Z-line had 6 eosinophils; if combined (> 15), does this give the patient a diagnosis of EoE?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether eosinophil counts from different biopsy sites (for example, 14 eosinophils/hpf in the mid esophagus and 6 eosinophils/hpf at the Z-line) can be combined to meet the ≥ 15 eosinophils/hpf histologic threshold for diagnosing eosinophilic esophagitis, and what that implies for the diagnosis and next steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal diagnostic criteria and exactly how eosinophils are counted. Then, I should verify the purpose of taking biopsies from multiple esophageal levels. Next, I will examine whether the Z-line is an appropriate anatomic site for EoE histology. After that, I need to check if "summing" counts across sites is ever acceptable. Finally, I will consider other required elements of diagnosis and the best next steps given a peak count of 14 eos/hpf in squamous mucosa and 6 eos/hpf at the Z-line [^117RxzeH].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic standard, because I need to ensure we are applying the right threshold the right way. The ACG 2025 guideline defines EoE as symptoms of esophageal dysfunction plus a peak eosinophil count of at least 15 eosinophils in a single high-power field on esophageal squamous mucosal biopsy, after evaluating for other causes of esophageal eosinophilia, and that peak is assessed per field in a given biopsy fragment rather than as a composite across sites or fragments, so the unit of decision-making is the highest eosinophil density in any one high-power field of esophageal squamous epithelium, not an aggregate total from multiple levels or jars [^117RxzeH] [^116Fjc1M].

> Next, I should review why we take multiple biopsies from different esophageal levels, because I need to verify whether "more samples" implies "summed counts". EoE is histologically patchy, so guidelines advise obtaining at least six esophageal biopsies split across at least two levels, typically proximal/mid and distal esophagus, to increase sensitivity for detecting a single qualifying peak field, not to allow mathematical combination of sub-threshold counts from different sites into one diagnostic number, and specimens from proximal and distal esophagus should be placed in separate containers to preserve anatomic context for interpretation rather than to permit cross-site pooling of counts [^113P2hkZ] [^1143HK2z].

> I will now examine the anatomic sites you mentioned, because I should confirm whether both are valid for EoE histology. The mid-esophageal 14 eos/hpf is within esophageal squamous mucosa but remains below the diagnostic threshold; the Z-line sample with 6 eos/hpf is at the gastroesophageal junction, a transition zone where eosinophils can be influenced by reflux-related changes and gastric cardia mucosa and is not the target site for establishing esophageal squamous eosinophilia for EoE, so I should not use a Z-line or gastric-adjacent specimen to "boost" an esophageal peak count, and I need to be cautious because GERD and junctional mucosa can host eosinophils at low levels that are not specific for EoE [^117RxzeH] [^115VzzMz] [^116pNJyL].

> Hold on, I should verify the counting convention before drawing conclusions. Histologic assessment uses the peak eosinophil density per single high-power field within squamous esophageal epithelium, and there is no guideline support for summing eosinophils from different anatomic levels or fragments to surpass 15 eos/hpf; instead, pathologists report the maximum count found in any one field, and endoscopists are advised to keep proximal and distal biopsies in separate jars to facilitate site-specific interpretation, further underscoring that counts are not meant to be combined across sites [^112c5nwP] [^1143HK2z] [^11183TD3].

> Let me consider the other diagnostic requirements, because I need to ensure the full clinicopathologic framework is satisfied. Diagnosis still requires compatible symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and exclusion of other causes of esophageal eosinophilia; at first glance I might say this particularly requires an 8-week PPI trial to rule out PPI-responsive eosinophilia, but wait, let me verify the current standard — updated guidelines no longer require a PPI trial to establish the diagnosis of EoE, although PPIs remain both a therapeutic option and part of the evaluation to exclude alternative etiologies if clinical suspicion dictates, so the key is documenting symptoms, peak ≥ 15 eos/hpf in squamous mucosa, and reasonable exclusion of competing causes rather than a mandatory pre-diagnostic PPI step [^117RxzeH] [^116Fjc1M] [^112pk8m8].

> Given a peak of 14 eos/hpf in the mid esophagus and 6 eos/hpf at the Z-line, let me think about prudent next steps, because I should double-check that we do not miss patchy disease. I would correlate with symptoms and endoscopic features using a standardized score such as EREFS, consider initiating PPI therapy as a reasonable first-line option, and if clinical suspicion for EoE remains high, repeat endoscopy with adequate sampling — at least six targeted squamous biopsies from at least two esophageal levels — because a single qualifying peak ≥ 15 eos/hpf in squamous mucosa on any fragment would meet histologic criteria, whereas sub-threshold peaks do not, and remission or response in follow-up is typically assessed by achieving less than 15 eos/hpf on histology alongside symptom and endoscopic improvement [^116ZQyA4] [^111n3EmQ] [^113P2hkZ] [^1141LkzX].

> Final check and conclusion: I should confirm that combining 14 eos/hpf from the mid esophagus with 6 eos/hpf from the Z-line to claim 20 eos/hpf is not acceptable, and after re-review, counts cannot be summed across different biopsy sites; the current data therefore do not meet the histologic threshold for EoE, and further evaluation with guideline-concordant sampling and clinical correlation is indicated rather than making the diagnosis based on aggregated counts from disparate locations [^117RxzeH] [^1143HK2z].

No, the patient does not meet diagnostic criteria for EoE because the **peak eosinophil count is below 15 eos/hpf** [^1141LkzX] in all esophageal biopsies, and the Z-line is not considered esophageal tissue for EoE diagnosis. EoE requires **≥ 15 eos/hpf in at least one esophageal biopsy** [^117RxzeH] plus symptoms and exclusion of other causes; counts from different sites are not summed, and Z-line counts are excluded. The patient has esophageal eosinophilia but does not meet EoE criteria [^117RxzeH]; further evaluation for GERD [^1177wzrj], PPI-responsive eosinophilia [^113YVynW], and other causes is recommended [^112pk8m8] [^112c5nwP].

---

## Diagnostic criteria for EoE

According to the **ACG 2025 guidelines**, EoE is diagnosed when all of the following criteria are met [^117RxzeH] [^11183TD3]:

- **Symptoms**: Esophageal dysfunction (e.g. dysphagia, food impaction, chest pain, refractory heartburn) [^1177wzrj].
- **Histology**: ≥ 15 eos/hpf in at least one esophageal biopsy.
- **Exclusion**: Other causes of esophageal eosinophilia (e.g. GERD, PPI-responsive eosinophilia, infections, systemic eosinophilic disorders) [^112pk8m8].

---

## Histologic threshold and biopsy site considerations

The **histologic threshold** for EoE is **≥ 15 eos/hpf in at least one esophageal biopsy** [^117RxzeH] [^1141LkzX]. Because EoE is patchy [^111fE3YY], obtain multiple biopsies from different esophageal levels to improve diagnostic yield [^112c5nwP] [^1143HK2z]. Diagnosis relies on the **peak count in a single esophageal biopsy** — counts across sites are not combined. The Z-line (squamocolumnar junction) **is not considered esophageal tissue for EoE diagnosis**; eosinophils there may reflect reflux or other non-EoE processes and are excluded from the diagnostic threshold.

---

## Clinical significance of eosinophil counts below the diagnostic threshold

Eosinophil counts below **15 eos/hpf** are nonspecific and may occur in GERD, PPI-responsive eosinophilia, infections, or systemic eosinophilic disorders [^115VzzMz] [^113YVynW]. Such counts alone **do not establish EoE** and warrant further evaluation to identify the underlying cause [^117RxzeH] [^112pk8m8].

---

## Recommended next steps in clinical evaluation

Given the findings (14 eos/hpf mid esophagus, 6 eos/hpf Z-line), the patient **does not meet EoE criteria** [^117RxzeH] but has esophageal eosinophilia. Next steps include:

- **PPI trial**: High-dose PPI for 8 weeks, then repeat endoscopy with biopsies to assess histologic response and exclude PPI-responsive eosinophilia [^116Fjc1M] [^1141LkzX].
- **GERD evaluation**: Consider pH monitoring or impedance testing to assess reflux [^1177wzrj].
- **Other causes**: Evaluate for infections, systemic eosinophilic disorders, and other inflammatory conditions [^113Poyvg].
- **Clinical correlation**: Integrate symptoms, endoscopic findings, and histology to guide management [^111n3EmQ].

---

## Summary table: diagnostic criteria and clinical implications

| **Criterion** | **Findings in this case** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|-|
| Symptoms of esophageal dysfunction | Not specified | Required for EoE diagnosis |
| Peak eosinophil count ≥ 15 eos/hpf in esophageal biopsy | 14 eos/hpf (mid esophagus) | Below diagnostic threshold |
| Z-line eosinophil count | 6 eos/hpf | Not included in EoE diagnosis |
| Exclusion of other causes | Not specified | Required for EoE diagnosis |
| Diagnosis of EoE | Not met | Further evaluation needed |

---

## Conclusion

The patient **does not meet EoE criteria** because the peak esophageal count is **below 15 eos/hpf**, and Z-line counts are excluded [^117RxzeH]. Further evaluation — including a PPI trial and assessment for other causes — is recommended to determine the etiology of esophageal eosinophilia [^116Fjc1M] [^112pk8m8].

### Optimal histologic cutpoints for treatment response in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis: Analysis of data from a prospective cohort study [^115Vz61y]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

No prospective studies substantiate 15 eos/hpf as an appropriate endpoint for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). We aimed to determine a histologic cutpoint that identifies successful treatment of EoE by assessing symptomatic and endoscopic improvement.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective cohort study of 62 consecutive adult patients undergoing outpatient esophagogastroduodenoscopy at the University of North Carolina from 2009 through 2014. At diagnosis of EoE and after 8 weeks of standard treatment, symptom and endoscopic responses were measured using a visual analogue scale and an endoscopic severity score (ESS), and eosinophil counts were assessed. Receiver operator curves and logistic regression models evaluated the histologic threshold that best predicted symptomatic and endoscopic response. For symptoms, analysis was limited to patients without baseline esophageal dilation.

- **Results**: The mean eosinophil count at diagnosis was 124 eos/hpf, falling to 35 eos/hpf after treatment. The mean visual analogue scale decreased from 3.4 at baseline to 1.7 after treatment, and the mean ESS decreased from 3 to 1.6. Twenty-nine patients had symptom responses (47%) and 34 had endoscopic responses (55%). Post-treatment eosinophil count thresholds of 8, 15, and 5 eos/hpf best predicted symptom, endoscopic and combined responses, respectively. On logistic regression, decreasing eosinophil count was significantly associated with the probability of symptomatic (P = 0.01) and endoscopic response (P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: In a prospective study of patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, the reduction in eosinophil count post-treatment was a significant predictor of clinical response.

### Clinicopathologic correlations in eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders [^115z2fDB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) are a collection of disorders characterized by allergy-driven inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Affected patients typically present with nonspecific symptoms of GI dysfunction and are frequently found to have mucosal abnormalities during endoscopy, as well as increased eosinophil levels on tissue biopsy, which are believed to be responsible for generating the clinical findings. Each of these findings is important in both the diagnosis and management of EGIDs. Understanding the impact of histopathologic and endoscopic changes on clinical signs and symptoms is critical to developing an understanding of the natural history of these disorders, as well as to the generation of validated assessment tools and targeted therapies. We explore these relationships in this review.

Over the course of the last year, a number of studies have brought new insights into the clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis, some of which will be summarized here.

- **Recent findings**: This swell of research and clinical need resulted in the revision of the 2007 consensus recommendations. New insights into key clinicopathological features, including symptoms such as feeding dysfunction and histological quantification of eosinophil extracellular granules, are presented. The advancement of the field is strongly supported by blinded and placebo-controlled studies of IL-5 and oral viscous budesonide, as well as new large studies examining the safety of dilation.

Overall, these studies set the stage for new methodologies to understand the pathophysiology of eosinophilic esophagitis and the development of novel therapies.

Despite best practice recommendations for managing eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), variation in care exists. We used established methodology for quality indicator development to identify metrics to define quality for the treatment of EoE.

- **Methods**: We used established methodology for quality indicator development to identify metrics to define quality for the treatment of EoE.

- **Results**: Among 29 proposed quality indicator statements, 9 (31%) were adopted as highly valid across all categories. Two (22%) of these statements were identified as having existing or suspected quality gaps.

- **Discussion**: We identified highly valid EoE quality indicators for adult gastroenterologists, which can be used for quality improvement with resulting benefits for patient outcomes.

### Do eosinophil numbers differentiate eosinophilic esophagitis from gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115VzzMz]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Although the healthy esophageal mucosa contains no eosinophils, eosinophilic infiltration is observed in two major clinicopathologic settings: gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EE). The prevalence of EE is increasing in many countries. This increase seems only partly due to a better awareness of the pathology following the relatively recent description of EE. Gastroesophageal reflux disease and EE represent two entities that do not respond to the same treatment modalities and, thus, need to be distinguished. However, diagnostic criteria for EE have been defined arbitrarily, and more recent articles tend to indicate that the overlap with GERD is probably greater than initially believed. This has led the authors to advise the strict exclusion of GERD before considering the diagnosis of EE.

- **Objectives**: To provide pathologists with the currently proposed histologic criteria of GERD and EE, to emphasize the need to combine these criteria with clinical data and endoscopic findings, and to outline the remaining controversies.

- **Data sources**: This review is based on selected articles identified by a PubMed (US National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland) search of the literature in English for GERD and EE. It also includes a recent review by the American Gastroenterological Association (Bethesda), the Proceedings of the First International Gastrointestinal Eosinophil Research Symposium, and the authors' experience.

Proper identification of the etiology of eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus allows accurate medical or surgical treatment.

### Analysis of midesophageal biopsies increases sensitivity of detection of eosinophilic esophagitis [^116NazE3]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is defined by the presence of abundant eosinophils in the squamous epithelium of the esophagus. There has been remarkable progress recently in the understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of EoE. Because undiagnosed EoE leads to an increase in fibrostenotic complications, including strictures, timely diagnosis is critical.

### Increased numbers of eosinophils, rather than only etiology, predict histologic changes in patients with esophageal eosinophilia [^112dvkgd]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: It can be a challenge to differentiate individuals with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) from those with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). We investigated differences in histologic and eosinophil patterns and numbers of mast cells between patients with these disorders.

- **Methods**: We performed histologic analyses and immunohistochemical assays for eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), major basic protein (MBP), and tryptase, using biopsy samples from 10 patients with GERD (positive results from a pH study and response to proton pump inhibitors), Barrett's esophagus, or EoE (negative results from a pH study and positive response to budesonide). Patients were matched for degree of eosinophilia.

- **Results**: Samples from patients with EoE, GERD, or Barrett's esophagus had similar increases in concentrations of eosinophils. Patients with GERD or EoE did not differ in amount of basal zone hyperplasia, microabscesses, spongiosis, eosinophil distribution, maximum eosinophils per high-power field (HPF), or composite histologic scores. Samples from all three groups had high levels of EDN and MBP; the levels of eosinophil products were correlated (ρ = 0.93). Extracellular staining for EDN was greater than intracellular staining (2.67 of 3 vs. 1.86 of 3); levels tended to be greater in samples from patients with EoE than GERD (P = 0.05) or Barrett's esophagus (P = 0.06). Detection of EDN correlated with peak numbers of eosinophils/HPF (ρ = 0.6 for intracellular and extracellular staining). Peak numbers of tryptase-positive mast cells/HPF were significantly greater in samples from patients.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for non-esophageal eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, specifically concerning endoscopy and biopsy, the ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2024 guidelines recommend performing multiple biopsies. These should include the gastric antrum, gastric body, and duodenum, taken from the involved segments of the gastrointestinal tract. Biopsies should be collected from both normal and abnormal appearing areas of the mucosa in patients with symptoms suggestive of eosinophilic gastritis or eosinophilic duodenitis.

	- **Lower gastrointestinal symptoms**: tenesmus, diarrhea or constipation, hematochezia or melena
	- **Nutritional and metabolic symptoms**: abdominal distention, ascites, iron deficiency, protein loss

- **Dense eosinophilic infiltrates**: Found in mucosal or full-thickness biopsies that are above organ-specific threshold values.

- **Absence of other diseases**: Conditions associated with gastrointestinal mucosal eosinophilic inflammation should be ruled out.

Eosinophilic esophagitis is a recently described disease characterized by the presence of upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms associated with a dense esophageal eosinophilic infiltrate. Awareness and interest among physicians and researchers in this disease have been increasing, as reflected by the number of publications on this topic in the last 5 years. The aim of this review is to summarize the latest evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of eosinophilic esophagitis, primarily in adults, with selected areas in children.

### One-hour esophageal string test: A nonendoscopic minimally invasive test that accurately detects disease activity in eosinophilic esophagitis [^117G4scL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

EAP levels from biopsy and EST samples correlate with mucosal eosinophil counts. We first sought to determine whether EAPs measured in samples from mucosal biopsies and the 1-hour EST correlated with peak eosinophil density in mucosal samples. As shown in Figure 1, all EAPs from mucosal biopsy sample extracts correlated significantly with mucosal eosinophil counts, ranging from r = 0.61 for Eot3 to 0.40 for Eot2 (all P < 0.0001). Similarly, there was a significant correlation of all EAPs from 1-hour EST string samples with mucosal eosinophil counts, ranging from r = 0.70 and 0.68 for CLC/Gal-10 and Eot3, respectively, to r = 0.53 for Eot2 (all P < 0.0001). Consistent with our previous study, our results indicate that both mucosal (biopsy) and luminal (EST) concentrations of EAPs can serve as surrogate markers of peak intraepithelial eosinophil counts, the present gold standard for assessing esophageal inflammation in EoE.

Figure 1: Eosinophil-associated biomarkers in EST and biopsy extract samples correlate with peak histologic eosinophil counts. Spearman analyses correlating EST samples (left panel) and biopsy extracts (right panel) with peak eosinophils/HPF were performed. Spearman rank correlation coefficients (r) and associated P-values are shown. Symbols denote subjects with (●) EoE, active; (◯) EoE, inactive; (◇) normal esophagus.

### Childhood esophagitis changes in 30 years at 1 center [^115uGQZb]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Eosinophils are nonspecific harbingers of esophageal disease. We report on the incidence and features of esophageal eosinophilia diagnosed at our center in 2011 and compare the findings with previously published results between 1980–1988 and 2000–2002. Eosinophils per high-power field were counted in esophageal biopsies from 675 patients who underwent 710 endoscopic procedures between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2011. Of these, 209 (33%) patients were infiltrated with eosinophils; the other 466 (67%) showed no pathological changes. The highest concentrations of eosinophils were observed in the distal esophagus. Our findings also indicate that esophageal eosinophilia fluctuates over time.

### Consultation for elevated blood eosinophils: Clinical presentations, high value diagnostic tests, and treatment options [^1153dfKq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The workup of a patient found to have eosinophilia should follow a thorough path with a detailed history and physical examination aimed at eliciting eosinophilic organ involvement, followed by histological confirmation whenever possible. The differential diagnosis of hypereosinophilia is extensive, but a rational approach beyond the history and physical examination, including serologic, blood, and bone marrow cell analyses, genetic testing, and radiologic imaging, can distinguish many of the causes.

Often, input from specialists (e.g. hematology, dermatology, pulmonary, gastroenterology, and neurology) can help narrow down the possibilities and eventually result in a specific diagnosis. An accurate diagnosis is key to choosing the optimal treatment for a particular condition, and this is certainly true for eosinophilic disorders. Myeloid neoplasms that present with eosinophilia, for example, may respond to medicines that the allergist may be less accustomed to using, such as immunosuppressive agents and kinase inhibitors. Similarly, newly approved biologics that target IL-5 and eosinophils may provide new options for management.

What follows is a case-based approach that helps to underscore key features of diagnosis, management, and follow-up when faced with a patient with a potential eosinophil-related disorder.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis in adults: An emerging problem with unique esophageal features [^116zrUhN]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis is an inflammatory condition characterized by dense eosinophilic infiltration of the surface lining of the esophagus. Reports of this condition have historically focused almost exclusively on pediatric populations. However, it is now emerging as a clinical affliction of adults. This report describes the clinical and endoscopic findings in the largest cohort of adult patients with eosinophilic esophagitis recorded at the time of writing.

- **Methods**: Twenty-nine patients (21 men, 8 women; mean age 35 years) with documented eosinophilic esophagitis (≥ 15 eosinophils per high-power field in biopsy specimens) and a significant history of chronic dysphagia for solid food (24 patients) were evaluated clinically and endoscopically over a 3-year period (1999–2002). Fourteen patients (48%) had a history of asthma, environmental allergy, or atopy. In a subset of 15 patients, the diagnostic accuracy of endoscopy was compared with that of barium contrast esophagography.

- **Results**: Twenty-seven patients (93%) exhibited abnormal endoscopic findings; 25 (86%) displayed unique esophageal structural changes associated with a preserved mucosal surface that were highly atypical for acid reflux injury. Structural alterations in adult patients with eosinophilic esophagitis may occur in combination or as primary characteristics, such as a uniform small-caliber esophagus, single or multiple corrugations (rings), proximal esophageal stenosis, or 1 to 2 mm whitish vesicles scattered over the mucosal surface. Barium contrast radiography combined with swallow of a barium-coated agent…

### Characterization of eosinophilic esophagitis variants by clinical, histological, and molecular analyses: A cross-sectional multi-center study [^116Tkr6U]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

Physicians are increasingly confronted with patients presenting with symptoms of esophageal dysfunction resembling eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) but absence of significant esophageal eosinophilia. The purpose of this study was to characterize and classify this group of EoE variants.

Patients from six EoE centers with symptoms of esophageal dysfunction but peak eosinophil counts of < 60/mm² (< 15/hpf) in esophageal biopsies and absence of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) were included. Clinical, endoscopic, (immuno)histological, and molecular features were determined and compared with EoE, GERD, and healthy controls.

We included 69 patients with EoE variants. Endoscopic abnormalities were found in 53.6%. We identified three histological subtypes: EoE-like esophagitis (36/69, 52.2%), lymphocytic esophagitis (14/69, 20.3%), and non-specific esophagitis (19/69, 27.5%). Immunohistochemistry revealed — in contrast to EoE — no significant increase in inflammatory cell infiltrates compared with GERD and healthy controls, except for lymphocytes in lymphocytic esophagitis. The EoE-typical Th2-response was absent in all EoE variants. However, considerable structural changes were detected based on histology and protein expression.

Using next-generation mRNA sequencing, we found the three EoE variants to have distinct molecular fingerprints partially sharing pronounced traits of EoE. Hierarchical sample clustering of RNA sequencing data confirmed the presence of an EoE-like (characterized by eotaxin-3 expression), non-specific, and lymphocytic profiles.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis and the eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases: Approach to diagnosis and management [^1147iaQK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs) represent disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that result from the local infiltration and aberrant activity of eosinophils and other immune cells. Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is the most well-characterized EGID and is defined by the presence of intraepithelial eosinophils in the esophagus (≥ 15 eosinophils per high-powered field) and clinical symptoms associated with esophageal dysfunction. The other EGIDs are rare and lack strong data regarding pathogenesis and management.

The incidence and prevalence of EoE are increasing, and EoE is now a major cause of upper GI morbidity. Management is multidisciplinary, with collaboration between gastroenterologists, allergists, pathologists, and dieticians, and is aimed at amelioration of symptoms and prevention of long-term complications such as esophageal stricture.

Treatment options for EoE include proton pump inhibitors, swallowed topical corticosteroids, and elimination diets. Esophageal dilation is used when esophageal strictures or fibrostenotic changes are present. Additional therapies targeting eosinophils and other mediators of Th2 inflammation are under development and are promising. Treatment options for other EGIDs typically involve corticosteroids or dietary elimination.

### Current updates in diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^115Jx2o6]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis is a relatively new and moderately well-understood disease. It is one of the leading causes of dysphagia in the pediatric population. Thought to be triggered by food ingestion, it is distinctly different from food allergies. Although endoscopy is required for diagnosis, this article will review warning signs and symptoms that aid with the evaluation and diagnosis of this disease. Treatment modalities and management are evolving, and more research is needed.

### Endoscopic tissue sampling - Part 1: Upper gastrointestinal and hepatopancreatobiliary tracts. European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^1143HK2z]. Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), the ESGE 2021 guidelines recommend taking at least six biopsies. Specifically, 2–4 biopsies should be from the distal esophagus and 2–4 from the proximal esophagus, targeting areas with endoscopic mucosal abnormalities in patients with suspected EoE.

### Characterization of eosinophilic esophagitis variants by clinical, histological, and molecular analyses: A cross-sectional multi-center study [^111sTqjG]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the esophagus defined clinically by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and histologically by an eosinophil-predominant infiltration of the esophageal squamous epithelium, with at least 15 eosinophils in at least one high-power field (hpf). Recently, several findings have questioned the role of eosinophils as the main driver of symptoms and inflammation, and therefore as the hallmark of EoE. These findings include the only modest correlation of eosinophil infiltration with symptom severity and the lack of efficacy of eosinophil-targeting medications. Moreover, a new EoE-like phenomenon has been described recently: five patients from four families with known EoE were evaluated for typical EoE symptoms, but without esophageal eosinophilia upon histological examination. These patients showed gene expression abnormalities similar to classical EoE, suggesting a uniform underlying pathogenesis. Thus, we hypothesized that EoE is only one phenotype of a broader disease spectrum.

Today, EoE centers around the world increasingly encounter patients reporting typical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction resembling EoE, yet the diagnosis cannot be established due to the absence of significant esophageal eosinophilia. It remains to be determined whether these patients suffer from a distinct inflammatory entity, a variant of EoE, or an early stage of EoE. Similarly, there are additional chronic inflammatory disorders of the esophagus, such as lymphocytic esophagitis, for which there is…

### AGA clinical practice update on esophageal dysfunction due to disordered immunity and infection: Expert review [^112pk8m8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of esophageal dysphagia, particularly concerning differential diagnosis, the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend evaluating for non-eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. These evaluations should be considered in patients presenting with esophageal symptoms in the context of hypereosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count > 1,500 cells/mcL).

### Longitudinal evaluation of noninvasive biomarkers for eosinophilic esophagitis [^115pYf8m]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) often require multiple endoscopies. Serum biomarkers can be elevated in EoE patients, but their clinical utility in diagnosis and assessing response to treatment is not well established.

- **Goals**: To evaluate serum biomarkers in EoE subjects compared with controls and assess longitudinally in response to treatment.

- **Study**: We conducted a prospective cohort study of children and adults undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy for suspected EoE. After completing an eight-week course of proton-pump inhibitor therapy, esophageal mucosal biopsies were obtained, as well as serum analysis of absolute eosinophil count (AEC), eotaxin-3, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and interleukin-5. Subjects with normal endoscopic and histologic findings constituted controls. Those meeting criteria for EoE underwent repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy and biomarker measurements following treatment with topical steroids for eight weeks.

- **Results**: Median levels of AEC (263.50 vs. 102 cu/mm, P < 0.001), ECP (26.98 vs. 5.20 ng/mL, P < 0.001), and EDN (31.70 vs. 14.18 ng/mL, P = 0.004) were significantly elevated in EoE subjects compared with controls and correlated with esophageal eosinophilia. Levels of AEC (odds ratio: 1.79; 95% confidence interval: 1.28–2.64) and ECP (odds ratio: 1.61; 95% confidence interval: 1.23–2.36) were associated with a diagnosis of EoE. Among the five biomarkers evaluated, only AEC significantly predicted esophageal eosinophilia following topical steroid therapy in EoE subjects (P = 0.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: Immune mechanisms and therapeutic targets [^112DYs6v]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

- **The eosinophil, eotaxin subfamily, and IL‐5**: The eosinophil is a pleiotropic granulocytic leukocyte characterized by a bilobed nucleus and cytoplasmic granules, originating from CD34+ progenitor cells within the bone marrow. It possesses homeostatic functions such as tissue development, thymic T cell selection, and innate host defense. However, eosinophils also contribute to the initiation and propagation of inflammatory responses, including parasitic helminth, bacterial, and viral infections, tissue injury, tissue immunity, and allergic diseases. Under homeostatic conditions, eosinophils are found throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, except the esophagus.

	- The most characteristic histopathologic feature of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is esophageal intraepithelial eosinophilia (≥ 15 eosinophils per high-power field [HPF]). Eosinophil numbers can be significant with micro-abscesses, and esophageal eosinophilia correlates with histopathologic features such as dilated intercellular spaces (DIS) and basal zone hyperplasia (BZH), as well as disease severity. In a registry of EoE patients, O'Shea et al. compared patients with high-grade esophageal eosinophilia (> 350 eosinophils per HPF) to those with low-grade eosinophilia (15–24 eosinophils per HPF) and found statistically significant differences in histologic severity, endoscopic severity, and gene expression, but not in symptoms.

	- The mechanisms by which eosinophils drive histopathologic features of EoE are not fully elucidated. Eosinophils possess granules that consist of cytotoxic proteins, including eosinophil peroxidase (EPX), major basic protein (MBP), and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP).

### Diagnosis and treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis [^1129F2PY]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a newly recognized disease caused by a T-helper type 2 cell response to food antigens in contact with the esophageal mucosa. Although no single feature defines EoE, a constellation of compatible demographic, clinical, endoscopic, and histologic findings establish the diagnosis. Children present with symptoms and endoscopic patterns characteristic of inflammation, whereas adolescents and adults exhibit manifestations of fibrosis and gross esophageal strictures. Clinical and endoscopic scoring systems have helped to standardize diagnosis.

There is controversy in EoE research over the optimal endpoint for treatment. Although the most common endpoint is a reduced number of eosinophils in biopsies, changes in symptoms and endoscopic features are becoming important targets of therapy. We should improve our understanding of EoE progression and the need for maintenance therapy, as well as continue development of diagnostic tools that avoid endoscopy and biopsy analyses to more easily monitor disease activity.

### What's new in the diagnosis and therapy of eosinophilic esophagitis [^113ZvxKs]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a relatively new chronic inflammatory disease of the esophagus. Novel aspects in the diagnosis and treatment of EoE are discussed in this review.

- **Recent findings**: Development of diagnostic guidelines consisting of symptoms as well as endoscopic and histopathologic criteria has improved the awareness of clinicians and the diagnosing of EoE. The clinically challenging discrimination of EoE from gastroesophageal reflux disease has become more obvious and has evoked the need for more individualized therapy options. Today, most patients with EoE can be treated successfully with topical corticosteroids. However, no convincing alternative treatment strategies exist for corticosteroid-refractory or corticosteroid-dependent patients. Interestingly, a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the eotaxin-3 gene has been linked to increased disease susceptibility for EoE.

EoE is an emerging esophageal disease. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder would improve the clinical recognition and diagnostic ability and ultimately provide patients with more optimal treatment options.

### Potential of blood eosinophils, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, and eotaxin-3 as biomarkers of eosinophilic esophagitis [^111x5nap]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is an increasingly recognized disorder characterized by eosinophilic inflammation of the esophageal mucosa. It typically requires serial invasive endoscopic biopsy examinations to document the characteristic histologic features of the disorder. The aim of this study was to identify noninvasive biomarkers that correlated with disease activity and response to treatment as measured by esophageal eosinophilia.

- **Methods**: A prospective, cross-sectional analysis was performed on 47 pediatric patients undergoing endoscopic evaluation of possible EE. Blood samples were collected for measurement of peripheral blood absolute eosinophil count (AEC) and levels of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), eotaxin-1, -2, and -3, and interleukin-5. Stool samples were collected for measurement of EDN. Biomarker levels were correlated with esophageal eosinophil density, and differences in biomarker levels based on disease activity and treatment were determined.

- **Results**: AEC, plasma EDN levels, and eotaxin-3 levels significantly correlated with esophageal eosinophil density (AEC: r = 0.56, P < .0001; EDN: r = 0.54, P < .0001; eotaxin-3: r = 0.32, P = 0.04) and were increased in patients with active EE versus controls (AEC: 440 vs. 140 eosinophils/muL, P < .05; EDN: 50.3 vs. 31.1 ng/mL, P = 0.01; eotaxin-3: 37.7 vs. 11.5 pg/mL, P = 0.01). Cut-off values were established to maximize the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of these biomarkers alone and in combination. Eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, interleukin-5, and fecal EDN levels did not correlate with disease activity.

### Quantitative analysis of tug sign: An endoscopic finding of eosinophilic esophagitis [^111bt8un]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune-mediated disorder characterized by esophageal inflammation and dysfunction, with a rising incidence affecting approximately 1 in 1000 individuals worldwide. Chronic inflammation can lead to tissue remodeling in the esophagus with fibrosis in the lamina propria that is partially responsible for symptoms and complications of EoE. At times, a firmness to the esophagus can be appreciated with a noticeable force required to obtain biopsies from EoE patients. This sensation has been described as the "tug" or "pull" sign.

Recently, with the advent of endoscopic functional luminal impedance, the fibroelastic properties of the esophagus, including diminished compliance and distensibility, have been described in patients with EoE. Quantification of these fibroelastic properties of the esophagus may aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of EoE. To date, a method to quantitatively measure the "tug sign" has not been developed. The primary objective of this study was to assess if a quantifiable difference in force is required to obtain endoscopic esophageal biopsies in patients with EoE compared with those without.

### The optimal number of biopsy fragments to establish a morphologic diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis [^111fE3YY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is characterized clinically by dysphagia, chest pain, and food impaction, and morphologically by increased numbers of intraepithelial eosinophils and marked basal hyperplasia of the squamous mucosa. The consensus criteria for a diagnosis of EoE include the presence of ≥ 15 eosinophils per high power field (HPF) in biopsies from both the proximal and distal esophagus in the absence of other causes of esophageal eosinophilia, and the lack of clinical response to proton pump inhibitor therapy. Because of the variability in the distribution of intraepithelial eosinophils among biopsy fragments and the lack of standardized biopsy practices, this study aimed to determine the optimal number of esophageal biopsies from the mid and distal esophagus needed to reach the minimum morphologic criteria of ≥ 15 eosinophils/HPF.

From January 5, 2009, to September 26, 2011, 771 patients were diagnosed with EoE at our institution. From that patient population, 102 sequential cases were chosen for further study, all of whom had biopsies taken from the mid and distal esophagus. Cases with only gastric mucosa present and biopsies taken from patients with a previous diagnosis of EoE were excluded. The original H&E-stained slides were reviewed, and the number of biopsy fragments containing squamous mucosa was recorded. By using a ×40 objective and ×10 oculars (field diameter = 0.52 mm, field area = 0.21 mm²), the number of eosinophils per high power field (EOS/HPF) in up to three HPFs was counted in each biopsy fragment.

The EOS/HPF were counted in 1,342 biopsy fragments.

### Distribution of eosinophils in the gastrointestinal tract of children with no organic disease [^116pNJyL]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

With regard to the eosinophilic distribution across the GI tract, a gradual increase in GI tissue eosinophils was observed in the proximal segments of the GI tract, from the esophagus to the ileum, while in the colon, a gradual decline was observed from the cecum to the rectum. The median (IQR) of peak counts of eosinophils per high power field (hpf) corresponding to areas of 0.196 mm² and 0.306 mm², as well as the count corresponding to mm² in each segment of the GI tract for the whole cohort, are shown in Figures 1 to 3.

- **Figure 1**: Peak numbers of eosinophils in the esophageal and gastric biopsies in the whole cohort of children. The median (interquartile range) of peak counts of eosinophils per high power field (0.196 mm² and 0.306 mm²), and per mm² in the esophagus (111 biopsies) and the stomach (111 biopsies) were as follows: esophagus: 0 (0–0), 0 (0–0), and 0 (0–0), respectively; stomach: 2 (0.6–3.0), 3.1 (1.0–4.7), and 10.2 (3.3–15.3), respectively.

### Promising modalities to identify and monitor eosinophilic esophagitis [^116gTDzB]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an allergen-mediated condition characterized by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and histologic evidence of intense eosinophilic inflammation involving the esophagus, in the absence of overlapping conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease. Since its initial description as a distinct entity approximately two decades ago, there has been a remarkable increase in the recognition of this clinicopathologic entity. The approach to diagnose and monitor EoE requires repeated esophagogastroduodenoscopies, with associated sedation/anesthesia, to visualize mucosal abnormalities and to obtain multiple biopsy specimens for histologic assessment and treatment response evaluation.

Frequent esophagogastroduodenoscopies with multiple biopsies can increase the risk of procedural complications, place significant financial burden on families, and escalate healthcare costs. In addition, this burdensome approach may contribute to delayed diagnosis and suboptimal monitoring, thereby increasing the likelihood of complications such as esophageal narrowing and stricture formation, which may require escalation of care, including endoscopic interventions.

Clinical progression and complications associated with EoE can be attenuated through early identification and optimal management. Therefore, developing reliable, safe, less-cumbersome, and cost-effective modalities for early diagnosis and effective monitoring of EoE is an area of active research. These efforts have been substantially supported by the development of new biomaterials and analytic methods.

### Diagnostic merits of the eosinophilic esophagitis diagnostic panel from a single esophageal biopsy [^115GjExt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a histologically "patchy" disease with uneven eosinophil distribution along the esophagus, posing a dilemma for histologically analyzing endoscopic biopsy samples, especially when biopsy samples are limited to only the distal esophagus.

- **Objective**: We investigated whether molecular mRNA profiling of a distal esophageal biopsy sample predicts eosinophilia in the proximal esophagus.

- **Methods**: Esophageal biopsy samples (n = 507) from subjects with EoE were collected from multiple institutions, spanning adults and pediatric patients. Subjects were grouped on the basis of distinct distal (D) and proximal (P) eosinophil counts (D + P +, D + P -, D - P +, and D - P -, with + and - defined as ≥ 15 or < 15 eosinophils/hpf, respectively). Molecular profiles were assessed by using the EoE Diagnostic Panel (EDP), a set of 96 esophageal transcripts used to derive the EDP score.

- **Results**: The distal EDP score was correlated with proximal eosinophil levels (r = -0.73; P < .0001). EDP analysis of a histologically negative distal biopsy sample predicted the presence of proximal esophagitis with high sensitivity (85%). In a 2-year follow-up focusing on the cases with discordant histologic and EDP results, histologically negative patients (D - P -) had higher rates of EoE relapse when the EDP was positive than when the EDP was negative (odds ratio = 11; p = 0.003), indicating predictive medicine capacity.

- **Conclusion**: EDP analysis of a single distal esophageal biopsy sample predicts remote inflammation in patients with spatially heterogeneous EoE.

### Increased expression of eotaxin-3 distinguishes between eosinophilic esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111ZiUzg]. Human Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Differentiating eosinophilic esophagitis from gastroesophageal reflux disease is important given their pathogenetic differences and responses to therapy. Eotaxins are a family of chemokines critical for the activation and recruitment of eosinophils, mediated by their receptor, chemokine receptor-3 (CCR-3). Interleukin 5 (IL-5) is a key cytokine involved in many steps of eosinophil production and recruitment. This study aimed to compare the messenger RNA expression of the eotaxins, CCR-3, and IL-5 among well-characterized groups of patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, those with gastroesophageal reflux disease, and healthy individuals.

This was a retrospective study using esophageal biopsies from 33 patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, 20 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, and 17 healthy controls. Parameters studied included demographic features, presenting symptoms, endoscopic findings, histopathologic features, and messenger RNA levels of eotaxins 1, 2, and 3, CCR-3, and IL-5 by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Patients with eosinophilic esophagitis were predominantly males (M/F = 3:1), with a mean age of 15.9 years and a mean eosinophil count of 55 per x400 high-power field. Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease had a mean age of 31.5 years and a mean eosinophil count of 5.8 per high-power field. Total intraepithelial eosinophil and lymphocyte counts, as well as the presence of superficial eosinophil clusters, microabscesses, and basal cell hyperplasia, were all significantly associated.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents: Epidemiology, diagnostic challenges, and management strategies for a type 2 inflammatory disease [^111GcDpF]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

While the first case of EoE was reported in 1970, the disease as recognized today was described in only three cases in the early 1990s. Although EoE has been considered a rare condition, it remains a significant cause of morbidity in the upper gastrointestinal tract, resulting in increased healthcare costs. The exact causes of EoE are not completely understood but are believed to be linked to genetic, environmental, and immune factors. Despite being relatively new, the incidence of EoE is on the rise globally, with reports of 1–34 new cases per 100,000 people per year.

Diagnosing EoE can be challenging due to its nonspecific symptoms and the absence of specific biomarkers. Diagnostic tools currently available are not sensitive enough to detect it. A major issue for EoE is diagnostic delay, with an average time from the first symptom to the final diagnosis being 10 years. Factors such as patient-dependent issues and misdiagnosis contribute to this delay, leading to increased EoE severity. In cases where patients report minimal symptoms, clinicians should explore dietary and adaptive behavioral modifications such as eating slowly, thorough chewing before swallowing, drinking fluids to aid swallowing, and avoiding solid foods. These adjustments help patients adapt to the reduced esophageal distensibility. However, enhancing our understanding of EoE's natural progression and refining clinical management will reduce diagnostic delays and optimize patient care pathways. Incorporating red flags into patient evaluations can enhance EoE diagnosis and management.

### Variability in diagnostic criteria for eosinophilic esophagitis: A systematic review [^115r4PKU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an emerging clinicopathologic entity defined by abnormal esophageal eosinophilic infiltration. Our understanding of this disease is hampered by the lack of a uniform diagnostic standard. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the range of diagnostic strategies and histologic criteria in the EoE literature.

- **Methods**: The MEDLINE-indexed literature from 1950 through December 31, 2006, was independently searched by two investigators. To identify additional relevant studies, bibliographies were hand-searched, as were the published proceedings of the 2000–2006 American College of Gastroenterology and American Gastroenterological Association national meetings. Data were extracted from all human EoE case reports, case series, cross-sectional and cohort studies, and clinical trials.

- **Results**: Of 318 publications initially identified, 116 original articles, 39 abstracts, and 69 reviews were included. We found 10 different histologic definitions of EoE, ranging from 5 to 30 eosinophils per high-powered field (hpf), though 41 (35%) of the original articles did not state their diagnostic criteria. In the 13 original articles (11%) reporting an hpf area, the eosinophil density per mm\(^2\) varied 23-fold. There was also variation in esophageal biopsy protocols, but specific protocols were reported in just 45 (39%) original articles.

- **Conclusions**: Significant variability in diagnostic criteria for eosinophilic esophagitis exists, and in a large proportion of studies, criteria are not reported. Because of this lack of a common disease understanding, further research to establish standardized diagnostic criteria is essential.

### Endoscopic assessment of the oesophageal features of eosinophilic oesophagitis: Validation of a novel classification and grading system [^111n3EmQ]. Gut (2013). High credibility.

The Eosinophilic Esophagitis Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS) is a clinical calculator used in the field of gastroenterology. It is specifically designed for patients with suspected or confirmed eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic immune system disease that can cause inflammation and damage to the esophagus.

The EREFS is used to quantify the endoscopic features of eosinophilic esophagitis, providing a standardized scoring system that can help clinicians assess disease severity, monitor disease progression, and evaluate the response to treatment. The score is based on five major endoscopic findings: edema, rings, exudates, furrows, and strictures, each of which is scored separately.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the EREFS. However, it should be noted that this scoring system is intended for use in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis and may not be applicable or accurate in patients with other esophageal conditions.

The Eosinophilic Esophagitis Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS) is a tool designed to assess the severity of eosinophilic esophagitis based on endoscopic findings. It evaluates five key features observed during an endoscopic examination: edema, rings, exudates, furrows, and strictures. Each feature is graded, and the grades are assigned numerical values that are summed to produce a total score, with higher scores indicating a more severe condition.

- **Patient demographics**: We identified 113 patients with typical EoE symptoms and peak eosinophil counts in esophageal biopsies of less than 60 eos/mm² (< 15 eos/hpf) from 6 EoE referral centers. After histological re-examination, absence of significant esophageal eosinophilia was proven in 69 subjects (62 adults, 7 children aged 16 years or younger). For patients included per study center, see Figure 1A. The mean age at diagnosis was 48.8 years (SD 24.0) with a median duration of symptoms of 28.1 months (IQR 12.4–74.4). Among them, 37 were females (53.2%) and 61 subjects were of Caucasian descent (88.4%). Atopic comorbidities were reported in 30 patients (43.5%), while family history for EoE was positive in 16 individuals (23.2%). For further details, refer to Table 1.

### The pathology and causes of tissue eosinophilia in the gastrointestinal tract [^1127nG7V]. Histopathology (2017). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract may occur as a primary eosinophilic disorder or as a secondary response with other causes. Primary eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) are Th2-mediated allergic diseases that overlap pathogenetically with atopic conditions involving other organs. The pathological diagnosis of primary EGIDs can be challenging, as the quantity of eosinophils considered to be 'abnormal' is difficult to define, and the diagnosis, by definition, requires exclusion of the far more common secondary causes.

Our understanding of the basic biology and natural history of eosinophilic oesophagitis has advanced considerably over the last decade, whereas other EGIDs have proven more difficult to characterize; nonetheless, some recent advances have been made. This review summarizes knowledge regarding the clinical presentation, diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of EGIDs, including eosinophilic oesophagitis. We also draw attention to the numerous secondary causes of tissue eosinophilia in the gastrointestinal tract and suggest a practical approach to the histological assessment, diagnosis, and reporting of EGIDs.

### Guideline for the investigation and management of eosinophilia [^113Poyvg]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for eosinophilia, specifically with respect to FISH, the BSH 2017 guidelines recommend investigating patients with an eosinophil count of at least 1.5×10⁹ cells/L with no obvious cause. This is to assess for a possible hematological neoplasm associated with clonal eosinophilia. Initially, this is done through peripheral blood analysis for FIP1L1-PDGFRA by FISH or nested RT-PCR.

### Toward uniformity in the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE): The effect of guidelines on variability of diagnostic criteria for EoE [^114M29ug]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Recent consensus guidelines for the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) have been published. Whether these guidelines have standardized diagnostic criteria for EoE is unknown. We aimed to determine if the EoE guidelines had an impact on the diagnostic criteria reported in the EoE literature, and whether the previously observed variability in diagnostic criteria has become more uniform.

Two investigators independently conducted a MEDLINE search from January 1, 2007, through June 30, 2010, for all publications reporting EoE in human subjects. They also searched the proceedings of the 2007–2010 American College of Gastroenterology and American Gastroenterological Association meetings, using a predefined search strategy. Data were extracted from all relevant publications.

Of the 799 publications identified, 149 original reports, 99 reviews, and 165 abstracts were included. In all, 32 original reports (21%) used diagnostic criteria consistent with each of the three components of the consensus guidelines. There was a significant increase when comparing original articles published after the release of the guidelines with those published earlier (31% vs. 6%, P < 0.001). The proportion of original articles using 15 eosinophils per high-power field (eos/hpf) as a histological cut-point increased significantly (P = 0.001). There was still substantial variability in biopsy protocols and eosinophil count methodology. The majority of original articles did not report microscope high-power field (HPF) area.

### Pathology of eosinophilic esophagitis: What the clinician needs to know [^114GEqnb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EOE) is a clinical pathologic syndrome characterized by an influx of numerous eosinophils into the esophageal epithelium. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the spectrum, as well as the characteristic location and distribution, of morphologic changes in EOE to maximize the diagnostic yield in mucosal biopsy specimens.

The major pathologic features of EOE include eosinophilic microabscesses, surface layering of eosinophils often associated with surface sloughing of necrotic squamous cells, and peak eosinophil counts usually greater than 15 per high power field (hpf) within the squamous epithelium. Minor features, which are frequent but less specific, include marked basal cell hyperplasia, lengthening of lamina propria papillae, intercellular edema, and lamina propria fibrosis with chronic inflammation.

The number, distribution, and location of intraepithelial eosinophils in EOE vary greatly between previously published studies. Thus, utilization of a diagnostic cutoff point for intraepithelial eosinophils in EOE, particularly in the absence of other major features of EOE, is currently considered unwise. In fact, some patients may show combined features of both gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and EOE, which complicates the histologic analysis of these patients.

In contrast to GERD, EOE typically involves longer lengths of the esophagus, affects the proximal equally, or even more, than the distal esophagus, and the pathologic findings are often patchy in distribution. As a result, it is highly recommended that clinicians obtain biopsies.

### Esophageal remodeling in eosinophilic esophagitis [^113rsK4F]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of histopathologic fibrosis has proved challenging, with most studies using standard forceps. These biopsies consist mostly of epithelium that contains adequate lamina propria in only about 50% of samples. This observation has raised concerns that esophageal biopsies using standard forceps assess sub-epithelial disease severity incompletely and inadequately in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).

Lamina propria sampling can be optimized with larger, specialized forceps that allow sampling of subepithelial tissue in over 90% of biopsies. Using this approach, one study of 200 EoE patients showed that correlations between subepithelial and epithelial peak eosinophil counts, as well as endoscopic and symptom severity, were significant but modest. There was also some discordance between epithelial and sub-epithelial findings, with biopsies of 40% of patients with fewer than 15 intraepithelial eosinophils per high power field (hpf) showing subepithelial peak counts of 15 or more per hpf.

These findings suggest that while the clinical utility of histologic assessment of sub-epithelial alterations needs further investigation, such assessment may be useful in those patients who have ongoing symptoms but do not fulfill diagnostic cut-offs for EoE based on epithelial eosinophil counts alone. Additionally, it is helpful to consider that lamina propria fibrosis can be an early feature of EoE, even in the absence of overt endoscopic findings such as esophageal stricture.

In the absence of secondary causes, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, local, progressive, T-helper type 2 immune-mediated disorder characterized by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and eosinophil-predominant inflammation. In the last 20 years, the incidence and prevalence of EoE have risen sharply, and the chances of encountering affected patients in clinics and endoscopy rooms have increased. Nevertheless, it is estimated that the mean diagnostic delay of EoE is 4–6 years in both children and adults. Unfortunately, the longer the disease stays unrecognized, the likelier it is for the patient to have persistent or increased esophageal eosinophilic inflammation, to complain of non-resolving symptoms, and to develop fibrotic complications. Early detection depends on the recognition of initial clinical manifestations that vary from childhood to adulthood and even among patients of the same age. The disease phenotype also influences therapeutic approaches that include drugs, dietary interventions, and esophageal dilation. We have herein reviewed epidemiologic, clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features and therapeutic options of EoE, focusing on differences and similarities between children and adults that may certainly serve in daily clinical practice.

### Incidental gastric eosinophils in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis: do they matter [^117B82Sp]? Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

and Aim

Some patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) (> 15 eosinophils/high-power field on esophageal mucosal biopsies and lack of response to acid suppression and/or normal pH probe study) demonstrate incidental eosinophilic inflammation of the gastric mucosa. It is unclear whether patients with EE and normal gastric biopsies (EE-N) are phenotypically different from patients with EE and gastric mucosal abnormalities (EE-A) (ie, > 10 eos/hpf on gastric biopsies). The aim of the study was to compare the clinical features and response to therapy among patients with EE-N and EE-A.

Patients and Methods

Medical records of all of the EE-A and a random group of patients with EE-N diagnosed during an 8-year period were reviewed. A subgroup analysis of patients treated with swallowed fluticasone with a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy within 6 months of starting therapy was also performed.

Results

During the study period, 41 patients had EE-A. When compared to 50 random patients with EE-N, no clinical differences were noted, including sex, age, presenting symptoms, esophageal histology, and atopy history. Eleven (27%) of the 41 EE-A and 14 (28%) of the 50 EE-N patients were treated with swallowed fluticasone, and the response was similar among the groups. The mean esophageal eosinophils/high-power field among the EE-A group dropped from 47 to 8 compared with a 46 to 7 drop among the EE-N group treated with fluticasone therapy (P = 0.91). In 9 (82%) of the 11 patients with EE-A treated with fluticasone, there was resolution (7 of 9) or significant improvement (2 of

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: Clinical, endoscopic, histologic and therapeutic differences and similarities between children and adults [^11583f5n]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

When treating patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), it is essential to achieve specific treatment endpoints. These include inducing and maintaining remission of eosinophilic inflammation below 15 eosinophils per high-power field (HPF), controlling symptoms to improve quality of life, and preventing and treating complications.

- **Therapeutic options**: Therapeutic interventions in EoE include drugs such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and topical corticosteroids, dietary interventions, and esophageal dilation. Any treatment may be offered as first-line and later interchanged; however, the choice should consider the EoE phenotype (inflammatory versus fibrostenotic), as well as the patient's clinical characteristics, treatment preferences, tolerance, costs, and available expertise.

### Distribution of esophageal eosinophilia as a predictor of proton pump inhibitor response in eosinophilic esophagitis [^113ERivu]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

The impact of the esophageal eosinophilic distribution pattern on treatment outcomes in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is unclear. We aimed to determine if the eosinophil distribution at index endoscopy predicts proton pump inhibitor (PPI) response in EoE.

- **Methods**: This was a cohort study of newly-diagnosed adult EoE patients from three hospitals. All included patients received an ≥ 8-week PPI trial and underwent repeat biopsies to assess response. Primary analyses compared PPI response between isolated distal disease (≥ 15 eosinophils/hpf on distal but not proximal biopsies) and proximal/diffuse eosinophilia (≥ 15 eosinophils/hpf on proximal ± distal biopsies). Secondary analyses categorized patients as distal-predominant (distal > proximal eosinophils by ≥ 10/hpf), proximal predominant (proximal > distal eosinophils by ≥ 10/hpf), or even distribution pattern. Multivariable analyses were performed using logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders.

- **Results**: 266 patients (50.8% male, 89.1% white) met inclusion criteria, including 66 isolated distal and 200 proximal/diffuse disease. PPI response was higher among patients with isolated distal disease [histologic remission (< 15 eosinophils/hpf post-PPI): 63.6% vs 44.5%, p = 0.01; deep remission (< 6 eosinophils/hpf): 54.5% vs 31.0%, p = 0.001; symptom improvement: 92.4% vs 81.0%, p = 0.03]. On multivariable analyses, isolated distal disease remained independently associated with histologic response (adjusted OR: 2.04, CI: 1.10–3.77, p = 0.02), deep remission (adjusted OR: 2.46, CI: 1.33–4.54, p = 0.02), and symptom improvement.

### A novel histologic scoring system to evaluate mucosal biopsies from patients with eosinophilic esophagitis [^116gwKRM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is characterized by gastroesophageal reflux symptoms that are resistant to medical or surgical treatment, alongside dense squamous eosinophilia. Studies suggest that histologic assessment of esophageal eosinophilia alone cannot reliably differentiate patients with EoE from those with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Our goal was to develop an assay to identify EoE patients and potentially differentiate EoE from other causes of esophageal eosinophilia.

A monoclonal antibody specific for an eosinophil secondary granule protein, eosinophil peroxidase (EPX), was developed. This antibody was shown to specifically identify intact eosinophils and detect eosinophil degranulation in formalin-fixed specimens. A histopathologic scoring algorithm was then developed to analyze data from patient evaluations. To assess the utility of this algorithm, we used archived esophageal tissues from patients with known diagnoses of EoE and GERD, as well as controls from two tertiary care centers.

Intraobserver and interobserver blinded evaluations demonstrated a significant difference, with the presence of ≥ 15 eosinophils in a high-power (40x) microscopy field being indicative.

A novel immunohistochemical scoring system was developed to address the challenges in diagnosing EoE effectively.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: Clinical, endoscopic, histologic and therapeutic differences and similarities between children and adults [^116PUDE4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

In conclusion, EoE is an emerging disorder whose diagnosis is often delayed. Early detection may lead to anticipating treatment and preventing the disorder, or at least decelerating the development of complications. Treatment options and endpoints should be tailored individually to achieve lasting compliance. This is crucial because EoE is a chronic disease that almost invariably relapses when the treatment is withdrawn.

### Eaaci food allergy and anaphylaxis guidelines: Diagnosis and management of food allergy [^116zQaCu]. Allergy (2014). High credibility.

The EAACI 2014 guidelines provide recommendations on diagnostic procedures for eosinophilic esophagitis. More specifically, with respect to esophageal biopsy, it is recommended to conduct esophageal biopsy with 2–4 samples taken from both the proximal and distal esophagus for the diagnosis of EoE. The biopsy should be performed after double-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy of at least 6 weeks to rule out esophageal eosinophilia caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and to exclude PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia.

### Treatment with high-dose proton pump inhibitors helps distinguish eosinophilic esophagitis from noneosinophilic esophagitis [^114zLckK]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is a clinical entity that is increasingly recognized in children. The treatment of EE has been debated since its identification as a distinct clinical entity separate from reflux esophagitis. We hypothesize that treatment with a high-dose proton pump inhibitor (HDPPI) helps differentiate EE from noneosinophilic esophagitis (NEE).

- **Patients and methods**: A retrospective review of 2221 patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsies was undertaken. Sixty-nine patients had 15 or more eosinophils per high-power field (eos/HPF) in one or more esophageal levels. Of those, 36 were initially treated with HDPPI for three months followed by a repeat EGD. Patients who demonstrated histologic response were classified as NEE. Patients with no histologic response were diagnosed with EE and treated with HDPPI plus swallowed fluticasone for three months, followed by a repeat EGD.

- **Results**: Of the 36 patients, histologic response was observed in 14 (39%) after treatment with HDPPI, with a 95% confidence interval (0.23–0.54). Swallowed fluticasone was added to the treatment of the 22 patients who did not show a histologic response to HDPPI alone. Of those, 15 patients underwent repeat endoscopies. Seven patients were lost to follow-up or did not have repeated EGDs. Histologic response was observed in 9 of 15 (60%) patients. Of the nonresponders (6 of 15), 5 of 6 (83%) self-reported noncompliance with the swallowed fluticasone. Patients with 15 or more eos/HPF at all three levels (25 of 36) were less likely to respond to HDPPI alone and more likely to require additional treatment.

### A model using clinical and endoscopic characteristics identifies patients at risk for eosinophilic esophagitis according to updated diagnostic guidelines [^116T9RBP]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Updated diagnostic guidelines for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) have eliminated the requirement for a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trial, but there are no models to identify patients with EoE based on these new criteria. We aimed to develop a predictive model for the diagnosis of EoE based on the updated EoE diagnostic guidelines.

- **Methods**: We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective study of adult patients referred for outpatient esophagogastroduodenoscopy at the University of North Carolina who had symptoms of esophageal dysfunction; patients with prevalent EoE were excluded. We analyzed data from 206 EoE cases (mean age 40.1, 62.6% male, 93.2% white) and 306 controls (mean age 52.3, 37.9% male, 79.7% white). We built predictive models for case-control status, using clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features, and defined EoE by either the new or historical definition of PPI non-response. Model discrimination was assessed by the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC).

- **Results**: Before endoscopy, younger age, male sex, history of atopic condition or food allergy, and dysphagia identified patients with EoE with an AUC of 0.83. When we included endoscopy findings suggestive of EoE, the model identified patients with EoE with an AUC of 0.92; this increased to 0.99 when histology was included.

- **Conclusion**: We developed a model to identify patients with EoE, without a trial of PPIs, based on updated diagnostic guidelines. Clinical features and endoscopic findings identified patients with EoE with an AUC of 0.92 — even without histologic data.

### Medical treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis [^116Fjc1M]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic antigen-mediated eosinophilic inflammatory disease isolated to the esophagus. As a clinicopathologic disorder, a diagnosis of EoE requires a constellation of clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and histologic findings, including at least 15 eosinophils per high-powered microscope field (eos/hpf). Guidelines no longer require the failure of response to proton pump inhibitor medications to establish a diagnosis of EoE; however, they continue to suggest the exclusion of other etiologies of esophageal eosinophilia.

The treatment goals for EoE include improvement in clinical symptoms, resolution of esophageal eosinophilia and other histologic abnormalities, endoscopic improvement, improved quality of life, enhanced esophageal function, minimized adverse effects of treatment, and prevention of disease progression and subsequent complications. Currently, there is no cure for EoE, making long-term treatment necessary. Standard treatment modalities include dietary modifications, esophageal dilation, and pharmacologic therapy. Effective pharmacologic therapies include corticosteroids, rapidly emerging biological therapies, and proton pump inhibitor medications.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of medical interventions for people with eosinophilic esophagitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP up to 3 March 2023.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any medical intervention or food elimination diet for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis.

### Diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^1177wzrj]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by esophageal dysfunction and eosinophilic infiltrate in the esophageal epithelium, in the absence of other potential causes of eosinophilia. The incidence and prevalence of EoE are increasing, making it a significant cause of gastrointestinal morbidity among children and adults. EoE is believed to be immune-mediated, with food or environmental antigens stimulating a T-helper (Th)-2 inflammatory response.

An increased understanding of the pathogenesis of EoE has led to the evolution of diagnostic and treatment paradigms. We review the latest approach to the diagnosis of EoE and present consensus diagnostic guidelines. We also discuss the clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features of EoE and the challenges to diagnosis. Finally, we present the three major treatment options for EoE: pharmacologic therapy, dietary modification, and endoscopic dilation.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: Diagnostic tests and criteria [^113YVynW]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to present the clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), review the diagnostic guidelines for EoE, and present an approach for its diagnosis. It also highlights selected techniques under development that may be useful for future diagnosis.

Recent findings emphasize that EoE is a clinicopathologic condition. Three criteria must be met to diagnose EoE: clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction, an esophageal biopsy with a maximum eosinophil count of at least 15 eosinophils per high-power microscopy field (with few exceptions), and the exclusion of other possible causes of esophageal eosinophilia, including proton-pump inhibitor responsive esophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE). A trial of proton-pump inhibitors is typically required to assess PPI-REE and evaluate the presence of concomitant gastroesophageal reflux disease.

EoE is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder. Because no single symptom, endoscopic finding, or histopathologic feature is pathognomonic, diagnosis can be challenging. In the future, symptom scores, tissue or serum biomarkers, and genetic testing may play a role in diagnosis, but these methods have yet to be validated and are not recommended for routine clinical use.

### Emerging incidence trends of eosinophilic esophagitis over 25 years: Results of a nationwide register-based pathology cohort [^1129TFyh]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Low credibility.

The degree of esophageal eosinophilia in all identified EoE patients was mentioned in 1,608 (40%) unique reports, of which 1,473 (36%) were classified as marked (i.e. pronounced) and 135 (3%) as mild (i.e. moderate). Of note, in all 135 reports describing "mild" esophageal eosinophilia, the diagnosis of EoE was confirmed and/or ≥ 15 eos/hpf were described by the pathologist. In only 588 (15%) reports, the esophageal eosinophilia was quantified as ≥ 15 eos/hpf within the entire study time frame. Between 1995 and 2009, quantification of the esophageal eosinophilia (i.e. ≥ 15 eos/hpf) was not stated in any of the reports. Between 2010–2014 and 2015–2019, the esophageal eosinophilia was described as ≥ 15 eos/hpf in 124 (3%) and 464 (12%), respectively, of pathology reports. Additional histological features, such as spongiosis, micro-abscesses, basal zone hyperplasia, and sub-epithelial fibrosis, were described in less than 2% of all pathology reports.

### Markers of eosinophilic inflammation for diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis and proton pump inhibitor-responsive esophageal eosinophilia: A prospective study [^1174fbkD]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Distinguishing between eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), gastroesophageal reflux disease, and proton pump inhibitor-responsive esophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE) is challenging. We assessed whether immunohistochemical analysis of esophageal tissues for major basic protein (MBP), eotaxin-3, and tryptase can be used for the diagnosis of EoE and to differentiate EoE from PPI-REE.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective study of 196 consecutive adults who underwent outpatient endoscopy at the University of North Carolina from 2009 through 2012. Incident cases of EoE were diagnosed per consensus guidelines. Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease or dysphagia served as controls. PPI-REE was defined as a symptomatic and histologic response to a PPI. Immunohistochemistry was performed to quantify MBP, eotaxin-3, and tryptase. The maximum density of epithelial staining was determined for each assay. Levels were compared between EoE and control groups and then EoE and PPI-REE groups, and receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed.

- **Results**: Esophageal tissues from patients with EoE (n = 50) had a median of 951 MBP-positive cells/mm², whereas those from controls (n = 123) had a median of 2 MBP-positive cells/mm² (P < .001). Samples from patients with EoE had a median of 155 eotaxin-3-positive cells/mm², and those from controls (n = 123) had 18 eotaxin-3-positive cells/mm² (P < .001). Samples from patients with EoE had a median of 249 tryptase-positive cells/mm², and those from controls (n = 123) had 11 tryptase-positive cells/mm² (P < .001).

### Characterization of eosinophilic esophagitis variants by clinical, histological, and molecular analyses: A cross-sectional multi-center study [^114aTCsR]. Allergy (2022).

Physicians are increasingly confronted with patients presenting with symptoms of esophageal dysfunction resembling eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), despite the absence of significant esophageal eosinophilia. The purpose of this study was to characterize and classify this group of EoE variants.

Patients from six EoE centers with symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and peak eosinophil counts of < 60/mm² (< 15/hpf) in esophageal biopsies, excluding those with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), were included. Clinical, endoscopic, (immuno)-histological, and molecular features were determined and compared with EoE, GERD, and healthy controls.

We included 69 patients with EoE variants. Endoscopic abnormalities were found in 53.6%. We identified three histological subtypes:

- **EoE-like esophagitis**: (36/69, 52.2%)
- **Lymphocytic esophagitis**: (14/69, 20.3%)
- **Non-specific esophagitis**: (19/69, 27.5%)

Immunohistochemistry revealed, in contrast to EoE, no significant increase in inflammatory cell infiltrates compared with GERD and healthy controls, except for lymphocytes in lymphocytic esophagitis. An EoE-typical Th2 response was absent in all EoE variants. However, considerable structural changes were detected based on histology and protein expression. Using next-generation mRNA sequencing, we found the three EoE variants to have distinct molecular fingerprints partially sharing pronounced traits of EoE. Hierarchical sample clustering of RNA sequencing data confirmed the presence of an EoE-like (characterized by eotaxin-3 expression), non-specific, and lymphocytic variant.

### Joint ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN guidelines on childhood eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders beyond eosinophilic esophagitis [^113dBLq6]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for non-esophageal eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, specifically in relation to endoscopy and biopsy, ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2024 guidelines recommend considering multiple biopsies. These should be taken from the terminal ileum and at least three sites of the colon: the cecum/ascending colon, transverse/descending colon, and sigmoid/rectum. Biopsies should be collected from both normal and abnormal appearing areas of the mucosa in patients exhibiting symptoms suggestive of eosinophilic colitis.
