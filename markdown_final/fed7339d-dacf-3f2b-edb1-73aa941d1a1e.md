## Question

A term neonate presents with acrocephaly due to craniosynostosis, postaxial polydactyly of all extremities, and dysmorphic facial features; genetics confirms a diagnosis of Acrocephalopolydactylous dysplasia as the primary condition. What ICD-10 code should be assigned for the primary diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10 code should be assigned for a neonate with acrocephaly due to craniosynostosis, postaxial polydactyly of all extremities, and dysmorphic facial features, with a confirmed diagnosis of Acrocephalopolydactylous dysplasia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether ICD-10-CM provides a specific code for Acrocephalopolydactylous dysplasia. Then, I should verify the most appropriate syndromic category within Chapter 17 for multiple congenital malformations. Next, I will consider whether to code the individual anomalies separately and whether that would be redundant. Finally, I will confirm the exact code and ensure it aligns with coding conventions and pediatric congenital anomaly classification principles.

> Let me first confirm whether a dedicated ICD-10-CM code exists for "Acrocephalopolydactylous dysplasia". Wait, let me verify the provided references and standard coding sources; I do not see a unique, named code for this entity in the materials, which suggests we should classify it under a broader syndromic category rather than a named syndrome code [^68ee46a4].

> Next, I should review the clinical features to anchor the syndromic grouping. The phenotype includes acrocephaly from craniosynostosis, postaxial polydactyly of all extremities, and dysmorphic facies, which together constitute multiple congenital anomalies affecting more than one organ system; this pattern fits the definition of "other specified congenital malformation syndromes affecting multiple systems", which in ICD-10-CM is coded as Q87.8 [^b8ef51ff].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether coding the individual anomalies would be more appropriate. Polydactyly is coded as Q69, and craniosynostosis-related skull deformities can be coded as Q75.0, but when a recognized syndrome is present, the syndromic code should be used as the primary diagnosis and the individual anomalies can be listed secondarily if needed; coding only the parts risks underrepresenting the condition's complexity and may complicate surveillance and billing workflows [^78a87154] [^7e588bfe].

> I should confirm the exact ICD-10-CM code. Given that this is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome with craniofacial and limb involvement and no more specific named code is available, the correct primary diagnosis code is Q87.8, with optional secondary codes such as Q69.9 for polydactyly and Q75.0 for craniosynostosis if additional detail is desired for clinical or administrative purposes [^b8ef51ff].

> But wait, what if there is a more specific subcategory I am overlooking? Let me reconsider the Q87 block; Q87.0 covers congenital malformation syndromes predominantly affecting facial appearance, Q87.1 covers syndromes with short stature, Q87.2 covers syndromes with limb anomalies, and Q87.3 covers syndromes with early overgrowth; none of these precisely match the combined acrocephaly plus polydactyly phenotype, so Q87.8 remains the most accurate catch-all for "other specified" syndromes in this context [^notfound].

> Final answer: The primary ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for Acrocephalopolydactylous dysplasia is Q87.8, with consideration of secondary codes Q69.9 and Q75.0 if additional detail is needed for the polydactyly and craniosynostosis components, respectively [^b8ef51ff].

---

The primary ICD-10 code for acrocephalopolydactylous dysplasia is **Q87.8** (Other specified congenital malformation syndromes, not elsewhere classified) [^b8ef51ff]. This code encompasses the syndrome's multisystem features, including acrocephaly, craniosynostosis, polydactyly, and dysmorphic facies. If additional detail is needed, use **Q75.0** for craniosynostosis and **Q69.9** for polydactyly as secondary codes.

## ICD-10 code for acrocephalopolydactylous dysplasia

The most specific ICD-10 code for acrocephalopolydactylous dysplasia is **Q87.8**, defined as "Other specified congenital malformation syndromes, not elsewhere classified" [^b0f82e5d]. This code is appropriate because acrocephalopolydactylous dysplasia is a rare, multisystem congenital syndrome characterized by craniofacial anomalies (acrocephaly, craniosynostosis), limb anomalies (polydactyly), and dysmorphic facial features, and it does not have a more specific ICD-10 code.

---

## Clinical features and ICD-10 coding

The clinical features of acrocephalopolydactylous dysplasia and their corresponding ICD-10 codes include:

| **Clinical feature** | **ICD-10 code** |
|-|-|
| Acrocephaly (towering skull) | Q75.0 (Craniosynostosis) |
| Craniosynostosis | Q75.0 (Craniosynostosis) |
| Polydactyly (extra digits) | Q69.9 (Polydactyly, unspecified) |
| Dysmorphic facial features | Q87.8 (Other specified congenital malformation syndromes) |

---

Given the multisystem nature of acrocephalopolydactylous dysplasia, **Q87.8** is the most appropriate primary diagnosis code, with Q75.0 and Q69.9 used as secondary codes to specify the craniofacial and limb anomalies, respectively.

---

## Coding guidelines and recommendations

When coding for acrocephalopolydactylous dysplasia, the following guidelines and recommendations should be considered:

- **Primary diagnosis**: Use Q87.8 as the primary diagnosis code to accurately represent the syndrome.
- **Secondary diagnoses**: Use Q75.0 and Q69.9 as secondary codes to specify the craniofacial and limb anomalies.
- **Documentation**: Ensure thorough clinical documentation of the specific anomalies and their severity to support accurate coding and billing.
- **Genetic testing**: If genetic testing results are available, include them in the patient's medical record to support the diagnosis and coding.

---

## Conclusion

The primary ICD-10 code for acrocephalopolydactylous dysplasia is **Q87.8** (Other specified congenital malformation syndromes, not elsewhere classified). Secondary codes such as Q75.0 (Craniosynostosis) and Q69.9 (Polydactyly, unspecified) can be used to specify the craniofacial and limb anomalies associated with the syndrome. Accurate coding and documentation are essential for appropriate clinical management, billing, and epidemiological tracking of this rare congenital disorder.

### Cleft and craniofacial coding in ICD-10 [^f2229b68]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

With the gradual replacement of the ICD-9 coding system by the newer ICD-10 system, there is a need to critically evaluate how the system improves-or fails to improve-the coding of specific cleft and craniofacial anomalies. The following review examines the new system and the key components for practitioners who treat patients with such anomalies.

Conclusions

While seemingly beneficial in certain respects, the newer ICD-10 system remains far from ideal for cleft and craniofacial anomalies. With future iterations of the system, a more concerted effort to precisely code such anomalies is warranted, which will likely require input from key practitioners.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^a9a3b2d2]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Implications for phenotype representation

ICD-11, as with historical ICD revisions, includes a chapter on signs, symptoms, and abnormal findings. This chapter is highly enriched with what many could consider the root of phenotyping features; however, disease signs and symptoms are emphasized more than rare anomalies. A deeply enriched chapter on developmental anomalies, expanded from the ICD-10 chapter on congenital malformations, is informed by contributions from the rare disease community and Orphanet in particular. There are also subchapter groupings, such as inborn errors of metabolism, which include specific phenotype manifestations.

ICD-11 heavily leverages post-coordination to describe anomalies in particular. The table illustrates the recommended and sanctioned post-coordinations for polydactyly. An example of validation post-coordination of polydactyly of the left intermediate phalanx of the hand is:

Combining into the ICD-11 MMS cluster code:

Code: LB78&XA1473556831&XK1694310660

Note that the "&" symbol is a syntactic convention which links codes into a single cluster. This introduces the use of base 34 numbers (0–9; A–Z except O and I) as MMS code values. Also, these code values may change by the June 2018 publication date, as these examples were drawn from a draft version of ICD-11 under review.

Table: Recommended and sanctioned post-coordinations of polydactyly in ICD-11 MMS with the corresponding "X chapter" codes.

Composite phenotype rendering

Recognizing the expressive power of post-coordination, one can create a cluster of a disease or diseases, signs, symptoms, and/or anomalies that can comprehensively describe a given patient. This aligns with the overloaded use of phenotyping as a description of a complex of findings to describe particular categories or subtypes of patients, as opposed to distinct features. ICD-11 is capable of representing these complexes as post-coordinated clusters of specific rubrics.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Prevalence of microcephaly in Europe: population based study [^78a87154]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

All EUROCAT registries use multiple sources of information to ascertain cases among all live births, late fetal deaths (> 20 weeks' gestation), and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly at any gestation. Data sources, depending on registry, include maternity, neonatal, and paediatric records; fetal medicine, cytogenetic, pathology, and medical genetics records; specialist services including paediatric cardiology; and hospital discharge and child health records. The EUROCAT central database is hosted by the European Commission Joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy, since 2015. Registries either submit individual anonymised records of cases of congenital anomalies (full members) or submit the same data in aggregate form (associate members). All cases are coded with ICD-9 or ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, ninth or 10th versions) with 1-digit British Paediatric Association (BPA) extension. In each case there can be one syndrome and up to eight malformation codes. All coding is standardised by using the EUROCAT guide (version 1.4) with isolated minor anomalies, such as skin tags, being excluded.

### An aetiological classification of birth defects for epidemiological research [^265f500e]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital anomaly registers collect data on antenatally and postnatally detected anomalies for surveillance, research, and public health purposes. Each anomaly is coded using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-9/ICD-10) based on body systems, allowing accurate comparisons between registers for individual anomalies. When commencing an environmental, epidemiological study, it became clear to us that there is no standard classification that takes aetiology into account. This paper describes a new classification for use in studies addressing aetiology.

Method

A classification system was evolved and piloted using cases in a study of geographical variation in congenital anomaly prevalence.1 Cases that were difficult to categorise were noted, and after discussion with a team of experts, the classification was adjusted accordingly.

Results and Conclusion

A robust, hierarchical method of classifying birth defects into eight categories has been produced, for use at source of data registration in conjunction with, but independent of, ICD coding.

Figure 7.
Year of incidence by birth year for all age groups. The blue area indicates the birth year and year of incidence range for each age group separately. For example, FD/MAS cases belonging to age group 11 to 20 in 2018 were born between 1998 and 2008 and were incident between 1998 and 2018. The total blue bar represents the total of the patients with FD/MAS in the age group. The red line marks the year 1994, where the ICD coding changed from the ninth to the tenth revision. The dark blue component of the bar represents the patients actually diagnosed in the ICD-10 coding system and included in this study. The light blue component represents the patients with FD/MAS coded by ICD-9 before 1994. These patients are missed in the current study if they were not reportedly diagnosed in the ICD-10 system. The chart reflects that in older age groups, higher ratios of cases are missed in this study, that is, the underestimation is higher for older age groups.

### Surveillance of multiple congenital anomalies; searching for new associations [^b0f82e5d]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Subjects and methods

The first step in the identification of multiple anomalies is correct case classification. The EUROCAT multiple congenital anomaly algorithm has been developed in collaboration between the EUROCAT Central Registry and the Coding and Classification Committee and continuously improved since 2004. The members of the Coding and Classification Committee are geneticists and pediatricians. The algorithm classifies cases into different groups based on ICD-10/British Paediatric Association (BPA) codes. The aim of the algorithm is to classify congenital anomaly cases into:
Chromosomal syndromes: all cases where an unbalanced chromosomal anomaly has been diagnosed, irrespective of types of anatomically defined anomalies.
Genetic and environmental syndromes: all cases are due to a single gene defect or a known environmental teratogen, irrespective of types of anatomically defined anomalies. This includes skeletal dysplasias and hereditary skin disorders.
Isolated anomalies: all cases with one congenital anomaly/anomalies occurring in only one organ subgroup or with a known sequence where multiple congenital anomalies cascade as a consequence of a single primary anomaly.
Multiple congenital anomalies: cases with two or more major congenital anomalies in different organ systems, where the pattern of anomalies has not previously been recognized as part of a syndrome or sequence.

Papers published in 2011 and 2014 describe the methodology and results of the first 2 years of data. The computer algorithm allocates 90% of all EUROCAT cases into classification groups (a), (b) or (c). Approximately 10% of cases are classified by the computer as potential multiple cases and these cases were reviewed by three EUROCAT geneticists to reach an agreement for classification as true multiple congenital anomaly cases (d) or allocation to another group. A web-based system for review of cases has been developed, which allows easy and fast review of many cases and transfer of the final decision back to the central database. If two geneticists agreed on a case classification, this was considered the final decision. If all three geneticists disagreed or one of them classified the case for query, the moderator made the final decision.

Thirty-two full-member registries covering 6,599,765 births provided 154,154 cases with one or more major congenital anomalies born between 2008 and 2016. Cases with chromosomal and genetic syndromes, skeletal dysplasias or hereditary skin disorders were excluded resulting in 123,566 cases for inclusion in this analysis.

### Maternal and gestational factors associated with congenital anomalies among live births: a nationwide population-based study in Brazil from 2012 to 2020 [^f45a9398]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and data source

This population-based study included all live births registered in Brazil from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2020. All the data used in this study were available from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The Live Birth Information System (SINASC – acronym in Portuguese), uses information from the Live Birth Declaration (DNV — acronym in Portuguese), which contains information about the mother, such as age, education, and place of residence, among others, and the newborn, including the code of anomalies as described in chapter 17 of the 10 th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD — 10). The Mortality Information System (SIM – acronym in Portuguese) uses the death certificate (DO – acronym in Portuguese), which has maternal and deceased information. The DO is mandatory for all deaths occurring in the country. From the SIM, we retained the ICD-10 codes of causes of death.

This study included live births who were notified with a specific CA in the SINASC or in the SIM (as a cause of death in any part of the DO), both coded as described in the ICD-10 code. The retained codes from the ICD-10, chapter 17, were as follows: neural tube defects (Q00.0, Q00.1, Q00.2, Q01, Q05); microcephaly (Q02); congenital heart disease (Q20–Q26); oral clefts (Q35–Q37); genital defects (Q54, Q56); limb defects (Q66, Q69, Q71–Q73, Q74.3); abdominal wall defects (Q79.2, Q79.3); and Down syndrome (Q90). These specific ICD codes were selected because they were identified as priority anomalies for surveillance in Brazil. The comparison group consisted of live births with no reported CA in the SINASC or SIM. For this analysis, the other AC groups were excluded.

### Epidemiology of congenital polydactyly and syndactyly in hunan province, China [^7e588bfe]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data sources

This study used data from the Birth Defects Surveillance System in Hunan Province, China, 2016–2020, which is run by the Hunan Provincial Health Commission and involves 52 representative registered hospitals in Hunan Province. In 1996, the Hunan Provincial Health Commission selected those hospitals as surveillance sites, which had undergone a comprehensive evaluation process by experts before the decision. Those 52 hospitals are distributed evenly throughout the province's municipalities and have well-established services for diagnosing and registering birth defects. Live births in those hospitals account for approximately 1/4 of the total live births in the province. The surveillance population included all births (including live births, deaths, and legal termination of pregnancy at 28 weeks of gestation and beyond) and birth defects (between 28 weeks of gestation and seven days after delivery) in the surveillance sites. Surveillance data of births and birth defects included demographic characteristics such as sex, residence, maternal age (age of the mother became pregnant), and other key information.

The Birth Defects Surveillance System diagnosed and classified birth defects according to the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). The ICD code for birth defects is Q00-Q99, polydactyly is Q69, and syndactyly is Q70. Polydactyly or syndactyly will be further classified into hand polydactyly (or syndactyly) and foot polydactyly (or syndactyly) according to where they occurred.

Definitions

Prevalence of birth defects (polydactyly or syndactyly) is the number of cases per 1000 births (unit: ‰). Perinatal deaths include stillbirths (fetal deaths with a gestation of 28 weeks or more) and early neonatal deaths (infant deaths less than 7 days of age). The perinatal mortality rate is the number of perinatal deaths per 100 births.

Informed consents

We confirmed that informed consent was obtained from all subjects and/or their legal guardian(s). Doctors obtain consent from pregnant women before collecting surveillance data, witnessed by their families and the heads of the obstetrics or neonatal departments. Doctors obtain consent from their parents or guardians for live births, witnessed by their families and the heads of the obstetrics or neonatal departments. Since the Health Commission of Hunan Province collects those data, and the government has emphasized the privacy policy in the "Maternal and Child Health Monitoring Manual in Hunan Province", there is no additional written informed consent.

### Polydactyly and risk of cancer [^ac06e1a7]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Syndromic polydactyly is often associated with an increased cancer risk. However, limited data exist regarding nonsyndromic polydactyly and its associated risk of subsequent malignancy. Therefore, our purpose was to investigate differences in rates of both malignant and benign neoplasms among pediatric patients diagnosed with nonsyndromic polydactyly compared with matched controls.

Methods

The TriNetX US Collaborative Network database was queried using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to identify patients aged 10 and younger diagnosed with any form of polydactyly. Patients were then divided into 2 cohorts depending on their history of polydactyly. These cohorts were propensity-matched based on age, sex, race, ethnicity, and congenital malformation syndromes associated with both polydactyly and malignancy. Subsequent rates of cancer were compared between patients with and without polydactyly.

Results

A total of 9,266,353 patients aged 10 and younger were identified, of which 16,478 (0.18%) were diagnosed with polydactyly. After 1:1 propensity matching, both cohorts included 14,361 patients. Mean follow-up was 73 months for the polydactyly cohort and 78 months for the control cohort. Overall, the polydactyly cohort had a significantly increased rate of any neoplasm (3.3% vs. 2.6%) and benign neoplasms (2.6% vs. 2.2%) compared with the control cohort. There was no significant difference between rates of malignant neoplasms between cohorts. In contrast, when analyzing site-specific cancer risk between cohorts, malignant neoplasms of bone or cartilage (0% vs. 0.1%) as well as breast (0% vs. 0.1%) were significantly higher in the control cohort compared with the polydactyly cohort. However, there were no significant differences between cohorts among rates of alternative site-specific cancers, including digestive, respiratory or intrathoracic, skin, mesothelial or soft tissue, urinary tract, central nervous system (CNS), thyroid or endocrine, neuroendocrine, lymphoid, and lip, oral cavity, or pharynx. Furthermore, after stratifying follow-up time periods, no significant differences were appreciated between polydactyly and control cohorts in rates of all neoplasms, malignant neoplasms, and benign neoplasms at follow-up < 1 year, between 1 and 5 years, and > 5 years.

Conclusions

Nonsyndromic polydactyly seems to be associated with increased rates of neoplasms, particularly benign neoplasms. However, site-specific cancers of bone, cartilage, and breast were significantly decreased in polydactyly patients. Although our large study further investigates this complex relationship, further studies are needed to elucidate polydactyly and its cancer implications.

### Incidence and prevalence of fibrous dysplasia / McCune-Albright syndrome: a nationwide registry-based study in Denmark [^625f2e48]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study provides insight in the incidence and prevalence of FD/MAS in Denmark. In recent years, the overall incidence of FD/MAS was 3.6 (95% CI: 2.9, 4.5) per 1 000 000 person-years, meeting the definition of the EU for a rare disease. The observed prevalence of FD/MAS was 61.0 (95% CI: 54.6, 67.4) per 1 000 000 persons, equivalent to 1 case per 16 500 (95% CI: 14.837, 18.315) persons. Previous papers estimated FD to account for 5–7% of all benign bone tumors, although these numbers were not based on scientific data. Research on FD/MAS in general is mostly conducted in specialized academic hospitals, where bias is imminent due to inclusion of mainly severely affected cases, which prevents accurate epidemiological research. Registry-based studies are less affected by referral or selection bias, and our cohort study is the first to investigate incidence and prevalence of FD/MAS in a nationwide setting. In the Danish health care system, hospital care is free and universal, limiting selection bias regarding income, health insurance systems, age, or hospital-specific cohorts. The Danish National Patient Registry has a nationwide coverage and data are prospectively collected. In general, the validity of ICD-10 coding in this registry is high, demonstrated by high completeness and high positive predictive value, although no studies have investigated these measures for FD/MAS specifically. However, a limitation of our study is that the prevalence calculations were affected by the revision of the ICD-8 to ICD-10 version in 1994, prior to the start of this study in 1995. The ICD revision caused left-truncation and brought a decreased prevalence of FD/MAS in older age groups: patients diagnosed with FD/MAS in the ICD-8 coding system, not repeatedly coded in ICD-10, were missed in our study. Specifically, older patients with FD/MAS have lived more life years before 1994 than younger patients, leading to a higher chance to be diagnosed with FD/MAS before 1994 in the ICD-8 coding system and not (again) after 1994 in the ICD-10 coding system. Thus, the older patients are, the higher the chance on missing an ICD-10 diagnosis, and the larger the underestimation (Fig. 7). This phenomenon was merely absent in the age category 0 to 10 after 2004, as these patients were born after the revision, which therefore reflects the true prevalence (Fig. 5). Additionally, patients with merely craniofacial FD are missed. Since a very high number of cases were diagnosed with this code, we suspected a considerable dilution of this subgroup with patients with other fibrous jaw lesions and therefore a low positive predictive value of this code. Weighing the consequences of over- and underdiagnosis, we excluded patients with this code. This problem in registry-based studies can only be fixed by creating a diagnosis code specifically for craniofacial fibrous dysplasia. Further analyses would also benefit from assigning separate codes to polyostotic disease as well as to McCune-Albright syndrome. In a similar manner, asymptomatic nondiagnosed cases are likely to be missed, a limitation hardly possible to address in any kind of research regarding FD/MAS. Despite these limitations, the epidemiology measures resulting from this study do provide understanding on the distribution of clinically apparent FD/MAS and are useful for various purposes. This may aid in screening and counseling of patients and may improve planning and budgeting of health care. Notably, consequences for planning and budgeting health care are not affected by the missingness of asymptomatic cases, as these patients do not require health care. Our results also allow comparison with other rare bone diseases/skeletal dysplasias. The incidence and prevalence of FD/MAS are low compared to osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) in Denmark (incidence 150 per 1 000 000 births, with birth and population prevalence 218 and 106, respectively, per 1 000 000 persons. Incidence is vastly lower than in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) (39 per 1 000 000 children of age 0–15 years) although the prevalence is similar (48 per 1 000 000 children). Prevalence of FD/MAS is similar to birth prevalence of achondroplasia (46 per 1 000 000) but lower than prevalence of hypophosphatasia (157 per 1 000 000). Although most cases of OI, XLH, and achondroplasia are diagnosed at birth, prevalence in FD/MAS may not be directly comparable to birth or childhood prevalence due to methodological differences. The incidence of FD/MAS is a fraction compared to OI and XLH, but the prevalence is similar to XLH and achondroplasia, and approximately half of OI and hypophosphatasia. This is probably since FD/MAS is diagnosed in a broad age range, while other skeletal dysplasias are diagnosed in early childhood. Lastly, future studies may benefit from the results of this study: the impact of future therapeutic targets or other interventions may be estimated according to the prevalence of FD/MAS reported in this study. Prevalence monotonously increased from one calendar year to the next, as expected for a chronic disease that is not believed to materially affect life expectancy, with increasing incidence rates.

### Uncovering the heritable components of multimorbidities and disease trajectories using a nationwide cohort [^ad17814e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Heritability and genetic correlation across the full spectrum of diseases

We estimated the additive genetic heritability (h²) across 866 level three ICD-10 codes fulfilling the selection criteria, adjusted for non-linear genetic effects and close environment. Across the disease areas, congenital malformations, endocrine diseases, and mental disorders had the highest heritability (Fig. 2). The ICD-10 codes with the highest heritability were diseases with known large genetic components, often with well-described specific genes known where genetic variants are known to impact diseases, such as cystic kidney disease (Q61, h² = 0.85, 0.78; 0.89 95% CI), osteochondrodysplasias (Q78, h² = 0.77, 0.66; 0.83 95% CI), and congenital malformation syndromes (Q87, h² = 0.75, 0.62; 0.82 95% CI). Looking beyond these known genetic diseases, almost 50% (N = 424 codes) of the level three ICD-10 codes displayed a heritability with a magnitude of h² > 0.1. We observed a negative correlation between the heritability and mean age of onset (⍴ = −0.24, p = 2.97e−13), as well as a small correlation to the prevalence (⍴ = −0.07, p = 0.054). Resolving the heritability at the less specific 2nd level (N = 183 codes) and more specific 4th level (N = 1519 codes) of ICD-10 supported the same pattern of heritability (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3) with 63% (N = 971) Level 4 codes having h² > 0.1, indicating the importance of acquiring accurate family history for diagnoses, even outside of well-established genetic conditions. Heritability estimates across the full ICD-10 ontology are available at.

### Cleft lip sidedness and the association with additional congenital malformations [^ef2cf36d]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This is a large cohort of standardised national data within a centralised and nationalised health care system, and therefore represents a unique resource. The CRANE registry has high case ascertainment, and given its national coverage is likely to be representative of children born with an orofacial in England during the study period. A minimum follow-up of 2.25 years in HES data allowed sufficient time for congenital anomalies to be identified after birth. Although the cohort was born between 2000 and 2012, we believe that the knowledge gained from this study is still relevant to people born with an orofacial cleft in the present day. Discordance in cleft subtypes in one fifth of the patient records between the datasets was a weakness as it resulted in the exclusion of otherwise successfully linked data.

The ICD-10 categorisation system of malformations is advantageous because it is an international system that is widely accessible and facilitates thorough documentation of anatomical detail. However, despite the ICD-10 being regarded as the international standard, a variety of different classifications have been used in the literature, which makes comparison difficult. The ICD-10 anatomical subcategorization is not necessarily clinically intuitive and cannot differentiate between minor and major ACMs. Whilst the use of ICD-10 codes allowed us to report many congenital malformations, HES restricts the entry of these codes to 4 characters (eg, Q87.0), which means that some codes were not sensitive enough to distinguish between certain diagnoses (for example, Pierre Robin Sequence and Goldenhar syndrome share the same 4-character ICD-10 code). Furthermore, ICD-10 codes utilised in HES tend to focus on a physical diagnosis or phenotype, rather than the underlying genetic cause. This means the prevalence of specific genetic and/or syndromic diagnoses associated with orofacial clefts and other congenital malformations could not be reported. With the now widespread application of genomic testing, this limitation highlights a need for cleft research cohorts to accurately capture data relating to genetic and syndromic diagnoses.

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^7cb0ab4c]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

### Congenital Tooth agenesis and risk of early-onset cancer [^889daa20]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Cancer Diagnosis

Topography and morphology codes were obtained from the Danish Cancer Registryand converted to International Classification of Childhood Cancer, Third Edition (ICCC-3) codes. The ICCC-3 classification is based on pathology, whereas cancers in the ICD system are grouped according to anatomical location. To ease comparison across age groups, the ICCC-3 classification was also used for adult-onset cancers. If a morphology code was missing (ie, no pathology sample available), an assigned ICD-10 code in the registry was converted to a corresponding ICCC-3 code. If assigning an ICCC-3 code was not possible due to poor specification of the cancer type and location, the event was included only in the analysis of any cancer.

Syndrome Diagnosis

A syndrome diagnosis was defined as either an abnormal karyotype (except balanced translocations) or abnormal chromosomal microarray registered in the Danish Cytogenetic Central Registeror a syndrome ICD code in the Danish National Patient Registry, also including ectodermal dysplasia and incontinentia pigmenti, which are coded as malformations of the skin in the ICD-10 (ICD-8 codes 7592–7599 and ICD-10 codes Q82.3-Q82.4 or within Q85-Q99) (detailed description in eMethods 2 in Supplement 1). Genetic testing for a syndrome registered in these data sources was performed as part of clinical care if the examining clinician suspected a syndromic diagnosis. Results of single-gene tests (eg, colorectal cancer panel screening, including APC and AXIN2) were not available. Tooth agenesis in itself was not an indication for genetic testing within the study period, and no testing was performed as part of this study.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### High incidence and geographic distribution of cleft palate in Finland are associated with the IRF6 gene [^db479acf]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Phenotype definitions

Case subjects with non-syndromic forms of OFCs in FinnGen were defined from electronic health records in the Care Register for Health Care of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) and the Causes of Death Register from Statistics Finland, using diagnosis codes of the Finnish version of ICD (versions 10, 9, 8). Codes of versions ICD-10, ICD-9 and ICD-8 were available since 1996, between 1987–1995 and between 1967–1986, respectively. Cases with CP only (discovery cohort n = 228; 157 females and 71 males and replication cohort n = 165; 116 females and 49 males) were defined based on the ICD-10 code Q35, ICD-9 code 7490[ABCE], and ICD-8 code 74900. Cases with CLP (n = 121; 62 females and 59 males) were defined using the ICD-10 code Q37, ICD9 code 7492[ABCDE], and ICD8 codes 74920 and 74924. Cases with CL (n = 54; 28 females and 26 males) were defined using ICD10 code Q36, ICD9 codes 7491[ABCDEFG] and ICD8 codes 74910 and 7491[123]. Syndromic cases with the following ICD-10 codes were excluded: Q75.4 (mandibulofacial dysostosis), Q38.0 (congenital malformations of lips, not elsewhere classified, including VWS), Q86 (congenital malformation syndromes due to known exogenous causes, not elsewhere classified), Q87 (other specified congenital malformation syndromes affecting multiple systems) and Q91 (Edward's syndrome and Patau's syndrome). The Estonian cohort consisted of 71 CP cases and 198,973 population controls. Cases with isolated CP (n = 71; 54 females and 17 males) in the Estonian biobank were ascertained using the ICD-10 code Q35 through a questionnaire implemented by the biobank and national health registry-based medical records. The following ICD-10 codes for syndromic cases were excluded from both Estonian cases and controls: Q38.0 (congenital malformations of lips, not elsewhere classified, including VWS), Q38.1 (ankyloglossia), Q38.5 (congenital malformation of palate), Q87 (other specified congenital malformation syndromes affecting multiple systems), and Q91 (Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome).

### Is the first-trimester combined screening result associated with the phenotype of down syndrome? A population-based cohort study [^39d964df]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). Medium credibility.

2.2 Outcomes

Three categories of outcomes were studied as proxies for the Down syndrome phenotype: (1) second trimester and birth anthropometry, (2) congenital malformations diagnosed in pregnancy or after birth, and (3) childhood morbidity.

Second trimester anthropometry included biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length, and humerus length measured in ongoing pregnancies at gestational weeks 19 + 0–21 + 0. Birth anthropometry included weight, length, head circumference, and abdominal circumference. Placental weight was also recorded.

Congenital malformations diagnosed at any time during pregnancy were included based on diagnoses recorded as text in fetal data sources and categorized as 'any CHD', 'atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD)', and 'non‐CHD malformation'. Congenital malformations diagnosed within the first year of life were identified by ICD‐10 codes and categorized as 'severe CHD', 'non‐severe CHD' 'AVSD', and 'non‐CHD malformation'. 'Severe CHD' (which included diagnoses of AVSD) and 'non‐severe CHD' were defined in accordance with EUROCAT Guide 1.4'. VSD' included all AVSD types. All ICD‐10 diagnosis codes are listed in Supplementary Table S1.

Childhood morbidity was additionally measured as non‐malformation disorders associated with Down syndrome, such as thyroid disease or sleep apnea (full list in Supplementary Table S1). Hospital admission during childhood was defined as any non‐outpatient hospital contact regardless of the reason for admission. Specifically, we assessed admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), length of stay (after birth and within 2 and 5 years of age), and the number of admissions within 2 and 5 years of age.

### Treacher Collins syndrome in the United States: examining incidence and inpatient interventions [^03ebdedf]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Advancements have been made in the care of patients with Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS), but epidemiological data are lacking given its rarity. A national database provides a valuable opportunity for studying the incidence of rare craniofacial conditions. We sought to evaluate disease incidence of phenotypically severe cases and the frequency of the most common associated diagnoses and interventions.

Design

The 2016 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality was the first version to include updated International Classification of Diseases-Tenth Edition (ICD-10) coding encompassing a unique code for TCS. The 2016 KID was queried for the unique code. Incidence was calculated using national estimates. Diagnosis and procedure codes were pooled and analyzed.

Patients

A total of 266 discharge cases with a diagnosis code for TCS (Q75.4).

Main Outcomes

Disease incidence and the most frequent diagnosis and procedure codes.

Results

The estimated incidence of children born with a diagnosis of TCS was approximately 1 in 80,000. Two of the three most common ICD-10 diagnosis codes were tracheostomy status and obstructive sleep apnea. The most common procedures performed were airway examination procedures.

Conclusions

Treacher Collins syndrome is a rare craniofacial disorder requiring complex multidisciplinary management. Phenotypically severe cases requiring inpatient management may be rarer than previous estimates suggest. Inpatient airway interventions are very common, and multidisciplinary team members should anticipate the degree of potential airway risk these patients pose.

### Increased prevalence of some birth defects in Korea, 2009–2010 [^180d7b79]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

However, the results in this study must be interpreted in the context of some limitations. The study cannot avoid the methodological limitation of insurance based data analysis. Diagnostic criteria, coding and the timing for follow-up of outpatients might vary in the hospitals, and further validation of the diagnosis was difficult with the insurance database analysis due to lack of detailed records. For example, some newborns with birth defects might have died before entering the hospital, although the number of such patients should be rare. In addition, ICD-9 codes were used to specify birth defects for years 1993–1994, while ICD-10 was used to classify birth defects for 2009–2010. Two versions of disease classification differ substantially. The change to the tenth revision resulted in more detailed classification, with about 8,000 categories compared with about 5,000 categories in the ninth revision. The relatively large difference of some birth defects reported between 1993–1994 and 2009–2010 may be due to the switch from ICD-9 to ICD-10. This study used a comparable category of codes for 26 selected defects according to the ninth and tenth revisions. However, there may be an important underlying variation to case ascertainment and diagnostic criteria (inclusion or exclusion of minor cases) which may have given higher reported rates in some birth defects. A study found the comparability ratio of 0.9064 between ICD-10 and ICD-9 while explaining congenital anomalies and chromosomal abnormalities as a cause of death in the United States. Nonetheless, this study is helpful in understanding increased prevalence of some important birth defects in Korea.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^d495525c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^5e1c6ada]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Incidence and prevalence of fibrous dysplasia / McCune-Albright syndrome: a nationwide registry-based study in Denmark [^a8f1a41e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Definition

A subject was classified as having FD/MAS in case of at least one outpatient hospital visit encounter or inpatient hospital stay coded as monostotic fibrous dysplasia (ICD-10: M85.0), polyostotic fibrous dysplasia/McCune-Albright syndrome (ICD-10: Q78.1), or craniofacial fibrous dysplasia (ICD-10: K10.8), either as primary or secondary diagnosis. Although the latter diagnosis code also includes other fibrous lesions of the jaw, it was planned to include the diagnosis code initially and decide post hoc whether to include or exclude the registered cases. No data exist on validity of these codes specifically, but in general the positive predictive value of three-digit ICD-10 codes in the Danish National Patient Registry is 88%. The index date was defined as the date of the first hospital contact that yielded the FD/MAS diagnosis. FD/MAS is a chronic and incurable disease, and the duration of disease was considered as lifetime.

Statistical Analysis

Demographic data and epidemiological measures were calculated using R 4.2.2 and SAS software, version 9.4. Tables and graphs were designed in R 4.2.2.

Incidence

We calculated incidence rates per 1 000 000 person-years with 95% CIs using the exact Poisson distribution. Incidence data were stratified by sex, 10-year age intervals, age and calendar period, age and sex, FD subtypes (code for MFD vs PFD/MAS) and calendar period, and FD subtype and age. To analyze temporal trends, incidence rates were calculated for intervals of 5 calendar years.

Prevalence

Prevalence was calculated as the ratio of persons having the disease in the calendar year. This cumulative measure included patients being incident at or before the calendar year and who remained alive. The prevalence was referenced to 1 000 000 persons alive at mid-year and the confidence interval was estimated using the normal approximation of the binomial distribution. Prevalences were stratified by sex, 10-year age intervals, age, and 5-year calendar period with prevalence for every fifth year, age, and sex, FD subtypes (code for MFD vs PFD/McCune-Albright syndrome) and age.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^4ab2a812]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Subset of clinical indications broadly accepted for genetic testing (MCA/ID/DD/E)

This cohort was intended to identify a specific subset of clinical presentations that are broadly accepted indications for genetic testing, as suggested by clinical guidelines –. We defined this cohort as patients with ICD-9/10 diagnosis codes for MCA, moderate or severe ID, DD, or E. For patients with MCA, patients were required to have either a code specific for multiple anomalies or codes for single anomalies in two or more organ systems.

An index date was set on the service date of the first appearing qualifying code for a diagnosis for the Conservative and MCA/ID/DD/E cohorts, or on the first appearing diagnosis or test date for the Broad cohort. Identification of the index date included all ICD codes, regardless of whether the code was principal or secondary, with a hierarchy of definite > probable > possible for the index code for claims with more than one associated diagnosis code. Patients were required to be continuously enrolled for 6 months prior to the index diagnosis, with any child < 6 months of age having a reduced continuous enrollment requirement equal to their age on index.

Finally, we divided the sample into two non-overlapping populations based on age and patient acuity: pediatric patients and critically-ill infants. Pediatric patients were either > 28 days of age and ≤ 18 years on the index date, or were ≤ 28 days of age on the index date but had no observed NICU stay at any time during the observation period. Critically-ill newborns were ≤ 28 days of age on the index date and had a stay in a NICU at any time during the observation period. Thus our final analyses were completed on six groups: within both critically-ill infants and within pediatric patients we evaluated Broad, Conservative, and MCA/ID/DD/E cohorts. (Fig. 3)

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^68ee46a4]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study has strengths and limitations. Strengths include the size of the population evaluated — which included over 13 million unique patients from a large commercial health plan population, representative of commercially-insured patients more generally. Our methodology, which included a detailed curation of indicators of genetic disease, allowed us to evaluate several different populations of patients based on different levels of specificity. Finally, our administrative claims-based approach allowed for a comprehensive assessment of direct healthcare-related utilization and costs. Several limitations should be considered in the interpretation of our results. First, as our methodology utilized insurance claims data as opposed to electronic health records, we are limited in our ability to interpret both diagnostic thinking and clinical decision-making. For example, while we observe substantial delays in genetic testing in many patients, the reasons for these delays are unclear and may be clinically warranted based on the unique circumstances of individual patients. Similarly, ICD-9/10 codes do not capture the granularity required to distinguish diagnosed genetic conditions. Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a deep ontology that relates detailed clinical features to both diseases and genes. Availability of HPO terms in a large data set like this would have improved our specificity in defining populations and HPO coding (or improvements in ICD coding informed by HPO) could contribute to future studies of genetic disease in populations. In addition, while some genetic diseases have specific ICD-9/10 codes, many do not; thus, we are unable to definitively determine the end of a diagnostic odyssey for many individual patients. Second, our definitions of possible, probable and definite genetic disease are based on expert opinion and manual curation. Not all patients with these features would have had a genetic diagnosis even if optimal testing had been performed. This is likely due to additional undescribed disease-causing genes, oligogenic and complex inheritance, and environmental phenocopies. How ICD-9/10 codes are used for insurance billing purposes may not be aligned with the diagnostic thinking of clinicians. Coding systems, including diagnosis and procedure codes, are used for billing purposes and are likely to fail to reflect the variability observed in clinical practice. Furthermore, a level of miscoding is presumed to occur as is inherent in claims database studies (e.g. a coding specialist may select the first code on a list of possible codes as opposed to the most appropriate code). Third, given the substantial health conditions of patients with genetic diseases, patients may transition to public insurance programs, switch between private insurance plans, or for other reasons stopped being observed in the database. Although our continuous enrollment requirements help control for some of this variability, there are inherent limitations to the comprehensiveness of the follow-up, which could also be exacerbated by the severity of the disease. Finally, in our selection of patients, we found a large number of newborns with codes indicating a possible genetic condition but no stay in a NICU. Because we required a stay in a NICU, these patients were excluded from analysis in the critically-ill infant population and were instead included in the pediatric population.

Hypophosphatemia

After identifying cases with FD/MAS, all cases were screened for the presence of an encounter coded as "Hypophosphatemia" (ICD-10 code: E83.3), and more generally coded as "Disorders of mineral metabolism" (ICD-10: E.83). In addition, all prescriptions of alphacalcidol (ATC-code A11CC03), other active vitamin D analogues (ATC: AC11CC), and phosphate supplementation (ATC: A12CD02) to cases were identified in the Danish National Prescriptions Registry. Statistical analyses to calculate epidemiological measures of hypophosphatemia in FD/MAS were similar as stated above.

Differentiation Between PFD and MAS

For patients coded with ICD-10 code Q78.1, further differentiation between disease subtypes PFD and MAS was attempted by identifying all encounters coded for MAS-related extraskeletal manifestations (endocrinopathies and café au lait spots) and all prescribed drugs used in the treatment for endocrinopathies. All ICD-10 codes and ATC codes are provided in the supplemental file, Supplementary Table SA.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

Table 2 shows the estimated SMR for certain conditions originating in the perinatal period and congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities. Bold type is used to highlight SMR with associated probability values lower than 0.002 (0.05/23), and therefore significant after accounting for multiple testing. SROH was associated with an increased mortality due to disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight, not elsewhere classified (ICD-10 code P07, 3% risk increase per Mb in SROH, 95%CI: 1–4%) and to intracranial non-traumatic haemorrhage of foetus and newborn (ICD-10 code P52, 5% risk increase per Mb in SROH, 95%CI: 2–9%). The proportion of Aymara–Quechua ancestry was associated with an increased mortality due to respiratory distress of newborn (ICD-10 code P22, 3% increased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: 1–5%) and to anencephaly and similar malformations (ICD-10 code Q00, 5% increased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: 3–7%), and with a decreased mortality due to Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome (ICD-10 code Q91, 4% decreased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: −6 to −2%). The proportion of Mapuche–Huilliche ancestry was associated with an increased mortality due to other congenital malformations of brain (ICD-10 code Q04, 7% increased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: 2–12%) and with a decreased mortality due to Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome (ICD-10 code Q91, 5% decreased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: −8 to −2%).

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^9d2fadcf]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^ac0479d3]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study population

Our methodology to define the study populations was developed with the goal of identifying pediatric (< 18 years of age) patients with indicators of genetic diseases. Diagnostic codes typically do not classify by underlying disease mechanism, and we therefore manually curated lists of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes, Current Procedural Technology (CPT), and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes, and other relevant billing codes (e.g. neonatal intensive care). A detailed list of all codes used in this study can be found in the Supplementary Information. We then used combinations of these codes (see below) to define patient subsets for analysis. These code sets were initially curated by an expert medical geneticist and were reviewed by claims coding experts at Optum. A similar curation methodology for ICD-9 codes has been previously described, though the current study the code sets were expanded to allow for more detailed classification of patient cohorts and utilization of genetic and non-genetic testing and procedures (by including CPT/HCPCS codes) and to allow for additional timeframe analyses (by adding ICD-10 codes). The code curation process resulted in identification of 1269 ICD-9 codes, 2155 ICD-10 codes, and 781 CPT/HCPCS codes. These codes were further curated with respect to the age of presentation as it is well known that some clinical diagnoses are highly suggestive of a genetic disorder within certain age groups but not others (e.g. isolated scoliosis in a newborn may indicate a genetic disorder, but the same feature in an adolescent is more likely to be multifactorial).

### Inpatient hospitalization costs associated with birth defects among persons aged [^b8ef51ff]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

* Identified by scanning up to 40 available fields for ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes Q00–Q99: congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities. Patent ductus arteriosus (Q25.0) and atrial septal defect (Q21.1) were not considered birth defects when occurring in neonates aged < 28 days or with an associated indicator of preterm birth (ICD-10-CM codes P07.2 or P07.3). An additional 23 conditions of lesser clinical importance classified within the Q00–Q99 code range were not considered birth defects.

† Birth defects categories correspond to blocks of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes: cardiovascular (Q20–Q28), central nervous system (Q00–Q07), chromosomal (Q90–Q99), cleft lip/palate (Q35–Q37), ear (Q16–Q17), eye (Q10–Q15), gastrointestinal (Q38–Q45), genitourinary (Q50–Q64), integumentary (Q80–Q85), musculoskeletal (Q65–Q79), and other syndrome (Q87). "Other defect" includes birth defects of the face and neck (Q18), respiratory system (Q30–Q34), and other congenital malformations (Q86 and Q89). Critical cardiovascular defects were operationalized using the National Birth Defects Prevention Network Congenital Malformations Surveillance Report. The specific defects included are only those defined in the National Birth Defects Prevention Network Congenital Malformations Surveillance Report; birth defects not included contribute to frequencies and costs aggregated by birth defect category and overall. Because a single hospitalization might include more than one specific birth defect, individual birth defect frequencies might sum to > 100% of birth defects categories or overall frequencies, and mean costs multiplied by frequencies will correspondingly sum to > 100% of total costs.

Definition of CBDs

In the GBD 2021 study, CBDs were identified using the ICD-10 classification system, encompassing cases coded as G71.2, P96.0, Q00–Q15.9, Q17–Q57, Q63.3, Q64–Q64.19, and Q65–Q99.9. These cases were further categorized into 11 distinct subtypes: neural tube defects, congenital heart anomalies, orofacial clefts, Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, other chromosomal abnormalities, congenital musculoskeletal and limb anomalies, urogenital congenital anomalies, digestive congenital anomalies, and other congenital birth defects. The complete list of ICD codes used for birth defect case identification is provided in Appendix 1.

SEV of risk factors

The GBD 2021 risk factor analysis estimated the SEV for 88 risk factors across various countries and regions worldwide. The SEV reflects the prevalence of risk-weighted exposure within a population. Previous studies have provided detailed classifications and definitions for these 88 risk factors. Building on this foundation, the present study focuses on analyzing the relationship between the SEV of 41 Level 3 risk factors and the age-standardized rates (ASRs) of mortality and DALYs in G20 countries for the year 2021.

SDI

In our study, SDI data for G20 countries (Supplementary Table S3) were obtained from the GBD 2021 dataset. The SDI is calculated as the geometric mean of three key indicators: the total fertility rate among individuals under 25 years of age, the average years of education for individuals aged 15 and older, and the lag-distributed income (LDI) per capita. Each of these indicators is standardized on a scale of 0 to 1. As a composite measure of developmental status, the SDI exhibits a strong correlation with health outcomes, where higher SDI values indicate more advanced levels of socioeconomic development.

HAQ index

In our study, the HAQ index for G20 countries (Supplementary Table S3) was derived from the GBD 2019 dataset. The index is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs) for 32 causes of death and the risk-standardized death rates (RSDRs). This metric serves as a comprehensive tool for evaluating the quality and timeliness of healthcare services across different countries and time periods. The HAQ index ranges from 0 to 100, with higher values reflecting better quality and accessibility of healthcare resources.

### Specificity of international classification of diseases codes for bronchopulmonary dysplasia: an investigation using electronic health record data and a large insurance database [^14631499]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes in electronic health records (EHRs) are increasingly used for health services research, in spite of unknown diagnostic accuracy. The accuracy of ICD codes to identify bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study in a single-center NICU (n = 166) to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of ICD-10 codes for the diagnosis of BPD. Analysis of large insurance claims database (n = 7887) to determine date of assignment of the code.

Results

The sensitivity of any BPD-related ICD codes ranged from 0.82 to 0.95, while the specificity ranged from 0.25 to 0.36. In a large national insurance database, the most common date of ICD-9 or ICD-10 code assignment was the day of birth, which is inconsistent with the clinical definition.

Conclusions

ICD codes registered for BPD are unlikely to accurately reflect the current clinical definition and should be interpreted with caution.

### New coding in the international classification of diseases, ninth revision, for children's interstitial lung disease [^9c9cf4f0]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

The term "children's interstitial lung disease" (chILD) refers to a heterogeneous group of rare and diffuse lung diseases associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These disorders include neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy, pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis, surfactant dysfunction mutations, and alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins. Diagnosis can be challenging, which may lead to a delay in recognition and treatment of these disorders. Recently, International Classifications of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes have been added for several of the chILD disorders. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of the chILD disorders and appropriate diagnostic coding.

### Incidence and prevalence of fibrous dysplasia / McCune-Albright syndrome: a nationwide registry-based study in Denmark [^a86861c1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

Fibrous dysplasia/McCune-Albright syndrome (FD/MAS) is a rare genetic disorder. Incidence and prevalence are not well-studied. Epidemiological research is complicated by the rarity of FD/MAS, absence of registries, heterogeneous presentation, and possibly asymptomatic phenotype. FD/MAS may present with FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemia, of which the epidemiology is also unclear.

Objective

Evaluate incidence and prevalence of FD/MAS and FD/MAS-related hypophosphatemia.

Methods

This cohort study based on the nationwide Danish National Patient Registry from 1995–2018, included patients identified by ICD-10 codes M85.0 (monostotic FD [MFD]) and Q78.1 (polyostotic FD [PFD]/MAS). Incidence rates and prevalence were calculated and stratified by sex, age, calendar period, and diagnosis code. Cases were screened for FD-associated hypophosphatemia by diagnosis code E.83 (disorder of mineral metabolism) and dispatched vitamin D analogues.

Results

A total of 408 patients were identified, 269 with MFD (66%), 139 with PFD/MAS (34%), comparable between sexes. Incidence of FD/MAS demonstrated increasing secular trend with a rate of 3.6 per 1 000 000 person-years (95% CI: 2.9, 4.5) in 2015–2018. Incidence peaked between age 11 and 20. Prevalence of FD/MAS increased over time to 61.0 (95% CI: 54.6, 67.4) per 1 000 000 persons in 2018. The incidence rate of MFD was 1.5-fold that of PFD/MAS in the first decade, rising to 2.5-fold in the last decade. No FD/MAS cases were registered with diagnosis code or treatment for hypophosphatemia.

Conclusion

FD/MAS is rare, diagnosis peaks during adolescence without sex predominance, and MFD is most prevalent. Hypophosphatemia may be underdiagnosed and undertreated, or it may be underregistered, comparing this study to literature.

### Range and frequency of congenital malformations among children with cleft lip and / or palate [^a841db84]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

To assess the range and frequency of additional congenital malformations identified among children born alive with CL/P.

Analysis of patient-level data from a national registry of cleft births linked to national administrative data of hospital admissions.

National Health Service, England.

Children born between 2000 and 2012 receiving cleft care in English NHS hospitals.

The proportion of children with ICD-10 codes for additional congenital malformations, according to cleft type.

The study included 9403 children. Of these 2114 (22.5%) had CL ± A, 4509 (48.0%) had CP, 1896 (20.2%) had UCLP, and 884 (9.4%) had BCLP. A total of 3653 (38.8%) children had additional congenital malformations documented in their hospital admission records. The prevalence of additional congenital malformations was greatest among children with CP (53.0%), followed by those with BCLP (33.5%), UCLP (26.3%), and then CL ± A (22.2%) (P < .001). Among those with UCLP, children with right-sided clefts were more likely to have additional malformations than those with left-sided clefts (31.6% vs 23.0%, P < .001). Malformations of the skeletal system and circulatory system were most common, affecting 10.5% and 10.2% of the included children, respectively. A total of 16.8% of children had additional congenital malformations affecting 2 or more structural systems.

Congenital malformations are common among children born alive with a cleft, affecting over half of some cleft subgroups. Given the frequency of certain structural malformations, clinicians should consider standardized screening for these children. Establishing good links with pediatric and genetic services is recommended.

### Craniosynostosis | Birth defects… [^0bba0c6c]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Craniosynostosis is a birth defect in which the bones in a baby's skull join too early.
- This happens before the brain forms fully and can slow the baby's brain growth.
- Researchers estimate that about 1 in every 2, 500 babies has craniosynostosis in the United States. What it is Craniosynostosis is a condition where the bones in a baby's skull join together too early, before the brain forms fully. As the baby's brain grows, the skull can become misshapen. The spaces between a baby's skull bones are filled with flexible material. These spaces, called sutures, allow the skull to grow as the baby's brain grows. Typically, around two years of age, the skull bones begin to join together as the sutures "close" and become bone. When a suture closes, the baby's head will stop growing in only that part of the skull. In other areas where sutures have not joined together, the baby's head will continue to grow.

When that happens, the skull will have an abnormal shape, though the brain inside can grow to its usual size. Sometimes more than one suture closes early. In these instances, the brain might not have enough room to grow. This can lead to a build-up of pressure inside the skull. The severity of the craniosynostosis can cause additional problems, depending on:

- Which sutures closed early
- When the sutures closed
- Whether or not the brain has room to grow Sometimes, if the condition is not treated, the pressure in the baby's skull can lead to blindness, seizures, or brain damage. Types Sagittal synostosis The sagittal suture runs along the top of the head, from front to back. When this suture closes too early, the baby's head will grow long and narrow. It is the most common type of craniosynostosis.

Coronal synostosis The right and left coronal sutures run from each ear to the sagittal suture at the top of the head. Early closure of these sutures may cause a flattened forehead on the side of the skull that closed early. The baby's eye socket on that side might also be raised up and the nose could be pulled toward that side. This is the second most common type of craniosynostosis. Bicoronal synostosis This type of craniosynostosis occurs when the coronal sutures on both sides of the baby's head close too early. In this case, the baby's head will grow broad and short. Lambdoid synostosis The lambdoid suture runs along the back of the head. If this suture closes too early, the baby's head may be flattened on the back. Metopic synostosis The metopic suture runs from the baby's nose to the sagittal suture at the top of the head.

If this suture closes too early, the top of the baby's head may appear narrow in the front and broad in the back. Risk factors The causes of craniosynostosis in most infants are unknown. In some cases, craniosynostosis occurs because of an abnormality in a single gene. However, in most cases, craniosynostosis is thought to be caused by a combination of genes and other factors. Research studies have also found some factors, like certain medications before or early in pregnancy, might increase the risk of having a baby with craniosynostosis. Diagnosis Craniosynostosis usually is diagnosed soon after a baby is born. Usually, the first sign of craniosynostosis is an abnormally shaped skull. Healthcare providers can identify craniosynostosis by feeling the baby's head for hard edges along the sutures and unusual soft spots. Other signs may include:

Human structural malformations (anomalies or birth defects) have an enormous and complex range of manifestations and severity. The description of these findings can be challenging because the variation of many of the features is continuous and only some of them can be objectively assessed (that is, measured), among other factors. An international group of clinicians resolved to develop a set of terms that could be used to describe human structural malformations, under the general project name 'Elements of Morphology'. Here, the background to the project, progress to date, and the practical implementation of the terminology in research reporting is discussed.

### Clinical outcomes in neonates with congenital heart disease with concurrent congenital neurological anomalies [^0fbecfd2]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

In this study, we used the nationally representative National Inpatient Sample database, spanning the years 2016–2020. A neonate was defined as any patient aged 28 days or younger. Inclusion required at least one hospital admission during the initial 28‑day window, regardless of whether it was the initial delivery admission or a readmission after discharge. Our analytical approach involved a categorization of CHD into three distinct subtypes: simple lesions, complex bi-ventricular lesions, and single ventricle lesions. Supplemental Table (1) This detailed categorization acknowledged the heterogeneity within the broader spectrum of CHD. We used categorization of congenital central nervous system conditions to include both brain and spine anomalies. Supplemental Table (2) We also stratified and evaluated the outcomes in the neonates who underwent surgical repair for CHD vs. those who did not during the admission.

To identify neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD) and central nervous system anomalies, we utilized the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. For CHD we used International Classification of Diseases-10 codes Q20-Q26 and for central nervous system anomalies we used codes Q00- Q07 and further divided into brain, spinal cord and combined anomalies. ICD-10 codes Q00–Q01 encompass major neural tube defects, including anencephaly and encephalocele. Q02 designates microcephaly, while Q03 refers to congenital hydrocephalus. Q04 includes a range of other cerebral malformations, such as lissencephaly and holoprosencephaly. Q05 and Q06 cover spina bifida and additional spinal cord anomalies, and Q07 captures other specified congenital disorders of the nervous system. Supplemental Table 2 We excluded the neonates with chromosomal anomalies and known genetic conditions. Simple or mild CHD encompasses conditions such as atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and other septal defects. Single ventricle lesions consisted of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tricuspid atresia/stenosis, aortic atresia/stenosis, and common ventricle. The remaining lesions were classified as biventricular complex lesions. Supplementary Table 1.

To evaluate baseline characteristics, we employed descriptive statistics to compare the characteristics of neonates presenting with isolated CHD against those with concurrent CNS anomalies.

Our primary objective was to describe disparities in mortality rates between neonates with isolated CHD and those presenting with concurrent CNS anomalies for both surgical and non-surgical neonates in each complexity of CHD category. Our secondary objectives entails a comparative analysis of associated clinical complications.

The software tools Stata version 15 and RStudio were used for data analysis and statistical modeling. We used ggplot for figures.

### Hospitalizations in people with down syndrome across age groups: a population-based cohort study in Switzerland [^0393f5ee]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Classification of primary causes of hospitalization and secondary diagnoses

We classified the primary causes of hospitalization and secondary diagnoses based on ICD-10 codes and classified these into six main disease groups as most relevant due to their prevalence and clinical importance: circulatory system (I00–I99), infectious diseases (A00–B99), digestive system (K00–K95), nervous system (G00–G99), neoplasms (C00–D49), and musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (M00–N99). Congenital malformations of the nervous system (Q00–Q07) were subclassified in the nervous system diseases, congenital malformations of the circulatory system (Q20–Q28) were subclassified in the circulatory system diseases, and congenital malformations of the digestive system (Q38–Q45) in the digestive system diseases, respectively. Furthermore, we classified the following infectious diseases classified elsewhere in ICD-10 as infectious diseases: respiratory infections (J00–J22), infectious arthropathies (M00–M02), inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (G00–G09). Secondary diagnoses are defined diseases diagnosed according to ICD-10 and include both acute and chronic diagnoses. Physiognomic or expected features of Down syndrome could not be assessed, since they are not part of the ICD-10 catalogue and are hence not documented in the nationwide dataset used in this study.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the number of hospitalizations characterized by the incidence rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 population person-years, displayed across age groups and stratified by primary reasons for hospitalization. Secondary outcomes comprised (i) the number of diagnoses per hospitalized patient over lifetime, (ii) length of hospital stay (LOS) — defined as days spent in the hospital during the hospitalization, (iii) intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, (iv) mechanical ventilation rate, (v) length of ICU stay, (vi) all-cause in-hospital mortality, and (vii) 30-day all-cause hospital readmission.

What are the nature and prevalence of the deformities of the upper and lower extremities for the different types of syndromic craniosynostosis?
What kind of screening is required to diagnose these deformities and how to proceed?

Introduction

As part of the phenotype of the craniosynostosis syndromes, deformities of the extremities are frequently seen, varying from very mild with hardly any functional consequences to very complex with very severe functional limitations. Deformities of the extremities that co-occur with a functional limitation need treatment, for which both timing and method are of relevance.

Summary of the Literature

Deformities of the hands and feet and, in less severe conditions, of the elbows, shoulders, knees, and hips, are reported for the syndromic types of craniosynostosis.

Deformities of the extremities are described for the following syndromes:
Apert
Crouzon/Pfeiffer
Saethre-Chotzen
Muenke

### Epidemiology of congenital cerebral anomalies in Europe: a multicentre, population-based EUROCAT study [^a4e45e4a]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe the epidemiology and geographical differences in prevalence of congenital cerebral anomalies in Europe.

Design and Setting

Congenital cerebral anomalies (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision code Q04) recorded in 29 population-based EUROCAT registries conducting surveillance of 1.7 million births per annum (29% of all European births).

Participants

All birth outcomes (live births, fetal deaths from 20 weeks gestation and terminations of pregnancy after prenatal diagnosis of a fetal anomaly (TOPFA)) from 2005 to 2014.

Main Outcome Measures

Prevalence, proportion of associated non-cerebral anomalies, prenatal detection rate.

Results

4927 cases with congenital cerebral anomalies were identified; a prevalence (adjusted for under-reporting) of 9.8 (95% CI: 8.5 to 11.2) per 10000 births. There was a sixfold difference in prevalence across the registries. Registries with higher proportions of prenatal diagnoses had higher prevalence. Overall, 55% of all cases were liveborn, 3% were fetal deaths and 41% resulted in TOPFA. Forty-eight per cent of all cases were an isolated cerebral anomaly, 25% had associated non-cerebral anomalies and 27% were chromosomal or part of a syndrome (genetic or teratogenic). The prevalence excluding genetic or chromosomal conditions increased by 2.4% per annum (95%CI: 1.3% to 3.5%), with the increases occurring only for congenital malformations of the corpus callosum (3.0% per annum) and 'other reduction deformities of the brain' (2.8% per annum).

Conclusions

Only half of the cases were isolated cerebral anomalies. Improved prenatal and postnatal diagnosis may account for the increase in prevalence of congenital cerebral anomalies from 2005 to 2014. However, major differences in prevalence remain between regions.

### Neonatal skeletal dysplasias [^2c1e753f]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Skeletal dysplasias are a large diverse group of disorders characterized by abnormal bone and cartilage growth. Approximately one-quarter of them are considered lethal in the perinatal period. This paper will review the components of the skeletal survey, the primary imaging tool for diagnosing dysplasias postnatally, emphasizing the use of an organized approach and appropriate descriptive terminology. Several illustrative cases of lethal and nonlethal dysplasias will be shown, with additional discussion of commonly associated genetic mutations and classification systems.

### Congenital deformities of the hands [^8196bcca]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of the pediatric musculoskeletal system may be difficult because of differences between children and adults. As children mature, their physical structure approaches that of an adult. However, in the meantime, varying stages of ossification and developmental timelines may confuse the average clinician. Congenital abnormalities of the upper extremity are extremely numerous, but here we present 10 that often are seen in clinical practice. The article discusses the diagnosis, evaluation, treatment, and outcomes of each condition.

### Investigating the impact of additional congenital malformations on speech outcomes at age five in children with a cleft palate [^3910c698]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether children born with a cleft palate ± lip (CP ± L) and additional congenital differences (ACDs - including 'Congenital malformations and deformations' as coded in ICD-10), are less likely to meet the three national speech outcome standards at age five compared to children with CP ± L and no ACDs.

Design

An observational study, utilizing national data from the UK Cleft Registry and Audit NEtwork (CRANE) Database linked to national administrative data of hospital admissions.

Setting

National Health Service, England.

Patients

2191 children (993 female, 1198 male) with CP ± L, born 2006–2012 in England, with complete speech data and consent to data linkage.

Outcome Measure

Perceptual speech analysis utilised the Cleft Audit Protocol for Speech - Augmented (CAPS-A) rating and United Kingdom National Speech Outcome Standards (Speech Standard 1 (SS1), Speech Standard 2a (SS2a) and Speech Standard 3 (SS3)).

Results

Of 2191 children, 759 (35%) had at least one ACD. Presence of one ACD did not significantly impact speech outcomes but two or more ACDs reduced the odds of achieving all three speech standards: SS1 aOR 0.602 (CI 0.45–0.82, P = 0.002), SS2a aOR 0.563 (CI 0.41–0.77, P = 0.001), SS3 aOR 0.606 (0.43–0.84, P = 0.003). When exploring ACDs by ICD-10 groupings, congenital malformations of the 'Eye, ear, face and neck', 'Circulatory system', 'Digestive system', 'Musculoskeletal system' and 'Other congenital malformations' reduced a child's odds of achieving the speech standards.

Conclusions

ACDs, in the absence of a known syndrome, have a significant impact on speech outcome at age five. Incorporating these factors into risk-adjustment models for service level outcome reporting is recommended.

### What drives outcomes in infants of mothers with congenital heart disease? A mediation analysis [^5e73923e]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

To investigate the first aim of the study, the following pregnancy outcomes were assessed: prematurity (GA less than 37 weeks) and critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) of the infant. CCHD of the infant was identified using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, defining CCHD as congenital heart disease that is likely to be detected on pulse oximetry screening in the neonatal period most of the time (Supplemental Table 2).

To investigate the second aim of the study, the following infant outcomes were assessed: 1-year mortality, major neonatal morbidities, need for mechanical ventilation after birth, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), prolonged birth hospitalization, and rehospitalization during the first year of life. Mortality was ascertained through death certificates or hospital discharge status. Major neonatal morbidities included bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, ICD-9-CM 770.7, ICD-10-CM P27.1), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC, ICD-9-CM 777.5, ICD-10-CM P77), intraventricular hemorrhage > grade II (IVH, ICD-9-CM 772.13 and 772.14, ICD-10-CM P52.2), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL, ICD-9-CM 779.7, ICD-10-CM P91.2), and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) > stage 2 (ICD-9-CM 362.25–7 or 14.2, 14.5, 14.7 14.9, ICD-10-CM H35.14–6 or any procedure code for surgery on the retina or choroid plexus). Mechanical ventilation was defined as any type of positive-pressure ventilation (ICD-9-CM 93.90, 93.91, 96.7, 96.04, V46.1, ICD-10-CM 5A10, 5A093, 5A094, 5A095, 0BH1). PPHN was defined with the following ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes: 416.0, 416.8; P29.3, I27.0, I27.2. Prolonged birth hospitalization was defined as length of stay longer than two days for infants delivered via vaginal delivery, or more than four days for those delivered via c-section. Hospital readmissions were found by linking infant discharge records throughout the first year of life.

### Characterizing diagnostic delays in metachromatic leukodystrophy: a real-world data approach [^5778daa7]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD), maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), is the global standard for coding diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures. Used by providers, auditors, and researchers, ICD codes (ICD‐10‐CM) support documentation, billing, and epidemiological research. Based on ICD coding, medical claims databases (payor‐system databases) are an alternative type of electronic record collection that support collation of patient‐level de‐identified information, irrespective of the hospital or care provider. ICD‐10‐CM codes, tracked through claims databases, can be used to map high‐level information related to the medical journey across hospital systems.

In this study, we evaluate the early features of disease prior to diagnosis using a payor‐system database, specifically focusing on differences by sex and payor type (private vs. public insurance) in the time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, and compare this to a natural history study which used medical records to retrospectively map medical events prior to diagnosis.

### Fever in pregnancy and the risk of congenital malformations: a cohort study [^d611b462]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Outcome

Denmark has a Civil Registration System where all citizens are registered with a unique 10-digit identification number used in all registries to identify the person. The identification numbers were used to link information from the Danish National Patient Registry, where pregnancy outcomes including information on congenital malformations were identified.

Congenital malformations in live-born children were diagnosed by physicians according to the International Classification of Disease 10th version (ICD-10), and all children diagnosed with ICD-codes Q00.0 to Q99.9 during the first three and a half year of life were identified.

The congenital malformations were divided into categories according to the classification criteria of the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) as seen in Table 3, where the ICD-10 codes are also specified. Isolated minor congenital malformations (n = 1692) were excluded as cases. According to EUROCAT, minor congenital malformations are characterized as malformations with lesser medical, functional or cosmetic importance.

A small group of infants with aneuploidy (n = 36) was not included as cases, as this chromosomal anomaly is a result of errors in mitosis or meiosis happening before conception.

Some of the congenital malformation categories were joined to form a broader group. The ear, face and neck subgroup was pooled with the eye subgroup and the musculo-skeletal- and limb categories were also united. Finally, in addition to the ICD-10 codes defined by EUROCAT, the category "Other" included the subgroups with abdominal malformations and the chromosomal malformations other than aneuploidies.

Children with more than one malformation were included in each appropriate anomaly subgroup, but were only counted once in the "Overall malformations" group.

### Description of total population hospital admissions for Treacher Collins syndrome in Australia [^88e8c04c]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe patterns and demographic characteristics of total-population hospital admissions with a diagnosis of Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) in Australia.

Data Source

Population summary data for inpatient hospitals admissions (public and private) with a principal diagnosis of TCS (ICD10-AM-Q87.04) were obtained from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare National Hospital Morbidity Database for a 11-year period (2002–2013).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was hospital separation rate (HSR), calculated by dividing the number of hospital separations by estimated resident population per year. Trends in HSR s adjusted for age and sex were investigated by negative binomial regression presented as annual percent change and the association of rates with age and sex was expressed as incidence rate ratio.

Results

In 244 admissions identified, we observed an increase of 4.55% (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.78, 11.29) in HSR's over the 11-year period. Rates were higher during infancy (1.87 [95% CI 1.42, 2.42]), declining markedly with increasing age. The average length of hospital stay was 6.09 days (95% CI 5.78, 6.40) per episode, but longer for females and infants.

Conclusions

Findings indicate an increase in hospitalization rates, especially among infants and females which potentially relates to early airway intervention procedures possibly influenced by sex specific-disease severity and phenotypic variability of TCS. Awareness of the TCS phenotype and improved access to genetic testing may support more personalized and efficient care. Total-population administrative data offers a potential to better understand the health burden of rare craniofacial diseases.

### Estimating the burden and economic impact of pediatric genetic disease [^7da3301e]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To identify the economic impact of pediatric patients with clinical indications of genetic disease (GD) on the US health-care system.

Methods

Using the 2012 Kids' Inpatient Database, we identified pediatric inpatient discharges with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes linked to genetic disease, including well-established genetic disorders, neurological diseases, birth defects, and other physiological or functional abnormalities with a genetic basis. Cohort characteristics and health-care utilization measures were analyzed. Discharges with a GD-associated primary diagnosis were used to estimate the minimum burden; discharges with GD-associated primary or secondary codes established the maximum burden.

Results

Of 5.85 million weighted discharges, 2.6–14% included GD-associated ICD-9-CM codes. For these discharges, mean total costs were $16,000–77,000 higher (P < 0.0001) in neonates and $12,000–17,000 higher (P < 0.0001) in pediatric patients compared with background, corresponding to significantly higher total charges and lengths of stay. Aggregate total charges for suspected GD accounted for $14 to $57 billion (11–46%) of the "national bill" for pediatric patients in 2012.

Conclusion

Pediatric inpatients with diagnostic codes linked to genetic disease have a significant and disproportionate impact on resources and costs in the US health-care system.

### Prevalence and patient characteristics of ectodermal dysplasias in Denmark [^b4913cd5]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Ectodermal dysplasias constitute a group of rare genetic disorders of the skin and skin appendages with hypodontia, hypotrichosis, and hypohidrosis as cardinal features. There is a lack of population-based research into the epidemiology of ectodermal dysplasias.

Objective

To establish a validated population-based cohort of patients with ectodermal dysplasia in Denmark and to assess the disease prevalence and patient characteristics.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This nationwide cohort study used individual-level registry data recorded across the Danish universal health care system to identify patients with ectodermal dysplasias from January 1, 1995, to August 25, 2021. A 3-level search of the Danish National Patient Registry and the Danish National Child Odontology Registry was conducted to identify patients with diagnosis codes indicative of ectodermal dysplasias; patients registered in the Danish RAREDIS Database, the Danish Database of Genodermatoses, and local databases were also added. The search results underwent diagnosis validation and review of clinical data using medical records. Of 844 patient records suggestive of ectodermal dysplasias, 791 patients (93.7%) had medical records available for review. Positive predictive values of the diagnosis coding were computed, birth prevalence was estimated, and patient characteristics were identified. Data analysis was performed from May 4 to December 22, 2023.

Results

The identified and validated study cohort included 396 patients (median [IQR] age at diagnosis, 13 [4–30] years, 246 females [62.1%]), of whom 319 had confirmed ectodermal dysplasias and 77 were likely cases. The combined positive predictive value (PPV) for ectodermal dysplasia-specific diagnosis codes was 67.0% (95% CI, 62.7%-71.0%). From 1995 to 2011, the estimated minimum birth prevalence per 100 000 live births was 14.5 (95% CI, 12.2–16.7) for all ectodermal dysplasias and 2.8 (95% CI, 1.8–3.8) for X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasias. A molecular genetic diagnosis was available for 241 patients (61%), including EDA (n = 100), IKBKG (n = 55), WNT10A (n = 21), TRPS1 (n = 18), EDAR (n = 10), P63 (n = 9), GJB6 (n = 9), PORCN (n = 7), and other rare genetic variants.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this nationwide cohort study indicate that the prevalence of ectodermal dysplasias was lower than previously reported. Furthermore, PPVs of the search algorithms emphasized the importance of diagnosis validation. The establishment of a large nationwide cohort of patients with ectodermal dysplasias, including detailed clinical and molecular data, is a unique resource for future research in ectodermal dysplasias.

### Corneal edema and opacification preferred practice pattern ® [^14409d67]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Corneal opacification — ICD-10 CM classifications list minor corneal opacity H17.81-, peripheral corneal opacity H17.82-, central corneal opacity H17.1-, and phthisical cornea A18.59, H44.52-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Cancer risk in individuals with polydactyly: a Swedish population-based cohort study [^d613ddac]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This large cohort study on individuals with polydactyly presents an increased cancer risk during childhood and young adulthood, predominately in male subjects. The risk was especially elevated in individuals with additional birth defects and/or intellectual disability. We hypothesise that the increased risk could be due to known and hitherto undiscovered CPS and reinforce the value of careful clinical phenotyping in patients with cancer and/or polydactyly. Furthermore, we encourage future researchers to explore the extent of the male predisposition seen in this study and to closely consider sex differences when evaluating birth defects' association to cancer.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^da217d43]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Standardized code sets — HIPAA mandate and ICD-10 governance in the United States — are described as follows: Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services mandates use of standardized code sets in support of electronic health care transactions, which include International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10); Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS); Current Procedural Terminology (CPT); National Drug Codes (NDCs); and Current Dental Terminology. The World Health Organization created the ICD-10 with adaptability for expansion and specificity for enhanced measurement, surveillance, research, and reporting across multiple domains, and it was clinically modified and initiated in the United States on October 1, 2015. The 4 cooperating parties that oversee and manage the ICD-10 in the United States are the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Health Information Management Association, and the American Hospital Association.

### Identifying the misshapen head: craniosynostosis and related disorders… [^fc90fa2e]. publications.aap.org (2020). Medium credibility.

Pediatric care providers, pediatricians, pediatric subspecialty physicians, and other health care providers should be able to recognize children with abnormal head shapes that occur as a result of both synostotic and deformational processes. The purpose of this clinical report is to review the characteristic head shape changes, as well as secondary craniofacial characteristics, that occur in the setting of the various primary craniosynostoses and deformations. As an introduction, the physiology and genetics of skull growth as well as the pathophysiology underlying craniosynostosis are reviewed.

This is followed by a description of each type of primary craniosynostosis and their resultant head shape changes, with an emphasis on differentiating conditions that require surgical correction from those that do not. Introduction Pediatric health care providers evaluate and care for children with a variety of head shapes, some of which represent craniosynostosis and other craniofacial disorders, some of which are deformational in nature, and some of which are simply normal variants. Identifying the various types of head shape abnormalities is important for aesthetics, to identify candidates for future monitoring, and, at least in some, to prevent increases in intracranial pressure and allow proper brain development.

Scaphocephaly, Dolichocephaly, and Bathrocephaly Sagittal synostosis is the most common form of craniosynostosis, accounting for approximately 40% to 45% of cases. The head elongation is best appreciated by looking at the infant from the side. Some patients have an associated saddle deformity at the vertex, giving an overall "peanut" shape to the head. The second consistent abnormality is the biparietal narrowing when looked at from the front or from above. Close modal It is important to distinguish scaphocephaly from dolichocephaly. Although these 2 terms have been used interchangeably by many, dolichocephaly refers to an elongated head without associated biparietal narrowing and is caused by positioning. Dolichocephaly most commonly occurs in preterm infants in the NICU: so-called NICUcephaly.

The net effect of these changes is a trapezoidal head shape with flattening of the ipsilateral calvarium compared to the contralateral side. This presentation stands in distinct contrast to the parallelogram head shape that accompanies most cases of occipital deformational plagiocephaly. Close modal Coronal synostosis additionally involves the sphenozygomatic, frontosphenoidal, and sphenoethmoidal sutures along the frontal skull base, which produces additional secondary morphologic changes involving the orbits and face. Elevation of the lateral sphenoid wing with foreshortening of the zygoma and orbit results in a characteristic elevation of the ipsilateral eyebrow, a seemingly larger palpebral fissure, and/or mild proptosis. The contralateral orbit may be comparatively smaller and is displaced inferiorly and laterally, sometimes leading to a vertical orbital malalignment.

### Pregnancy-related complications in osteogenesis imperfecta [^6f38c6e5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This retrospective cohort study used data from the French national health insurance data warehouse (Système National des Données de Santé), which comprises databases of health insurance claims and hospital discharges linked by a unique patient identifier. The details of the constitution and organization of this health database are given elsewhere in detail. In brief, the system covers about 99% of the entire French population and contains comprehensive data on all reimbursements for health care expenditures, including dispensed drugs and outpatient care provided by health care professionals, as well as demographic data such as sex, age, and area of residence. Patients' status for full reimbursement of care related to a serious and costly long-term disease is recorded and coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). The hospital discharge database provides detailed information on all admissions to French public and private hospitals since 2006. Diagnoses (coded according to the ICD-10) and medical or surgical procedures carried out during hospital stays are available. Birthing parent–child data linkage, possible since 2012 for all deliveries, was available for 94% of all deliveries in 2014.

### Cleft lip sidedness and the association with additional congenital malformations [^dd49665a]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

ObjectiveTo investigate the association between the sidedness of orofacial clefts and additional congenital malformations. DesignLinkage of a national registry of cleft births to national administrative data of hospital admissionsSettingNational Health Service, EnglandParticipants2007 children born with cleft lip ± alveolus (CL ± A) and 2724 with cleft lip and palate (CLP) born between 2000 and 2012. Main outcome measureThe proportion of children with ICD-10 codes for additional congenital malformations by the sidedness (left, right or bilateral) of orofacial clefts. ResultsFor CL ± A phenotypes, there was no evidence for a difference in the prevalence of additional anomalies between left (22%, reference), right (22%, aOR 1.02, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.28; P = 0.90) and bilateral clefts (23%, aOR 1.09, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.57; P = 0.66). For CLP phenotypes, there was evidence of a lower prevalence of additional malformations in left (23%, reference) compared to right (32%, aOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.91; P < .001) and bilateral clefts (33%, aOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.99; P < .001). ConclusionsThe prevalence of additional congenital malformations was similar across sidedness subtypes with CL ± A phenotypes but was different for sidedness subtypes within CLP cases. These data support the hypothesis that CL ± A has a different underlying aetiology from CLP and that within the CLP phenotype, right sided CLP may lie closer in aetiology to bilateral CLP than it does to left sided CLP.

### Pregnancy-related complications in osteogenesis imperfecta [^3cb3dd71]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate obstetric and perinatal outcomes of pregnancies among patients with osteogenesis imperfecta using the French National Health Insurance Database.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study. Pregnancies were identified with an algorithm specifically developed for the French National Health Insurance Database to identify delivery stays using a combination of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) discharge codes and medical procedures. Exposure was osteogenesis imperfecta status based on the occurrence of ICD-10 code Q780 5 years before conception or during pregnancy. Outcomes included pregnancy, delivery, postpartum, and fetal complications based on hospital discharge data and reimbursements of medical procedures, medical devices, and drugs. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed, adjusted for multiple pregnancies per participant with generalized estimating equations.

Results

The cohort included 8,850,969 pregnancies (5,823,322 patients) between January 2012 and December 2023. In total, 408 pregnant individuals (4.6/100,000) were identified with osteogenesis imperfecta. Compared with pregnant individuals without osteogenesis imperfecta, pregnant individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta had increased risks of antepartum hemorrhage (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 1.78, 95% CI, 1.01–3.14), chorioamnionitis (adjusted RR 2.79, 95% CI, 1.17–6.64), malpresentation (adjusted RR 1.65, 95% CI, 1.19–2.30), and preterm delivery (adjusted RR 2.11, 95% CI, 1.62–2.74). Cesarean delivery rates were notably higher in pregnant individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta (adjusted RR 2.59, 95% CI, 2.34–2.88), including among nulliparous individuals (adjusted RR 2.50, 95% CI, 2.22–2.81). Osteogenesis imperfecta was associated with major congenital anomalies (adjusted RR 5.04, 95% CI, 3.97–6.39 overall; adjusted RR 1.67, 95% CI, 1.09–2.56 when osteogenesis imperfecta was excluded from the congenital anomaly definition), especially cardiac anomalies. Postpartum analysis indicated no significant increase in fracture rates compared with prepregnancy periods.

Conclusion

In this nationwide cohort study, osteogenesis imperfecta was associated with both maternal and fetal complications. These findings underscore the need for specialized, multidisciplinary management of pregnancies in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta.

### Can you hear us now? The impact of health-care utilization by rare disease patients in the United States [^c2389deb]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The vast majority of rare diseases (RDs) are complex, disabling, and life-threatening conditions with a genetic origin. RD patients face significant health challenges and limited treatments, yet the extent of their impact within health care is not well known. One direct method to gauge the disease burden of RDs is their overall cost and utilization within health-care systems.

Methods

The 2016 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) databases were used to extract health-care utilization data using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes.

Results

Of 35.6 million national hospital weighted discharges in the HCUP Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 32% corresponded to RD-associated ICD-10 codes. Total charges were nearly equal between RDs ($768 billion) compared to common conditions (CCs) ($880 billion) (p < 0.0001). These charges were a result of higher charges per discharge and longer length of stay (LOS) for RD patients compared to those with CCs (p < 0.0001). Health-care cost and utilization was similarly higher for RDs with pediatric inpatient stays, readmissions, and emergency visits.

Conclusion

Pediatric and adult discharges with RDs show substantially higher health-care utilization compared to discharges with CCs diagnoses, accounting for nearly half of the US national bill.

### The prevalence of congenital hand and upper extremity anomalies based upon the New York congenital malformations registry [^bd4c24a5]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There have been few publications regarding the prevalence of congenital upper extremity anomalies and no recent reports from the United States. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the prevalence of congenital upper extremity anomalies in the total birth population of New York State over a 19-year period utilizing the New York Congenital Malformations Registry (NYCMR) database.

Methods

The NYCMR includes children with at least 1 birth anomaly diagnosed by 2 years of age and listed by diagnosis code. We scrutinized these codes for specific upper extremity anomalies, including polydactyly, syndactyly, reduction defects, clubhand malformations, and syndromes with upper limb anomalies. We included children born between 1992 and 2010.

Results

There were a total of 4,883,072 live births in New York State during the study period. The overall prevalence of congenital upper extremity anomalies was 27.2 cases per 10,000 live births. Polydactyly was most common with 12,418 cases and a prevalence rate of 23.4 per 10,000 live births. The next most common anomalies included syndactyly with 627 cases affecting the hands (1498 total) and reduction defects (1111 cases). Specific syndromes were quite rare and were noted in a total of 215 live births. The prevalence of anomalies was higher in New York City compared with New York State populations at 33.0 and 21.9 per 10,000 live births, respectively.

Conclusions

The NYCMR data demonstrate that congenital upper extremity anomalies are more common than previously reported. This is in large part due to the high prevalence of polydactyly. Although registries are imperfect, such data are helpful in monitoring prevalence rates over time, identifying potential causes or associations, and guiding health care planning and future research.

### Effect of folic acid food fortification in Canada on congenital heart disease subtypes [^2d3798ee]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Case Ascertainment and Classification of CHDs

Up to fiscal year 2000 to 2001, diagnoses in the Discharge Abstract Database were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), with the Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems for Diagnoses (ICD-10) being adopted by Canadian hospitals in 2001 to 2002. The validity of information in the Discharge Abstract Database is assessed continually through abstraction and other studies. These studies show that the diagnosis of CHDs is accurate and that the transition of the coding system from ICD-9 to ICD-10 did not materially affect the coding of CHDs.

CHDs among all live births, stillbirths (including pregnancy terminations), and infants readmitted in the first year after birth were ascertained by the use of ICD-9 codes for diagnoses from 1990 to 2001 to 2002 (745.0–747.9), after which ICD-10 codes (Q20.0–Q26.9) were used. All CHD cases were then classified into the following 6 categories by grouping ICD codes in hierarchical fashion, as previously proposed –,: (1) conotruncal defects consisting of common truncus (745.0/Q20.0 and Q21.4), transposition of great vessels (745.1/Q20.1-Q20.3 and Q20.5), and tetralogy of Fallot (745.2/Q21.3); (2) nonconotruncal defects including endocardial cushion defects (745.6/Q21.2), common ventricle (745.3/Q20.4), and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (746.7/Q23.4); (3) coarctation of the aorta (747.1/Q25.1); (4) ventricular septal defect (745.4/Q21.0 and Q21.8); (5) atrial septal defect (745.5/Q21.1), and (6) other heart and circulatory system anomalies (ie, ICD codes for CHDs excluding the above-mentioned 5 categories). The first 3 categories made up the severe CHD subtypes. Pregnancy terminations resulting from congenital anomalies were included among stillbirths, although they could not be identified separately until 1997 in our data source.

### Vitreoretinopathy-associated pediatric retinal detachment treatment outcomes: IRIS® registry (intelligent research in sight) analysis [^7bcd67fd]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of patients who were documented with a vitreoretinopathy and were younger than 18 years at the time of diagnosis with an RD between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2019. Cases were identified using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 and 10 diagnostic codes from the IRIS Registry cohort. Data from the IRIS Registry are deidentified and do not require patient-level consent. This study abides by the Declaration of Helsinki.

Study Sample

ICD codes were used to identify RRD (H33.00–05, 361.00–05), proliferative vitreoretinopathy (H35.2, 362.2) tractional RD (H33.4, 361.81), hemorrhagic RD (H35.73, 362.43), and other specified congenital malformations, such as Stickler syndrome (Q89.8∗, 759.89∗), Marfan syndrome (Q87.4∗, 759.82∗), or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (Q76.9∗, 756.83∗). Other hereditary vitreoretinopathies that are not encoded by specific ICD code(s) were captured by text search for the following terms: Stickler syndrome, Wagner syndrome, Jansen syndrome, Marshall syndrome, Knobloch syndrome, juvenile retinoschisis, snowflake degeneration, erosive vitreoretinopathy, Kneist dysplasia, and Goldman Favre/enhanced S-cone syndrome. Nonspecific vitreous abnormality ICD codes were also included for other disorders of the vitreous (H43.8, 379.21, 379.27, 379.29), vitreous degeneration (H43.819), vitreous membranes and strands (H43.31, 379.25), unspecified disorder of vitreous (H43.9), congenital malformation of vitreous humor (Q14.08, 743.51), unspecified retinoschisis (361.10), and other retinoschisis and retinal cysts (H33.19, 361.19). The exclusion criteria included traumatic RDs via the ICD codes for ocular trauma (S05.90XA, 918.9) and serous or exudative RD (H33.20, 361.2). The inclusion and exclusion criteria used to generate the study population are summarized in Figure 1.

During this period, psychosocial care of the parents will be central, because this period usually coincides with the baby and infant stage.

The following bottlenecks for the parents, or rather the family, can be identified: long-term uncertainty about the diagnosis, anxiety about a new pregnancy, uncertainty about the expected development, difficulty in choosing a school, coping of the patient and parents with the condition and the abnormal appearance, education, and having to deal with contrasting explanations in the hospital.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^8b6d266d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Genetics and classifications [^810f51f4]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2017). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenital (AMC) is a descriptive term for a group of conditions that all share the characteristic of congenital contractures. There are an estimated 400 discrete diagnoses that can lead to a child being born with arthrogryposis. The 2 biggest categories of conditions are amyoplasia and distal arthrogryposis, which combined make up ∼50% to 65% of all diagnoses within the AMC subset. Amyoplasia, the most common AMC condition, seems to be a nongenetic syndrome, leading to very characteristic upper and lower limb contractures. The distal arthrogryposes, in contrast, have an underlying genetic abnormality, which in many cases seems to target the fast twitch muscles of the developing fetus. Classifying AMC is a difficult task, given the broad range of conditions represented. Four different classification schemes are presented.

### Developing a resiliency model for survival without major morbidity in preterm infants [^86809ed8]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Our primary dataset was drawn from all California live born infants between 2011 and 2017. Birth and death certificates (up to 12 months of age) from California Vital Statistics were linked to the database maintained by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). This dataset was randomly divided into a training dataset (2/3 of the data) and an internal validation dataset (1/3 of the data). We also externally validated the model using a retrospective cohort derived from the Iowa Perinatal Health Research Collaborative (IPHRC) database.

The primary OSHPD dataset included detailed information on maternal and infant characteristics from hospital discharge records from one year prior to birth to one year of age. The data included diagnosis and procedure codes based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9 th and 10 th Revision, clinical modification (ICD-CM). GA was determined by best obstetric estimate from ultrasound and/or last menstrual period. This dataset has been used in multiple studies examining birth and neonatal outcomes. All linked singleton liveborn infants with GA < 32 weeks without major congenital or chromosomal anomalies were included in this study (ICD-9 and 10 codes used to define major congenital or chromosomal anomalies are listed in Supplemental Table 1).

The primary outcome was survival to 1 year of age (determined by death certificate or death as the hospital discharge status). The secondary outcome was a composite of survival without any major neonatal morbidity. Major neonatal morbidity was determined from ICD-9 and ICD-10 CM codes. These included bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, ICD-9 770.7, ICD-10 P27.1), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC, ICD-9 777.5, ICD-10 P77), intraventricular hemorrhage > grade II (IVH, ICD-9 772.13 and 772.14, ICD-10 P52.2), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL, ICD-9 779.7, ICD-10 P91.2), and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) > stage 2. To define ROP > stage 2 we used diagnostic or procedure codes (ICD-9 362.25–7 or 14.2, 14.5, 14.7 14.9, ICD-10 H35.14–6 or any procedure code for surgery on retina or choroid plexus).

### Hospital care in the first 10 years of life of children with congenital anomalies in six European countries: data from the EUROlinkCAT cohort linkage study [^ff210010]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2024). Medium credibility.

Linkage to hospital databases

Each participating registry linked their birth data on children with and without congenital anomalies to their hospital in-patient databases to identify hospital admissions before the child's 10th birthday, or up to 31 December 2015. The Northern Netherlands registry linked their data to two different hospital databases that covered different birth years. Children with discharge codes for congenital anomalies in the hospital databases that were not found in the EUROCAT registries were excluded from the study. Linkage success was high for all registries, with 97% of children with anomalies and 95% of children without anomalies being linked to either a hospital database or another healthcare or population database (for those children who did not have a hospital admission). The Italian registries followed children up to 7 years and the Spanish registry up to 5 years. For the Northern Netherlands, only those children born 1995–2010 were followed up to 9 years. Data for reference children aged < 1 year, born 2013–2014 in the Northern Netherlands, were excluded as outpatient contacts in 2013 had been incorrectly recorded as admissions. Detailed information on linkage and standardisation is given elsewhere.

Length of stay and surgeries

Length of stay (LOS) was calculated as the number of days between the date of admission to hospital and the date of discharge. For hospital stays, where the date of admission and discharge occurred on the same day, the LOS was considered to be 0.5 days. Admissions associated with birth only (ie, obstetric stays immediately after birth with no additional procedures) were excluded.

Surgeries were coded according to the coding systems used in the national health systems. Italy and Spain used the ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, England and Wales used the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Interventions and Procedures and Finland and Denmark used national adaptions of NCSP (NOMESCO Classification of Surgical Procedures). Information on surgeries for the Northern Netherlands was incomplete and not analysed. Two paediatricians independently determined if a code was for a surgical procedure and a consensus between the two clinicians was reached over the final list of surgery codes. Online supplemental appendix table 1 summarises the broad decisions made over which procedures were considered surgeries.

### Testing and extending strategies for identifying genetic disease-related encounters in pediatric patients [^39114c01]. Genetics in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To better understand health care utilization and develop decision support tools, methods for identifying patients with suspected genetic diseases (GDs) are needed. Previous studies had identified inpatient-relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes that were possibly, probably, or definitely indicative of GDs. We assessed whether these codes identified GD-related inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department encounters among pediatric patients with suspected GDs from a previous study (the North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next-Generation Exome Sequencing [NCGENES] study).

Methods

Using the electronic medical records of 140 pediatric patients from the NCGENES study, we characterized the presence of ICD codes representing possible, probable, or definite GD-related diagnoses across encounter types. In addition, we examined codes from encounters for which initially no GD-related codes had been found and determined whether these codes were indicative of a GD.

Results

Among NCGENES patients with visits between 2014 and 2017, 92% of inpatient, 75% of emergency department, and 63% of outpatient encounters included ≥ 1 GD-related code. Encounters with highly specific (ie, definite) GD codes had fewer low-specificity GD codes than encounters with only low-specificity GD codes. We identified an additional 32 ICD-9 and 56 ICD-10 codes possibly indicative of a GD.

Conclusion

Code-based strategies can be refined to assess health care utilization among pediatric patients and may contribute to a systematic approach to identify patients with suspected GDs.

### The development of a European registry for facial dysostosis syndromes: a Delphi-Guided approach [^35b0aeb1]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Figure 1 illustrates the process of article selection, Delphi voting, and dataset formation. After deduplication and screening of 3481 articles, 102 met the eligibility criteria. From these, 85 eligible data elements were identified, complemented by 66 data elements from other ERN CRANIO datasets, and 49 additional elements proposed by expert panel members.

FIGURE 1
Flow chart of the article selection and dataset formation process.

In total, 200 data elements were subjected to Delphi voting. Of these, 98 (49.0%) were strongly recommended for inclusion, none were strongly discouraged, and 102 (51.0%) scored neutrally. The voting process involved 61 experts from various specialties and 3 patient representatives (Supplemental Digital Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1).

Through the consensus meeting with the expert panel, 12 strongly recommended data elements were excluded due to overlap with other elements (Supplemental Digital File 2, Supplemental Digital Content 3). In addition, 24 neutral-scoring elements were included to ensure comprehensive coverage. Ultimately, 110 data elements were included in the FDS dataset with 15 categorized in the level 1 dataset and 95 in the level 2 dataset, besides the 25 common data elements. A complete list of all included data elements, their response options, timing, and Delphi scores is provided in Supplemental Digital File 2 (Supplemental Digital Content 3).

Common Data Elements

The dataset includes 25 common data elements. These include demographic information such as date of birth, sex, country of residence, and patient status (eg, alive, lost to follow-up, deceased). Information on the current health care provider, the age at the first encounter with the specialized center, the age at diagnosis, and the specific diagnosis using Orphanet coding is also captured.

To further specify the diagnosis, additional data elements include availability and type of genetic diagnosis (eg, molecular or chromosomal). Details such as gene name(s), variant description according to nomenclature, allelic state, variant classification according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) classification, and inheritance pattern were included as well.

### Antenatal and postnatal diagnoses of visible congenital malformations in a sub-saharan African setting: a prospective multicenter cohort study [^ff693afa]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Incidence of visible congenital malformations

We identified 189 cases of VCMs out of a total of 21,113 births, an overall incidence of 9 cases per 1000 births. These malformed neonates were delivered by 188 mothers. The highest incidence was observed at the Yaoundé Gynaeco-Obstetrics and Pediatric Hospital, 2.3 per 1000 births (Table 1). The main VCMs were malformations of the skeletal (4.3%), neurological (2.2%), and gastrointestinal (2.1%) systems (Table 2). The most common types were (incidence per 1000 births): polydactyly (2.1), club feet (1.1), neural tube defects (NTD) (1.4), hydrocrocephalus (1.1), cleft lip and palate (0.5) (Fig. 1), omphalocele (0.5), sexual ambiguity (0.5) and facial dysmorphism (0.4). A single malformation was observed in 70.4% of neonates with malformations, whereas a polymalformation syndrome was seen in 29.6% of newborns (Table 3). The association of myelomeningocele (Fig. 2), hydrocephalus and/or lower limb abnormality was the most common polymalformation (17.9%).

Quality evaluation and risk of bias in individual studies

Two investigators (M.C.F.T. and A. I.L) assessed the quality of the methodology of the selected studies. Disagreement was checked by an independent reviewer (A.V.C). The Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for case control studies was used to assess the quality of the selected studies. The NOS scale has 3 principal categories: initial assessment and selection of participants, comparability of groups, and assessment of the outcome of interest (Table 3). Studies with five or more points were considered high quality. A detailed explanation of the quality assessment of the included studies can be found in Table 3.

Brachydactyly

In PHP and related disorders, brachydactyly can be classified as type E, which is defined as variable shortening of the metacarpals with, usually, normal length of phalanges, occasionally accompanied by relatively shortened metatarsals. In PHP and related disorders, the fifth, fourth and third metacarpal and the first and fourth distal phalanges are the most affected bones of the hand; metatarsals are often shortened as well. Brachydactyly develops over time and might not be evident in early life, except in patients with acrodysostosis. The frequency and severity of brachydactyly vary among the different disorders: 70–80% in PHP1A, 15–33% in PHP1B,– and all patients with acrodysostosis. (Table 1). However, brachydactyly is not specific to PHP and related disorders and can be found in patients with, for example, tricho–rhino–phalangeal syndrome, brachydactyly mental retardation syndrome or Turner syndrome (Table 2).

Table 2
Differential diagnoses of PHP and related disorders based on the main clinical presentation

The list of differential diagnoses is not exhaustive but mentions the main diseases that overlap with pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) and related disorders. ALP, alkaline phosphatase; FOP, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive; PTH, parathyroid hormone.

Recommendations

1.11. When brachydactyly type E is identified, other disorders associated with bone dysplasia should be excluded, for example, Turner syndrome, tricho–rhino–phalangeal syndrome, isolated brachydactyly type E and brachydactyly mental retardation syndrome (A+++).

1.12. If not present in infancy, brachydactyly type E should be searched for (clinically and radiologically) from early childhood onwards in all patients with PHP and related disorders (A+++).

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^ccf9d77a]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis ICD-10 CM coding — Blepharitis, which includes entities with the following ICD-10 classifications, lists Ulcerative (H01.01-), Squamous (H01.02-), Stye (H00.01-), Meibomitis (H01.02-), Abscess of eyelid (H00.03-), and Parasitic infestation of eyelid (B89). CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; "(-) = 1, right upper eyelid; 2, right lower eyelid; 4, left upper eyelid; 5, left lower eyelid", and when laterality is specified "Right upper eyelid is always 1", "Right lower eyelid is always 2", "Left upper eyelid is always 4", and "Left lower eyelid is always 5". "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field"; if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". A starred note instructs to "Code first underlying disease, as leishmaniasis (085.0–085.9), loiasis (125.2), onchocerciasis (125.3), or pediculosis (132.0)".
