## Question

A 15-year-old girl with a 2-year history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents to your pediatric rheumatology clinic for follow-up. She was diagnosed with class IV lupus nephritis one year ago and has been managed according to adult lupus nephritis protocols, including immunosuppressive therapy and regular monitoring of renal function. She is currently stable, with no active urinary findings and normal renal function. She will be turning 16 soon, and her parents express concern about her ongoing care as she approaches adulthood.

Based on current EULAR guidelines, what is the recommended approach to managing her lupus nephritis as she transitions from pediatric to adult care?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended approach to managing a 15-year-old with class IV lupus nephritis as she transitions from pediatric to adult care, with emphasis on EULAR guidance and related recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why transition is uniquely risky in pediatric-onset SLE with lupus nephritis. Then, I should verify what EULAR/ERA-EDTA explicitly recommends for transition. Next, I will review ACR and KDIGO alignment and any pediatric-specific considerations that modify adult protocols. After that, I need to outline a practical, stepwise transition plan with timelines, documentation, and coordination. Finally, I will consider special issues like adherence, psychosocial support, and what to do if the patient is already on adult-style regimens, and I will close with a concise, actionable summary anchored to guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk profile. Pediatric-onset SLE carries higher risks of severe nephritis, damage accrual, and adverse outcomes, and the transition period is a vulnerable window with increased risks of care gaps, nonadherence, and flares, so I need to ensure we treat this as a high-priority process rather than a passive transfer of records [^3285288d] [^1bc7881e].

> I should confirm the EULAR/ERA-EDTA stance. The 2019 EULAR/ERA-EDTA update explicitly recommends ensuring a coordinated transition program to adult specialists to support adherence and optimize long-term outcomes, which is a direct answer to the parents' concern and underscores that transition is a quality standard rather than optional [^19798ec9].

> Wait, let me verify alignment with other major guidelines so I don't overstate a single source. The 2024 ACR lupus nephritis guideline similarly recommends implementing a structured, intentional transition from pediatric to adult rheumatology and nephrology care for childhood-onset SLE to avoid poor outcomes, and KDIGO advises treating pediatric LN with adult-style regimens while considering pediatric-specific issues, which supports continuity of evidence-based therapy across the transition [^7eac3388] [^7c3592da].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric-specific modifications that might change management during or after transition. ACR emphasizes pediatric-appropriate glucocorticoid dosing, vigilance for growth and pubertal effects, and structured transition, while KDIGO reminds us to consider dose adjustments, growth, fertility, and psychosocial factors when planning therapy in adolescents, which should be documented and communicated to adult teams [^f36285ce] [^7c3592da].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise transition plan. Let me think about timing and readiness: start formal transition planning around age 14–15, aim for transfer during medical and psychosocial stability, and use a written transition policy with a designated coordinator; this mirrors EULAR/PReS transition recommendations for adolescent rheumatic diseases and is echoed by nephrology transition consensus statements [^d6940e76] [^b77fb182].

> I need to ensure documentation and communication are explicit. A comprehensive medical summary should include disease course, biopsy details, current and prior immunosuppression, response targets, adherence history, growth and pubertal status, vaccinations, and psychosocial needs; direct communication between pediatric and adult rheumatology/nephrology should occur before and after transfer, and a transfer document should accompany the patient, ideally with a warm handoff and early follow-up within 4–6 weeks [^d6940e76] [^1bc7881e].

> Let me consider adherence and self-management, because these drive outcomes. I should confirm that transition planning includes education on medication management, insurance navigation, and self-advocacy, and that we screen for and address barriers such as pill burden, side effects, and mental health; ACR patient-panel priorities and pediatric SLE reviews reinforce these as core elements to prevent dropout and flares during transfer [^fda9330c] [^eaf92478].

> But wait, what if the patient is already receiving adult-style induction/maintenance therapy? Does that change transition logistics? KDIGO and ACR endorse adult-equivalent regimens for pediatric LN with pediatric-specific dosing and monitoring, so the key is to ensure the adult team continues the same evidence-based regimen, maintains the same response targets (complete response typically defined as proteinuria < 0.5 g/g with stable kidney function), and avoids unnecessary therapy switches during stability, which aligns with EULAR's emphasis on continuity and adherence [^7c3592da] [^2a3d4b4f] [^d6dbb617].

> I should double-check monitoring cadence and long-term goals to set expectations. EULAR recommends frequent early follow-up after diagnosis or flare (about every 2–4 weeks initially), then spacing based on response, with lifelong surveillance for renal and extrarenal disease and comorbidities; this cadence should be communicated to adult providers to avoid abrupt lengthening of intervals during transition [^3153aebf] [^9e2acfe2].

> Let me reconsider any potential pitfalls. Nonadherence and loss to follow-up are common in this age group, and disparities in access and communication can worsen outcomes; therefore, embedding a transition coordinator, verifying insurance and medication access pre-transfer, and scheduling the first adult appointment before leaving pediatric care are critical guardrails to mitigate preventable flares and ESRD risk [^1bc7881e] [^c297c2e5].

> In summary, I should confirm that the EULAR-aligned approach is to implement a structured, coordinated transition program with early start, clear documentation, direct communication, and continuity of evidence-based immunosuppression, while addressing pediatric-specific needs such as growth, fertility, and self-management; this strategy is supported by ACR and KDIGO and directly addresses the parents' concern by reducing care gaps and optimizing long-term outcomes [^19798ec9] [^7eac3388] [^7c3592da].

---

Per EULAR/ERA-EDTA 2020, pediatric LN should be managed like adult LN [^3285288d], but **transition to adult care must be planned and coordinated** to maintain disease control and adherence [^19798ec9]. Start transition planning at least 6–12 months before transfer, ideally at age 16–18, and ensure a structured handover with a comprehensive medical summary, medication reconciliation, and a single transition coordinator [^d6940e76]. Adult teams should continue evidence-based induction/maintenance regimens (e.g. mycophenolate or low-dose cyclophosphamide plus glucocorticoids) [^4032204d] and maintain the same response targets and monitoring cadence [^27fb8f55] [^3153aebf]. Emphasize adherence, self-management, and psychosocial support to reduce relapse and care gaps during transfer [^1bc7881e].

---

## Timing and initiation of transition

- **Start early**: Begin transition planning at least 6–12 months before the intended transfer, ideally at age 16–18, to allow adequate preparation and avoid rushed transfers [^d6940e76].

- **Stability first**: Transfer should occur only when the patient is clinically stable, with no active disease or recent flares, to minimize risks during the transition [^c297c2e5].

- **Individualized timing**: Tailor the transfer age to the patient's maturity, disease control, and psychosocial readiness, rather than using a fixed age cutoff [^d6940e76].

---

## Key components of transition care

### Structured transition program

A **written transition policy** should be in place in both pediatric and adult services, outlining roles, responsibilities, and timelines [^d6940e76]. A **designated transition coordinator** should oversee the process, ensure continuity, and track outcomes [^d6940e76]. The program should include education on disease self-management, medication adherence, and navigating adult healthcare systems [^1bc7881e].

---

### Comprehensive medical summary

Provide a **detailed medical summary** covering disease history, biopsy results, current and prior treatments, response to therapy, and adherence history [^506a6080]. Include growth and pubertal development, fertility considerations, and psychosocial needs specific to pediatric patients [^e78c2e8b]. Ensure the summary is transferred to the adult team before the first visit [^d6940e76].

---

### Medication reconciliation and adherence support

Review and reconcile all medications, ensuring **accurate dosing and clear instructions** [^notfound]. Address adherence barriers and provide tools (e.g. pill organizers, reminders) to support adherence [^d6940e76]. Educate the patient and family on the importance of adherence and potential consequences of non-adherence [^d6940e76].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Maintain the same monitoring cadence as in pediatric care, with **frequent visits initially** after transfer to ensure stability and adherence [^3153aebf]. Continue regular assessment of renal function, proteinuria, blood pressure, and disease activity [^3153aebf]. Monitor for growth and pubertal development, and refer to endocrinology if indicated [^e78c2e8b].

---

## Clinical management considerations during transition

### Continuation of evidence-based therapy

Continue the same **induction and maintenance regimens** used in pediatric care, such as mycophenolate mofetil or low-dose cyclophosphamide with glucocorticoids, as recommended by EULAR/ERA-EDTA and ACR guidelines [^4032204d]. Maintain the same treatment goals, including complete renal response (proteinuria < 0.5 g/day) and prevention of flares [^27fb8f55]. Avoid unnecessary changes in therapy during the transition unless clinically indicated [^notfound].

---

### Addressing pediatric-specific issues

Pay special attention to **growth and pubertal development**, adjusting glucocorticoid therapy as needed and referring to pediatric endocrinology if indicated [^e78c2e8b]. Discuss fertility preservation and contraception with adolescent females, especially if cyclophosphamide has been used [^notfound]. Provide psychosocial support to address anxiety, depression, and body image issues common in adolescents with chronic illness [^notfound].

---

### Patient and family education

Educate the patient and family on **disease self-management**, including symptom recognition, medication management, and when to seek medical attention [^d6940e76]. Provide resources on navigating adult healthcare systems, insurance coverage, and accessing medications [^d6940e76]. Encourage the development of independence and self-advocacy skills [^d6940e76].

---

## Potential challenges and solutions

| **Challenge** | **Solution** |
|-|-|
| Loss to follow-up | - Designated transition coordinator <br/> - Early follow-up appointments <br/> - Reminder systems [^d6940e76] |
| Medication non-adherence | - Education <br/> - Adherence tools <br/> - Simplified regimens <br/> - Regular adherence monitoring [^d6940e76] |
| Communication gaps | - Direct communication between pediatric and adult teams <br/> - Comprehensive medical summary <br/> - Joint visits if possible [^d6940e76] |
| Psychosocial stressors | - Psychosocial support <br/> - Counseling <br/> - Peer support groups [^notfound] |

---

## Long-term outcomes and benefits of structured transition

Structured transition programs are associated with **improved adherence**, reduced disease activity, and better renal outcomes [^notfound]. They also reduce emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and healthcare costs [^notfound]. Patients report improved satisfaction with care and better quality of life [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

EULAR/ERA-EDTA emphasizes a **coordinated, structured transition** from pediatric to adult care for adolescents with lupus nephritis to maintain disease control and adherence [^19798ec9]. Start planning early, ensure clinical stability, and use a designated coordinator to oversee the process. Continue evidence-based therapy, address pediatric-specific needs, and provide comprehensive education and support. This approach reduces relapse, care gaps, and long-term complications, ultimately improving outcomes for young adults with lupus nephritis [^235d07ec].

Adjunctive and non-immunologic treatments in lupus nephritis (LN)—Adjunctive and non-immunologic therapies and practices should be added to appropriate immunosuppressive therapy to improve overall kidney health. In children with childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) nephritis, glucocorticoid regimens should use pediatric-appropriate doses for children, and clinicians should monitor for delayed pubertal onset and decreased growth velocity that can result from disease activity and glucocorticoid treatment and consider referral to pediatric endocrinology if indicated. For children with cSLE nephritis, a structured, intentional transition from pediatric to adult care is indicated to avoid poor outcomes during this vulnerable period. For older people with LN, medication number, type, and dosage should be regularly assessed, given the risks of polypharmacy and age-related decline in GFR in this population.

Lupus nephritis (LN) guiding principles—The goals of LN treatment are to preserve kidney function, reduce morbidity and mortality associated with chronic kidney disease, and minimize medication-related toxicities. Collaborative care from rheumatology and nephrology should be offered to people with LN whenever possible. Shared decision-making between clinicians and patients is essential as it respects patient values and preferences, leading to better adherence and outcomes. Healthcare disparities may impact outcomes in people with LN; equitable implementation of treatment recommendations aims to improve outcomes and alleviate health disparities. Pediatric and geriatric good practice statements are included when applicable.

In the past years, many (randomized) trials have been performed comparing the treatment strategies for lupus nephritis. In 2012, these data were incorporated in six different guidelines for treating lupus nephritis. These guidelines are European, American and internationally based, with one separate guideline for children. They offer information on different aspects of the management of lupus nephritis including induction and maintenance treatment of the different histological classes, adjunctive treatment, monitoring of the patient, definitions of response and relapse, indications for (repeat) renal biopsy, and additional challenges such as the presence of vascular complications, the pregnant SLE patient, treatment in children and adolescents and considerations about end-stage renal disease and transplantation. In this review, we summarize the guidelines, determine the common ground between them, highlight the differences and discuss recent literature.

### Childhood-onset lupus nephritis: unique aspects and challenges in management [^0c9126a3]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

Childhood-onset lupus nephritis is an important glomerular disease that requires safe and effective treatments to reduce the incidence of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease. Novel treatments have become available for adults in the last decade, notably belimumab, obinutuzumab and voclosporin. In contrast, most children with lupus nephritis are treated with conventional immunosuppression, and treatment recommendations are extrapolated from adult data since paediatric patients have historically been rarely included in clinical trials. However, children are not small adults with evolving immune systems, and there is a significant role of genetics contributing to the complex disease pathogenesis. In this mini review, we will highlight several unique aspects in managing childhood-onset LN (cLN), including the optimal definition of disease remission, prevention of relapse, the delicate balance between treatment efficacy and side-effects, and monogenic forms of lupus nephritis. We will also discuss how treatment adherence and dedicated transition care can affect treatment outcomes.

### 2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^94a03418]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based and expert guidance for the treatment and management of non-renal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); treatment and management of lupus nephritis are addressed in a separate guideline.

Methods

Clinical questions for treatment and management of SLE were developed in the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome). Systematic literature reviews were developed for each PICO question, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess evidence quality and formulate recommendations. The Voting Panel achieved a consensus of ≥70% agreement on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation.

Results

We present recommendations and ungraded, consensus-based good practice statements for the treatment and management of SLE that are applicable to pediatric and adult patients. Recommendations emphasize uniform treatment with hydroxychloroquine, limiting duration of glucocorticoid use, and early introduction of conventional and/or biologic immunosuppressive therapies to achieve and maintain control of SLE inflammation (remission or a low level of disease activity), reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize medication-related toxicities.

Conclusion

This guideline presents direction regarding treatment and management of SLE and provides a foundation for well-informed, shared clinician-patient decision-making. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies, as treatment decisions may vary due to the unique clinical situation and personal preferences of each person with SLE.

- Over 200, 000 people in the United States are estimated to have SLE.
- Women and people from certain racial and ethnic groups are more likely to develop SLE. People affected by lupus An estimated 204, 000 people have SLE in the United States, according to the most recent data available. This includes about:
- 184, 000 females.
- 20, 000 males. Anyone can develop lupus, including children. However, lupus is more common in:
- Women.
- People from certain racial and ethnic groups. Mostly in women Most people with lupus are women. It is estimated that 9 out of every 10 people with lupus are women. Women of childbearing age have the highest risk of developing SLE. Racial and ethnic groups Black or African American, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian and Alaska Native populations are affected more than White populations.

Black and AI/AN women are 2 to 3 times more likely than White women to develop lupus. They also tend to have more severe cases of lupus. Lupus-Related deaths Black people have higher rates of death from lupus than White people.
- Black people with lupus also tend to die sooner after they are diagnosed.
- And they tend to die younger, compared to White people with lupus. Fact

### The management of lupus nephritis as proposed by EULAR / ERA 2019 versus KDIGO 2021 [^50890c92]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2019 and 2021, the European League for Rheumatism (EULAR) jointly with the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), respectively, released updated guidelines on the management of lupus nephritis (LN). The Immunology Working Group of the ERA reviewed and compared both updates. Recommendations were either consistent or differences were of negligible clinical relevance for: indication for kidney biopsy, kidney biopsy interpretation, treatment targets, hydroxychloroquine dosing, first-line initial immunosuppressive therapy for active class III, IV (±V) LN, pregnancy in LN, LN in paediatric patients and LN patients with kidney failure. Relevant differences in the recommended management relate to the recognition of lupus podocytopathies, uncertainties in steroid dosing, drug preferences in specific populations and maintenance therapy, treatment of pure class V LN, therapy of recurrent LN, evolving alternative drug options and diagnostic work-up of thrombotic microangiopathy. Altogether, both documents provide an excellent guidance to the growing complexity of LN management. This article endeavours to prevent confusion by identifying differences and clarifying discrepancies.

### Transition and transfer of the patient with paediatric-onset lupus: a practical approach for paediatric and adult rheumatology practices [^d6940e76]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Expert opinion guidelines

A recently published European set of recommendations for pSLE included transition as a critical element of care, specifying that ‘a coordinated transition programme including paediatric and adult specialists is crucial for ensuring continuity of care and adherence to treatments in order to optimize long-term outcomes including prevention of fatalities’.The authors further advised that adolescent patients be supported through the transition and transfer process, advocating for concerted efforts to develop adolescents’ self-management skills and address the challenges of non-adherence. In addition, a 2011 review of pSLE management supported integrating ‘adherence to medications and clinic visits as well as self-management training’ into the routine care of patient with pSLE.

Looking at transition and transfer best practices for the broader category of paediatric rheumatology patients, a 2015 consensus statement from the Spanish Society of Pediatric Rheumatology used a Delphi process to establish 18 recommendations, including training paediatric rheumatologists and related healthcare professionals in translational care.In addition, in 2016 the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society (PReS) jointly published transition recommendations for AYA with paediatric-onset rheumatic diseasesbased on the input of 200 European adult and paediatric rheumatology specialists. This report made 12 recommendations, including that every rheumatology service has a written transition policy and that providers begin discussing transition with patients in early adolescence. The EULAR/PReS guidelines also recommend that transitional care be individualised, based on the needs and abilities of patients and their families, addressing medical, psychosocial, educational and vocational needs. The recommendations also stipulate that a transfer document should accompany transferring patients, that there should be direct communication between the paediatric and adult rheumatologists both before and after transfer, in addition to the involvement a designated transition coordinator. Analyses of multiple published transition programmes point to the pivotal role of a transition coordinator as a main contributor to successful outcomes.

Tracking AYA outcomes post-transfer is a valuable role for the transition coordinator and helps guide the development, refinement and implementation of transition interventions. As Foster et al point out in the EULAR/PReS recommendations, one challenge in transition research is the lack of a single outcome of ‘successful transition’.The literature is highly varied with regard to what constitutes key indicators of successful transition and transfer,with candidates including disease activity and status, patient (and family) experience of care, adherence to treatment, patient engagement in care, and achievement of young adult development tasks, including psychosocial, educational and vocational status outcomes.

### 2024 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the screening, treatment, and management of lupus nephritis [^afe5689d]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective is to provide evidence-based and expert guidance for the screening, treatment, and management of lupus nephritis.

Methods

The Core Team developed clinical questions for screening, treatment, and management of lupus nephritis using the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome). Systematic literature reviews were completed for each PICO question, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the quality of evidence and to formulate recommendations. The Voting Panel achieved a consensus ≥70% on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation.

Results

We present 28 graded recommendations (7 strong, 21 conditional) and 13 ungraded, consensus-based good practice statements for the screening and management of lupus nephritis. Our recommendations focus on the unifying principle that lupus nephritis therapy is continuous and ongoing, rather than consisting of discrete induction/initial and maintenance/subsequent therapies. Therapy should include pulse glucocorticoids followed by oral glucocorticoid taper and two additional immunosuppressive agents for 3-5 years for those achieving complete renal response.

Conclusion

This guideline provides direction for clinicians regarding screening and treatment decisions for management of lupus nephritis. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies, as treatment decisions may vary due to the unique clinical situation and personal preferences of each individual patient.

### Assessing success in transitioning of young adults from pediatric to adult kidney practice [^57b2fbde]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a growing body of research on transitioning patients with chronic conditions from pediatric to adult care. Young adult patients face many challenges throughout this transition process. Some challenges include: difficulty navigating adult healthcare systems, gaps in insurance coverage, lack of health self-efficacy, and limited experience in self-management. Transition programs/clinics have been developed to support the transfer to adult care and to reduce patient vulnerabilities and interruptions in care. The International Society of Nephrology and the International Pediatric Nephrology Association released a consensus statement outlining the ideal clinical management of young adult patients. Since these guidelines were released in 2011, there has been a growing interest in evaluating transition programs. While most research has focused on clinical outcomes to determine the effectiveness of transition programs, little work has been done to evaluate patients’ viewpoints of a transition program.

ACR lupus nephritis (LN) guideline recommendations and methodology—We present 28 Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)-generated recommendations (7 strong, 21 conditional) and 13 ungraded, consensus-based GPS. Consensus required ≥70% agreement on direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation. A recommendation is categorized as strong if the panel is confident that the benefits of an intervention clearly outweigh the harms (or vice versa); a conditional recommendation denotes uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and harms, low quality of evidence, or that the recommendation is particularly sensitive to individual patient preferences and patient-provider discussion. The strength of a recommendation determines its clinical implications and should be considered when interpreting and using it for patient care; for patients, a strong recommendation suggests that most people in their situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not; for clinicians, it means most patients should receive the recommended course of action. With a conditional recommendation, the implication for patients is that most people in their situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not; for clinicians, it means they should recognize that different choices will be appropriate for different patients and they must engage in shared decision-making with each patient to arrive at a management decision. GPS are made when panel members are confident that there is unequivocal benefit or harm despite indirect or inadequate evidence.

Nephrotic syndrome in children—initial glucocorticoid course length and implementation—compared regimens of ≥12-week versus 8-week duration and judged the certainty for frequent relapses as low, with recent data indicating that prolonging treatment >12 weeks increases harm without added relapse benefit; there is insufficient evidence to choose between 8 and 12 weeks, so local practice, resources, and patient preferences may guide selecting 8 weeks. Prednisolone is inexpensive, widely available, and does not require special monitoring; in children with particularly young age at onset (1–6 years), prolonging the initial episode to 16–24 weeks may be beneficial only when there is a delayed response to prednisolone (remission in 10–15 days), whereas rapid responders may be managed with shorter courses and 8 weeks may be preferable in children achieving rapid remission within 7 days or with comorbidities. The recommendation is designated Level 1 because nearly all well-informed parents and patients would choose 8 or 12 weeks of glucocorticoids as initial treatment of SSNS rather than longer courses, other treatment, or no treatment; the alternative (no treatment) is not acceptable, and the recommendation places higher value on reducing adverse events with shorter-term (8–12 weeks) therapy and on evidence suggesting increased adverse effects with prolonged (>12 weeks) treatment without further clinical improvement.

### New guidelines and therapeutic updates for the management of lupus nephritis [^f81aa27c]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be a devastating condition, striking young patients often in their prime reproductive years. Lupus nephritis is a common and serious complication occurring in roughly 50% of SLE cases, indicating a high likelihood of disease progression, morbidity, and mortality. As the early trials of steroid therapy, and later cyclophosphamide (CYC), therapeutic changes had been stagnant. Then came the introduction of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in the 2000s. After the Aspreva Lupus Management Study, there had been a dearth of trials showing positive therapy results. Since 2020, new studies have emerged for lupus nephritis involving the use of anti-BLYS agents, novel calcineurin inhibitors, CD20 blockade, and antiinterferon agents. Nephrology and rheumatology society guidelines in the United States and across the world are still catching up.

Recent Findings

Although therapeutic guidelines are being developed, updates that have come through have focused on improved diagnostic and monitoring guidelines. One theme is the recommendation of increasingly tight proteinuria control and firmer guidelines for the rapid induction of remission. The reality of multitarget therapy and the expectation of rapid induction for a more complete remission are being widely recognized.

Summary

The need for more complete and more rapid induction and control of lupus nephritis is undisputed according to the evidence and guidelines, and the medications to achieve this are growing at a rate not seen over the prior two decades. What remains is a stepwise approach to recognize how to best optimize therapy. Based on available evidence, an algorithm for induction and maintenance treatment of lupus nephritis used by the University of California Irvine Lupus Nephritis clinic, is recommended.

Care transitions—KDOQI US commentary affirms the difficulty of moving patients from pediatric to adult nephrology and recommends internal leadership for coordination. The authors state, “We agree that the transition of care between pediatric and adult nephrology care is especially challenging and requires both special attention and established protocols,” and “Recognizing that emerging adulthood is a high-risk time period for all young adults, especially for those with chronic illness, is critical for adult providers.” They add, “We therefore recommend that within a practice a transition champion(s) partners with a pediatric nephrologist(s) to ensure optimal communication and care for this population.” They also note, “the timing of transfer should occur during a medically and psychosocially stable period,” and “The patient, however, should also be included in the discussion around appropriate timing and planning of transfer of care.”

### Pediatric SLE – towards a comprehensive management plan [^eaf92478]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) results from complex abnormalities of the innate and acquired immune systems. For reasons that are currently not well understood, the disease course and phenotype associated with SLE, although quite variable, are generally more severe when the diagnosis is made during childhood. Active disease, infections, lupus nephritis, and neuropsychiatric SLE manifestations are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Unlike in adult-onset SLE, systemic glucocorticoid therapy and immunosuppressive medications are needed for the treatment of the majority of children and adolescents with SLE. The complex nature of childhood-onset SLE demands a comprehensive, multidisciplinary management approach that considers the patients' growth and development, their educational needs, and the unpredictable course of SLE and its complications.

Lupus nephritis—clinical trial response definitions are specified as follows: Complete response requires reduction in proteinuria <0.5 g/g (50 mg/mmol) measured as the protein–creatinine ratio (PCR) from a 24-h urine collection, stabilization or improvement in kidney function (±10%–15% of baseline), and assessment within 6–12 mo of starting therapy, but could take more than 12 mo. Primary efficacy renal response (PERR) requires PCR ≤0.7 g/g (70 mg/mmol), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) that was no worse than 20% below the pre-flare value or ≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and no use of rescue therapy for treatment failure. Partial response requires reduction in proteinuria by at least 50% and to <3 g/g (300 mg/mmol) measured as the PCR from a 24-h urine collection with stabilization or improvement in kidney function (±10%–15% of baseline) within 6–12 mo of starting therapy. No kidney response is failure to achieve a partial or complete response within 6–12 mo of starting therapy. For children <18 years old, complete response is defined as proteinuria <0.5 g/1.73 m2 per day or <300 mg/m2 per day based on a 24-hour urine specimen.

### International consensus for provisions of quality-driven care in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus [^e5c4b367]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To obtain international consensus around processes that support the delivery of high-quality care to patients with childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) based on current recommendations and scientific evidence.

Methods

To identify process quality indicators (QIs) for the medical care of children and adolescents with childhood-onset SLE, we sent 2 Delphi questionnaires internationally to 340 physicians who treat these patients. We set consensus at 80% of completed responses.

Results

Two hundred ninety-seven physicians (87%) responded to the first Delphi questionnaire and 265 physicians (76%) responded to the second questionnaire. The group achieved consensus for 26 QIs addressing laboratory testing at diagnosis, health maintenance measures, diagnosis and therapy of lupus nephritis, general preventive strategies, surveillance for medication safety, counseling and evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors, as well as transition planning. Of the 26 process QIs for use in childhood-onset SLE, 11 matched those established for adults with SLE, 9 required modification, and consensus was reached for an additional 6 QIs specific to children.

Conclusion

An international consensus for a set of process QIs for childhood-onset SLE was reached that considers unique aspects of children with childhood-onset SLE. The presented set of QIs for children and adolescents with childhood-onset SLE defines agreed-upon standards of medical care.

DISCUSSION

Kidney involvement in SLE has significant implications for the disease management and prognosis. Several authorities, including the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and American College of Rheumatology, have published recommendations for the management of LN.The recently published update of the joint EULAR/ERA-EDTA recommendations was based on a dedicated SLR, which covered several aspects of the disease (formed in the 15 research questions) and not just the efficacy and safety of immunosuppressive agents used in the treatment of its different phases. To this end, we followed an inclusive approach during article selection, in order to capture data from observational and non-controlled studies, in topics where randomised controlled studies are absent or scarce. Importantly, because this was an update of previous recommendations published in 2012,data retrieval started from the ending date of the previous SLR, although overall LoE and GoR took into account the whole body of evidence.

Kidney biopsy remains a cornerstone in the diagnosis and management of LN, because the prognostic value of histological findings cannot be replaced by any clinical or laboratory parameter. In addition to features with well-established prognostic value (histological class, activity and chronicity indices, presence of crescents), from the review of the literature it became evident that acute or chronic lesions of the tubulointerstitial space (inflammation and fibrosis/tubular atrophy, respectively) are also associated with adverse short- and long-term outcomes. Regarding features of thrombotic microangiopathy, prognostic associations are more equivocal, despite the fact that such lesions may be present in up to one in four kidney biopsies in LN. A current revision of the 2003 ISN/RPS class, which will address these issues, is currently under way. The issue of repeat kidney biopsy, performed either per protocol or during a disease flare, was explored in several observational studies; histological transition is common, often leading to changes in treatment.

Lupus nephritis (LN)—treatment in children advises: Treat pediatric patients with LN using immunosuppression regimens similar to those used in adults, but consider issues relevant to this population, such as dose adjustment, growth, fertility, and psychosocial factors, when devising the therapy plan. Approximately 20% of SLE is diagnosed before the age of 18 years, and In adolescent patients with SLE and isolated proteinuria, orthostatic or postural proteinuria should be excluded, as this phenomenon has been observed frequently in this population; Children with LN should be comanaged by pediatric nephrologists and rheumatologists with expertise in lupus, and the expertise of other professionals, such as clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, or social workers, can be helpful.

METHODS

We followed the standardised operating procedures for the development of EULAR-endorsed recommendations and employed the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation instrument.A Delphi-based methodology within the Task Force identified 15 research questions covering the following topics related to LN: diagnosis and classification, pharmacologic treatment, monitoring and therapeutic targets, refractory LN, management of LN in pregnancy, antiphospholipid syndrome-associated nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, comorbidities and adjunctive therapy. Since this was an update of the 2012 recommendations, the SLR considered all PubMed English-language articles published between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018. As the search strategy intended to address 15 different questions, instead of performing a single, broad SLR, we chose to perform focused SLRs for each topic separately. This resulted in 14 dedicated search strings (citations both for induction and for maintenance treatments were retrieved using the same search string). All study designs were included (excluding narrative reviews, viewpoints, opinion or consensus papers), with a minimum of 10 patients/study (except in selected research questions with very limited data). The eligible studies were reviewed for snowball references, and for each eligible study, data extraction concerned parameters for all 15 research questions. A detailed description of the search terms and strategy is provided in online supplementary table 1, and the number of initial articles retrieved and final articles included per research question is shown in table 1.

Case

An African–American woman was diagnosed with paediatric-onset SLE (pSLE) at age 16. Due to class IV lupus nephritis, she was initially treated with the United States’ National Institutes of Health (NIH) protocol for cyclophosphamide, after wich she was transitioned to mycophenolate for maintenance therapy. She did well for 3years but lost Medicaid coverage at age 19 and subsequently stopped going to paediatric rheumatology clinic visits. Her primary care physician continued to refill mycophenolate, which she obtained via a patient assistance programme. At age 21, she developed a mild flare and was admitted to adult medicine, where adult rheumatology was consulted and arranged postdischarge follow-up in the adult rheumatology clinic. When she arrived late to her second appointment, she was advised to reschedule and was not seen. She resurfaced 24months later, having run out of medication and experiencing a severe flare with active lupus nephritis. She explained, “I kept waiting for the adult clinic to call me to reschedule, but they never did”.

### Transition and transfer of the patient with paediatric-onset lupus: a practical approach for paediatric and adult rheumatology practices [^1bc7881e]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The prevalence of paediatric-onset SLE (pSLE) is estimated at 1million people worldwide and accounts for a significant proportion of SLE morbidity, mortality and cost. Patients with pSLE are especially vulnerable during and immediately following transfer from paediatric to adult rheumatology care, when substantial delays in care and increased disease activity are common. Transition is the process through which adolescents and young adults (AYA) develop the skills needed to succeed in the adult healthcare environment, a process that typically takes several years and may span a patient's time in paediatric and adult clinics. Recommendations for improving transition and transfer for AYA with pSLE include setting expectations of the AYA patient and family concerning transition and transfer, developing AYA's self-management skills, preparing an individualised transition plan that identifies a date for transfer, transferring at a time of medical and social stability, coordinating communication between the paediatric and adult rheumatologists (inclusive of both a medical summary and key social factors), and identifying a transition coordinator as a point person for care transfer and to monitor the AYA's arrival and retention in adult rheumatology care. Of paramount importance is empowering the adult rheumatologist with skills that enhance rapport with AYA patients, engage AYA patients and families in adult care models, promote adherence and encourage ongoing development of self-management skills.

Lupus nephritis (LN) response definitions in clinical trials specify thresholds for proteinuria, kidney function, and timing. Complete response requires reduction in proteinuria <0.5 g/g (50 mg/mmol) measured as the protein–creatinine ratio (PCR) from a 24-h urine collection, stabilization or improvement in kidney function (±10%–15% of baseline), and achievement within 6–12 mo of starting therapy, though it could take more than 12 mo. Primary efficacy renal response is defined by PCR ≤0.7 g/g (70 mg/mmol) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) that was no worse than 20% below the pre-flare value or ≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, with no use of rescue therapy for treatment failure. Partial response requires a reduction in proteinuria by at least 50% and to <3 g/g (300 mg/mmol) measured as the PCR from a 24-h urine collection, stabilization or improvement in kidney function (±10%–15% of baseline), and achievement within 6–12 mo of starting therapy. No kidney response is failure to achieve a partial or complete response within 6–12 mo of starting therapy. For children <18 years old, complete response is defined as proteinuria <0.5 g/1.73 m2 per day or <300 mg/m2 per day based on a 24-hour urine specimen.

Determinants of recommendation strength and certainty—The strength of a recommendation was determined by “the balance of benefits and harms across all critical and important outcomes, the grading of the overall certainty of the evidence, patient values and preferences, resource use and costs, and considerations for implementation (Table 6).” The overall certainty of the evidence “was based on the certainty of the evidence of all critical and important outcomes, taking into account the relative importance of each outcome to the population of interest,” and “was graded as A, B, C, or D (Table 3).” Regarding values and preferences, “No patients or caregivers were involved in the Work Group,” and “Formal qualitative evidence synthesis on patient priorities and preferences was undertaken by the Cochrane ERT for the 2021 update, but there was limited evidence available to inform the formulation of guideline recommendations.” Resource considerations are explicit: “Healthcare and non-healthcare resources, including all inputs in the treatment management pathway, were considered in grading the strength of a recommendation,” including “direct healthcare costs; non-healthcare resources, such as transportation and social services; informal caregiver resources (e.g., time from the family and caregivers); and changes in productivity,” and “Economic evaluations, including cost-effectiveness analysis, were not conducted for any of the guideline topics.”

Transferring the patient: best practices for paediatric and adult rheumatologists

Preparing the patient for transfer

In addition to the transition work described above, the AYA and family should be oriented to what to expect in adult care. As outlined in table 1, in the typical adult practice, visits may be shorter, there may not be a social worker available onsite, screening procedures (eg, echocardiograms or pulmonary function tests) may not occur by routine and medication dosing may differ. Additionally, late and no-show policies are often more stringent and strictly enforced. Other known practice-specific differences can be shared as well, minimizing the likelihood that a family interprets deviations from the pediatric norm as a sign that the adult provider is incompetent. It is helpful for the pediatric provider to reassure the family ahead of time about the appropriateness of different approaches to care.

### Advances in the care of children with lupus nephritis [^3993f2c6]. Pediatric Research (2017). Low credibility.

The care of children with lupus nephritis (LN) has changed dramatically over the past 50 y. The majority of patients with childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) develop LN. In the 1960's, prognosis in children was worse than in adults; therapies were limited and toxic. Nearly half of cases resulted in death within 2 y. Since this time, several diagnostic recommendations and disease-specific indices have been developed to assist physicians caring for patients with LN. Pediatric researchers are validating and adapting these indices and guidelines for the treatment of LN in cSLE. Classification systems, activity, and chronicity indices for kidney biopsy have been validated in pediatric cohorts in several countries. Implementation of contemporary immunosuppressive agents has reduced treatment toxicity and improved outcomes. Biomarkers sensitive to LN in children have been identified in the kidney, urine, and blood. Multi-institutional collaborative networks have formed to address the challenges of pediatric LN research. Considerable variation in evaluation and treatment has been addressed for proliferative forms of LN by development of consensus treatment practices. Patient survival at 5 y is now 95-97% and renal survival exceeds 90%. Moreover, international consensus exists for quality indicators for cSLE that consider the unique aspects of chronic disease in childhood.
