## Question

What are the common symptoms of mold exposure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common symptoms of mold exposure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the established pathophysiologic mechanisms of mold-related illness. Then, I should verify which symptom clusters are consistently reported and which are controversial. Next, I will stratify symptoms by mechanism and highlight high-risk populations. After that, I need to check the strength of evidence for chronic toxic effects versus transient irritant or allergic effects. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically useful summary and note diagnostic cautions and management implications, ensuring I anchor claims to authoritative sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic framework so I don't jump to conclusions: mold-related health effects are generally categorized as allergic (IgE-mediated), irritant (mVOCs, spores, β-glucans), infectious (true fungal disease), and toxic (mycotoxin-mediated), with the first two being most common in indoor settings and the latter two being rare or context-dependent, so I need to keep that hierarchy in mind as I interpret symptoms [^111DvhoH] [^116mX6i8] [^113pQfgU].

> I will now examine respiratory symptoms, since these are the most consistently reported and mechanistically plausible. Wait, let me verify the specific frequencies from clinical series: in a cohort of 65 patients with mold-related complaints, rhinitis occurred in 62% and cough in 52%, with broader respiratory symptoms in 34%, which aligns with the expected predominance of upper and lower airway involvement in allergic and irritant responses to mold [^1129KMVr]. Hold on, I should also confirm population-level signals: CDC summaries consistently list nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, wheeze, and chest tightness as common effects of damp and moldy environments, reinforcing that respiratory symptoms are the primary clinical manifestation in exposed individuals [^113pQfgU] [^114BBHSW].

> Next, I should review ocular and mucous membrane irritation. Let me think about the dose and context for mVOCs: mold-derived volatile organic compounds can cause transient eye and nasal discomfort, headache, and dizziness, but indoor concentrations are typically orders of magnitude below irritation thresholds, so persistent symptoms weeks to months after exposure should not be attributed to mVOCs without corroborating evidence, which means I need to be cautious about attributing chronic complaints to mVOCs alone [^112JpjnZ] [^113V5hdB]. I should double-check that CDC also lists burning or red/itchy eyes and skin irritation among common effects, which supports the irritant mechanism in real-world damp indoor exposures [^113pQfgU].

> Let me consider systemic and neurocognitive symptoms. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought neurocognitive complaints might be common, but I should verify the evidence base: case series report high rates of headache, fatigue, and "CNS symptoms", yet these are largely unvalidated and often reflect selection bias or coexisting conditions. ACMT explicitly states there is no documented evidence that inhalation exposure to fungi or mycotoxins in indoor environments causes chronic toxic encephalopathy, so I should not over-attribute such symptoms to mold toxicity without alternative explanations [^1129KMVr] [^111LZWv2]. Hold on, I should verify the dose argument too: mycotoxins are large, nonvolatile molecules with exceedingly low airborne concentrations indoors, making inhalational toxic doses implausible in typical residential settings, which further weakens a toxic mechanism for chronic systemic or neurocognitive symptoms [^113fMDgh] [^111dTxxT].

> I need to check special populations and contexts where symptoms may be amplified. People with asthma or mold allergy have stronger, more consistent symptom responses, and dampness/mold remediation improves asthma outcomes, which supports a causal contribution in sensitized individuals. Infants and children exposed to dampness/mold have higher risks of wheeze and persistent asthma, and severe asthmatics demonstrate higher rates of mold sensitization, so age and atopy meaningfully modify risk and symptom expression [^113ZEvQw] [^1163HfrX] [^1132f7yx] [^1178SiNC]. But wait, what if exposure is occupational and massive? In agricultural or grain-handling settings, Organic Dust Toxic Syndrome presents with fever, malaise, myalgia, headache, dyspnea, chest tightness, cough, and nausea, typically resolving within hours to days; this is a high-dose, nonresidential context and should not be extrapolated to typical indoor exposures [^113P9nw7] [^1133b2LH].

> Let me synthesize the symptom profile by mechanism while keeping the strength of evidence in view: allergic symptoms include sneezing, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy/watery eyes, and wheeze, often with objective evidence of sensitization on skin or serum testing. Irritant symptoms include cough, throat irritation, eye irritation, and headache, generally transient and tied to exposure. Infectious disease is uncommon in immunocompetent hosts but can occur in the severely immunocompromised. Toxic mycotoxin effects from inhalation are not established in indoor environments, so chronic multisystem or neurocognitive complaints should prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses rather than defaulting to mold toxicity [^113pQfgU] [^111DvhoH] [^111LZWv2] [^113fMDgh].

> Hold on, I should verify diagnostic cautions so I don't over-interpret testing: identification of toxigenic fungi in an environment does not prove mycotoxin exposure or harm, and mycotoxin antibody testing is not validated for exposure assessment. IgE/IgG testing can support allergic or hypersensitivity diagnoses but do not quantify mycotoxin exposure, so they should not be used to infer toxic mold illness. Instead, clinicians should prioritize exposure assessment, moisture control, and targeted allergy evaluation when symptoms suggest mold-related disease [^111dTxxT] [^112LByS7] [^116GiZs8] [^112TfmdE].

> Finally, I should confirm management implications so recommendations are actionable: for patients with asthma or allergic symptoms in damp environments, evidence-based guidance supports mold remediation and moisture control to reduce symptoms and medication use, with individualized allergen mitigation strategies when sensitization is present. For nonspecific chronic symptoms without objective evidence of allergy or toxicity, clinicians should pursue standard diagnostic pathways and avoid attributing causality to mold without corroborating exposure and mechanistic plausibility [^113ZEvQw] [^115v8vcr] [^11494jhj].

Mold exposure commonly causes **respiratory symptoms** (cough, wheeze, nasal congestion, sore throat, shortness of breath) [^113pQfgU] and **allergic reactions** (sneezing, runny nose, itchy/watery eyes, skin rash) [^114BBHSW], especially in people with asthma or mold allergies [^113pQfgU]. It can also trigger **asthma exacerbations** [^1163HfrX] and, in sensitized individuals, hypersensitivity pneumonitis [^116ynWmH]. Less common effects include headache, fatigue, and irritant symptoms from microbial VOCs [^112JpjnZ]; severe infections are rare and mainly affect immunocompromised patients [^115FxCPi]. Symptoms vary with exposure level, duration, and individual susceptibility [^113sT9Ap].

---

## Respiratory symptoms

Respiratory symptoms are the **most common** [^notfound] and include:

- **Cough**: Persistent or intermittent, often accompanied by wheezing [^114BBHSW].

- **Wheezing**: Especially in individuals with asthma or other respiratory conditions [^114BBHSW].

- **Nasal congestion**: Stuffiness, runny nose, and sneezing [^111Eyw26].

- **Sore throat**: Irritation or scratchiness [^113pQfgU].

- **Shortness of breath**: Difficulty breathing, particularly during physical activity [^114BBHSW].

---

## Allergic reactions

Allergic reactions are common, particularly in individuals with mold allergies or asthma [^114BBHSW]. These include **sneezing and runny nose** — classic allergic rhinitis symptoms — and **itchy, watery eyes** from conjunctival irritation [^111Eyw26]. Some individuals develop **skin rash or hives** upon contact with mold [^113pQfgU].

---

## Asthma exacerbations

Mold exposure can significantly exacerbate asthma symptoms, leading to **increased frequency and severity** of attacks [^113ZEvQw]. Asthma symptoms may worsen in damp or moldy environments [^114BBHSW], and individuals with asthma may require **higher doses of medication** or additional treatments [^1163HfrX].

---

## Hypersensitivity pneumonitis

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an immune-mediated lung disease caused by repeated exposure to mold spores [^116ynWmH]. Symptoms include **shortness of breath, cough, fever, chills, and fatigue** [^114BBHSW]; with continued exposure, it can lead to permanent lung damage [^114BBHSW].

---

## Irritant symptoms from microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs)

Mold produces mVOCs that can cause irritant symptoms, particularly in individuals with heightened sensitivity [^112JpjnZ]. These include **headache, dizziness, and fatigue**, as well as **eye, nose, and throat irritation** [^112JpjnZ].

---

## Severe infections in immunocompromised individuals

Immunocompromised individuals are at increased risk of severe fungal infections from mold exposure [^112uJCkE]. These infections can cause **severe respiratory symptoms, fever, and systemic illness** [^notfound] and may require aggressive medical treatment [^113qUPTb].

---

## Factors influencing symptom severity

Several factors influence the **severity and type** of symptoms experienced:

- **Exposure level and duration**: Higher concentrations and longer exposure times increase symptom severity [^1133efQm].

- **Individual susceptibility**: Individuals with asthma, allergies, or compromised immune systems are more susceptible to mold-related symptoms [^113pQfgU].

- **Genetic predisposition**: Certain genetic factors may increase susceptibility to mold-related illnesses [^1139sWcq].

### Exposure and health effects of fungi on humans [^115wEX2U]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Fungi are ubiquitous microorganisms that are present in outdoor and indoor environments. Previous research has found relationships between environmental fungal exposures and human health effects. We reviewed recent articles focused on fungal exposure and dampness as risk factors for respiratory disease development, symptoms, and hypersensitivity. In particular, we reviewed the evidence suggesting that early exposure to dampness or fungi is associated with the development of asthma and increased asthma morbidity. Although outdoor exposure to high concentrations of spores can cause health effects such as asthma attacks in association with thunderstorms, most people appear to be relatively unaffected unless they are sensitized to specific genera. Indoor exposure and dampness, however, appears to be associated with an increased risk of developing asthma in young children and asthma morbidity in individuals who have asthma. These are important issues because they provide a rationale for interventions that might be considered for homes and buildings in which there is increased fungal exposure. In addition to rhinitis and asthma, fungus exposure is associated with a number of other illnesses including allergic bronchopulmonary mycoses, allergic fungal sinusitis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Additional research is necessary to establish causality and evaluate interventions for fungal- and dampness-related health effects.

### Multilevel risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing-related symptom burden in an urban pediatric community-based sample [^114LnHHZ]. CHEST Pulmonary (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate both the indoor and neighborhood environment in relation to SDB symptom burden in children. Our findings reveal that multilevel risk factors are associated with SDB-related symptom burden (ie, individual health conditions [asthma and allergic rhinitis], family/household SES [maternal education], neighborhood disadvantage [COI score]). Within households, exposures to irritants and allergens (eg, ETS, pests) were associated with an approximately 4-point to 12-point increase in total OSA-18 scores, and those with both exposures had an approximately 20-point increase in OSA-18 scores (approximately 1.3 SD increase) compared with children with no adverse indoor exposures.

These results are consistent with and extend those from prior studies that showed children living in low SES households have a high prevalence of SDB. In a Canadian cohort, children with mothers reporting less than high school education had nearly three times the odds of having OSA compared with university-educated participants. The underlying drivers of this association, however, are poorly understood. Poor indoor air quality because of tobacco smoke and allergen exposures from rodents, mold, and cockroaches have been shown to contribute to asthma symptoms.- Although the pathogenesis for OSA and asthma differ, our results suggest that these conditions have overlapping risk factors. Irritants and allergens may exacerbate SDB by stimulating immune responses manifested as adenotonsillar hypertrophy and by amplifying nasopharyngeal inflammation, adversely affecting upper airway patency. ETS, although not common in this sample, was strongly associated with SDB symptoms, a finding that is consistent with previous reports. - We additionally showed an association between pest exposure with SDB symptoms. Moreover, we studied the associations of bedroom dust allergen exposures in a large proportion of the cohort and demonstrated similar associations for mouse and cockroach bedroom dust levels with caregiver-report information, supporting the importance of household and bedroom environmental conditions and sleep health.

### Characterization of a population presenting with suspected mold-related health effects [^116ShERQ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Numerous epidemiologic studies have reported a relationship between dampness and increased respiratory symptoms in adults and children, which has led to increasing concerns among the general population about potential mold-related health effects.

Objective

To identify characteristics of patients with possible mold-related health effects that might help allergists better understand how to evaluate such patients in their practices.

Methods

The parameters that were evaluated for the total population included age, sex, upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms, systemic symptoms, atopic status, pet ownership, smoking history, mold sensitization, mold exposure, and exposure location. Subgroups stratified by atopic status, mold sensitization, and indoor mold exposure confirmed by an environmental mold report prepared by certified industrial hygienists were also analyzed. Significant associations were determined by correlation coefficients and logistic regression analysis.

Results

A total of 135 patients with possible mold-related health effects secondary to prolonged indoor mold exposure were evaluated. For the overall population, a strong correlation was found among atopy, mold sensitization, and sensitization to specific molds identified in the patient's environmental report. Mold intracutaneous testing was not useful for discriminating between atopic and nonatopic individuals. There were no associations among the patients' presenting symptoms, atopic status, and magnitude of mold exposure. Similar findings were identified when subgroup analysis was performed.

Conclusions

Patients who present with mold-related health effects manifest heterogeneous characteristics. Medical history, skin testing, and current indoor mold sampling practices have significant limitations in establishing a causal link among mold exposure health effects.

### Effects of mycotoxins on neuropsychiatric symptoms and immune processes [^112s6U8r]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The effects of air pollutants have been receiving increased attention both clinically and in the media. One such pollutant is mold, fungal growth in the form of multicellular filaments known as hyphae. The growth of molds is omnipresent not only in outdoor settings but also in indoor environments containing excessive amounts of moisture.

Methods

PubMed was searched for relevant articles using terms such as mold, mycotoxins, fungi, immunity, inflammation, neurodevelopment, cognition, Alzheimer's, and autism.

Findings

Exposure to molds is most commonly associated with allergies and asthma. However, it is now thought to be associated with many complex health problems, since some molds, especially Trichoderma, Fusarium and Stachybotrys spp, produce mycotoxins that are absorbed from the skin, airways, and intestinal lining. People exposed to molds and mycotoxins present with symptoms affecting multiple organs, including the lungs, musculoskeletal system, as well as the central and peripheral nervous systems. Furthermore, evidence has recently implicated exposure to mycotoxins in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder. The effects of mycotoxins can be mediated via different pathways that include the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially from mast cells.

Implications

The information reviewed indicates that exposure to mold and mycotoxins can affect the nervous system, directly or through immune cell activation, thus contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder.

### The medical effects of mold exposure [^111DvhoH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Exposure to molds can cause human disease through several well-defined mechanisms. In addition, many new mold-related illnesses have been hypothesized in recent years that remain largely or completely unproved. Concerns about mold exposure and its effects are so common that all health care providers, particularly allergists and immunologists, are frequently faced with issues regarding these real and asserted mold-related illnesses. The purpose of this position paper is to provide a state-of-the-art review of the role that molds are known to play in human disease, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, sinusitis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In addition, other purported mold-related illnesses and the data that currently exist to support them are carefully reviewed, as are the currently available approaches for the evaluation of both patients and the environment.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^11591tqy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Some but not all study findings suggested that multicomponent interventions that included mold mitigation reduce symptoms to an extent. The results of studies of multicomponent interventions that included pet removal were inconclusive.

Most studies did not examine harms, and none reported any important harms from the various allergen mitigation strategies studied. Because of the lack of benefits identified and the potential harms from applications of chemicals, the Expert Panel does not recommend the use of acaricides.

Rationale and discussion

Overall approach for developing allergen mitigation recommendations.

When developing each of the four recommendations in this section, the Expert Panel considered the benefits and harms of each of the allergen mitigation interventions and the level of evidence available for assessing the interventions. In addition, the Expert Panel considered the acceptability of the interventions to individuals with asthma and their providers as well as the ease of use, costs, and impact on health equity of each intervention.

Potential harms.

Although the identified harms from most of the interventions were minimal, studies rarely examined harms. Therefore, the Expert Panel considered theoretical harms, patient burden, and initial and ongoing costs in its recommendations. For example, the Expert Panel's judgment was that interventions for mold mitigation and carpet removal could be associated with risks or be costly or difficult to complete. Another Expert Panel determination was that impermeable pillow and mattress covers are low-risk interventions with limited costs but are likely to require frequent cleaning of the bedding above the covers to be effective.

Prioritization of outcomes.

Furthermore, the Expert Panel considered the impact of the interventions on asthma symptoms as a critical outcome. The Expert Panel recognized that none of the studies used a validated outcome measure of asthma symptoms, and the definition of asthma symptoms was not standardized across studies. However, asthma symptoms are a relevant patient-centered outcome that was important to individuals with asthma in focus groups and that could be particularly relevant to assess for low-risk interventions.

### Environmental justice and allergic disease: a Work group report of the AAAAI environmental exposure and respiratory health committee and the diversity, equity and inclusion committee [^1138DoLx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Housing and indoor environment — poor-quality housing characteristics are described and linked to asthma outcomes and allergen exposures: characteristics include cracks allowing pests, leaky pipes with mold/mildew, inadequate ventilation, lack of air conditioning and/or heating, and exposure to volatile organic compounds from building materials, and poor-quality housing was independently associated with diagnosis of asthma and asthma-related emergency department visits. Remediation of housing conditions to limit indoor asthma triggers resulted in significant improvements in asthma-related health care utilization. Mouse and cockroach allergen sensitization and exposure are clearly linked with pediatric asthma morbidity, and exposure to cockroach allergen in sensitized individuals was associated with asthma prevalence in a dose-dependent manner. Indoor damp housing and moisture damage in school buildings were associated with increased respiratory symptoms including cough and wheeze and with increased odds of nocturnal cough, wheeze, nasal symptoms, and school absence in children; Alternaria alternata was associated with increased prevalence of asthma and increased asthma symptoms in sensitized children.

### Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: current concepts and future questions [^116ynWmH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis) caused by inhaled allergens can progress to disabling or even fatal end-stage lung disease. The only truly effective treatment is early recognition and control of exposure. Although patients produce antibody exuberantly, the immunopathogenesis involves cellular immunity — notably, CD8(+) cytotoxic lymphocytes, multinucleate giant cell granulomas, and ultimately interstitial fibrosis. Many causative agents have been recognized in occupational dusts or mists, but most current new cases arise from residential exposure to pet birds (pigeons and parakeets), contaminated humidifiers, and indoor molds. The symptoms and physical findings are nonspecific. Serum IgG containing high titers of specific antibody to the offending antigen is elevated. Pulmonary function tests show restrictive and diffusion defects with hypoxemia, especially after exercise. Occasionally, small airways disease causes obstruction. Radio-graphic changes vary according to the stage of the disease and are best evaluated by means of high-resolution computed tomography. In typical cases, the history of a known exposure and the presence of a characteristic interstitial lung disease with serologic confirmation of IgG antibody to the offending antigen suffice for diagnosis. In more obscure cases, observation of changes after a natural environmental exposure, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung biopsy might be indicated. Among the many questions that remain are the following: What is the prevalence of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and how often is it the cause of chronic interstitial fibrosis? What is the long-term prognosis? Why do most individuals exposed to these antigens develop a vigorous antibody response whereas only a few develop the disease? How does exposure to endotoxin and cigarette smoking affect the disease? To answer these questions, standardized and validated clinical laboratory immunochemical tests are needed, in addition to a systematic approach to diagnosis, classification of disease severity, risk assessment, and management. This review is limited to the disease caused by airborne allergens and focuses on its immunopathogenesis, eliciting agents, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, and prognosis.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115Hbi4R]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America 2016 aspergillosis guidelines — surveillance and nosocomial detection — state that leukemia and transplant centers should perform regular surveillance of cases of invasive mold infection, and an increase in incidence over baseline or the occurrence of invasive mold infections in patients who are not at high risk for such infections should prompt evaluation for a hospital source (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). As a quality control measure, leukemia and transplant centers should perform regular surveillance (eg, every 3 months) documenting the number of invasive mold infections within their institution. In the absence of an outbreak with an identified environmental source or molecular analysis that demonstrates clustering of fungal isolates, it is not possible to reliably distinguish community-acquired from nosocomial aspergillosis, and cases of invasive mold disease with onset of symptoms ≥ 7 days after hospital admission are more likely to be nosocomial. Environmental surveillance can provide important insight about sources of aspergillosis, including the spread of azole-resistant strains, but in the absence of an outbreak, there is insufficient evidence that environmental sampling of fungal spores is of value.

### ACMT position statement: institute of medicine report on damp indoor spaces and health [^1133b2LH]. ACMT (2022). High credibility.

Organic Dust Toxic Syndrome (ODTS) — ODTS is described with microbial exposures in agricultural environments and includes fever, malaise, myalgia, headache, dyspnea, chest tightness, dry cough, and nausea; symptoms are transient and generally resolve within hours to days from acute exposure, and there is no documented evidence that inhalation exposure to fungi or mycotoxins in indoor environments causes a chronic toxic encephalopathy.

### Fungal exposome, human health, and unmet needs: a 2022 update with special focus on allergy [^116viXVM]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Humans inhale, ingest, and touch thousands of fungi each day. The ubiquity and diversity of the fungal kingdom, reflected by its complex taxonomy, are in sharp contrast with our scarce knowledge about its distribution, pathogenic effects, and effective interventions at the environmental and individual levels. Here, we present an overview of salient features of fungi as permanent players of the human exposome and key determinants of human health, through the lens of fungal allergy and other fungal hypersensitivity reactions. Improved understanding of the fungal exposome sheds new light on the epidemiology of fungal-related hypersensitivity diseases, their immunological substratum, the currently available methods, and biomarkers for environmental and medical fungi. Unmet needs are described and potential approaches are highlighted as perspectives.

### Occupational and environmental contributions to chronic cough in adults: chest expert panel report [^117WA7aX]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Environmental exposures in the home and workplace can contribute to chronic cough, with irritants and antigens from hobbies, renovations, and animals implicated; diagnosis relies on documenting underlying disease with pulmonary function tests/chest/sinus imaging/induced sputum/ears, nose, and throat assessment and relating exposure history to cough timing, reviewing health records after accidental exposures, noting similar symptoms in co-exposed individuals, and considering a home or formal environmental assessment to document fungal contamination; if hypersensitivity pneumonitis is suspected, accepted diagnostic pathways should be followed; management includes pharmacologic therapy as for other causes and avoidance of further exposure to relevant agents as reasonable.

### The continuum of severity of functional impairment due to indoor air symptoms: prevalence and determinants [^113sT9Ap]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Indoor air or building-related symptoms are common in nonindustrial environments. – Symptoms range from organ specific, such as mucous-membrane irritation and dry skin to general, nonspecific symptoms of fatigue and headaches. Risk factors for indoor air–related symptoms include not only indoor air pollution, such as molds, chemicals, and poor ventilation, but also individual factors, such as sex, concurrent diseases, personality traits, and psychosocial factors at work.– In addition to increasing symptoms, mold and dampness exposure has been shown to be associated with onset of new asthma also in adults.

A few clinical studies have shown that some of the patients have difficult functional impairment due to persistent symptoms, meaning severe restrictions to personal, occupational, and social life. These persistent symptoms have been shown to be associated with limitations of daily activities due to, for example, avoidance of buildings that the individual perceives to trigger symptoms. In addition, adverse effects on work ability seem to be common among these individuals. In the most severe cases, disability to work persists despite environmental repairs, improvements in indoor air quality, or avoidance of the building in question. – These persistent indoor air–related symptoms have been shown to affect quality of life even more than common diseases such as asthma or depression. However, the great majority of studies on indoor air–related symptoms do not consider the severity of symptoms or associated levels of functional impairment, but typically only symptom frequency.–

### Increased prevalence of atopy among children exposed to mold in a school building [^116D64aU]. Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to assess the occurrence of immunoglobulin E sensitization to common environmental allergens (atopy) and new allergic diseases among schoolchildren after starting school in a water-damaged school building. The staff and pupils of a Finnish elementary school with visible water damage and mold complained of respiratory and skin symptoms. The school building was examined and widespread moisture damage was found. A control school with no visible water damage was also examined. No indication of exceptional microbial growth was found in the samples taken from this school.

Methods

History of allergic diseases and the year of diagnosis were established by a questionnaire. IgE antibodies to the common environmental allergens were determined from randomly selcted groups from both schools.

Results

Elevated IgE values were significantly more common among the exposed children, as was the occurrence of new allergic diseases after the children started at the school.

Conclusions

The odds ratios for the IgE values of the study groups indicated a possible relationship between exposure to microorganisms and IgE sensitization. Exposure to spores, toxins, and other metabolites of molds may have complex results with unknown immunogenic effects that may act as a nonspecific trigger for allergic sensitization leading to the development of atopy.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^115v8vcr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

For individuals with asthma who have allergy symptoms or a test result suggesting that they are allergic to dust mites, the Expert Panel recommends using multicomponent interventions to reduce dust mite levels in the home and improve asthma outcomes. Use of pillow and mattress covers alone does not improve asthma outcomes.

Overall, the studies of allergen mitigation strategies provide low certainty of evidence that these strategies are beneficial for key asthma outcomes. Therefore, the Expert Panel recommends tailored allergen intervention strategies only for individuals with asthma who are exposed to these specific allergens and have either symptoms based on clinical history or an allergy to these substances based on allergy testing.

Based on current data on the use of a variety of single-component and multicomponent strategies to reduce exposure to allergens, the Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementing allergen exposure reduction strategies:
Allergen mitigation strategies can be used in individuals of all ages with asthma of all levels of severity.
Clinicians need to tailor mitigation strategies to the individual based on their allergy symptoms, sensitization, and exposures. Clinicians should consider allergen testing when appropriate, before committing individuals to specific allergen mitigation strategies that may be burdensome. See Table IIIA for allergen-specific mitigation interventions addressed in the systematic review report. Table IIIB summarizes the certainty of evidence on various allergen mitigation interventions.
The Expert Panel recognizes the existing inequities in access to specialists and allergen testing. The panel therefore advises clinicians to, at a minimum, take a clinical history of symptoms and exposures for all individuals with asthma to help determine the need for allergen mitigation.
Allergy testing (with a skin prick or allergen-specific IgE test) may have false-positive and false-negative results, and certain allergens (eg, dust) may also act as irritants. For an individual whose symptoms worsen on exposure to specific aeroallergens, the Expert Panel recommends that the clinician consider mitigating that aeroallergen even if the individual's test result is negative.
Some of the interventions examined provide no or low certainty of evidence about their efficacy in improving asthma outcomes (including exacerbations, quality of life, asthma control, and symptoms). The Expert Panel recognizes that some of the interventions, especially integrated pest management and mold mitigation, may have broader public health benefits. However, these interventions do not replace routine good practices, including regular and frequent house cleaning and laundering of bedding materials.
Some people are allergic to dander (flakes of skin) or saliva from pets. The few studies on pet removal have had inconclusive results. However, if an individual with asthma experiences symptoms around a pet, the individual should consider removing the pet from the home, keeping the pet outdoors, or, if neither of these options is feasible, keeping the pet out of commonly used rooms. Testing for sensitization to pets may be particularly worthwhile for those with chronic or uncontrolled symptoms and might help support what can be a difficult decision to remove a pet from the home.
Some cleaning and integrated pest management interventions may trigger asthma and/or be hazardous. Individuals with asthma need to balance the potential benefits and harms of interventions before implementing them.
If an individual with asthma has sensitization to an allergen on skin prick testing and is exposed to that allergen but has no objective evidence of worsened disease control and denies having symptoms, chronic exposure could have led to the development of clinical tolerance to that allergen in that environment. Allergen-specific mitigation strategies could adversely modify this established balanced relationship between the individual and the environment.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: Clinicians need to consider the complexity of the patient population and the limitations of the evidence identified. Clinicians may also find it helpful to consider the severity of a patient's asthma, the small benefit, and the extent of previous symptoms and exacerbations when recommending allergen mitigation interventions. Allergen mitigation interventions may be expensive or difficult for patients to use or maintain. Clinicians should consider the cost implications of certain interventions, especially among those with limited financial resources, and assess the magnitude of the potential value of an intervention in improving an individual's asthma outcomes.

Background

Infancy is a developmental stage with heightened susceptibility to environmental influences on the risk of chronic childhood disease. Few birth cohort studies have detailed measures of fungal diversity data in infants' bedrooms, limiting the potential to measure long-term associations of these complex exposures with development of asthma or allergy.

Objective

We evaluated the relation of home fungal levels in infancy to repeated measures of wheeze and development of asthma and rhinitis by age 13, and sensitization by age 12 years.

Methods

In the Epidemiology of Home Allergens and Asthma prospective birth cohort study, we recruited 408 children with family history of allergic disease or asthma. When children were aged 2–3 months, we measured culturable fungi in bedroom air and dust, and in outdoor air. Main outcomes included ascertainment of symptoms/disease onset by questionnaire from birth through age 13. We estimated hazard ratios and, for wheeze and sensitization, odds ratios for an interquartile increase in log-transformed fungal concentrations, adjusting for other outcome predictors and potential confounders.

Results

Elevated levels of yeasts in bedroom floor dust were associated with reduced: i) wheeze at any age; ii) fungal sensitization; and iii) asthma development by age 13 (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), [0.75 to 0.98]). Outdoor airborne Cladosporium and dustborne Aspergillus predicted increased rhinitis. Risk of fungal sensitization by age 12, in response to environmental Alternaria and Aspergillus, was elevated in children with a maternal history of fungal sensitization.

Conclusions and Clinical Relevance

Despite the irritant and allergenic properties of fungi, early-life elevated dust yeast exposures or their components may be protective against allergy and asthma in children at risk for these outcomes. Ascertainment of fungal components associated with immunoprotective effects may have therapeutic relevance for asthma.

### Invasive fungal infections after natural disasters [^112uJCkE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Indoor Mold Exposures after Disasters

Disaster-induced water damage to structures can create moist environments that can promote indoor fungal growth, but the extent to which damp indoor spaces and mold growth affect human health remains somewhat ambiguous. A 2004 report by the Institute of Medicine found sufficient evidence of association between indoor mold exposure and upper respiratory tract symptoms, cough, and wheezing, and evidence of an association between indoor mold exposure and some noninfectious health conditions that included asthma symptoms in persons with asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis in some groups of people. Although the report found no association between indoor mold exposure and invasive infection in healthy persons, there was evidence to support a link between exposure to Aspergillus and aspergillosis in severely immunocompromised persons.

Few data clearly demonstrate that indoor mold exposures increase the risk for invasive infection in post-disaster settings. Flooding lasted for weeks after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita made landfall on the US Gulf Coast in August and September 2005, respectively, leading to visible mold growth in 46% of 112 inspected homes. Despite these high levels of indoor mold growth documented in some areas, 1 study showed no elevated risk for fungal infections among immunocompromised patients exposed to water-damaged buildings after Hurricane Katrina; 1 patient, 1.2% of the profoundly immunocompromised study population, had a mold infection (caused by a Cladosporium sp.), which resolved without antifungal treatment. Colonization in the absence of related clinical symptoms was observed in persons who returned to their water-damaged homes after Hurricanes Rita and Katrina: the mucormycete Syncephalastrum was detected in various clinical specimens from 8 persons whose self-reported exposures to mold ranged from none to heavy, but none had evidence of invasive infection.

After the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent tsunami, a medical relief team observed unexplained chronic cough among a group of previously healthy persons living in a temporary refuge. Fungal cultures of sputum samples from 6 persons yielded Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, and basidiomycetous fungi; culture plates exposed inside the refuge showed a similar fungal profile, suggesting that the indoor environment may have played a role in the patients' infections. Although the authors of that report state that the patients' coughs resolved after treatment with the antifungal itraconazole, the extent to which an infectious process was responsible for the illnesses is unclear.

### Infant origins of childhood asthma associated with specific molds [^114kwUxW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The specific cause or causes of asthma development must be identified to prevent this disease.

Objective

Our hypothesis was that specific mold exposures are associated with childhood asthma development.

Methods

Infants were identified from birth certificates. Dust samples were collected from 289 homes when the infants were 8 months of age. Samples were analyzed for concentrations of 36 molds that comprise the Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) and endotoxin, house dust mite, cat, dog, and cockroach allergens. Children were evaluated at age 7 years for asthma based on reported symptoms and objective measures of lung function. Host, environmental exposure, and home characteristics evaluated included a history of parental asthma, race, sex, upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms, season of birth, family income, cigarette smoke exposure, air conditioning, use of a dehumidifier, presence of carpeting, age of home, and visible mold at age 1 year and child's positive skin prick test response to aeroallergens and molds at age 7 years.

Results

Asthma was diagnosed in 24% of the children at age 7 years. A statistically significant increase in asthma risk at age 7 years was associated with high ERMI values in the child's home in infancy (adjusted relative risk for a 10-unit increase in ERMI value, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5–2.2). The summation of levels of 3 mold species, Aspergillus ochraceus, Aspergillus unguis, and Penicillium variabile, was significantly associated with asthma (adjusted relative risk, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.8–2.7).

Conclusion

In this birth cohort study exposure during infancy to 3 mold species common to water-damaged buildings was associated with childhood asthma at age 7 years.

### The role of allergens in asthma [^1178PvtT]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel guidelines for the management of asthma recommend that patients who require daily asthma medications have allergy testing for perennial indoor allergens and that, when triggers are found, exposure to allergens and pollutants be controlled through avoidance and abatement. For patients whose symptoms are not controlled adequately with these interventions and who are candidates for immunotherapy, the guidelines recommend referral to an allergist. However, the data supporting these recommendations are not consistent. Although there is evidence that simple allergen avoidance measures are ineffective, there is good evidence for the effectiveness of a comprehensive approach based on known sensitization. Thus, allergen avoidance may include removal of pets, use of high-efficiency particulate air filtration and vacuum cleaners, use of allergen-impermeable mattress and pillow covers, cockroach extermination, smoking cessation, and measures to control mold growth in the home. All allergen-specific treatment is dependent on defining sensitization. This can be achieved through serum assays of immunoglobulin E antibodies or skin tests with aeroallergens. Information on sensitization can be used to educate patients about the role of allergens in their symptoms, to provide avoidance advice, or to design immunotherapy.

### Recommendations for clinicians to combat environmental disparities in pediatric asthma: a review [^111RaBLC]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Topic Importance

Asthma is a common and complex lung disease in children, with disproportionally higher prevalence and related adverse outcomes among children in racial and ethnic minority groups and of lower socioeconomic position. Environmental factors, including unhealthy housing and school-based exposures, can contribute to increased asthma morbidity and widening disparities. This underscores a significant environmental justice issue and suggests the need for clinical interventions to reduce sources of environmental exposures and ultimately diminish the observed disparities in childhood asthma.

Review Findings

Unhealthy housing conditions, including secondhand tobacco smoke, allergen exposure, and indoor air pollution, can exacerbate asthma symptoms in children. Although unhealthy housing can occur anywhere, such situations most frequently occur in urban, low-income environments where renting is common. To reduce environmental triggers, clinicians can recommend smoking cessation, cleaning techniques to mitigate exposure, and even directly contacting landlords to address poor housing conditions. Children spend much of their time in schools, where this built environment is also a source of asthma triggers (eg, poor ventilation) and allergens (eg, mold and pests, chemicals). As such, a multidisciplinary approach is needed to adequately address the burden of childhood asthma to equitably reduce disparities to both harmful exposures and negative health outcomes.

Summary

Racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities exist in asthma morbidity in children, and such disparities are driven in part by environmental factors at the housing and school level. Clinicians can make evidence-based recommendations to drive effective exposure reduction strategies to mitigate asthma morbidity and reduce observed disparities.

### Housing characteristics, reported mold exposure, and asthma in the European community respiratory health survey [^114CQ8cP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The effects of home dampness and mold exposure on adult asthma are not clear.

Objective

We aimed to investigate the associations between housing characteristics related to dampness, mold exposure, and house dust mite levels and adult asthma in 38 study centers from the European Community Respiratory Health Survey.

Methods

Data about the present home, heating and ventilation systems, double glazing, floor covers, recent water damage, and mold exposure were obtained by means of an interviewer-led questionnaire. The associations between these factors and asthma, as defined on the basis of symptoms in the last year, and of bronchial responsiveness, as determined with methacholine challenge, were evaluated. Odds ratios (ORs) were obtained by using random-effects meta-analyses adjusted within study centers for sex, age group, and smoking status.

Results

Fitted carpets and rugs in the bedroom were related to fewer asthma symptoms and bronchial responsiveness (OR range, 0.69–0.91). This effect was consistent across centers and more pronounced among house dust mite-sensitized individuals. Reported mold exposure in the last year was associated with asthma symptoms and bronchial responsiveness (OR range, 1.14–1.44). This effect was homogeneous among centers and stronger in subjects sensitized to Cladosporium species. In centers with a higher prevalence of asthma, the prevalence of reported indoor mold exposure was also high. This association was observed for reported mold exposure by asthmatic subjects (Spearman r (s) = 0.46), as well as reported mold exposure by nonasthmatic subjects (r (s) = 0.54). Reported mold exposure was highest in older houses with recent water damage.

Conclusion

We conclude that indoor mold growth has an adverse effect on adult asthma.

### Home exposure to moisture and mold is associated with poorer asthma control in children: CHAMPIASTHMA study [^114AVCck]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Numerous studies have established the link between asthma and the environment. According to the World Health Organization, dampness affects between 10% and 50% of homes in Europe, North America, Australia, India, and Japan. In Europe, a 2012 study estimated the prevalence of dampness and mold at 10% to 15% of the housing stock.

Dampness promotes the proliferation of mold, among other microbial agents. Many studies have shown an association between this exposure and various diseases, such as rhinitis, allergic rhinitis, respiratory infections, and bronchitis, in both adults and children. Studies have also shown that exposure to dampness and mold at home increases the risk of developing asthma, especially early-onset asthma, and can be associated with asthma symptoms, such as coughing and wheezing. Nevertheless, data on the impact of this indoor exposure on asthma control in children are lacking.

Because asthmatic children may be particularly vulnerable to their home environment, the CHAMPIASTHMA study aimed to report asthma outcomes in a large multicenter population of well-characterized children aged 1 to 17 years, stratified by their exposure to moisture and/or mold (EMM), as assessed by a parental questionnaire. Our primary objective was to assess the association of EMM with asthma control in children. We hypothesized that children with EMM would be less likely to have controlled asthma. Exacerbations, asthma treatment step, and mold sensitization were also assessed.

### Health problems | Mold… [^114BBHSW]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance Research has found that people who spend time in damp buildings report health problems including respiratory symptoms and infections, developing or worsening asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis or hay fever, and eczema. Allergies Allergies or allergic responses to mold are common. In mold-allergic individuals, inhaling or touching mold may cause an allergic response, such as the following:

- Sneezing
- Nasal stuffiness or runny nose
- Red, itchy, or watery eyes
- Skin rash Mold can also cause irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, skin, or lungs even in people who are not allergic to mold. Asthma Asthma is a lung disease that affects the airways in the lungs. Airways can become inflamed and narrowed at times. This makes it harder for air to flow out of the lungs when breathing out. People with asthma may have one or more of the following symptoms:

- Coughing
- Wheezing
- Chest tightness
- Shortness of breath.

Symptoms of work-related asthma tend to get better when away from work. However, in some cases, symptoms do not improve until an extended time away from the exposure or trigger. Workers who are already sensitized to mold may even respond to a trace amount of mold. Diagnosing asthma is based on a combination of medical and exposure history, physician examination, and medical tests such as pulmonary function tests. Workers may be able to use peak flow meters to link changes in lung function with environmental settings. Symptoms of this illness can vary. Some persons experience:

- Shortness of breath
- Cough
- Muscle aches
- Chills
- Fever
- Night sweats
- Extreme fatigue
- Weight loss Symptoms may improve after a few hours or days when away from the substance or allergen causing illness. Likewise, hypersensitivity pneumonitis may be work-related if a worker's symptoms and medical tests improve when away from work and worsen when returning to work. With continued exposure, persistent lung inflammation over time could lead to permanent lung damage.

### Fungi and atopy [^1116Tu9R]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Atopy and fungi have a long associative history. Fungal spores were among the first substances to which humans were noted to be sensitized. Humans contact fungal spores in the outdoor, indoor, and occupational environments. As organisms, fungi have their own kingdom and are found in all environmental niches on earth. Currently, fungal exposure in the indoor environment especially related to wet housing conditions is of particular concern. Sensitization rates to fungi typically exceed 5% of the general public with higher rates among the atopic population. Alternaria is the best studied of the allergic fungi; however, cross sensitization to multiple fungi is well documented. Recent advances in understanding mechanisms of the innate immune system are beginning to explain why the fungal atopy relationship is unique and why fungal sensitivity seems to extend to many non-atopic individuals. Evidence has been accumulated that indicates fungal allergen exposure can be via intact spores as well as spore and mycelial fragments. Germinating spores produce a different and often increased allergen picture. Much evidence has been developed through animal studies that extends the mechanisms surrounding long-term low-level fungal exposure. However, it should be emphasized that the presence of fungi in the air does not necessarily equate with illness. Indeed, in the absence of an atopic individual and/or a significant immune response against fungi, there is little evidence suggesting pathology. Allergists frequently deal with patients who have concerns about indoor fungal exposure and respiratory disease in those patients with an allergic response.

### Mold and dampness exposure and allergic outcomes from birth to adolescence: data from the BAMSE cohort [^1132f7yx]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Table 3
Exposure to any mold or dampness indicator in relation to allergic phenotypes of asthma and rhinitis up to 16 years of age among children in the BAMSE cohort (n = 3798)

In analyses of clinical phenotypes of asthma, children exposed to any mold or dampness indicator during infancy had an increased odds of persistent asthma (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.20–2.50), but not early‐transient or late‐onset asthma (Fig. 2). The association between asthma clinical phenotypes with mold odor, visible mold, and dampness damage provided a similar picture for persistent asthma. Exposure to dampness damage was associated with late‐onset asthma (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.02–1.95).

### ACMT position statement: institute of medicine report on damp indoor spaces and health [^11494jhj]. ACMT (2022). High credibility.

ACMT recommendations on damp indoor spaces — The ACMT generally concurs with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) assessment of the relationship between damp indoor spaces and human health effects and recommends that public health responses be based upon what is known and generally accepted regarding association with allergic disease; public health responses should not be solely based upon the presence of fungi or mycotoxins because the available scientific evidence does not provide any compelling data to conclude that they pose significant health risks via inhalation in these settings, risks from inhalation are minimal compared with other sources and pathways including the diet, and the use of unapproved diagnostic studies and therapeutic modalities based on unproven infection or mold-related toxicity are medically inappropriate and costly.

### Health effects of indoor fungi [^113dQcYu]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the nontoxic harmful effects that poor indoor air quality caused by fungi can have on health.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed for publications related to the various topics discussed in this review, and we relied on our knowledge of the field.

Study Selection

Where more than one publication was relevant, we attempted to identify a consensus of the reports and cited the most relevant articles. Priority was given to randomized controlled trials and expert reports when available, although much of the information herein relates to laboratory research.

Results

Actively growing fungal colonies can release volatile substances that have an unpleasant smell, leading to psychological responses in the occupants such as fatigue and nausea. Symptoms that are likely caused by indoor fungi include respiratory complaints that involve the nose and lungs, eye symptoms, and mucous membrane irritation. These adverse effects can occur by a variety of mechanisms, including IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, fungal infection, irritant reaction to spores or fungal metabolites, and possibly toxic reaction to mycotoxins.

Conclusions

Reduced fungal exposure can reasonably be expected to improve health. Removal of moisture from the indoors and proper maintenance of air filters can aid in prevention and elimination of fungi from the home environment. Small areas of present contamination can be cleaned with a dilute bleach solution, which kills viable colonies and removes their mycelia. If fungal contamination is not addressed early, substantial damage can occur, requiring professional remediation. Above all, the individual should not panic at the first sight of fungi growing in the home. Regular inspection and cleaning can prevent many fungus-related problems.

### Mold damage in homes and wheezing in infants [^112C1VhP]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In most studies that investigate the association of mold or water damage and respiratory disorders in infants, the analysis is not adjusted for exposure to house dust mite (HDM), which is also a known cause of respiratory illnesses.

Objective

To investigate the relationship between visually observable mold or water damage and HDM (Der f 1) levels and the prevalence of lower respiratory tract symptoms and allergen sensitization in infants of atopic parents as part of a prospective birth cohort study.

Methods

On-site home visits (at the infants' age of 8 months) were performed to evaluate observable mold or water damage and HDM exposure. At a clinic visit near the infant's first birthday, medical histories, including parent-reported wheezing episodes, and a skin prick test to food and 15 common aeroallergens were conducted in 640 infants.

Results

More than half of the homes were found to have mold or water damage, and 5% had major mold or water damage with visible mold at 0.2 m2 or more. Only 16% of homes had a HDM allergen (Der f 1) concentration of more than 2 microg/g. Major mold or water damage increased the risk of recurrent wheezing nearly 2 times in infants, 5 times in food or aeroallergen-sensitized infants, and 6 times in aeroallergen-sensitized infants. Neither visible mold or water damage nor HDM exposure was associated with sensitization to either mold or aeroallergens.

Conclusions

Visible mold was shown to be a significant risk factor for recurrent wheezing in infants at high risk of developing atopic disorders, whereas HDM exposure did not significantly increase the risk.

### Health effects of mold in children [^116mX6i8]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Mold is ubiquitous, and exposure to mold and its products of metabolism is unavoidable, whether indoors or outdoors. Mold can produce a variety of adverse health outcomes by four scientifically validated pathophysiologic mechanisms: hypersensitivity, toxicity, infection, and irritation. Some adverse health outcomes have been attributed to mold for which mechanisms of injury are not well defined or are implausible. This article discusses these adverse health outcomes, focusing predominantly on those for which valid associations have been established.

### Wheeze in infancy: protection associated with yeasts in house dust contrasts with increased risk associated with yeasts in indoor air and other fungal taxa [^111XRp2b]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

While fungal exposures are assumed to provoke wheeze through irritant or allergenic mechanisms, little is known about the differential effects of indoor and outdoor fungi on early-life wheeze.

Methods

In a Boston prospective birth cohort of 499 at-risk infants, culturable fungi in bedroom air and dust and outdoor air were measured at the age of 2–3 months. Wheeze was determined using bimonthly telephone questionnaires. Odds ratios were estimated for an interquartile increase in fungal natural log-transformed concentrations, adjusting for predictors of wheeze and potential confounders.

Results

Increased odds of 'any wheeze' (≥ 1 vs 0 episodes) by age one were positively associated with indoor dust Alternaria [odds ratio (OR) = 1.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07–3.14], Penicillium [OR = 1.18; (0.98–1.43)], and Cladosporium [OR = 1.47; (1.16–1.85)]; indoor air Penicillium [OR = 1.26; (0.92–1.74)]; and outdoor air Cladosporium [OR = 1.68; (1.04–2.72)]. In contrast, indoor dust yeasts were protective [OR = 0.78; (0.66–0.93)]. 'Frequent wheeze' (≥ 2 vs < 2 episodes) by age one was borderline associated with dust yeasts [OR = 0.86; (0.70–1.04)] and indoor air yeasts [OR = 1.53; (0.93–2.53)]. Alternaria concentration was associated with any wheeze for children with maternal mold sensitization [OR = 9.16; (1.37–61.22)], but not for those without maternal mold sensitization [OR = 1.32; (0.79–2.20)].

Conclusions

While wheeze rates were higher with exposures to fungal taxa considered to be irritant or allergenic in sensitive subjects, yeasts in the home had a strong protective association with wheeze in infancy. Molecular microbiologic studies may elucidate specific components of innate microbiologic stimulants that lead to contrasting effects on wheeze development.

### Indoor environmental exposures among children with asthma seen in an urban emergency department [^111nRwdh]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for asthma management emphasize the control of environmental irritants and allergens within the home. Understanding the prevalence of indoor home exposures within such a population may be important for any emergency department (ED) program that seeks to improve the quality of its asthma care and patient education.

Objective

We sought to determine the prevalence of indoor home exposures in a cohort of children with moderate to severe asthma who were treated in an urban pediatric ED and to correlate these exposures with household income, prior asthma morbidity, health care utilization, and quality of life (QoL).

Methods

We enrolled a cohort of children with chronic asthma who were 12 months through 17 years of age and who had at least one other unscheduled visit for asthma within the previous 6 months. Trained research assistants interviewed the children's parent or guardian regarding the prevalence of home exposures to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and common allergens. In addition, data were collected on each patient's prior asthma history, morbidity, health care utilization, medication use, and QoL.

Results

Of the 488 eligible children enrolled, 60.0% were < 6 years of age, 63.9% were male, 85.9% were black, 68.4% were publicly insured, and 51.8% had > 3 ED visits in the previous 12 months. Home exposure to ETS and potential allergens was high. Exposure to cockroach allergen was significantly associated with household income. Coexistence of exposures was common: significantly more patients reporting ETS exposure also reported exposure to cockroach allergen and mold than those not reporting ETS exposure. Poorer QoL was significantly associated with cockroach exposure, although this effect was limited to those also exposed to ETS. Higher rates of unscheduled health care utilization and persistent asthma symptoms were not associated with exposures.

Conclusion

Additional investigation is necessary to clarify the role of exposure-avoidance measures as a component of ED-based interventions for asthma care.

### Studies of sick building syndrome. IV. mycotoxicosis [^114Yrrew]. The Journal of Asthma (2002). Low credibility.

There has been increasing public attention to the potential health risks of mold exposure, particularly in wet buildings. A variety of molds has been isolated from both damaged homes and businesses, including agents that secrete toxigenic materials. One area that is attracting particular notice is the relative toxigenic potential of mycotoxins. Although exposure to molds can produce significant mucosal irritation, there are very few data to suggest long-term ill effects. More importantly, there is no evidence in humans that mold exposure leads to nonmucosal pathology. In fact, many of the data on toxigenic molds are derived from animal toxicity studies, and these are based primarily, on ingestion. Although every attempt should be made to improve the quality of indoor air, including avoidance of molds, the human illnesses attributed to fungal exposure are, with the exception of invasive infections and mold allergy, relatively rare. In this review we discuss selected aspects of the microbiology of mycotoxin-producing molds and their potential role in human immunopathology with respect to wet building environments.

### Environmental controls of allergies [^114Y7a3Z]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Environmental controls of allergy remain a cornerstone in the management of patients who have allergic rhinitis. In the past, recommendations for environmental controls were based on common sense and the demonstration that certain methods of environmental control reduce antigen quantity. Reduction of antigen quantity is, however, only an indirect measure of whether an environmental control strategy actually reduces allergic symptoms. This article details current recommendations for reducing antigen exposure based on specific antigen sensitivities. Strategies for reduction of indoor inhalant allergens-dust mites, cockroach, molds, and house pet danders-are presented, as well as techniques for reducing exposure to outdoor inhalant allergens.

### Coccidioidomycosis outbreaks, United States and worldwide, 1940–2015 [^117VmDRx]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis causes substantial illness and death in the United States each year. Although most cases are sporadic, outbreaks provide insight into the clinical and environmental features of coccidioidomycosis, high-risk activities, and the geographic range of Coccidioides fungi. We identified reports published in English of 47 coccidioidomycosis outbreaks worldwide that resulted in 1,464 cases during 1940–2015. Most (85%) outbreaks were associated with environmental exposures; the 2 largest outbreaks resulted from an earthquake and a large dust storm. More than one third of outbreaks occurred in areas where the fungus was not previously known to be endemic, and more than half of outbreaks involved occupational exposures. Coccidioidomycosis outbreaks can be difficult to detect and challenging to prevent given the unknown effectiveness of environmental control methods and personal protective equipment; therefore, increased awareness of coccidioidomycosis outbreaks is needed among public health professionals, healthcare providers, and the public.

### Mold prevention strategies and possible health effects in the aftermath of hurricanes and major floods [^114EwzX2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Extensive water damage after major hurricanes and floods increases the likelihood of mold contamination in buildings. This report provides information on how to limit exposure to mold and how to identify and prevent mold-related health effects. Where uncertainties in scientific knowledge exist, practical applications designed to be protective of a person's health are presented. Evidence is included about assessing exposure, clean-up and prevention, personal protective equipment, health effects, and public health strategies and recommendations. The recommendations assume that, in the aftermath of major hurricanes or floods, buildings wet for < 48 hours will generally support visible and extensive mold growth and should be remediated, and excessive exposure to mold-contaminated materials can cause adverse health effects in susceptible persons regardless of the type of mold or the extent of contamination. For the majority of persons, undisturbed mold is not a substantial health hazard. Mold is a greater hazard for persons with conditions such as impaired host defenses or mold allergies. To prevent exposure that could result in adverse health effects from disturbed mold, persons should 1) avoid areas where mold contamination is obvious; 2) use environmental controls; 3) use personal protective equipment; and 4) keep hands, skin, and clothing clean and free from mold-contaminated dust. Clinical evaluation of suspected mold-related illness should follow conventional clinical guidelines. In addition, in the aftermath of extensive flooding, health-care providers should be watchful for unusual mold-related diseases. The development of a public health surveillance strategy among persons repopulating areas after extensive flooding is recommended to assess potential health effects and the effectiveness of prevention efforts. Such a surveillance program will help CDC and state and local public health officials refine the guidelines for exposure avoidance, personal protection, and clean-up and assist health departments to identify unrecognized hazards.

Chronic cough (CC) is a common respiratory symptom in children, often linked to allergic conditions, environmental exposures, and potentially indicative of underlying asthma.

Objective

To investigate the relationships of CC in children with allergic predispositions, environmental exposures, and airway inflammatory markers.

Methods

A case-control study was conducted at a tertiary hospital. Data on cough duration, personal and family allergic histories, and environmental exposures were collected. Airway inflammation was assessed using fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO 50), and lung function was evaluated via spirometry.

Results

Children with CC showed a higher prevalence of allergic conditions, including rhinitis (74.77% vs. 24.13%, OR = 9.312, p < 0.0001), food allergy (59.81% vs. 27.59%, OR = 3.907, p = 0.0017), eczema (55.14% vs. 31.03%, OR = 2.731, p = 0.0213), and family history of allergies (71.96% vs. 27.59%, OR = 6.738, p < 0.001). Environmental exposures, such as household smoking (55.14% vs. 20.69%, OR = 4.712, p = 0.001) and mold exposure (28.68% vs. 7.35%, OR = 3.442, p = 0.0251), were more common in the CC group. CC children exhibited elevated FeNO 50 (median: 18 vs. 14ppb, p = 0.0153) and impaired small airway function (FEF75%pred: 53.84 ± 20.21 vs. 65.07 ± 28.52, p = 0.0170).

Conclusions

Pediatric CC is strongly associated with allergic predispositions, environmental exposures, and eosinophilic airway inflammation, potentially reflecting an asthma-related phenotype.

### Spectrum of noninfectious health effects from molds [^1113D6BQ]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Molds are multicellular fungi that are ubiquitous in outdoor and indoor environments. For humans, they are both beneficial (for the production of antimicrobial agents, chemotherapeutic agents, and vitamins) and detrimental. Exposure to mold can occur through inhalation, ingestion, and touching moldy surfaces. Adverse health effects may occur through allergic, infectious, irritant, or toxic processes. The cause-and-effect relationship between mold exposure and allergic and infectious illnesses is well known. Exposures to toxins via the gastrointestinal tract also are well described. However, the cause-and-effect relationship between inhalational exposure to mold toxins and other untoward health effects (eg, acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage in infants and other illnesses and health complaints) is controversial and requires additional investigation. In this report we examine evidence of fungal-related illnesses and the unique aspects of mold exposure to children. Mold-remediation procedures are also discussed.

### Spectrum of noninfectious health effects from molds [^112b6Vur]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Molds are eukaryotic (possessing a true nucleus) nonphotosynthetic organisms that flourish both indoors and outdoors. For humans, the link between mold exposure and asthma exacerbations, allergic rhinitis, infections, and toxicities from ingestion of mycotoxin-contaminated foods are well known. However, the cause-and-effect relationship between inhalational exposure to mold and other untoward health effects (eg, acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage in infants and other illnesses and health complaints) requires additional investigation. Pediatricians play an important role in the education of families about mold, its adverse health effects, exposure prevention, and remediation procedures.

### Mold sensitization is common amongst patients with severe asthma requiring multiple hospital admissions [^111dKqcX]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

One of the fungi which we investigated and for which antigenic extracts are available, Candida albicans, is a yeast, does not become airborne but does produce hyphae in tissue. Thus it is possible that human asthma due to fungal allergens may have three sources of allergen exposure – outdoor mold spores, indoor mold spores and endogenous fungal growth on body surfaces including the skin and gut.

Fungal sensitization is relatively uncommon in our British asthma patients and in Finnish schoolchildren compared with Arizona and Australia where up to 31% of asthmatic children and up to 23% of non-asthmatic controls react to at least one fungal allergen. The prevalence of Alternaria sensitization in Italian patients with respiratory symptoms ranges from 2% in Northern Italy to 29% in Southern Italy. Some of these differences are probably due to difficulties in the standardization of mold allergen extracts or skin testing techniques. Also fungal sensitization is commoner in children and declines with age. However, it is likely that the significance of a positive skin test to fungal allergens varies in different climatic zones. Our data and those of O'Hollaren, Sureik and Black suggests that fungal skin sensitization tests may identify adults who are at risk of especially severe asthma. The difference in the prevalence of mold sensitization between patients with multiple asthma admissions and the other groups in our study was so striking that it is extremely unlikely to have occurred by chance. Mold allergy tests may be useful to screen for children and adults who are at greatly increased risk of developing severe or fatal asthma. A large prospective study will be required to confirm these preliminary findings.

### Indoor environmental control practices and asthma management [^1163HfrX]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Dampness and mold in homes — Moisture-related exposures contribute to asthma, and risk quantification and management steps are described: "Excessive moisture in homes can contribute to asthma through an increase in mold exposure as well as increased cockroach and dust mite allergen". In children with persistent asthma, "The prevalence of mold sensitization… is approximately 50%", and nationally "56% of homes had levels of some molds above thresholds observed to be associated with asthma symptoms". "Children sensitized and exposed to the major indoor molds appear to be at greater risk of asthma exacerbations", and "Remediation of mold has been shown to reduce symptoms and medication use… and its effects may not depend on whether the population is sensitized to mold". Evaluation "includes an assessment of sensitization to the major indoor molds, which can be accomplished with specific IgE testing… or through referral to a board-certified allergist for skin testing". To identify moisture problems, "Air sampling, thermography, moisture meters, environmental history, and direct observation are all useful", and parental report "suggests that the parents be counseled to intervene on the home environment". Caution is noted that "reports from air sampling are uninterpretable without concomitant indoor and outdoor sampling".

### Assessment of the indoor environment: evaluation of mold growth indoors [^112fNYQw]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Much attention has been focused on indoor molds; resulting in modest amounts of new research. There is strong evidence of respiratory effects. Although mechanisms are disputed, some of the effect (but not all) is likely to be allergy related. There is some evidence that atopic individuals may be more affected, but many nonatopic individuals also are affected. This area needs more general research and specific research on exposure measures (such as what fungal components should be measured) and on health-effect mechanisms. It is worthwhile to emphasize the practical knowledge that is readily available. Buildings should be designed, built, operated, and occupied so that the buildings stay dry. When this situation does not occur, the environmental and clinical aspects that are observed by competent professionals should both be considered when determining causal relationships.

### ACMT position statement: medical toxicology considerations in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with concerns about mold-related inhalation exposures [^112LByS7]. ACMT (2025). High credibility.

ACMT position statement — laboratory testing for mycotoxin exposure assessment notes that "mycotoxin antibody testing" has been utilized in epidemiological studies of damp indoor spaces but states that identification or measurement of antibodies to mycotoxins is not an accepted method to assess human exposure, has not been validated in well-designed epidemiological studies, and is not recommended for the assessment of human exposure to mycotoxins. The document further clarifies that fungal immunoassay tests, including immunoglobulin testing for IgG and IgE, can be clinically useful for immunological conditions from exposure to fungal antigens but do not provide information about the source or magnitude of exposure to mycotoxins and therefore have no role in exposure assessment in this context.

### Environmental risk factors, protective factors, and biomarkers for allergic rhinitis: a systematic umbrella review of the evidence [^1178Mt7u]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Exposure to indoor mold and exposure to indoor dampness are associated with AR and are an environmental risk factor for AR, which provides highly suggestive evidence and upgrades to convincing evidence in the subgroup analysis of children. Indoor dampness and mold are important factors in residential indoor environment. On the one hand, it is related to high indoor water vapor content and insufficient ventilation; on the other hand, it is related to unreasonable construction and use of buildings that lead to excessive moisture or excessive water vapor accumulation in building materials, both of which create conditions for the breeding of moisture and mold. Studies have found that self-reported problems with dampness or mold in buildings where people live or work are associated with respiratory or allergic diseases. Signs of dampness, such as water leakage, water damage, visible mold, and mold odor, inevitably cause biological contamination, invasion of the respiratory tract, and allergic reactions. In addition to indoor dampness and mold providing a good environment for microbial growth, the degradation of building materials by moisture and water vapor to volatilize chemicals may also be an important cause of allergy problems. The age subgroup analysis showed that the level of evidence was upgraded from highly suggestive to convincing evidence in children, suggesting that children may be more susceptible to allergic reactions in indoor environments with dampness and mold, which may be related to the immature development of the immune system in children.

### Pollen and mold exposure impairs the work performance of employees with allergic rhinitis [^115Y2UMf]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Although quality of life studies suggest that allergic rhinitis has a substantial impact on work impairment, national survey estimates of the magnitude of this impairment have varied widely. Retrospective recall bias is likely to be a major cause of this variability.

Objective

This study used a nationally representative daily diary sample to obtain prospective data that improve on previous estimates of the work impairment because of allergic rhinitis.

Methods

The MacArthur Foundation National Survey of Daily Experience is a daily diary survey that included a nationally representative subsample of 739 employed people, each of whom provided daily reports on work performance for 1 randomly assigned week of the calendar year. National Allergy Bureau monitoring station data were merged with the survey data to study the association of time-space variation in pollen/mold exposure with impaired daily work quality and quantity.

Results

National Allergy Bureau pollen/mold counts are significantly related to work impairments only among respondents with self-reported allergic rhinitis. The average estimated monthly salary-equivalent work impairment costs associated with pollen/mold exposure for each allergy sufferer is between $109 and $156, with an annualized national projection of between $5.4 billion and $7.7 billion.

Conclusions

The extent to which these costs can be recovered by increasing the proportion of allergy sufferers who are successfully treated remains unknown and can only be evaluated definitively in effectiveness trials.

American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) position — mold-related inhalation exposures states that there are no medical toxicologically-based diagnostic laboratory or treatment modalities in the management of individuals exposed to damp indoor spaces that are supportive of inhalation contact with mycotoxins as a systemic toxicant associated with mold/fungi. The document clarifies that this is the position of the American College of Medical Toxicology at the time written, after a review of the issue and pertinent literature.

### Mold and dampness exposure and allergic outcomes from birth to adolescence: data from the BAMSE cohort [^117CFTRX]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Indoor mold and dampness is a major environmental problem globally, with estimates ranging from 18% to 50% of household dwellings 1, 2, 3. Efforts to improve household energy efficiency and reduce heat loss can increase the risk of dampness and fungal contamination 4. Excessive indoor dampness fosters microbial proliferation and results in exposure to various microbial agents, like spores and cell fragments containing toxins, inflammatory substances, and allergens 5. These substances have been shown to cause irritation and immunostimulation, and induce inflammatory processes 6. Exposure to mold and dampness has been suggested to increase the risk of asthma and allergic disease, and both allergic and nonallergic pathways have been proposed 7.

In epidemiological studies, exposure to a moldy or damp indoor environment in early life has been associated with atopic diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, and immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitization in young children 7, 8, 9, 10. The most consistent and highest excess risks have been noted for asthma 8 and rhinitis 11, while fewer and less conclusive studies have been conducted for IgE sensitization 6. Studies have attempted to elucidate the association between exposure to moldy indoor environments early in life and allergic health outcomes in school age 10, 12, 13, but the results have been inconsistent and few prospective studies have followed children beyond 10 years of age 8, 14, 15. Furthermore, the role of dampness and mold for persistence and late‐onset asthma is not clear 16.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether exposure to mold or dampness during infancy influences the risk of asthma, rhinitis, or IgE sensitization in children followed prospectively from birth to adolescence. In conjunction, we assessed clinical phenotypes of asthma, looking at the timing of onset and persistence of symptoms.

### Uncontrolled asthma and household environmental exposures in Puerto Rico [^113cG2YU]. The Journal of Asthma (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe asthma control and household environmental exposures among adults and children with asthma in Puerto Rico.

Methods

A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the 2014–2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Asthma Call-back Survey on 931 adults and 177 children with current asthma in Puerto Rico. These data were analyzed to assess the prevalence of uncontrolled asthma in Puerto Rico and potential associations with household environmental exposure to cockroaches, smoke, and mold. Asthma control was classified using daytime and nighttime symptoms, activity limitation, and short-acting beta agonist use. Prevalence and prevalence ratios were calculated, adjusting for sample weighting.

Results

An estimated 53% of adults with asthma and 29% of children with asthma in Puerto Rico have uncontrolled asthma. Among adults with asthma, in the past 30days, 29% had seen or smelled mold and 50% had seen cockroaches; in the past week, 12% reported having someone smoke in their home. Adults with uncontrolled asthma were 1.4 times more likely to have observed mold in their homes than were those with controlled asthma when adjusting for age, sex, education, and income (prevalence ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.4 [1.1, 1.8]). Children with uncontrolled asthma were also more likely to have mold observed in their home than were children with controlled asthma (adjusted PR [95% CI]: 3.0 [1.3, 7.1]).

Conclusions

Uncontrolled asthma is common among adults and children with asthma in Puerto Rico. These results suggest potential differences in household mold exposure by asthma control status.

### Mold sensitization is common amongst patients with severe asthma requiring multiple hospital admissions [^1178SiNC]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Third, there is evidence that indoor mold exposure may contribute to asthma severity. Many patients report respiratory symptoms in damp and moldy houses and a review of nine population-based studies found that seven reported one or more positive associations between fungal levels and health outcomes. The study of Williamson and colleagues in Scotland reported that asthmatic patients were more than twice as likely than control patients to live in a house that was considered damp or moldy by a building surveyor. Furthermore, in that study, there was a positive association between a patient's asthma severity and the degree of dampness which the surveyor measured in the patient's home (r = 0.3, p = 0.006) and independently with an index of visible mold growth in their dwelling (r = 0.23, p = 0.035). In a study of German children, it was found that bronchial hyper-reactivity was associated with damp housing that was only partly explained by exposure to house dust mite antigen, suggesting that other factors such as mold growth may also be important. Taskinen et al found that the prevalence of asthma was similar (4.8%) amongst children attending a school with moisture and mold problems compared with a control school but asthma symptoms such as wheeze and cough were commoner in the damp moldy school as were emergency visits to hospital (OR 2.0, p < 0.01).

Fourth, we know that Aspergillus in particular is a major respiratory allergen causing the vast majority of cases of allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis. It is likely that these cases represent the extreme of a spectrum of mold allergy, the slightly less severe manifestation of which is severe asthma as described in this study and without all the serological and radiological markers characterisitic of ABPA. The reactivity of asthmatic patients to multiple mold allergens could be due to genuine sensitization to a variety of molds or it could be due to cross-reactivity between mold allergens. The paper of Hemmann and colleagues suggests that Aspergillus and Candida allergens may share IgE-binding epitopes. However, it is believed that multiple mold sensitization skin test reactions are usually due to sensitivity to multiple antigens rather than cross reactivity. Few fungi of the > 1 million species of fungi thought to exist worldwide have been subjected to the antigenic scrutiny that Aspergillus and a few other common airborne fungi have and it is likely that sensitization to other fungi will be discovered in the future.

### The role and abatement of fungal allergens in allergic diseases [^117U49AB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Sensitivity to a variety of fungi is known to be a factor in allergic rhinitis and asthma. In this review methods for measuring exposure to fungi in the indoor environment are evaluated. A variety of markers for the presence of fungi are also described in addition to their known relationship to either toxic or adverse immunologic effects. Key studies documenting the clinical effects of different types of fungi are also reviewed, as well as a description of abatement methods that either have been successful or need further investigation. Although many studies have shown an association between exposure to fungi and allergic disease, in many cases a direct cause-and-effect relationship has not been established. Improved knowledge of the epidemiology and mechanisms behind fungal-induced human disease will hopefully establish this causal link and suggest methods for reducing morbidity.

### Indoor environmental control practices and asthma management [^111GAx1L]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Indoor environmental control practices for asthma management emphasize that individually tailored environmental control measures have been shown to reduce asthma symptoms and exacerbations, are similar in efficacy to controller medications, and appear to be cost- effective when the aim is to reduce days of symptoms and their associated costs; the efficacy of environmental control measures has been sustained for up to 1 year after the intervention. As a part of developing tailored strategies, an environmental history may be obtained to evaluate the key indoor environmental exposures that are known to trigger asthma symptoms and exacerbations, including both indoor pollutants and allergens, and may include questions regarding the presence of pets or pests or evidence of pests, knowledge of whether the community's climatic characteristics favor dust mites, and sources of indoor air pollution including smokers in the home, use of gas stoves and appliances, and presence of mold in the home. The leading indoor environmental contributors to asthma symptoms are indoor allergens (pets, dust mites, mice, rats, cockroaches, molds) and pollutants (airborne PM [particulate matter], SHS [secondhand smoke], NO2 [nitrogen dioxide]). For evaluation, serum allergen-specific IgE (immunoglobulin E) antibody tests may be performed or the patient may be referred to a board-certified allergist for evaluation and allergy skin testing to identify indoor allergens that are most likely to be clinically relevant. Environmental control strategies are tailored to each potentially relevant indoor exposure and are based on knowledge of the sources and underlying characteristics of the exposure, and strategies include source removal, source control, and mitigation strategies.

### Mold and dampness exposure and allergic outcomes from birth to adolescence: data from the BAMSE cohort [^112rxDFX]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

The prospective design, large number of participants, high retention rate, and repeated assessments of allergic disease at six different time points are significant strengths of our study. The longitudinal design allowed us to investigate the temporal sequence between early‐life exposure and health outcomes up to adolescence, and to study the timing of onset and persistence of these allergic diseases.

Several limitations to our study should be acknowledged. Exposure to mold and dampness were ascertained by parental questionnaires, and some exposure misclassification is probable. Questionnaire‐based data are subjective and lack sensitivity and specificity. For example, perceived mold odor in the home may in fact be from chloroanisoles, which are produced by microbes that methylate chlorophenols in wood preservatives in moist conditions, but which do not necessarily indicate major problems with dampness and molds as the odor thresholds of some common chloroanisoles are extremely low 41. Home inspection is a more standardized way of assessing exposure, but it is not often feasible to perform with a large number of participants and homes, and interinspector variation is common 5, 42. In the BAMSE birth cohort, a subset of 540 children's homes were inspected between the child's age of 1 and 2 years for dampness and mold indicators. The overall agreement between the parental reported and inspector noted signs of mold and dampness was rather weak, but increased odds of recurrent wheezing in infancy were observed for both exposures 43. Parents and inspectors reported at different times, so remediation of dampness or mold problems could have occurred prior to the inspector's visit. In this subset of our cohort, families with parental allergic disease more often reported problems with mold or dampness, and also had a tendency toward higher measured values of indoor humidity 43. In the present analyses, risk estimates for asthma and rhinitis were elevated both among children with and without parental allergic disease. Outcome misclassification can be a concern when analyzing data collected by questionnaires, but the definitions of asthma and rhinitis used in this study were modified based on the validated ISAAC questionnaire 44 and have been used in prior publications 18, 31.

In conclusion, our findings indicate that exposure to mold or dampness during infancy increases the risk of asthma and rhinitis through 16 years of age, particularly for disease without IgE sensitization. Early exposure to mold or dampness may be particularly associated with persistent asthma up to adolescence.

### Toxic mold: phantom risk vs science [^116AZfSw]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the available literature on the subject of fungi (molds) and their potential impact on health and to segregate information that has scientific validity from information that is yet unproved and controversial.

Data Sources

This review represents a synthesis of the available literature in this area with the authors' collective experience with many patients presenting with complaints of mold-related illness.

Study Selection

Pertinent scientific investigation on toxic mold issues and previously published reviews on this and related subjects that met the educational objectives were critically reviewed.

Results

Indoor mold growth is variable, and its discovery in a building does not necessarily mean occupants have been exposed. Human response to fungal antigens may induce IgE or IgG antibodies that connote prior exposure but not necessarily a symptomatic state. Mold-related disease has been discussed in the framework of noncontroversial and controversial disorders.

Conclusions

When mold-related symptoms occur, they are likely the result of transient irritation, allergy, or infection. Building-related illness due to mycotoxicosis has never been proved in the medical literature. Prompt remediation of water-damaged material and infrastructure repair should be the primary response to fungal contamination in buildings.

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^115HoCbF]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Building associated illness/indoor air quality (IAQ) — program elements and assessment approaches are described for health care facilities: Health care facilities must develop an indoor environmental program to ensure a healthy building environment, with central elements including ventilation standards, development of good operations and maintenance procedures, establishment of construction and remediation standards and effective management of moisture, mold, and other indoor environmental problems. The American Society for Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers has published a standard for indoor air quality in hospitals, and hospital ventilation systems are usually far more complex than those of office buildings, hotels, or schools because of the multiple uses and locations, including operating rooms, bone marrow transplant units, and sterilization areas. IAQ complaints must be properly evaluated in a timely fashion, and facilities are generally more successful if they have a defined procedure including ways of reporting complaints, designated responders, and a formal approach to providing feedback. Clinicians should assess staff, patients, or visitors to determine whether symptoms may represent building-related disease or irritant symptoms and differentiate between illness in response to chemical exposures, inadequate ventilation, and illness of microbiologic origin. The primary environmental assessment generally requires an engineering assessment of the systems, and, often, an industrial hygiene assessment of potential sources, and in general, quantitative sampling should be limited to the specific contaminants suspected by the environmental and medical assessments, with a very clear justification for sample collection. Detailed reporting of findings should be made to management and to the affected employees.

### Multiyear environmental surveillance in a pediatric teaching hospital: association between airborne mold spores and invasive mold infections [^111NukoR]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Very few infections within the hematology/oncology population were classified as CO because other significant healthcare exposure during the month before sign/symptom onset typically gave a classification of at least a possible HO. The associations between AFL and IMI for hematology/oncology patients — including possible HO events — suggests that at least a portion of the early hospitalization infections classified as possible HO were likely acquired in the healthcare setting. The alternative potential for some IMI to develop after an extended period of latency or incubation, however, is suggested by the fact that the association between hematology/oncology IMI and the non- Aspergillus pathogen AFL was strengthened by inclusion of IMI data from the month following the AFL measurement. These observations may contribute to future efforts that are needed to standardize criteria for healthcare-associated IMI.

Within the limitations above, our results may provide useful comparison data for other hospitals performing AFL measurements. Further work is needed to extend these observations to other healthcare facilities and more fully define the role that routine AFL surveillance may play in mitigating the risk of IMI among immunocompromised patients.

### Fungal levels in the home and lower respiratory tract illnesses in the first year of life [^1143RZtz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The association between home dampness and lower respiratory symptoms in children has been well documented. Whether fungal exposures contribute to this association is uncertain. In a prospective birth cohort of 499 children of parents with asthma/allergies, we examined in-home fungal concentrations as predictors of lower respiratory illnesses (LRI) (croup, pneumonia, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis) in the first year. In multivariate analyses, we found a significant increased relative risk (RR) between LRI and high levels (more than the 90th percentile) of airborne Penicillium (RR = 1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23, 2.43), dust-borne Cladosporium (RR = 1.52; CI, 1.02, 2.25), Zygomycetes (RR = 1.96; CI, 1.35, 2.83), and Alternaria (RR = 1.51; CI, 1.00, 2.28), after controlling for sex, presence of water damage or visible mold/mildew, born in winter, breastfeeding, and being exposed to other children through siblings. In a multivariate analysis, the RR of LRI was elevated in households with any fungal level at more than the 90th percentile (RR = 1.86; CI, 1.21, 2.88). Exposure to high fungal levels increased the risk of LRI in infancy, even for infants with nonwheezing LRI. Actual mechanisms remain unknown, but fungi and their components (glucans, mycotoxins, and proteins) may increase the risk of LRI by acting as irritants or through increasing susceptibility to infection.

### Hurricane season public health preparedness, response, and recovery guidance for health care providers, response and recovery workers, and affected communities, 2017 [^112gSTL1]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

As part of the overall U.S. Department of Health and Human Services response and recovery operations, CDC and ATSDR are supporting public health and medical care functions for affected communities and persons displaced by the hurricanes. As of September 12, 2017, CDC and ATSDR had sent pharmacy and federal medical station supplies to Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. CDC and ATSDR have also activated and deployed members of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and other personnel to provide technical support for critical public health functions. Field operations and the CDC and ATSDR Emergency Operations Center are supporting mortality and morbidity surveillance; public health messaging and risk communication; water, sanitation, safety, and facility assessments; community rapid needs assessments; mold abatement; industrial and residential contaminant exposure prevention; and vector control.

There are potential public health and safety concerns after hurricane impact. Many injuries and illnesses from hurricanes and floods occur during the response and recovery phases. Common hazards include vehicle- and nonvehicle-related drowning, carbon monoxide poisoning (e.g. from any gasoline-powered engine, including generators and clean-up equipment), electrocution, falls, lacerations, and exposure to mold and industrial and household chemicals. In addition, exacerbation of existing chronic conditions and development of acute mental health symptoms are frequent reasons for seeking health care services following a disaster. Guidance and other resources to assist in addressing many of these hazards and risk are available (Table 2).

CDC and ATSDR also offer a disaster response clinical consultation service to assist health care providers, public health professionals, and emergency response partners. This service can be accessed by emailing CDC IMS Clinical Inquiries at.

For additional assistance, health care providers, public health professionals, and members of the public can also use CDC and ATSDR's information service, CDC-INFO. Live agents provide up-to-date science-based health information. CDC-INFO can be reached Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time at 1–800-INFO (1–800–232–4636) or by submitting a web-based form.

### The continuum of severity of functional impairment due to indoor air symptoms: prevalence and determinants [^1133CGyG]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

We observed that increasing severity of functional impairment due to indoor air–related symptoms was associated with an increased risk of reporting intolerance not only to indoor air but also to other environmental exposures. This finding is consistent with earlier findings from population-based studies in Finlandand Swedenshowing strong overlap between different idiopathic environmental intolerances, conditions that are characterized by symptoms from multiple-organ systems attributed to various environmental factors that are tolerated by most people. As observed before for environmental intolerance, also in the present study, the likelihood of having symptoms from multiple organs increased with increasing severity of functional impairment. We further observed a similar increased risk of having disorders that are labeled as functional somatic syndromes, like irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome, with increasing severity of functional impairment. These findings are consistent with earlier suggestions that there is substantial overlap between the functional somatic syndromes or manifestations of persistent physical symptoms, which may result from shared predisposing and perpetuating factors and common underlying mechanisms. For example, controlled studies done among those with increased sensitivity to electromagnetic fieldsand multiple chemicalshave shown that the symptoms among these individuals are not due to the suspected exposures, but knowledge or suspicion of being exposed. There is also extensive evidence that in addition to indoor air impurities and dampness and mold,– indoor air–related symptoms are associated with other biopsychosocial factors as well, such as gender, stress, lack of social support, anxiety, and job demands, that may serve as perpetuating factors for functional impairment. In addition, we observed in the present study that the number of comorbidities was increased especially among those with severe functional impairment. Taken together, these observations suggest that factors other than indoor air impurities may play a larger etiological role among those with more severe functional impairment, which is also consistent with the clinical experience.

### ACMT position statement: medical toxicology considerations in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with concerns about mold-related inhalation exposures [^113fMDgh]. ACMT (2025). High credibility.

ACMT position statement — mycotoxins in indoor air and exposure magnitude states that mycotoxins in indoor air are large, complex molecules that are not volatile and their concentrations in indoor and outdoor air are exceedingly low, and exposure modeling indicates that even in moldy environments the maximum inhalation dose is generally orders of magnitude lower than demonstrated thresholds for adverse health effects. Human studies in agricultural environments are described as demonstrating that in moldy environments inhalation exposure results in a dose far less than what is normally encountered from dietary exposure. ACMT recommends that future studies utilize validated biomarker methods as indicators of internal dose to assess cumulative exposure and the dose-response relationship, bearing in mind the variably short elimination half-life of most mycotoxins, and states that it is inappropriate to attribute identification of mycotoxins in urine to postulated remote inhalation exposure.

### Indoor fungal exposure [^11649Yfu]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Fungi affect humans in complex ways and are capable of eliciting a number of disease responses, such as infectious, allergic, and irritant and toxic effects. Fungal exposure is unequivocally associated with exacerbations of asthma, although the role of fungi in causing the disease is yet to be determined. The association between home dampness and respiratory health effects is strong, and fungal exposure is suspected to be associated with this linkage. Fear of toxin exposures has generated debate over the possible toxic health effects of airborne fungi; however, several recent reviews discount the health impacts of mycotoxin through indoor exposures. Nevertheless, fungal contamination of indoor environments is undesirable. Knowledge of sources and characteristics of fungal spore release and dispersal are important for understanding the processes of exposure. Environmental monitoring for fungi and their disease agents are important aspects of exposure assessment, but few guidelines exist for interpreting their health impacts. Much work is needed in isolating, characterizing and standardizing fungal disease agents to properly assess the prevalence of fungal health effects.

### Children's respiratory health and mold levels in New Orleans after katrina: a preliminary look [^114ftBnn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

When the federal levee system broke after Hurricane Katrina, 80 percent of New Orleans, approximately 134,000 homes, flooded. As repopulation and revitalization activities continue, exposure to mold and other respiratory irritants has emerged as a major health concern; however, there has been no study examining children's respiratory health and indoor mold levels in the post-Katrina environment.

Objective

The Children's Respiratory Health Study was designed as a preliminary examination of indoor air levels of mold, children's lung function, and common indices of respiratory health in a select sample of children returning to live in New Orleans immediately after Hurricane Katrina.

Methods

Children were recruited from a private primary school in the Garden District of New Orleans. Respiratory health questionnaire and spirometric data were collected on children 7 to 14 years of age, and mold air sampling was conducted at baseline and again after 2 months.

Conclusions

There was an overall decrease in mold levels and respiratory symptoms over the study period, and indoor mold levels were low despite reported hurricane damage.

Volatile organic compounds produced by mold (mVOCs) — exposure levels, symptom potential, and attribution: In sufficient doses, mVOCs can produce transient irritative symptoms and subjective complaints such as nasal and eye discomfort, headache and dizziness, but indoor concentrations are "very low, on the order of micrograms-to-nanograms per liter or part per billion (ppb) to parts per trillion (ppt) range", whereas "the levels that can induce sensory irritation are in the milligram per cubic meter (mg/m3) or parts per billion (ppb) range in the air"; due to short environmental half-lives "minutes to hours", effects are transient, and when persistent neurological, cognitive, or non-specific symptoms occur "weeks or months after the putative exposure", they "should not be attributed to irritant effects; rather, other causes should be sought".

### ACMT position statement: medical toxicology considerations in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with concerns about mold-related inhalation exposures [^111dTxxT]. ACMT (2025). High credibility.

ACMT position on mold-related inhalation exposures — mycotoxins and exposure assessment states that these issues have cast doubt on the causative role of inhaled mycotoxins for any toxic health effects in the indoor residential environment; epidemiological studies of mold in indoor environments should include appropriate comparisons with outdoor air, and studies should be designed to consider our aggregate and cumulative exposure to fungi and mycotoxins from indoor and outdoor environments; ACMT emphasizes the importance of distinguishing exposure to mycotoxins from exposure to the fungi that are capable of producing them, noting that toxigenic fungi and mycotoxins are not synonymous hazards and that the isolation of a toxigenic fungal species in the environment does not necessarily indicate that mycotoxins are also present, or that they are present at doses that pose health risks from environmental exposure; if epidemiological studies of damp indoor spaces are to include hypotheses relating to mycotoxins, then exposure assessment methods should utilize validated techniques to detect and quantify mycotoxins directly in environmental samples, and the interpretation of such environmental measurements should consist of a plausible, complete exposure pathway and an assessment of the dose-response relationship; ACMT further emphasizes that the diet is the most important source of human exposure to mycotoxins, and notes that mycotoxins of known dietary importance include aflatoxins (in corn, ground nuts, and dairy products), trichothecenes (in corn, cereals and fermented beverages) and ochratoxins (in coffee, wine, and dried fruits), with the vast majority of scientific data on the adverse health effects of mycotoxins derived from their presence as natural and unavoidable contaminants of foods and beverages.

### Adverse human health effects associated with molds in the indoor environment [^115FxCPi]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Molds are common and important allergens. About 5% of individuals are predicted to have some allergic airway symptoms from molds over their lifetime. However, it should be remembered that molds are not dominant allergens and that the outdoor molds, rather than indoor ones, are the most important. For almost all allergic individuals, the reactions will be limited to rhinitis or asthma; sinusitis may occur secondarily due to obstruction. Rarely do sensitized individuals develop uncommon conditions such as ABPA or AFS. To reduce the risk of developing or exacerbating allergies, mold should not be allowed to grow unchecked indoors. When mold colonization is discovered in the home, school, or office, it should be remediated after the source of the moisture that supports its growth is identified and eliminated. Authoritative guidelines for mold remediation are available. Fungi are rarely significant pathogens for humans. Superficial fungal infections of the skin and nails are relatively common in normal individuals, but those infections are readily treated and generally resolve without complication. Fungal infections of deeper tissues are rare and in general are limited to persons with severely impaired immune systems. The leading pathogenic fungi for persons with nonimpaired immune function, Blastomyces, Coccidioides, Cryptococcus, and Histoplasma, may find their way indoors with outdoor air but normally do not grow or propagate indoors. Due to the ubiquity of fungi in the environment, it is not possible to prevent immunecompromised individuals from being exposed to molds and fungi outside the confines of hospital isolation units. Some molds that propagate indoors may under some conditions produce mycotoxins that can adversely affect living cells and organisms by a variety of mechanisms. Adverse effects of molds and mycotoxins have been recognized for centuries following ingestion of contaminated foods. Occupational diseases are also recognized in association with inhalation exposure to fungi, bacteria, and other organic matter, usually in industrial or agricultural settings. Molds growing indoors are believed by some to cause building-related symptoms. Despite a voluminous literature on the subject, the causal association remains weak and unproven, particularly with respect to causation by mycotoxins. One mold in particular, Stachybotrys chartarum, is blamed for a diverse array of maladies when it is found indoors. Despite its well-known ability to produce mycotoxins under appropriate growth conditions, years of intensive study have failed to establish exposure to S. chartarum in home, school, or office environments as a cause of adverse human health effects. Levels of exposure in the indoor environment, dose-response data in animals, and dose-rate considerations suggest that delivery by the inhalation route of a toxic dose of mycotoxins in the indoor environment is highly unlikely at best, even for the hypothetically most vulnerable subpopulations. Mold spores are present in all indoor environments and cannot be eliminated from them. Normal building materials and furnishings provide ample nutrition for many species of molds, but they can grow and amplify indoors only when there is an adequate supply of moisture. Where mold grows indoors there is an inappropriate source of water that must be corrected before remediation of the mold colonization can succeed. Mold growth in the home, school, or office environment should not be tolerated because mold physically destroys the building materials on which it grows, mold growth is unsightly and may produce offensive odors, and mold is likely to sensitize and produce allergic responses in allergic individuals. Except for persons with severely impaired immune systems, indoor mold is not a source of fungal infections. Current scientific evidence does not support the proposition that human health has been adversely affected by inhaled mycotoxins in home, school, or office environments.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: climate change and human health [^112aA2KZ]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society climate change workshop — respiratory health impacts are outlined as preliminary research showing potentially direct and indirect adverse effects on respiratory health, with published studies linking climate change to increases in respiratory diseases including changing pollen releases impacting asthma and allergic rhinitis, heat waves causing critical care–related diseases, climate-driven air pollution increases exacerbating asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, desertification increasing particulate matter exposures, and climate-related changes in flood and water security impacting infectious respiratory diseases through malnutrition. The report notes concern about increased aeroallergens and mold exposure after Hurricane Katrina flooding and states that the impact of climate change on pollen and mold spores and allergic respiratory diseases is of growing concern. Workshop participants suggested links between climate-forced migration, crowding, and tuberculosis, and that climate change may also cause seasonal shifts impacting seasonal flu patterns. Among discussed factors, the most serious and direct health risk was believed to be heat-related disease resulting from increased frequency and severity of heat waves, which have been demonstrated to increase morbidity and mortality, and evidence is increasing that climate change drives respiratory disease onset and exacerbation via increased ambient and indoor air pollution, desertification, heat stress, wildfires, and the geographic and temporal spread of pollens and molds.

### Mold… [^113pQfgU]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know
- Mold can look like spots of many different colors, and it can smell musty. If you see or smell mold, you should remove it.
- If mold is growing in your home, you need to clean up the mold andfix the moisture problem.
- Learn what mold is, how to prevent it, and how to clean it up. Common types Mold is found both indoors and outdoors. Mold can enter your home through open doorways, windows, vents, and heating and air conditioning systems. Mold in the air outside can also attach itself to clothing, shoes, and pets can and be carried indoors. When mold spores drop on places with excessive moisture, such as where leakage may have occurred in roofs, pipes, walls, plant pots, or where there has been flooding, they will grow. Possible health effects Exposure to damp and moldy environments may cause a variety of health effects, or none at all. For some people, mold can cause a stuffy nose, sore throat, coughing or wheezing, burning eyes, or skin rash.

People with asthma or who are allergic to mold may have severe reactions. Immune-compromised people and people with chronic lung disease may get infections in their lungs from mold. For people who are sensitive to molds exposure to molds can lead to symptoms such as stuffy nose, wheezing, and red or itchy eyes, or skin. Severe reactions, such as fever or shortness of breath, may occur among workers exposed to large amounts of molds in occupational settings, such as farmers working around moldy hay. In 2004 the Institute of Medicine found there was sufficient evidence to link indoor exposure to mold with upper respiratory tract symptoms, cough, and wheeze in otherwise healthy people; with asthma symptoms in people with asthma; and with hypersensitivity pneumonitis in individuals susceptible to that immune-mediated condition. In 2009, the World Health Organization issued additional guidance, the WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Dampness and Mould.

Other recent studies have suggested a potential link of early mold exposure to development of asthma in some children, particularly among children who may be genetically susceptible to asthma development, and that selected interventions that improve housing conditions can reduce morbidity from asthma and respiratory allergies.

### Mycotoxin illness: recognition and management from functional medicine perspective [^114tCUSp]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Mold toxin exposure by inhalation and ingestion has significant health consequences for humans. In this article, we discuss the sources of these everyday toxins and their relevance to patient health. The effects of mycotoxins can present across all body systems, and the resulting symptoms can be acute, cumulative, and chronic. These effects can occur discretely, but they can also present alongside other clinical entities. It is important for the clinician to recognize the phenomenon of mycotoxin illness, because as a primary cause, it does not resolve with current standards of care for conditions secondary to it.

### Household mold exposure interacts with inflammation-related genetic variants on childhood asthma: a case-control study [^1139sWcq]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13 pathway genes, including IL-4, IL-13, IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Ra), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), were frequently linked to serum IgE levels and asthma as they can regulate IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines. IL-4 and IL-13 are the critical cytokines that regulate the switching from Immunoglobulin M (IgM) to IgE in activated B lymphocytes and the differentiation of Th2 cells, which is the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation or childhood asthma. In our study, there was no interaction between these genetic polymorphisms and visible mold exposure on childhood asthma, although they both can trigger the differentiation of Th2 cells. It is possible that the risk of one SNP involved in the IL-4/IL-13 pathway was not sufficient to result in profound changes in asthma susceptibility, just as our genetic associations have shown (see Additional file 1: Table S5). Larger studies are warranted to investigate the combined effects of the SNPs in the IL-4/IL-13 signaling pathway and the interaction with mold exposure on childhood asthma. Beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) gene is located on chromosome 5q31-q32 and encodes β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), which modulates the severity of asthma and the response to β2-AR agonists. Rs1042713 and rs1042714 are two common variants associated with the increased airway responsiveness and the reduced lung function by regulating β2-AR. Therefore, they were more prone to be linked to asthma severity but not asthma. Wang et al. reported that ADRB2 rs1042713 polymorphism significantly interacted with mold odor on asthmatic children with a symptom of night-time awakening, a phenotype of severe asthma. ADRB2 genetic polymorphisms might increase bronchoconstriction which was further accentuated by mold exposure, leading to asthma exacerbation. Severe asthma is a type of asthma that does not respond well to standard asthma treatment. The definition of severe asthma usually relies on the symptoms. Unfortunately, we didn't have sufficient information to identify the severity of asthmatic children. Therefore, we compared asthmatic and non-asthmatic children without stratifying by severity, which might have led to inconsistent findings.

### Indoor air quality and health does fungal contamination play a significant role? [^1133efQm]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Fungal contamination in buildings can vary greatly, and their presence in a dwelling does not necessarily constitute exposure. Measurement of mold spores and fragments varies depending on the methodology and instruments used. Meaningful comparison of data is rarely possible. The presence of a specific immune response to a fungal antigen only connotes that exposure to one or more related species has occurred, but not that there is a symptomatic clinical state. The response of individuals to indoor bioaerosols is complex and depends on age, gender, state of health, genetic makeup, and degree and time of bioaerosol exposure. In general, mold contamination in buildings is associated with incursion of water or moisture, which should be remedied as efficiently as possible. When disease occurs, it more likely is related to transient annoyance or irritational reactions. Allergic symptoms may be related to mold proliferation in the home environment. Because molds are encountered both indoors and outdoors, it is difficult to determine where the sensitivity initially arose and if the response is solely provoked by either an indoor or outdoor source. As an indoor allergen, mold is considered to be an infrequent participant in the induction of allergic disease when compared with housedust mites, animal dander, and cockroach allergens. Infection in healthy individuals is rare and usually is caused by an outdoor source. Building-related disease caused by mycotoxicosis has not been proved in the medical literature.

### Pesticide exposure in children [^111gsZqX]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

This statement presents the position of the American Academy of Pediatrics on pesticides. Pesticides are a collective term for chemicals intended to kill unwanted insects, plants, molds, and rodents. Children encounter pesticides daily and have unique susceptibilities to their potential toxicity. Acute poisoning risks are clear, and understanding of chronic health implications from both acute and chronic exposure are emerging. Epidemiologic evidence demonstrates associations between early life exposure to pesticides and pediatric cancers, decreased cognitive function, and behavioral problems. Related animal toxicology studies provide supportive biological plausibility for these findings. Recognizing and reducing problematic exposures will require attention to current inadequacies in medical training, public health tracking, and regulatory action on pesticides. Ongoing research describing toxicologic vulnerabilities and exposure factors across the life span are needed to inform regulatory needs and appropriate interventions. Policies that promote integrated pest management, comprehensive pesticide labeling, and marketing practices that incorporate child health considerations will enhance safe use.

### Allergy and "toxic mold syndrome" [^1129KMVr]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

"Toxic mold syndrome" is a controversial diagnosis associated with exposure to mold-contaminated environments. Molds are known to induce asthma and allergic rhinitis through IgE-mediated mechanisms, to cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis through other immune mechanisms, and to cause life-threatening primary and secondary infections in immunocompromised patients. Mold metabolites may be irritants and may be involved in "sick building syndrome". Patients with environmental mold exposure have presented with atypical constitutional and systemic symptoms, associating those symptoms with the contaminated environment.

Objective

To characterize the clinical features and possible etiology of symptoms in patients with chief complaints related to mold exposure.

Methods

Review of patients presenting to an allergy and asthma center with the chief complaint of toxic mold exposure. Symptoms were recorded, and physical examinations, skin prick/puncture tests, and intracutaneous tests were performed.

Results

A total of 65 individuals aged 1 1/2 to 52 years were studied. Symptoms included rhinitis (62%), cough (52%), headache (34%), respiratory symptoms (34%), central nervous system symptoms (25%), and fatigue (23%). Physical examination revealed pale nasal mucosa, pharyngeal "cobblestoning", and rhinorrhea. Fifty-three percent (33/62) of the patients had skin reactions to molds.

Conclusions

Mold-exposed patients can present with a variety of IgE- and non-IgE-mediated symptoms. Mycotoxins, irritation by spores, or metabolites may be culprits in non-IgE presentations; environmental assays have not been perfected. Symptoms attributable to the toxic effects of molds and not attributable to IgE or other immune mechanisms need further evaluation as to pathogenesis. Allergic, rather than toxic, responses seemed to be the major cause of symptoms in the studied group.

### Inhalational mold toxicity: fact or fiction? A clinical review of 50 cases [^117XusLu]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Three well-accepted mechanisms of mold-induced disease exist: allergy, infection, and oral toxicosis. Epidemiologic studies suggest a fourth category described as a transient aeroirritation effect. Toxic mold syndrome or inhalational toxicity continues to cause public concern despite a lack of scientific evidence that supports its existence.

Objectives

To conduct a retrospective review of 50 cases of purported mold-induced toxic effects and identify unrecognized conditions that could explain presenting symptoms; to characterize a subgroup with a symptom complex suggestive of an aeroirritation-mediated mechanism and compare this group to other diagnostic categories, such as sick building syndrome and idiopathic chemical intolerance; and to discuss the evolution of toxic mold syndrome from a clinical perspective.

Methods

Eighty-two consecutive medical evaluations were analyzed of which 50 met inclusion criteria. These cases were critically reviewed and underwent data extraction of 23 variables, including demographic data, patient symptoms, laboratory, imaging, and pulmonary function test results, and an evaluation of medical diagnoses supported by medical record review, examination, and/or test results.

Results

Upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract, systemic, and neurocognitive symptoms were reported in 80%, 94%, 74%, and 84% of patients, respectively. Thirty patients had evidence of non-mold-related conditions that explained their presenting complaints. Two patients had evidence of allergy to mold allergens, whereas 1 patient exhibited mold-induced psychosis best described as toxic agoraphobia. Seventeen patients displayed a symptom complex that could be postulated to be caused by a transient mold-induced aeroirritation.

Conclusion

The clinical presentation of patients with perceived mold-induced toxic effects is characterized by a disparate constellation of symptoms. Close scrutiny revealed a number of preexisting diagnoses that could plausibly explain presenting symptoms. The pathogenesis of aeroirritation implies completely transient symptoms linked to exposures at the incriminated site. Toxic mold syndrome represents the furtive evolution of aeroirritation from a transient to permanent symptom complex in patients with a psychogenic predisposition. In this respect, the core symptoms of toxic mold syndrome and their gradual transition to chronic symptoms related to nonspecific environmental fragrances and irritants appear to mimic what has been observed with other pseudodiagnostic categories, such as sick building syndrome and idiopathic chemical intolerance.

### Self-reported adverse reactions associated with mycoprotein (quorn-brand) containing foods [^111b1saD]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Mycoprotein, which is produced by a mold and is the basis of Quorn-brand meat substitutes, is a novel cause of allergic and gastrointestinal reactions, but little information has been available on its associated symptomatology.

Objective

To describe the nature and frequency of adverse reactions to mycoprotein.

Methods

Self-reports of adverse reactions to mycoprotein were collected via a Web-based questionnaire (www.quorncomplaints.org) and then analyzed.

Results

Analysis of 1,752 adverse reactions found that Quorn products caused allergic and gastrointestinal symptoms, with some people experiencing both. Allergic reactions, including urticaria and anaphylaxis, occurred within 4 hours of consumption in 312 people. Of those reactions, 45.8%, 1 fatal, began within 1 hour of exposure. Of those 312 individuals, 188 (60.3%) reported repeated reactions after repeated consumption of Quorn, and 2 people experienced 8 reactions (13 people did not say whether they experienced more than 1 reaction). Quorn foods caused gastrointestinal symptoms, including emesis and diarrhea, within 8 hours of consumption in 1,692 people. Of the gastrointestinal symptoms, 66.6% occurred 46 to 180 minutes after consumption of the products. Symptoms ranged from mild nausea to emesis severe enough to warrant medical attention.

Conclusion

Mycoprotein may be causing numerous and sometimes life-threatening allergic and gastrointestinal reactions. The acceptance in the food supply of this nonessential ingredient deserves reconsideration.

### Indoor and outdoor fungal allergens and impacts on respiratory allergic disease [^115TRWTh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Humans have a historic and intimate relationship with fungi. Fungi cause decay in the environment and a variety of human disease states including respiratory disease. Immunocompromised persons are particularly susceptible to fungal infection; however, the greater impact of fungi in general is through allergic mechanisms. This impact has been extensively documented in epidemiologic studies. Typically, fungal spore exposure has been examined in the outdoor environment; however, in recent decades, lifestyle changes have resulted in increased concern about fungi in the indoor environment. This review examines evidence for the relationship between fungal exposure and respiratory disease as indicated by documented physician interactions comparing times of high spore exposure with times of low exposure. The taxa Alternaria has been especially associated with respiratory difficulties, but there is extensive cross-reactivity among fungal allergens. We examine recent evidence that damp housing and associated indoor fungal load relate to respiratory disease and some possible mechanisms by which fungal products might cause sensitivity. We also offer some steps allergists might suggest to their patients that may help alleviate fungal exposure.

### Mold and dampness exposure and allergic outcomes from birth to adolescence: data from the BAMSE cohort [^112R2aRb]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Our finding that early‐life exposure to mold or dampness may play a role for development of asthma and rhinitis is analogous to corresponding associations for other environmental exposures such as air pollution or secondhand tobacco smoke 18, 33, 34. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that early‐life exposures contribute to health outcomes later in life.

Early‐life exposure to molds could cause recurrent irritation and immune activation in the respiratory tract, inducing prolonged inflammation, prompting the genesis of inflammatory‐related diseases, like asthma and rhinitis 10, 23. Certain fungal species are associated with inflammatory processes, and molds may contain substances which have inflammatory effects such as β‐1‐3‐glucans in the cell wall structure, microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs), extracellular polysaccharides, and mycotoxins 3, 6, 8, 35. Our results indicate that exposure to any mold or dampness indicator primarily increases the risk of nonallergic asthma and rhinitis, which may speak in favor of irritative rather than allergic inflammatory changes in the airways. Evidence from a case–control study suggests that nonallergic asthmatics have higher nasal and bronchial epithelia sensitivity to nonallergic factors like strong smells, air pollution, cold air, and respiratory viruses, compared with allergic asthmatics 36. Supporting our findings, two mouse models identified fungal glucans [(1→3)‐β‐‐glucans] and toxic metabolites to influence nonallergic inflammatory respiratory effects, such as increased concentrations of leukocytes and pro‐inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 37, 38.

### Procedures to assist health care providers to determine when home assessments for potential mold exposure are warranted [^112TfmdE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Drawing evidence from epidemiology and exposure assessment studies and recommendations from expert practice, we describe a process to guide health care providers helping their patients who present with symptoms that might be associated with living in damp housing. We present the procedures in the form of a guided 2-part interview. The first part has 5 questions that triage the patient toward a more detailed questionnaire that reflects features of housing conditions known to be reliably associated with exposures to mold and dampness contaminants. We chose the questions based on the conditions associated with moisture problems in homes across the United States and Canada. The goal is to facilitate the clinician's effort to help patients reduce exposure to environmental triggers that elicit symptoms to better manage their disease.

### Clinical use of immunoassays in assessing exposure to fungi and potential health effects related to fungal exposure [^116HCkbg]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and summarize current evidence regarding the proper role of immunoassays in clinical assessments of exposure to fungi and health effects related to fungal exposure.

Data Sources

We reviewed relevant scientific investigations and previously published reviews concerning this topic.

Study Selection

The authors' clinical, laboratory, and public health experiences were used to evaluate relevant data for scientific merit.

Results

Testing to determine the presence of IgE to specific fungi may be a useful component of a complete clinical evaluation in the diagnosis of illnesses that can be caused by immediate hypersensitivity such as allergic rhinitis and asthma. Detection of IgG to specific fungi has been used as a marker of exposure to agents that may cause illnesses such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis. However, the ubiquitous nature of many fungi and the lack of specificity of fungal antigens limit the usefulness of these types of tests in the evaluation of potential building-related illness and fungal exposure. Specific serologic tests (such as tests for cryptococcal antigen, coccidioidal antibody, and Histoplasma antigen) have been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of some fungal infections, but these are the exception not the rule.

Conclusions

There is currently not enough scientific evidence to support the routine clinical use of immunoassays as a primary means of assessing environmental fungal exposure or health effects related to fungal exposure. Health care providers who care for persons expressing concerns about the relationship of symptoms to potential exposure to fungi are advised to use immunoassay results with care and only as an adjunct to a comprehensive approach to patient care.

### Are indoor molds causing a new disease? [^115Nu4am]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Three mechanisms for disease caused by mold-infection, allergy, and toxicity-are established and well recognized by clinicians. In each case the corresponding diseases are specific to a particular fungus. The mechanisms involved include a recognized inflammatory pathology that leads to objective clinical evidence of disease. Recent widespread litigation has arisen out of an unproved assertion that exposure to indoor molds causes an ill-defined illness. This illness is characterized by the absence of objective evidence of disease and by the lack of a defined pathology. There is usually no specificity for the involved fungus purported to cause the illness. Those publications that claim such an illness are reviewed. They are found to lack scientific validity, often on the basis of faulty methodology and insufficient information. There is no coherent clinical description for the presumed illness. Recommendations are offered for published reports and studies to address this problem.

### Fungi: toxic killers or unavoidable nuisances? [^117KDxMA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

This discussion is focused on the many roles of fungi in human health, and also to put the mycotoxin literature into perspective.

Data Sources

Data are derived from the literature referenced in PubMed from the National Library of Medicine, earlier references in the authors' reprint collection, and ongoing research. Studies for review were either selected from the peer-reviewed literature or from standard texts that are well recognized in the field.

Results

The review yielded many studies of the role of fungi in allergic disease, but none that systematically documented such a role for mycotoxins or fungal volatiles. Many case studies were found, but none of these unequivocally document a cause/effect relationship between mycotoxin exposure by inhalation and human disease in residential, school, or office settings.

Conclusions

The review led to the conclusion that that the primary result from fungal exposure is allergic disease, and that the evidence for inhalation disease resulting from mycotoxin exposure in residential and office settings is extremely weak.

### Health problems… [^114BnG9s]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance Research has found that people who spend time in damp buildings report health problems including respiratory symptoms and infections, developing or worsening asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis or hay fever, and eczema. Allergies Allergies or allergic responses to mold are common. In mold-allergic individuals, inhaling or touching mold may cause an allergic response, such as the following:

- Sneezing
- Nasal stuffiness or runny nose
- Red, itchy, or watery eyes
- Skin rash Mold can also cause irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, skin, or lungs even in people who are not allergic to mold. Asthma Asthma is a lung disease that affects the airways in the lungs. Airways can become inflamed and narrowed at times, making it harder for air to flow out of the lungs when breathing out. People with asthma may have one or more of the following symptoms:

- Coughing
- Wheezing
- Chest tightness
- Shortness of breath.

Asthma is associated with exposure to irritants, allergens, and physical conditions called triggers. Many asthma triggers can be in the workplace. Research shows evidence of an association between damp indoor spaces and asthma symptoms in individuals with pre-existing asthma. This means exposure to molds in workplaces can make pre-existing asthma worse. There is also evidence of an association between damp indoor spaces and new-onset asthma. Symptoms of work-related asthma tend to get better when away from work. However, in some cases, symptoms do not improve until an extended time away from the exposure or trigger. Workers who are already sensitized to mold may even respond to a trace amount of mold. Asthma takes ongoing monitoring and management to keep it under control. It is important for affected individuals to have a comprehensive asthma treatment plan and regular follow-up with their healthcare providers.
- Shortness of breath
- Cough
- Muscle aches
- Chills
- Fever
- Night sweats
- Extreme fatigue
- Weight loss Symptoms may improve after a few hours or days when away from the substance or allergen causing illness. Likewise, hypersensitivity pneumonitis may be work-related if a worker's symptoms and medical tests improve during time away from work and worsen when returning to work. With continued exposure, persistent lung inflammation over time could lead to permanent lung damage.

### A large case-series of successful treatment of patients exposed to mold and mycotoxin [^116rdNnw]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The goal of this study was to present the results of treatment of 100 chemically sensitive and chronically mold-exposed patients, who continued to be disabled even after decontamination of their houses or work places or they were physically removed from their sources of mold.

Methods

Molds were identified, serum anti-mold immunoglobulin G antibodies were measured, patients were skin-tested, immunologic abnormalities were recorded, and objective neurologic tests were performed in a subset of patients.

Findings

Patient sensitivities and exposures were confirmed by measuring serum immunoglobulin G anti-mold antibodies, intradermal skin testing, and trichothecene toxin breakdown products in the urine. Patients were positive (44%-98%) for individual molds. Abnormalities in T and B cells were found in > 80% of patients. Respiratory signs were present in 64% of all patients, and physical signs and symptoms of neurologic dysfunction were present in 70%. Objective autonomic nervous system test results were abnormal in almost 100% of patients tested. Objective neuropsychological evaluations were conducted in 46 of the patients who exhibited symptoms of neurologic impairment and showed typical abnormalities in short-term memory, executive function/judgment, concentration, and hand/eye coordination. Patients (N = 100) with documented mold exposure were divided into 3 groups: (1) those who improved easily, with mold avoidance and antigen injections; (2) those who improved after desensitization to their mold antigens plus additional mycotoxin antigens; and (3) those who had their regular mold antigens, additional mycotoxin antigens, along with regimens that included sauna, oxygen therapy, and nutrients. Approximately 85% of all patients cleared completely; 14% had partial improvement, and 1% remained unchanged.

Implications

Exposure to molds has been increasingly recognized as a major reason for patients presenting with multiple organ symptoms that could not otherwise be explained. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment could be very successful.

### Pulmonary and sinus fungal diseases in non-immunocompromised patients [^113qUPTb]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

The human respiratory tract is exposed daily to airborne fungi, fungal enzymes, and secondary metabolites. The endemic fungi Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides spp, Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and occasionally Aspergillus fumigatus, are primary pulmonary pathogens of otherwise healthy people. Such infections resolve in most people, and only a few infections lead to disease. However, many fungi are directly allergenic by colonising the respiratory tract or indirectly through contact with cell wall constituents and proteases, causing or exacerbating allergic disease. Increasing evidence implicates high indoor fungal exposures as a precipitant of asthma in children and in worsening asthma symptoms. Lung or airways infection by endemic fungi or aspergillus can be diagnosed with respiratory sample culture or serum IgG testing. Sputum, induced sputum, or bronchial specimens are all suitable specimens for detecting fungi; microscopy, fungal culture, galactomannan antigen, and aspergillus PCR are useful tests. Antifungal treatment is indicated in almost all patients with chronic cavitary pulmonary infections, chronic invasive and granulomatous rhinosinusitis, and aspergillus bronchitis. Most patients with fungal asthma benefit from antifungal therapy. Adverse reactions to oral azoles, drug interactions, and azole resistance in Aspergillus spp limit therapy. Environmental exposures, genetic factors, and structural pulmonary risk factors probably underlie disease but are poorly understood.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^111dgWDU]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergy diagnostic testing — fungi clinical significance and categorization are constrained by confounders and sampling limits; Summary Statement 159 states that the clinical significance of a single fungus test reagent may be difficult to ascertain because of sampling method, culture conditions, nonculturable species, allergenic differences between spores and hyphae, and preferential ecologic niches (A), and Summary Statement 160 notes that for clinical purposes molds are often characterized as outdoors (Alternaria and Cladosporium), indoors (Aspergillus and Penicillium), or both (Alternaria, Aspergillus, and Penicillium) (B). Traditional gravity or Rotorod air sampling equipment does not collect fungal spores as efficiently as pollens, and many counting stations have not differentiated fungal forms. Although clinicians sense that fungi contribute to respiratory allergy with dark-spored asexual forms especially implicated, apart from the association of spore blooms with thunderstorms there is little evidence linking exposure to well-defined single agents with isolated or recurring morbidity.

### Associations of aeroallergen testing with reduced oral corticosteroid bursts among adults with asthma [^114ACWgp]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic disease in adults and a major public health burden in the United States. A key component of asthma care is to reduce symptoms and exacerbations by addressing modifiable risk factors, including aeroallergen exposure in sensitized patients. Pollens, dust mite, cat, dog, and molds are common allergens and important asthma triggers. Addressing allergic asthma triggers is beneficial in adults with asthma; most are sensitized to aeroallergens, and aeroallergen exposure is nearly universal in US homes. In studies of adults with asthma, aeroallergen testing with allergen avoidance education improved patients' awareness of perceived asthma triggers and lung functionand complemented asthma self-management. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–led online focus groups of people with asthma that explored patients' values and priorities related to their asthma found that most patients took steps to mitigate indoor allergen exposure. Thus, testing aligns with patients' strategies to reduce asthma symptoms.

### Mold sensitization is common amongst patients with severe asthma requiring multiple hospital admissions [^1112xbSY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

A key question is whether severe asthma is actually caused by sensitivity to molds or is simply associated with it. In any case, mold sensitivity will certainly not be the only cause of severe attacks of asthma; upper respiratory tract virus infections and some drugs being two of other well documented causes. The greater degree of mold sensitization in the severe asthma group could simply reflect an extreme example of the generalized increase in atopy amongst this group. However, we believe that mold allergy may be responsible for severe asthma attacks for several reasons.

First, the temporal relationship between high environmental spore counts and asthmatic attacks is strong. Airborne spore levels may be up to 1000 times higher than pollen levels. The data of Targonski and colleagues provide strong evidence that asthma deaths in Chicago are more likely to occur on days when local mold spore counts are high. High mold spore counts have been associated with asthma admissions in New Orleans (adults) and in Derby, UK (adults and children). Asthma symptoms are increased in California and Pennsylvania on days when mold spore counts are high. The young patients of O'Hollaren and colleagues who were Alternaria -sensitive had their near-fatal asthma episodes in summer and early fall when mold spore levels would be expected to be high.

### Mold sensitization is common amongst patients with severe asthma requiring multiple hospital admissions [^1115azJv]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Most asthma patients have mild symptoms which are well controlled with anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator therapy but a minority of asthma patients have severe airway inflammation and airflow obstruction requiring multiple hospital admissions. The reasons for these differences in asthma severity are complex and not fully understood. At least two thirds of asthmatic patients are atopic with skin reactivity to common allergens. It has also been reported that individuals with severe ("brittle") asthma may have a greater degree of atopy than other asthmatic patients. Skin reactivity to fungal allergens such as Alternaria species has been reported to be especially common in patients with life-threatening asthma. Asthma deaths, hospital admissions, respiratory symptoms, and Peak Expiratory Flow rates can be adversely affected by high fungal spore concentrations in outdoor air. Mold sensitivity has been associated with increased asthma severity and intensive care admissions in adults and with increased bronchial reactivity in children.

Indoor mold exposure might also contribute to asthma severity. Many patients believe that their asthma is aggravated by damp housing, especially if there is visible mold growth. It has been reported that asthma patients are more likely than control patients to live in a damp dwelling and their asthma severity was correlated to the degree of dampness and mold growth in their home (measured by a building surveyor). It is also known that asthma deaths in young adults in England and Wales are commonest in the months of July, August and September which coincides with peak levels of mold spores in the outdoor air in the UK.

These studies prompted us to undertake a study of asthmatic patients in Salford in Greater Manchester (North-West England) to assess whether atopy in general and mold sensitization in particular was associated with increased asthma severity. There are few agreed definitions of severe asthma so we used hospital admissions and treatment category (according to British Thoracic Society Asthma Guidelines) as surrogate markers for asthma severity.
