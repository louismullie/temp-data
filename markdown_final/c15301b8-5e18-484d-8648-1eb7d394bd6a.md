## Question

GLP-1 approved for heart failure without diabetes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether GLP-1 receptor agonists are approved for heart failure in patients without diabetes, and if so, which agents and indications are supported by evidence and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and whether any GLP-1 RA carries a heart failure indication irrespective of diabetes. Then, I should verify the pivotal trials in HFpEF and whether they included people without diabetes. Next, I will review guideline positions and labeling language to distinguish symptomatic benefit from hard outcomes. After that, I need to check safety signals in HFrEF and how that affects use. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, phenotype-specific recommendation and note limitations and next steps in evidence generation.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory landscape, because I need to ensure I'm not over-claiming an indication. Currently, no GLP-1 receptor agonist has a regulatory approval specifically for the treatment of heart failure independent of diabetes, and the cardiovascular approvals for semaglutide and liraglutide are anchored in type 2 diabetes populations with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk, not in HF per se, so there is no FDA-labeled HF indication for GLP-1 RAs at this time [^113AeJy4] [^112JaoHt].

> Wait, let me verify the pivotal HFpEF data before drawing conclusions. The STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpEF DM programs evaluated semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly in patients with HFpEF and obesity; importantly, STEP-HFpEF excluded diabetes, so the symptomatic and functional benefits observed there directly inform use in non-diabetic HFpEF, showing large improvements in KCCQ clinical summary score and body weight and favorable effects on 6-minute walk distance and a hierarchical composite endpoint, with pooled analyses confirming consistency across subgroups including those with and without diabetes [^1162Aj3z].

> Hold on, I should also check whether outcomes extend beyond symptoms. In SELECT, a large outcomes trial in people with overweight/obesity and established ASCVD, semaglutide reduced MACE and showed consistent benefits in prespecified analyses of participants with and without heart failure, including both HFpEF and HFrEF subgroups, supporting cardiovascular risk reduction in obesity-related phenotypes even when HF is present, though this is not a labeled HF indication [^115MnZZU].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. The 2025 ADA Standards recommend GLP-1 RAs with demonstrated benefit for adults with T2D, obesity, and symptomatic HFpEF to reduce HF-related symptoms, physical limitations, and exercise function, reflecting the STEP-HFpEF data and emphasizing symptomatic rather than mortality or HF-hospitalization labeling claims, while heart failure guidelines continue to prioritize SGLT2 inhibitors for HF outcomes across EF phenotypes irrespective of diabetes status [^112fg2qA] [^115nCEEW] [^113NhWam].

> I need to check safety signals in HFrEF before suggesting any off-label use. Trials and mechanistic studies in HFrEF show increased heart rate with liraglutide and signals of more serious cardiac adverse events or arrhythmias in some analyses, and device-based observational data suggest higher heart rate and more ventricular arrhythmia therapies with GLP-1 RA use in HFrEF, so caution is warranted and routine use in HFrEF without diabetes is not supported pending definitive trials [^1126rkXt] [^116kAGGx] [^1136BwkN] [^112qstfc].

> Let me consider the clinical phenotypes carefully. For HFpEF with obesity and without diabetes, semaglutide has robust randomized evidence of symptom and functional improvement and is reasonable to consider for symptom relief and weight management, recognizing this is not a regulatory HF indication and that SGLT2 inhibitors remain foundational for HF outcomes; for HFrEF, even in obesity, the balance of evidence does not support routine GLP-1 RA use outside of research settings due to physiologic and clinical safety concerns and lack of dedicated outcomes data [^1162Aj3z] [^115nCEEW].

> But wait, what if the question is about preventing HF or improving atherosclerotic outcomes rather than treating established HF. GLP-1 RAs reduce MACE in T2D and in SELECT reduced events in people with obesity and ASCVD, including those with HF history, so in non-diabetic patients at high ASCVD risk, semaglutide may reduce cardiovascular events, but that is distinct from an HF treatment indication and should not be conflated with HF therapy goals [^115MnZZU] [^113AeJy4].

> I should double-check the bottom line to avoid ambiguity. GLP-1 receptor agonists are not currently approved for heart failure treatment irrespective of diabetes status; however, in non-diabetic HFpEF with obesity, semaglutide has high-quality randomized evidence for meaningful improvements in symptoms, function, and weight, and may be used for these purposes in shared decision-making, while in HFrEF or in HFpEF without obesity, evidence is insufficient or raises safety concerns and GLP-1 RAs should not be considered standard therapy pending further trials [^1162Aj3z] [^115nCEEW].

---

GLP-1 receptor agonists are **not currently approved** for heart failure in patients without diabetes. However, **emerging evidence** shows semaglutide improves symptoms, function, and reduces HF events in obesity-related HFpEF, including in non-diabetic patients [^1162Aj3z] [^114GP9vx]. For HFrEF, data are limited and mixed, with no clear benefit and potential harm signals; thus, GLP-1 RAs are **not recommended** for HFrEF outside trials. Guidelines prioritize SGLT2 inhibitors for HF, and GLP-1 RAs should be considered only for obesity-related HFpEF or ASCVD risk reduction, not as primary HF therapy.

---

## Current regulatory status

Currently, **no GLP-1 RA has regulatory approval** for HF in patients without diabetes [^notfound]. Their approved cardiovascular indications are limited to reducing MACE in T2DM with established ASCVD or high risk [^113AeJy4].

---

## Clinical evidence in heart failure without diabetes

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)

In obesity-related HFpEF, **STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpEF DM** showed semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly improved KCCQ scores, reduced body weight, and lowered HF events; pooled analysis found a 41% reduction in HF hospitalization or urgent care and a 28% reduction in CV death or HF events, including in non-diabetic participants [^1162Aj3z]. The **SELECT trial** also reported a 20% MACE reduction with semaglutide in obesity without diabetes, including patients with HF, supporting potential benefit in obesity-related HFpEF [^115MnZZU].

---

### Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)

Evidence in HFrEF without diabetes is limited and mixed. The **FIGHT and LIVE trials** of liraglutide in HFrEF (with/without diabetes) showed no benefit and more serious cardiac adverse events, including increased heart rate and arrhythmias, raising safety concerns [^116kAGGx] [^1126rkXt]. A recent meta-analysis suggests GLP-1 RAs may reduce HF hospitalization in obesity and T2DM, but **effects in HFrEF are uncertain**, with a non-significant increase in HF hospitalization in HFrEF subgroups [^115cWP7Z].

---

## Mechanistic considerations

GLP-1 RAs may benefit HFpEF via weight loss, reduced inflammation, improved endothelial function, and lower blood pressure, but in HFrEF, **heart rate increases and sympathetic activation** may worsen outcomes, especially in advanced disease [^1162Aj3z] [^1136BwkN].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Guidelines **do not recommend GLP-1 RAs** for HF without diabetes:

- **ADA 2025**: Recommends GLP-1 RAs for T2DM with obesity and symptomatic HFpEF to improve symptoms and function, not for HF without diabetes [^112fg2qA].
- **ACC/AHA 2023**: Recommends SGLT2 inhibitors for HFpEF regardless of diabetes; GLP-1 RAs are not recommended for HF without diabetes [^notfound].
- **ESC 2023**: Recommends GLP-1 RAs for T2DM with ASCVD to reduce CV events, not for HF without diabetes [^116mn7Tu].

---

## Safety considerations

GLP-1 RAs are generally well tolerated, but **in HFrEF**, increased heart rate, arrhythmias, and serious cardiac adverse events have been observed, warranting caution and close monitoring [^1126rkXt] [^1136BwkN].

---

## Ongoing and future research

Ongoing trials (e.g. SUMMIT) will clarify GLP-1 RA effects in obesity-related HFpEF without diabetes. Further studies are needed in HFrEF to define safety and efficacy before any approval or guideline endorsement.

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **HFpEF without diabetes**: Consider GLP-1 RAs (e.g. semaglutide) in obesity-related HFpEF for symptom relief and functional improvement, recognizing the evidence base is growing but not yet guideline-endorsed.
- **HFrEF without diabetes**: GLP-1 RAs are not recommended due to limited and mixed evidence; prioritize guideline-directed therapy and SGLT2 inhibitors.
- **General HF care**: SGLT2 inhibitors remain first-line for HF regardless of diabetes status; GLP-1 RAs should not replace them.

---

GLP-1 RAs are **not approved for HF without diabetes**, but semaglutide shows promise in obesity-related HFpEF, improving symptoms and reducing HF events. They are **not recommended for HFrEF** outside trials due to safety concerns. Clinicians should prioritize SGLT2 inhibitors and reserve GLP-1 RAs for select obesity-related HFpEF cases or ASCVD risk reduction.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists across the spectrum of heart failure [^116f5mMj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been used to reduce body weight in overweight or people with obesity and to improve glycemic control and cardiovascular outcomes among people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and a high cardiovascular risk. However, the effects of GLP-1 RAs may be modified by the presence of heart failure (HF). In this review, we summarize the evidence for the use of GLP-1 RA across a patient's risk with a particular focus on HF. After a careful review of the literature, we challenge the current views about the use of GLP-1 RAs and suggest performing active HF screening (with directed clinical history, physical examination, an echocardiogram, and natriuretic peptides) before initiating a GLP-1 RA. After HF screening, we suggest GLP-1 RA treatment decisions as follows: (1) in people with T2D without HF, GLP-1 RAs should be used for reducing the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, with a possible effect to reduce the risk of HF hospitalizations; (2) in patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction, GLP-1 RAs do not reduce HF hospitalizations but may reduce atherosclerotic events, and their use may be considered in an individualized manner; and (3) in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, the use of GLP-1 RAs warrants caution due to potential risk of worsening HF events and arrhythmias, pending risk-benefit data from further studies.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes with and without chronic heart failure: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled outcome trials [^1133gGup]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) reduce atherosclerotic events in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and a high cardiovascular risk. The effect of GLP1-RA to reduce heart failure (HF) has been inconsistent across T2D trials, and individual trials were underpowered to assess the effect of GLP1-RA according to HF history. In this meta-analysis we aim to assess the effect of GLP1-RA in patients with and without HF history in stable ambulatory patients with T2D.

Methods

Random-effects meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were extracted from the treatment effect estimates of HF subgroup analyses reported in each individual study. The primary outcome was a composite of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death.

Results

In total, 54092 patients with T2D from seven randomized controlled trials were included, of whom 8460 (16%) had HF history. Compared with placebo, GLP1-RA did not reduce the composite of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death in patients with HF history: HR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.84–1.08, but reduced this outcome in patients without HF history: HR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.76–0.92. GLP1-RA did not reduce all-cause death in patients with HF history: HR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.86–1.11, but reduced mortality in patients without HF history: HR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.79–0.92. GLP1-RA reduced atherosclerotic events regardless of HF history: HR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.75–0.97 with HF, and HR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.83–0.93 without HF.

Conclusions

Treatment with GLP1-RA did not reduce HF hospitalizations and mortality in patients with concomitant T2D and HF, but may prevent new-onset HF and mortality in patients with T2D without HF. The reduction of atherosclerotic events with GLP1-RA was not influenced by HF history status.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and heart failure: the need for further evidence generation and practice guidelines optimization [^111FWCmZ]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

With worsening epidemiological trends for both the incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure (HF) worldwide, it is critical to implement optimal prevention and treatment strategies for patients with these comorbidities, either alone or concomitantly. Several guidelines and consensus statements have recommended glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors as add-ons to lifestyle interventions with or without metformin in those at high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. However, these recommendations are either silent about HF or fail to differentiate between the prevention of HF in those at risk versus the treatment of individuals with manifest HF. Furthermore, these documents do not differentiate among those with different HF phenotypes. This distinction, even though important, may not be critical for sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors in view of the consistent data for benefit for both atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease- and HF-related outcomes that have emerged from the regulatory-mandated cardiovascular outcome trials for all sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors and the recent DAPA-HF trial (Dapagliflozin in Patients with Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction)demonstrating the benefit of dapagliflozin on HF-related outcomes in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction with or without T2DM. However, the distinction may be crucial for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and other antihyperglycemic agents. Indeed, in several of the new statements, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are suggested treatment not only for patients with T2DM and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but also in those with manifest HF, despite a lack of evidence for the latter recommendation. Although glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists may be appropriate to use in patients at risk for HF, mechanistic insights and observations from randomized trials suggest no clear benefit on HF-related outcomes and even uncertainty regarding the safety in those with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Conversely, theoretical rationales suggest that these agents may benefit patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction. Considering that millions of patients with T2DM have HF, these concerns have public health implications that necessitate the thoughtful use of these therapies. Achieving this aim will require dedicated trials with these drugs in both patients who have HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction with T2DM to assess their efficacy, safety, and risk-benefit profile.

GLP-1 receptor agonists — cardiovascular outcomes: A 2021 comprehensive meta-analysis of 8 major GLP-1 RA cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs), comprising more than 60 000 participants, showed these agents reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 14% (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80–0.93; P < .0001), reduce death from any cause by 12% (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.94; p = 0.0001), and produce a modest but significant decrease in hospitalization for heart failure (HF) (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82–0.98; p = 0.013); importantly, these benefits were consistent in persons with or without established ASCVD and did not differ by GLP-1 RA structural homology, baseline A1C, or background antihyperglycemic therapy.

### Efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114GP9vx]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for over half of cases of HF, with obesity playing a key role. Residual risk remains high despite available therapies. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have shown potential cardiometabolic benefits, but their role in HFpEF remains unclear.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating GLP-1RAs in HFpEF were conducted. Studies evaluating GLP-1RA in combination with glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) were also included. The analyzed outcomes included cardiovascular (CV) death, worsening HF events and their composite. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled by using a random-effects model.

Results

Six randomized controlled trials involving 8788 patients were included. GLP-1RAs significantly reduced the composite outcome of CV death or worsening HF events (HR: 0.68 [0.51–0.89]; P = 0.006, I² = 47%) as well as worsening HF events alone (HR: 0.56 [0.38–0.82]; P = 0.003, I² = 51%). No significant reduction was observed for CV death alone (HR: 0.86 [0.67–1.12]; P = 0.27, I² = 0%).

Conclusion

GLP-1RAs reduce worsening HF events and the composite of CV death or worsening HF in HFpEF, particularly in patients with obesity or diabetes. These findings support their role as a promising therapy requiring further HFpEF-focused trials.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with and without diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^1135BdQJ]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

We considered the studies to be eligible based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) randomized‐controlled trials; (2) studies assessed MACEs; (3) studies compared an experimental group receiving an agent belonging to GLP‐1 agonists irrespective of the dosing regimens and route of administration; (4) studies included patients with diabetes or other conditions such as overweight/obesity and heart failure; and (5) studies with a minimum trial duration of 52 weeks (1 year). Studies were excluded if (1) outcomes compared between groups were not among cardiovascular‐related outcomes; (2) conference abstracts and lab studies; (3) the comparator arm received any active treatment including insulin, oral hypoglycemic medications, and any other agent belonging to the group of GLP‐1 agonists that the intervention arm was not receiving; (4) post hoc analysis of randomized trials; and (5) studies on glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP‐1 dual agonists.

The primary outcome of the present study was set as MACE at the latest available follow‐up. Other outcomes of interest included cardiovascular and all‐cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke/transient ischemic attack, and hospitalization for heart failure.

2.2 Data Extraction and Quality Appraisal

The data required for quantitative synthesis were extracted from the text, figures, and tables of the included trials. General and specific data were extracted from each article into pre‐specified spreadsheets. The general characteristics included trial name, identification number, the details of the intervention provided to the experimental group, the comorbidity of the studied population, and the duration of the longest follow‐up. The data related to the outcomes included the sample size of the intervention and comparator groups and the event rates that occurred in each of the groups.

For quality appraisal, the randomized studies included in this meta‐analysis were subjected to thorough assessment using the revised version of the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool for quality appraisal of randomized trials (RoB 2). This tool assesses the potential risk of bias arising from five main domains comprising randomization, deviation from the planned intervention, missing outcome data, method of measuring the endpoints of interest, and selection of the reported outcomes. Each study was assigned an overall risk of bias based on the specified criteria by two of the reviewers (J.K. and A.H.). Any disagreement was resolved by discussion and consensus. Plots visualizing the risk of bias were constructed using the robvis online tool.

### Effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors on cardiac structure and function: a narrative review of clinical evidence [^116QqiuF]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with an increased early incidence and severity of heart failure (HF). At a population level, the age-adjusted rate for first hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) in patients with T2D ranges from 4.5 to 9.2 per 1000 person-years, depending on the degree of glycemic control, which is 2–4 times higher than the general population. In real-life care, the age-adjusted incidence of any HHF in T2D is 31 per 1000 person-years, i.e. 2.5-fold (95% CI 2.3–2.7) higher than in well-matched subjects without T2D. Irrespective of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) value — either preserved (HFpEF: LVEF > 50%), mildly reduced (HFmrEF: LVEF 40–50%), or reduced (HFrEF: LVEF < 40%) — the presence of T2D in chronic HF is associated with a worse prognosis, namely, increased rates of all cause death (11.6 vs. 7.3%/yr), cardiovascular death (9.4 vs. 5.8%/y), all cause hospitalization (47.3 vs. 32.7%/yr), and HHF (13.9 vs. 7.8%/yr). This appears to be somewhat greater in patients with HFpEF (adjusted HHR OR: 2.04 [1.68–2.47]) than in those with HFrEF (adjusted OR: 1.64 [1.44–1.86]).

The observation of increased HF with thiazolidinediones prompted their withdrawal from the market, and boosted cardiovascular safety trials of newer agents, which led, quite unexpectedly, to the discovery of unprecedented cardiovascular benefits of new drugs (and even old ones), especially for patients with HF. Two new classes of drugs might change the natural trajectory of the "lethal synergy" of T2D and HF, namely, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1Ra) and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i). While both classes show comparable benefits on composite cardiovascular endpoints, their effect on the cardiovascular system and their impact on HF-related events appear rather different, and a direct comparison of their efficacy on cardiac structure and function is currently lacking, possibly leaving decision-making in clinical practice difficult.

### Effects of liraglutide on cardiovascular Outcomes in patients with diabetes with or without heart Failure [^114hkHa8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

More data regarding effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and heart failure (HF) are required.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of liraglutide on cardiovascular events and mortality in LEADER (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results) participants, by HF history.

Methods

In the multinational, double-blind, randomized LEADER trial, 9,340 patients with T2D and high cardiovascular risk were assigned 1:1 to liraglutide (1.8 mg daily or maximum tolerated dose up to 1.8 mg daily) or placebo plus standard care, and followed for 3.5 to 5 years. New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV HF was an exclusion criterion. The primary composite major adverse cardiovascular events outcome was time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Post hoc Cox regression analyses of outcomes by baseline HF history were conducted.

Results

At baseline, 18% of patients had a history of NYHA functional class I to III HF (liraglutide: n = 835 of 4,668; placebo: n = 832 of 4,672). Effects of liraglutide versus placebo on major adverse cardiovascular events were consistent in patients with (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.81 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65 to 1.02]) and without (HR: 0.88 [95% CI: 0.78 to 1.00]) a history of HF (p interaction = 0.53). In both subgroups, fewer deaths were observed with liraglutide (HR: 0.89 [95% CI: 0.70 to 1.14] with HF; HR: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.70 to 0.97] without HF; p interaction = 0.63) versus placebo. No increased risk of HF hospitalization was observed with liraglutide, regardless of HF history (HR: 0.98 [95% CI: 0.75 to 1.28] with HF; HR: 0.78 [95% CI: 0.61 to 1.00] without HF; p interaction = 0.22). Effects of liraglutide on the composite of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death were consistent in patients with (HR: 0.92 [95% CI: 0.74 to 1.15]) and without (HR: 0.77 [95% CI: 0.65 to 0.91]) a history of HF (p interaction = 0.19).

Conclusions

Based on these findings, liraglutide should be considered suitable for patients with T2D with or without a history of NYHA functional class I to III HF. (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results [LEADER]; NCT01179048).

### Effect of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, on left ventricular function in stable chronic heart failure patients with and without diabetes (LIVE)-a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^1126rkXt]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine the effect of the glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue liraglutide on left ventricular function in chronic heart failure patients with and without type 2 diabetes.

Methods and Results

LIVE was an investigator-initiated, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicentre trial. Patients (n = 241) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 45%) were recruited (February 2012 to August 2015). Patients were clinically stable and on optimal heart failure treatment. Intervention was liraglutide 1.8mg once daily or matching placebo for 24weeks. The LVEF was similar at baseline in the liraglutide and the placebo group (33.7 ± 7.6% vs. 35.4 ± 9.4%). Change in LVEF did not differ between the liraglutide and the placebo group; mean difference (95% confidence interval) was -0.8% (-2.1, 0.5; P = 0.24). Heart rate increased with liraglutide [mean difference: 7b.p.m. (5, 9), P < 0.0001]. Serious cardiac events were seen in 12 (10%) patients treated with liraglutide compared with 3 (3%) patients in the placebo group (P = 0.04).

Conclusion

Liraglutide did not affect left ventricular systolic function compared with placebo in stable chronic heart failure patients with and without diabetes. Treatment with liraglutide was associated with an increase in heart rate and more serious cardiac adverse events, and this raises some concern with respect to the use of liraglutide in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular function. More data on the safety of liraglutide in different subgroups of heart failure patients are needed.

### European Society of Cardiology / heart failure association position paper on the role and safety of new glucose-lowering drugs in patients with heart failure [^114KPK7n]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is common in patients with heart failure (HF) and associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Significant advances have recently occurred in the treatment of T2DM, with evidence of several new glucose-lowering medications showing either neutral or beneficial cardiovascular effects. However, some of these agents have safety characteristics with strong practical implications in HF [i.e. dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors]. Regarding safety of DPP-4 inhibitors, saxagliptin is not recommended in HF because of a greater risk of HF hospitalisation. There is no compelling evidence of excess HF risk with the other DPP-4 inhibitors. GLP-1 RAs have an overall neutral effect on HF outcomes. However, a signal of harm suggested in two small trials of liraglutide in patients with reduced ejection fraction indicates that their role remains to be defined in established HF. SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin) have shown a consistent reduction in the risk of HF hospitalisation regardless of baseline cardiovascular risk or history of HF. Accordingly, SGLT-2 inhibitors could be recommended to prevent HF hospitalisation in patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease or with multiple risk factors. The recently completed trial with dapagliflozin has shown a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and HF events in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, with or without T2DM. Several ongoing trials will assess whether the results observed with dapagliflozin could be extended to other SGLT-2 inhibitors in the treatment of HF, with either preserved or reduced ejection fraction, regardless of the presence of T2DM. This position paper aims to summarise relevant clinical trial evidence concerning the role and safety of new glucose-lowering therapies in patients with HF.

Discussions and implication of pathway — type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction states that sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have been shown to directly improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, with randomized trials proving reductions in acute myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and CV death in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D); SGLT2 inhibitors also have heart failure (HF) and renal benefits that appear independent of HbA1c, even in patients without T2D. CV specialists "now need to incorporate these agents", and this ECDP provides a practical guide for initiation and monitoring that "should be used in concert with established risk factor modification guidelines" (including lipids, blood pressure, and antiplatelet therapy) and "applied in the context of guideline-directed diabetes care". The document "should complement, rather than supersede, good clinical judgement", emphasizes that achieving goals "requires a team-based approach", and notes that, if used appropriately, these therapies "should significantly reduce CV morbidity and mortality", while also stating that evidence is still emerging and algorithms may change as new data appear, with the overarching goal of improved CV outcomes remaining consistent.

### Dulaglutide and cardiovascular and heart failure outcomes in patients with and without heart failure: a post-hoc analysis from the REWIND randomized trial [^115dzZZi]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

People with diabetes are at high risk for cardiovascular events including heart failure (HF). We examined the effect of the glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist dulaglutide on incident HF events and other cardiovascular outcomes in those with or without prior HF in the randomized placebo-controlled Researching Cardiovascular Events with a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND) trial.

Methods and Results

The REWIND major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) outcome was the first occurrence of a composite endpoint of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes (including unknown causes). In this post-hoc analysis, a HF event was defined as an adjudication-confirmed hospitalization or urgent evaluation for HF. Of the 9901 participants studied over a median follow-up of 5.4years, 213/4949 (4.3%) randomly assigned to dulaglutide and 226/4952 (4.6%) participants assigned to placebo experienced a HF event (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77–1.12; p = 0.456). In the 853 (8.6%) participants with HF at baseline, there was no change in either MACE or HF events with dulaglutide as compared to participants without HF (p = 0.44 and 0.19 for interaction, respectively). Combined cardiovascular death and HF events were marginally reduced with dulaglutide compared to placebo (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78–1.00; p = 0.050) but unchanged in patients with and without HF at baseline (p = 0.31).

Conclusions

Dulaglutide was not associated with a reduction in HF events in patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of baseline HF status over 5.4years of follow-up.

### A review of cardiovascular outcomes trials of glucose-lowering therapies and their effects on heart failure outcomes [^112yJfpn]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus has long been recognized as a major risk factor for adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events; however, recent data indicate that heart failure is now emerging as the most common and morbid cardiovascular complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus. When heart failure develops in patients with type 2 diabetes, prognosis is ominous, highlighting the need for glucose-lowering therapies that can prevent heart failure, improve outcomes, or both. Prior to 2008, there was a paucity of randomized controlled trials evaluating long-term cardiovascular outcomes with glucose-lowering therapies. This changed after guidance on the assessment of novel glucose-lowering agents was issued by both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. Since then, significant progress has been made as a result of large cardiovascular outcomes trials. Though randomized controlled trials on insulin, sulfonylureas, and metformin are still limited, cardiovascular outcomes trials on newer glucose-lowering agents have included hundreds of thousands of patients with multiple years of follow-up. The increased risk of thiazolidinediones on heart failure had been well theorized and is now established; however, the increase in heart failure hospitalization with certain dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors was unexpected. The reasons for discrepancies with regard to heart failure risk with different dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors remain unclear, and further mechanistic studies are ongoing. The role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists among patients with heart failure also remains unclear, and their effects may differ in patients with and without established heart failure, particularly those with decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

### GLP-1 receptor agonist in nonobese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111EZQji]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) promote weight loss and improve heart failure-related symptoms, quality of life, and functional capacity in patients with obesity and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, their clinical effectiveness in nonobese patients with diabetes and HFpEF is understudied.

Methods

The TriNetX research network was used to identify adult patients (≥ 18 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45%), elevated brain natriuretic peptide (≥ 150 pg/mL) or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide(≥ 450 pg/mL) and a body mass index (BMI) < 30 kg/m² on or before August 31, 2022. Patients were divided into two groups based on GLP-1RA use. After propensity score matching, Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) were used to compare outcomes over a 12-month follow-up period.

Results

The study included 84,990 patients (n = 42,495 per group, mean age 64 years, 49% females, 65% white). Patients on GLP-1RAs were associated with lower incidence of heart failure exacerbation events (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.58–0.62, p < 0.001) and all-cause emergency room visits or hospitalizations (HR, 0.67, 95% CI 0.66–0.69; P < .001) compared with those not on GLP-1RAs. Other outcomes, including acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, ischemic stroke, pulmonary hypertension, C-reactive protein ≥ 5 mg/L, acute kidney injury, and the need for renal replacement therapy, were also significantly less frequent in the GLP-1RA group. These associated benefits persisted even among patients on a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i).

Conclusion

GLP-1RA use is associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes in nonobese patients with T2DM and HFpEF and has an associated incremental benefit even among patients on SGLT2i.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^116dUpym]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology 2023 type 2 diabetes — cardiovascular risk therapy selection states that GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) lower major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in meta-analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80–0.93, P < .001), while sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce hospitalization for heart failure (HF) and cardiovascular death, including a 32% reduction in HF hospitalization (HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.61–0.76]) and a 15% reduction in CV death (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.78–0.93]) versus placebo. For persons with T2D and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or at high risk, a GLP-1 RA with cardiovascular benefit should be initiated as first-line therapy independent of A1C goal or other antihyperglycemic treatments, and as an alternative clinicians may recommend an SGLT2i with proven cardiovascular benefit to reduce MACE or CV death in persons with T2D and established ASCVD. SGLT2is should be recommended in persons with T2D and HF regardless of A1C goal or other antihyperglycemic treatments, and they have been shown to improve HF-related symptoms irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction and background therapies. High-risk trial features included "albuminuria or proteinuria, HTN and LV hypertrophy, LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, and/or ABI < 0.9". DPP-4 inhibitors show neutrality for MACE, but saxagliptin increased HF hospitalizations and caution is advised with alogliptin in New York Heart Association Class III or IV CHF. Thiazolidinediones can worsen fluid retention and should not be used in symptomatic HF, and initiation of pioglitazone is contraindicated in New York Heart Association Class III or Class IV CHF.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and diabetes — antihyperglycemic therapy selection and avoidance: Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) "should be first-line therapy for individuals with HFpEF and T2DM and add-on or alternate therapy in those already on other agents", and clinicians "should consider stopping or adjusting the dose of other hypoglycemic agents in order to accommodate an SGLT2i". Metformin "is recommended as first-line therapy for glycemic control in individuals with T2DM and HF, including HFpEF, with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2", with observational data "suggesting a 20% relative risk reduction in mortality in individuals with HF, including HFpEF". Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) trials "included 10% to 23% of individuals with HF in the study population", and these drugs "should be considered in individuals with HFpEF with coexisting T2DM and high risk for ASCVD or with pre-existing ASCVD". Agents to avoid include the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor saxagliptin, which "was associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalization (3.5% vs 2.8%; HR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07–1.51)", and the FDA "contraindicates the use of saxagliptin and alogliptin in individuals with HF". Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are linked to "increased incidence of fluid retention, weight gain, and HF events", the risk rises with insulin coadministration and "this combination should be avoided", and "TZDs are relatively contraindicated in individuals with HFpEF".

### Managing glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in clinical practice [^114AjZu1]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

The obesity epidemic has significantly heightened the impact of cardiometabolic risk factors on the global burden of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), originally developed for type 2 diabetes treatment, have demonstrated in randomised controlled trials their ability to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. This has led to substantial improvements in patient outcomes. SGLT2i, in particular, are the first class of drugs proven to improve the prognosis of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and evidence is accumulating to suggest that also GLP-1RA might be beneficial in these patients. Remarkably, the benefits of GLP-1RA and SGLT2i are independent of type 2 diabetes status or baseline renal function. The critical role of these drug classes in managing high cardiovascular risk patients is increasingly acknowledged in guidelines, which now advocate their use across broader clinical phenotypes. This review compiles evidence supporting the use of these drugs in various clinical scenarios, highlighting their impact on outcomes and identifying patient subgroups most likely to benefit from their prescription. Guideline recommendations are summarised at the conclusion of each section. In the conclusion, we highlight how these drugs have changed our approach to cardiometabolic diseases and emphasise the potential advantages achievable by using their reciprocal combination and combinations with other drugs representing the foundation of the guidelines-directed medical therapy.

Antihyperglycemic therapy selection — choice of therapy reflects glycemic targets and comorbidities (ASCVD, CHF, CKD, overweight/obesity, and NAFLD), and clinicians should use the coexistence of these conditions to select therapies with the most potential for improved overall outcomes. The 2022 AACE CPG update on a DM comprehensive care plan recommends that "if there is established or high risk for ASCVD, heart failure [HF], and/or CKD, clinicians should prescribe a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) with proven efficacy for the specific condition(s) independent of glycemic control".

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) — regulatory status and overall cerebrovascular effects are as follows: a 24% reduction in the risk of stroke (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.94) has been reported, and liraglutide, semaglutide SC, and dulaglutide are approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of MACE in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established cardiovascular (CV) disease, with dulaglutide being the only agent also approved for CV disease reduction in patients without established ASCVD; additionally, a recent meta-analysis suggests this class may offer modest reductions in hospitalization for heart failure, apparently driven by albiglutide rather than a consistent effect across all agents.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115o2419]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus with heart failure — SGLT-2 inhibitors to prevent hospitalization: For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure, we recommend a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor to prevent hospital admissions for heart failure. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation, categorized it as Reviewed, New-added, stated that the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was high, and found that the benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors in reducing hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) for patients with T2DM and HF outweighed the potential harm. Guideline-directed medical therapy includes SGLT-2 inhibitors as part of an initial "four pillar" approach for patients with heart failure along with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors, beta blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and adding an SGLT-2 inhibitor to a regimen in a patient already achieving glycemic goals might require de-escalation of other medications to limit the risk of hypoglycemia. Evidence cited notes empagliflozin has been shown effective in patients with reduced and preserved ejection fraction and that dapagliflozin similarly reduced the rate of heart failure outcomes, while some systematic reviews suggest that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) might also reduce HHF but the overall impact on HHF is likely minimal without albiglutide, which is no longer marketed in the U.S. Implementation should consider patient factors and tolerability described here, including urinary frequency (especially with coexisting bladder or prostate conditions), a history of recurrent or severe genitourinary infections, and in older patients on other antihypertensives or diuretics or those with systolic heart failure the possibility of symptomatic hypotension or volume depletion that might require de-escalation or discontinuation of therapy.

### Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors for people with cardiovascular disease: a network meta-analysis [^117UnR1t]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death globally. Recently, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) were approved for treating people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although metformin remains the first-line pharmacotherapy for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a body of evidence has recently emerged indicating that DPP4i, GLP-1RA and SGLT2i may exert positive effects on patients with known CVD.

Objectives

To systematically review the available evidence on the benefits and harms of DPP4i, GLP-1RA, and SGLT2i in people with established CVD, using network meta-analysis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index on 16 July 2020. We also searched clinical trials registers on 22 August 2020. We did not restrict by language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating DPP4i, GLP-1RA, or SGLT2i that included participants with established CVD. Outcome measures of interest were CVD mortality, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, all-cause mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure (HF), and safety outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently screened the results of searches to identify eligible studies and extracted study data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. We conducted standard pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analyses by pooling studies that we assessed to be of substantial homogeneity; subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also pursued to explore how study characteristics and potential effect modifiers could affect the robustness of our review findings. We analysed study data using the odds ratios (ORs) and log odds ratios (LORs) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and credible intervals (Crls), where appropriate. We also performed narrative synthesis for included studies that were of substantial heterogeneity and that did not report quantitative data in a usable format, in order to discuss their individual findings and relevance to our review scope.

Main Results

We included 31 studies (287 records), of which we pooled data from 20 studies (129,465 participants) for our meta-analysis. The majority of the included studies were at low risk of bias, using Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias. Among the 20 pooled studies, six investigated DPP4i, seven studied GLP-1RA, and the remaining seven trials evaluated SGLT2i. All outcome data described below were reported at the longest follow-up duration. 1. DPP4i versus placebo Our review suggests that DPP4i do not reduce any risk of efficacy outcomes: CVD mortality (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09; high-certainty evidence), myocardial infarction (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.08; high-certainty evidence), stroke (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.14; high-certainty evidence), and all-cause mortality (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.11; high-certainty evidence). DPP4i probably do not reduce hospitalisation for HF (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.23; moderate-certainty evidence). DPP4i may not increase the likelihood of worsening renal function (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33; low-certainty evidence) and probably do not increase the risk of bone fracture (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.19; moderate-certainty evidence) or hypoglycaemia (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.29; moderate-certainty evidence). They are likely to increase the risk of pancreatitis (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.37; moderate-certainty evidence). 2. GLP-1RA versus placebo Our findings indicate that GLP-1RA reduce the risk of CV mortality (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95; high-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.95; high-certainty evidence), and stroke (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98; high-certainty evidence). GLP-1RA probably do not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01; moderate-certainty evidence), and hospitalisation for HF (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.06; high-certainty evidence). GLP-1RA may reduce the risk of worsening renal function (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.84; low-certainty evidence), but may have no impact on pancreatitis (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.35; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of GLP-1RA on hypoglycaemia and bone fractures. 3. SGLT2i versus placebo This review shows that SGLT2i probably reduce the risk of CV mortality (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.95; moderate-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96; moderate-certainty evidence), and reduce the risk of HF hospitalisation (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.71; high-certainty evidence); they do not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.12; high-certainty evidence) and probably do not reduce the risk of stroke (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.36; moderate-certainty evidence). In terms of treatment safety, SGLT2i probably reduce the incidence of worsening renal function (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.82; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably have no effect on hypoglycaemia (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.07; moderate-certainty evidence) or bone fracture (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.18; high-certainty evidence), and may have no impact on pancreatitis (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.86; low-certainty evidence). 4. Network meta-analysis Because we failed to identify direct comparisons between each class of the agents, findings from our network meta-analysis provided limited novel insights. Almost all findings from our network meta-analysis agree with those from the standard meta-analysis. GLP-1RA may not reduce the risk of stroke compared with placebo (OR 0.87, 95% CrI 0.75 to 1.0; moderate-certainty evidence), which showed similar odds estimates and wider 95% Crl compared with standard pairwise meta-analysis. Indirect estimates also supported comparison across all three classes. SGLT2i was ranked the best for CVD and all-cause mortality.

Authors' Conclusions

Findings from both standard and network meta-analyses of moderate- to high-certainty evidence suggest that GLP-1RA and SGLT2i are likely to reduce the risk of CVD mortality and all-cause mortality in people with established CVD; high-certainty evidence demonstrates that treatment with SGLT2i reduce the risk of hospitalisation for HF, while moderate-certainty evidence likely supports the use of GLP-1RA to reduce fatal and non-fatal stroke. Future studies conducted in the non-diabetic CVD population will reveal the mechanisms behind how these agents improve clinical outcomes irrespective of their glucose-lowering effects.

### A GIPR antagonist conjugated to GLP-1 analogues promotes weight loss with improved metabolic parameters in preclinical and phase 1 settings [^112FJsYP]. Nature Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Main

Obesity is a heterogeneous, chronic condition that has grown into an extremely prevalent public health problemand is one of the greatest threats to human health and well-being in the 21st century. The morbidity associated with obesity has exerted a tremendous burden on patients and the healthcare system globally, accounting for an estimated $173 billion in medical expenditures in the United States in 2019. Effective and safe obesity therapeutics are needed. The advancement of incretin-based therapeutics has resulted in a sea change in the management of type 2 diabetes, with the most recently developed agents promoting notable reductions in weight as well –. These large reductions in weight by current incretin therapeutics have translated into improvements in cardiovascular health. In a recent clinical study, individuals with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction who received weekly semaglutide injections (2.4 mg) for 52 weeks experienced substantially improved symptoms and physical function compared to the placebo group. Furthermore, the SELECT trial showed a 20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular event risk in patients with obesity and without diabetes who lost weight with semaglutide treatment. Therapeutics with enhanced efficacy, improved pharmacokinetics (PK) allowing less-frequent dosing and good tolerability remain in high demand to address the unmet medical need of patients with obesity.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116Y5yxx]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes — noninsulin pharmacologic adjuncts to insulin show limited glycemic and weight effects with safety considerations. Clinical trials have demonstrated a modest reduction in A1C (0.3–0.4%) and modest weight loss (~1 kg) with pramlintide. The largest clinical trials of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in type 1 diabetes have been conducted with liraglutide 1.8 mg daily, and results showed modest A1C reductions (~0.4%), decreases in weight (~5 kg), and reductions in insulin doses; during treatment there was no impact on C-peptide, and after liraglutide discontinuation there was worsening of C-peptide loss versus placebo. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improved A1C, reduced body weight, and improved blood pressure in trials but were associated with an increased rate of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The SGLT1/2 inhibitor sotagliflozin improved A1C and body weight but was associated with an eightfold increase in DKA compared with placebo. The studies that led to the approved indication for heart failure excluded individuals with type 1 diabetes or a history of DKA, and there are currently no approved therapies for preservation of C-peptide or delaying the progression of symptomatic type 1 diabetes.

### Non-inferiority and clinical superiority of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors: systematic analysis of cardiorenal outcome trials in type 2 diabetes [^112fEkjM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

Most trials leading to the approval of glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) were primarily designed to confirm their non-inferiority to placebo (commonly using an upper 95% confidence limit threshold of 1.3) and, if confirmed, superiority (threshold 1): this asymmetry of margins (1 vs. 1.3) favours the active intervention. We aimed to quantify the probability of clinical superiority of the active treatment by applying the same threshold used to claim non-inferiority.

Materials and Methods

We searched PubMed and Cochrane CENTRAL for cardiorenal outcome trials in subjects with type 2 diabetes published before 5 December 2021, to reconstruct from Kaplan-Meier plots individual-level data for the primary outcome or all-cause mortality. We calculated Bayesian posterior densities to obtain the probability for a treatment effect (hazard ratio) < 0.769, which is symmetric to the 1.3 threshold (i.e. its reciprocal [1/1.3]), emulating a scenario where the active treatment is placebo and placebo is the active treatment.

Results

We extracted data from 27 Kaplan-Meier plots (18 for the primary outcome, nine for mortality). Probabilities of clinical superiority to placebo varied significantly: for GLP-1RAs, from a minimum of 0% to a maximum of 69% for the primary outcome and from 0% to 8% for mortality; corresponding estimates for SGLT2is were 0% to 96% and 0% to 93%. Probabilities were on average greater for SGLT2is, particularly in trials investigating kidney or heart failure outcomes.

Conclusions

The probability of clinical superiority to placebo varies widely across trials previously reported as showing superiority of GLP-1RAs or SGLT2is compared with placebo. These results showed within- and between-class differences, highlight the drawbacks of a binary interpretation of the results, particularly in the context of the current designs of non-inferiority trials, and have implications for decision makers and future clinical recommendations.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) cardiovascular risk reduction — SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists have been demonstrated to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and SGLT2 inhibitors also substantially diminish the risks of heart failure (HF) hospitalization and progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Although the exact mechanisms of cardiovascular and renal benefits remain uncertain and appear to exceed direct glucose-lowering effects, data proving that SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs improve outcomes in patients with T2D and cardiovascular disease have triggered a paradigm shift beyond glucose control toward comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction.

### Effects of liraglutide on clinical stability among patients with advanced heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: a randomized clinical trial [^116kAGGx]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Abnormal cardiac metabolism contributes to the pathophysiology of advanced heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists have shown cardioprotective effects in early clinical studies of patients with advanced heart failure, irrespective of type 2 diabetes status.

Objective

To test whether therapy with a GLP-1 agonist improves clinical stability following hospitalization for acute heart failure.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of patients with established heart failure and reduced LVEF who were recently hospitalized. Patients were enrolled between August 2013 and March 2015 at 24 US sites.

Interventions

The GLP-1 agonist liraglutide (n = 154) or placebo (n = 146) via a daily subcutaneous injection; study drug was advanced to a dosage of 1.8 mg/d during the first 30 days as tolerated and continued for 180 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was a global rank score in which all patients, regardless of treatment assignment, were ranked across 3 hierarchical tiers: time to death, time to rehospitalization for heart failure, and time-averaged proportional change in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level from baseline to 180 days. Higher values indicate better health (stability). Exploratory secondary outcomes included primary end point components, cardiac structure and function, 6-minute walk distance, quality of life, and combined events.

Results

Among the 300 patients who were randomized (median age, 61 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 52–68 years]; 64 [21%] women; 178 [59%] with type 2 diabetes; median LVEF of 25% [IQR, 19%-33%]; median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level of 2049 pg/mL [IQR, 1054–4235 pg/mL]), 271 completed the study. Compared with placebo, liraglutide had no significant effect on the primary end point (mean rank of 146 for the liraglutide group vs 156 for the placebo group, P = 0.31). There were no significant between-group differences in the number of deaths (19 [12%] in the liraglutide group vs 16 [11%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.57–2.14]; p = 0.78) or rehospitalizations for heart failure (63 [41%] vs 50 [34%], respectively; hazard ratio, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.89–1.88]; p = 0.17) or for the exploratory secondary end points. Prespecified subgroup analyses in patients with diabetes did not reveal any significant between-group differences. The number of investigator-reported hyperglycemic events was 16 (10%) in the liraglutide group vs 27 (18%) in the placebo group and hypoglycemic events were infrequent (2 [1%] vs 4 [3%], respectively).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients recently hospitalized with heart failure and reduced LVEF, the use of liraglutide did not lead to greater posthospitalization clinical stability. These findings do not support the use of liraglutide in this clinical situation.

GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors — clinical effects and value in CCD with type 2 diabetes: In patients with CCD and type 2 diabetes, both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists significantly reduce the risk of MACE, with additional benefits in terms of weight loss and progression of kidney disease. SGLT2 inhibitors do not appear to primarily reduce atherosclerosis as much as they reduce incident and worsening HF, whereas GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to primarily reduce the risk of atherosclerotic events, such as MI and stroke; meta-analyses have shown no statistically significant heterogeneity in cardiovascular risk reduction across different GLP-1 receptor agonists. Currently, no compelling evidence is available that either medication reduces cardiovascular risk in patients with CCD but without type 2 diabetes, or in the case of SGLT2 inhibitors, without concomitant HF. From a cost-effectiveness perspective in diabetes populations, the use of a GLP-1 agonist is projected to be of high value (cost-saving or incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of < $50,000 per QALY gained), whereas the use of an SGLT2 inhibitor is projected to be of intermediate value ($50,000 to < $150,000 per QALY gained) compared with standard of care.

### Effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on major cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with or without established cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113WyoM3]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Glucose-lowering, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists reduce incidence of major cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). However, randomized clinical trials reported inconsistent effects on myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, and limited data in DM patients without established CV disease (CVD). Very recently, new relevant evidence was available from additional CV outcome trials (CVOTs) that also included large subgroups of patients with DM without established CVD. Thus, the aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on major CV events and safety in DM patients with and without established CVD.

Methods and Results

In this trial-level meta-analysis, we analysed data from randomized placebo-controlled CVOTs assessing efficacy and safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists in adult patients with Type 2 DM. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, ISI Web of Science, SCOPUS, and clinicaltrial.gov databases for eligible trials. Of 360 articles identified and screened for eligibility, seven CVOTs were included, with an overall of 56004 patients included. The difference in efficacy with respect to the major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) primary endpoint (including CV mortality, non-fatal MI, and non-fatal stroke) between patients with established CVD and patients with CV risk factors only was not significant [pooled interaction effect, expressed as ratio of hazard ratio (HR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85–1.34]. In the analysis of the whole population of DM patients, GLP-1 receptor agonists showed a significant 12% reduction in the hazard of the three-point MACE composite endpoint (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80–0.96) and a significant reduction in the risk of CV mortality (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79–0.98), all-cause mortality (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81–0.97), fatal and non-fatal stroke (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76–0.94), and heart failure (HF) hospitalization (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–0.97). No significant effect was observed for fatal and non-fatal MI (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82–1.02), although in a sensitivity analysis, based on a less conservative statistical approach, the pooled HR become statistically significant (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83–1.00; P = 0.039). No excess of hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer was observed between GLP-1 receptor agonists and placebo.

Conclusion

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists significantly reduce MACE, CV and total mortality stroke, and hospitalization for HF, with a trend for reduction of MI, in patients with Type 2 DM with and without established CVD.

Diabetes pharmacotherapy and heart failure outcomes — Incretin-based therapies (glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP-4] inhibitors), insulin, and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are described with heart failure (HF) endpoints. The safety and efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists have "not been studied extensively in patients with established HF", and although "there were no significant changes with the use of DPP-4 inhibitors in cardiovascular outcomes in large-scale clinical studies", the SAVOR–TIMI 53 trial "showed a 27% increase in hospitalization for HF" with saxagliptin versus placebo; "12.8% of patients had a history of HF at baseline", and the composite risk with saxagliptin was "similar for patients with history of HF compared with patients without a history of HF". A meta-analysis "suggests that DPP-4 inhibitor use is associated with an increased risk of HF". In a randomized trial of "12537 patients" assigned to insulin glargine versus standard care, "rates of cardiovascular outcomes (including HF events) were similar". For sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition, empagliflozin added to standard care "was shown to reduce cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, and HF hospitalizations"; "Hospitalization for HF was reduced by 35%; 10% of the patients had pre-existing HF", but "among patients with HF, improvement in clinical outcomes including reductions in mortality, cardiovascular death, or HF hospitalizations did not reach significance", and "There was no measure of LVEF or natriuretic peptides in the trial".

### Risk of adverse events with liraglutide in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: a post hoc analysis of the FIGHT trial [^112qstfc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) are a drug class that promote glycaemic control and weight loss, lower blood pressure and improve lipid profile. In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), GLP‐1RAs decreased the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with a high cardiovascular risk, and current guidelines for treatment of T2D propose GLP‐1RAs as a preferential class for those patients at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events.

Despite these beneficial effects, GLP‐1RAs are known for increasing heart rate and activating cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)‐dependent pathways, which have been associated with detrimental effects in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Despite the reduction in MACE in RCTs with patients with T2D, these trials included only a small fraction of heart failure (HF) patients without measuring ejection fraction or natriuretic peptides; thus, the efficacy and safety of GLP‐1RAs among patients with HF, particularly those with HFrEF, is not well established.

In two small RCTs with the GLP‐1RA liraglutide in HFrEF, namely, the Heart Failure Network Functional Impact of GLP‐1 for Heart Failure Treatment (FIGHT)and the Effect of Liraglutide on Left Ventricular Function in Stable Chronic Heart Failure Patients with and without Diabetes (LIVE) studiestreatment with liraglutide was not associated with beneficial effects and there was a higher number of hospitalizations for worsening HF and arrhythmia‐related events in the group treated with liraglutide compared to placebo, albeit not reaching statistical significance. The analysis of both trials focused on the evaluation of first events which may have limited their power to detect potential adverse effects of GLP‐1RAs. The effect of the GLP‐1RA albiglutide was also evaluated in patients with stable HFrEF. In that small RCT (82 participants, 12 weeks follow‐up), albiglutide did not improve cardiac function or myocardial glucose use. Although albiglutide was well tolerated in the RCT, the number of participants and the short follow‐up may have limited the detection of potential adverse effects (no hospitalizations for worsening HF were reported during this period).

In the present analysis, we aimed to evaluate the effect of the GLP‐1RA liraglutide (vs. placebo) on the totality of events of HF hospitalization or all‐cause death in patients with HFrEF enrolled in the FIGHT trial.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114v9fYd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA): We recommend initiating a patient-clinician discussion about SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1RA therapy at a follow-up visit for patients with T2D who have or who are at very high risk for clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), and/or diabetic kidney disease (DKD). An SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefit is recommended for patients with T2D and HF, especially heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), or who are at high risk of developing HF, DKD, clinically evident ASCVD, or combinations of these. A GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit is recommended for patients with established or at very high risk for ASCVD. Patients with T2D may become eligible for these therapies if they are subsequently hospitalized or diagnosed with ASCVD, HF, and/or DKD, although hospitalized patients were not included in most CV outcome trials and inpatient formularies may not include these agents. Outpatient adherence after an acute CV event can be favorably influenced by initiation at discharge. CV specialists should consider periodic screening for T2D by measuring HbA1c at guideline-recommended intervals (e.g., annually in patients with prediabetes). Patients with ASCVD or at high risk of ASCVD and/or HF should consider initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit irrespective of HbA1c levels. Although canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin have differences in FDA-approved CV indications, they appear to have broadly similar CV and renal benefits, and the choice of an individual agent should be made after appropriate patient-clinician discussion of benefits and potential risks.

### Non-inferiority and clinical superiority of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors: systematic analysis of cardiorenal outcome trials in type 2 diabetes [^113gS4nR]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The results of randomized controlled trials investigating the safety and efficacy of GLP‐1RAs and SGLT2is have led to the approval of several therapies and to an unprecedented growth in the number of available treatments for type 2 diabetes; directly or indirectly, the 2008 FDA regulatory requirement has been a strong influence on the design and implementation of such trials. Further consideration, however, is required if the goal is to claim not only non‐inferiority of these medications but also their clinical superiority, as the recommended characteristics and current interpretation of the non‐inferiority trials bias the comparison in favour of the medication under investigation for approval. Using the margin of 1.3 suggested by the FDA to declare non‐inferiority, we showed that the evidence for clinical superiority is modest or null for some treatments and more robust for others, with remarkable differences across outcomes as well as between and within GLP‐1RAs and SGLT2is. In view of the drawbacks that have so far characterized the design and interpretation of non‐inferiority trials, changes in the recommendations on their design and complementary analytical approaches may help generate more informative and actionable evidence for health care professionals and patients.

### Impact of GLP-1 receptor agonist-based therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with CKD [^117RAtK4]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists-based therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes has not been systematically reviewed across baseline kidney function groups. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (RAs) in patients with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

We performed a PubMed/Medline search of randomized, placebo-controlled, event-driven outcome trials of GLP-1 RAs versus placebo in patients with and without diabetes from inception to January 2025. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73m2. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Secondary outcomes included hospitalization for heart failure, CKD progression, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The relative risk (RR) was estimated using a random-effects model.

Results

Nine RCTs were included with a total of 75,088 patients, including 17,568 with eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m². Use of an GLP-1 RA in patients with CKD was associated with a lower incidence of MACE (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.74–0.95; P 0.006) and of CKD progression (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77–0.94; P 0.002), compared with placebo. There was no differential treatment effect of GLP-1 RA on these endpoints by CKD status at baseline.

Conclusions

GLP-1 RAs offer substantial cardiovascular and renal protection in patients with CKD. These findings support their use in CKD patients and confirms that these therapies may be continued as kidney function declines.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112fg2qA]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in type 2 diabetes — semaglutide (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist [GLP-1 RA]) improved symptoms and weight in STEP-HFpEF, and the committee recommends treatment with a GLP-1 RA with demonstrated benefit in individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and symptomatic HFpEF for the reduction of HF-related symptoms, physical limitations, and exercise function in this population. Approximately 45% of people admitted for HFpEF have diabetes, and most people with HFpEF have obesity. In the trial, 616 people with type 2 diabetes and a BMI of 30 or greater with HFpEF were assigned to receive once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg or placebo, and the primary end point was the change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) clinical summary score (range from 0 to 100) and the change in body weight. After 1 year of treatment, the KCCQ clinical summary score had increased by 9.7 points and mean body weight was reduced by 9.8% with semaglutide compared with 3.4% with placebo; semaglutide also improved 6-min walk distance and favored a hierarchical composite of death, heart failure events, KCCQ change, and C-reactive protein levels.

1 INTRODUCTION

Randomized controlled trials showed that treatments with glucagon‐like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RA) or sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) result in notable reductions in the rates of classical atherothrombotic cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as in renal and heart failure outcomes in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Most of these trials, popularized as 'cardiovascular outcome trials' (CVOTs), were designed according to the 2008 United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations for industry, after concerns around the cardiovascular risks of glucose‐lowering medications such as rosiglitazone. Newer glucose‐lowering medications now had to be shown not to result in an unacceptable increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease. To secure FDA approval, these large phase 3 trials had to show safety in the form of non‐inferiority of the active compared with the control treatment, defined as an upper bound of the two‐sided 95% confidence interval (CI) lower than 1.3 (more rarely 1.8) in the active versus control comparison.

### Liraglutide in the treatment of heart failure: insight from FIGHT and LIVE [^112XiDcz]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) affects at least 26 million people worldwide, and the prevalence is increasing year by year. HF patients experience a high burden of symptoms and functional limitations, and morbidity and mortality remain high despite successful therapies. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the most frequent subtype of diabetes, is an expanding global health problem, and in the past decades, the global prevalence has increased by 30%, and now about 463 million people are affected. Both HF and T2DM independently increase the morbidity of another disease and associated with considerable mortality. There are many glucose-lowering agents used in patients with HF, however, the results are mixed. Here, we critically and systematically explored the effect of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, on the treatment of patients with HF.

We included all perticipants from the Functional Impact of GLP-1 for Heart Failure Treatmen (FIGHT) and Effect of Liraglutide on Left Ventricular Function in Stable Chronic Heart Failure Patients with and without Diabetes (LIVE) trials, which are multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Two reviewers extracted data independently and crossed check. Only data indicators from both trials can be used for subsequent analysis. All the results were descriptive analysis.

In those trials, 541 perticipants from 24 sites in the United States and 4 Danish Centres were included. The baseline of two trials was basically similar, regardless of general data, functional measures, physical examination, medical history, laboratory measures, echocardiographic data, and HF medications (Table 1). The outcomes of FIGHT and LIVE are not exactly the same, and we choose the coincident indicators for analysis. In FIGHT, liraglutide decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, hemoglobin A1c and heart rate, and increased left ventricular end-systolic volume index, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, and 6 min walk test, compared with placebo. However, there was no statistical difference. In LIVE, liraglutide significantly decreased hemoglobin A1c (P < 0.0001) and inceased 6 min walk test (P = 0.04) and heart rate (P < 0.0001), compared with placebo. There were no statistical differences in the influence of the abovementioned outcomes that coincided with FIGHT (Table 1).

### Semaglutide in patients with obesity and heart failure across mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction [^117PGZ7w]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

There have been some concerns raised regarding the use of GLP-1 receptor agonist in patients with HFrEF based on 2 relatively small trials with liraglutide. The LIVE (Effect of Liraglutide on Left Ventricular Function in Stable Chronic Heart Failure Patients) trial randomized 241 patients with HFrEF with or without diabetes to placebo or liraglutide 1.8 mg for 24 weeks. No changes in LVEF, health status, or functional class were observed, but serious cardiac adverse events (including sustained ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation requiring intervention, aggravation of ischemic heart disease, and worsening of HF) occurred more frequently in the liraglutide arm (n = 12, 10.0% vs n = 3, 3.0%; P = 0.04). The FIGHT (Functional Impact of GLP-1 for HF Treatment) trial randomized 300 patients with HFrEF and recent decompensation to liraglutide or placebo for 6 months. The trial was neutral overall, but although not statistically significant, participants in the liraglutide arm experienced numerically higher risk for the composite outcome of death or HF hospitalization (HR: 1.30; 95% CI: 0.92–1.83; P = 0.14), particularly in patients with diabetes (HR: 1.54; 95% CI: 0.97–2.46; P = 0.07). Neither study was powered or of sufficient duration to allow conclusive comments regarding the efficacy or safety of these agents in HFrEF. The favorable efficacy and safety results from the HFmrEF subgroup of participants in STEP-HFpEF provides important reassurance regarding the use of these agents in patients with mildly reduced LVEF and obesity, although the number of STEP-HFpEF participants with HFmrEF was small, and LVEF was only modestly reduced. Given that obesity may also contribute to the progression of HF-related symptoms and physical limitations in HFrEF, the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists in stable patients with HFrEF and obesity should be further investigated.

### Reappraisal on pharmacological and mechanical treatments of heart failure [^112J2sRF]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)

Abnormal myocardial metabolism has been documented in the HF population, with reduced fatty acid oxidation and myocardial insulin resistance. GLP-1 increases myocardial insulin sensitivity and has a cardioprotective nature. Previous small-sample, retrospective studies showed that GLP-1 was associated with favourable effects that GLP-1 significantly improved LV function, functional status, and the QoL; and that GLP-1 reduced the risk of HHF, all-cause hospitalization, and death in T2DM. Another study involving 32 T2DM patients with a history of CHF provided evidence that treatment with liraglutide is associated with improvements in cardiac function and functional capacity. However, in LEADER, the rate of the primary composite outcome in the time-to-event analysis (the first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke) among patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk was lower with liraglutide than with placebo, whereas the number of HHF was reduced non-significantly in the active arm. Moreover, the unfavourable results observed in LEADER are not stand-alone findings. LIVE, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicentre trial, determined that although the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide did not affect LV systolic function compared with placebo in stable CHF patients with and without T2DM, treatment with liraglutide was associated with an increase in HR and more serious cardiac adverse events. The FIGHT trial, a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of HFrEF, revealed that the use of liraglutide did not lead to greater post-hospitalization clinical stability. In SUSTAIN 6, involving 3297 patients with type 2 diabetes who were at high cardiovascular risk, the rate of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke was significantly lower among patients receiving semaglutide than among those receiving placebo, an outcome that confirmed the noninferiority of semaglutide.

In summary, the results of the body of existing evidence do not support the use of liraglutide or semaglutide in HF with T2DM, and LIVE points out the potential harmful effect of liraglutide in this population. Importantly, the safety of these powerful GLP-1 analogues in patients with T2DM and documented HF remains uncertain. Therefore, further studies are needed to assess the risks and benefits of liraglutide and semaglutide in this particular subgroup of diabetic patients.

A Bayesian approach helps to circumvent some limitations of the frequentist, hypothesis‐testing approach. Rather than classifying the results in two alternatives, Bayesian estimates encompass the continuous spectrum of the magnitude of effect and permit a more nuanced and natural, probabilistic interpretation of the results. As an example, the 95% credible interval represents the probability within which lies, with a 95% probability, the treatment effect; such an interpretation is not possible when considering the frequentist 95% confidence interval. Estimating the probability of a treatment effect across varying thresholds gives deeper insights into the treatment effect and better aligns with a context‐specific, personalized approach to glucose‐lowering therapies, if compared with the results obtained within the frequentist framework. Thresholds, for example, may differ between patients and change in the same patient over time: instead of a 23% reduction (HR 0.77), a smaller reduction in the rate of MACE may be also considered clinically meaningful. Moreover, although several factors are simultaneously considered, label indications from regulatory agencies and clinical recommendations on glucose‐lowering medications in subjects with type 2 diabetes are mainly based on the available evidence centred on dichotomous interpretations of the results. The large differences in the clinical superiority observed within and between GLP‐1RAs and SGLT2is across the investigated outcomes underline the limitations of the current decisional frameworks leading to their approval, call into question the within‐class equivalence in most of the current clinical guidelines, and may better inform future indications, clinical recommendations and therapeutic decisions.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Study characteristics

After excluding duplicates and screening by title or abstract, we assessed the full text of 44 articles: six reported the baseline characteristics of trial participants, trial protocol or comments on the results, while in 19 no Kaplan‐Meier plots for the primary outcome or all‐cause mortality were available, leaving 19 articles (reporting 27 Kaplan‐Meier plots in 18 trials) for data extraction and quantitative analyses (Figure S1, Tables S1 and S2). The references of the included studies are reported in Appendix S1.

The characteristics of the included trials are summarized in Tables S1 and S2: Kaplan‐Meier curves for the primary outcome were available in all trials (eight with GLP‐1RAs and 10 with SGLT2is). The definition of the primary outcome was largely consistent across studies with GLP‐1RAs [composite of a 3‐point major adverse cardiac events (MACE): non‐fatal myocardial infarction, non‐fatal stroke or death from cardiovascular causes]; conversely, it varied across studies with SGLT2is, being 3‐point MACE in five and a variable combination of hospitalization for heart failure and renal outcomes in the remaining five studies (Table S2). In all trials with a GLP‐1RA and in seven with a SGLT2i, all subjects had type 2 diabetes at randomization; in DAPA‐CKD and DAPA‐HF, subjects with type 2 diabetes constituted a subcohort representing 67.5% and 45.1% of the overall participants, respectively; in EMPEROR Reduced, the proportion of subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes was 49.8%. Inclusion criteria also varied across trials: most studies with GLP‐1RAs enrolled adult subjects with either established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors (both heterogeneously defined) while trials with SGLT2is included predominantly adult subjects with chronic kidney disease or heart failure (Table S2).

4 DISCUSSION

Using data from trials investigating GLP‐1RAs and SGLT2is, we estimated the treatment effect with a Bayesian survival model and quantified the probability for the active treatment of being not only statistically but also clinically superior to placebo, defined using the same threshold suggested by the FDA to claim non‐inferiority. While most trials showed 'superiority' of the active treatment in the original published report, the probability of clinical superiority varied significantly: in studies with GLP‐1RAs, from a minimum of 0% to a maximum of 69% for the primary outcome and from 0% to 8% for mortality; in those with SGLT2is, from 0% to 96% for the primary outcome and from 0% to 93% for mortality, although probabilities were on average greater for SGLT2is than for GLP‐1RAs.

### Effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on heart failure outcomes and cardiovascular death across varying cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic comorbidity [^115cWP7Z]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on heart failure hospitalization (HFH) and cardiovascular (CV) death among patients with varying overlap of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) comorbidity are not well characterized. This study aimed to assess effects GLP-1RAs on HFH and CV death across populations with varying type and number of CKM comorbidity.

Methods and Results

Online databases were queried through November 2024 for primary and secondary analyses of clinical outcome trials of GLP-1RAs in patients with heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), obesity, and combinations of these diseases. Primary outcome was a composite HFH or CV death. Secondary outcomes were first HFH and CV death. Hazard ratios (HRs), risk ratios (RRs), and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived using random-effects models. Fifteen trials (n = 87549) were included. Compared with placebo, GLP-1RAs reduced the relative risk of composite HFH/CV death in HF (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69–0.96), T2DM (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78–0.93), and obesity (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.58–0.86), with a non-significant risk reduction in CKD (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61–1.01). GLP-1RAs reduced the risk of HFH in T2DM (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80–0.99) and obesity (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45–0.87), with a non-significant risk reduction among patients with HF (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69–1.04) and CKD (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64–1.06). GLP-1RAs also significantly reduced CV death in HF (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77–0.99), T2DM (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78–0.93), and in obesity (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73–0.93), with a non-significant risk reduction in CKD (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.60–1.08). Effects were consistent across subgroups, except for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where GLP-1RAs showed a non-significant risk increase in HFH (HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.93–1.47) but significantly reduced CV death (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50–0.90). GLP-1RAs were not associated with increased risk for serious adverse events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89–1.00).

Conclusions

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists reduce HFH and CV death across CKM conditions, with generally consistent effects in varying combinations of these diseases. The potential exception is among patients with HFrEF, where a reduction in risk of CV death, but a numeric increase in HFH, was observed. Definitive CV outcome trials are needed to definitively determine effects of GLP-1RAs in patients with established HFrEF.

### Comparison of the effects of glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors for prevention of major adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115FSSsR]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have emerged as 2 new classes of antihyperglycemic agents that also reduce cardiovascular risk. The relative benefits in patients with and without established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for different outcomes with these classes of drugs remain undefined.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and trial-level meta-analysis of GLP1-RA and SGLT2i cardiovascular outcomes trials using the PubMed and EMBASE databases (Excerpta Medica Database). The primary outcomes were the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death (MACE); hospitalization for heart failure; and progression of kidney disease.

Results

In total, data from 8 trials and 77 242 patients, 42 920 (55.6%) in GLP1-RA trials, and 34 322 (44.4%) in SGLT2i trials, were included. Both drug classes reduced MACE in a similar magnitude with GLP1-RA reducing the risk by 12% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.84–0.94; P < 0.001) and SGLT2i by 11% (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83–0.96; P = 0.001). For both drug classes, this treatment effect was restricted to a 14% reduction in those with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80–0.93; P = 0.002), whereas no effect was seen in patients without established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.87–1.19; P = 0.81; P interaction, 0.028). SGLT2i reduced hospitalization for heart failure by 31% (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.61–0.79; P < 0.001), whereas GLP1-RA did not have a significant effect (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83–1.04; P = 0.20). Both GLP1-RA (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75–0.89; P < 0.001) and SGLT2i (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.58–0.67; P < 0.001) reduced the risk of progression of kidney disease including macroalbuminuria, but only SGLT2i reduced the risk of worsening estimated glomerular filtration rate, end-stage kidney disease, or renal death (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.48–0.64; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In trials reported to date, GLP1-RA and SGLT2i reduce atherosclerotic MACE to a similar degree in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, whereas SGLT2i have a more marked effect on preventing hospitalization for heart failure and progression of kidney disease. Their distinct clinical benefit profiles should be considered in the decision-making process when treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Therapeutic evidence in cardiometabolic populations — GLP-1–based therapies — indicates that use extends to patients with cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus with a lower BMI threshold of 25 kg/m^2; in patients with HFpEF, semaglutide resulted in improvement in symptoms, physical limitation, and exercise function, with the magnitude of benefit directly related to weight loss and possible weight-independent mechanisms. A study of tirzepatide in patients with obesity and HFpEF observed a significant reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death and worsening heart failure, potentially extending the role of these agents to HFpEF.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114JesBF]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Obesity and HFpEF — In heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), increasing severity of obesity is associated with an increased risk for HF hospitalization, and there is a U-shaped relationship between body mass index (BMI) and all-cause mortality with the lowest event rate at a BMI of 32 to 34 kg/m2. Weight loss is beneficial in individuals with obesity. In the STEP-1 trial, semaglutide plus lifestyle resulted in a sustained weight loss of over 15 kg over a 68-week period, and in SURMOUNT-1 tirzepatide demonstrated up to 20% reduction in weight loss sustained over the 72-week trial, although semaglutide and tirzepatide have not yet been rigorously evaluated in individuals with HF and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists may result in loss of not only adipose weight but also lean muscle mass. To improve symptoms and alleviate shared obesity-associated comorbidities with HFpEF, those with BMIs ≥ 35 kg/m² would benefit from referral to a multidisciplinary team of medical, surgical, and nutritional experts in obesity, when available.

### Cardiovascular effectiveness of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in older patients in routine clinical care with or without history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases or heart failure [^115btm5i]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background Randomized trials demonstrate the cardioprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA). We evaluated their relative cardiovascular effectiveness in routine care populations with a broad spectrum of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) or heart failure (HF). Methods and Results We identified Medicare beneficiaries from 2013 to 2017, aged > 65 years, initiating SGLT2i (n = 24 747) or GLP-1RA (n = 22 596) after a 1-year baseline. On the basis of diagnoses during baseline, we classified patients into: (1) no HF or CVD, (2) HF but no CVD, (3) no HF but CVD, and (4) both HF and CVD. We identified hospitalized HF and atherosclerotic CVD outcomes from drug initiation until treatment changes, death, or disenrollment. We estimated propensity score-weighted 2-year risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences, accounting for measured confounding, informative censoring, and competing risk. In patients with no CVD or HF, SGLT2i reduced the hospitalized HF risk compared with GLP-1RA (propensity score-weighted RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.43–0.96). The association was strongest in those who had HF but no CVD (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25–0.85). The combined myocardial infarction, stroke, and mortality outcome risk was slightly higher for SGLT2i compared with GLP-1RA in those without CVD or HF (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.09–1.56). The association was favorable toward SGLT2i in subgroups with a history of HF. Conclusions SGLT2i reduced the cardiovascular risk versus GLP-1RA in patients with a history of HF but no CVD. Atherosclerotic CVD events were less frequent with GLP-1RA in those without prior CVD or HF.

Anti-obesity medications and comparative weight loss — tirzepatide versus semaglutide are contrasted with quantified outcomes. The dual GLP-1 receptor/GIP agonist tirzepatide is associated with greater weight loss than the single GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide, and a trial in individuals with obesity reported greater average weight loss with tirzepatide (20.2% vs 13.7% at 72 weeks); this study did not specifically assess individuals with HF.

Within this context, we extracted individual level data from all published CVOTs including subjects with type 2 diabetes randomized to a GLP‐1RA or SGLT2 inhibitor and reporting incident cardiovascular or renal (cardiorenal) or all‐cause mortality events, to estimate their effects with two main goals: (a) quantify the probability that each treatment results in a reduction of the outcome at least equal to the 1.3 threshold used to declare non‐inferiority to the control, i.e. the probability that the active treatment is clinically superior, and (b) estimate these probabilities for a range of other thresholds to aid the understanding of treatment effects across a continuum and facilitate comparisons within and between the two glucose‐lowering classes.

SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists — use around acute coronary syndrome (ACS), perioperative precautions, and post–myocardial infarction (MI) trial data: The cardiovascular benefits of sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are well documented in stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and type 2 diabetes, as well as in heart failure (HF) regardless of diabetes status. GLP-1 receptor agonists may lead to weight loss, and semaglutide has been shown to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in overweight or obese patients with stable ASCVD but has not been studied early after ACS. SGLT-2 inhibitors may increase the risk of urinary tract infection, genital mycotic infection, hypovolemia, and acute kidney injury; due to a higher risk of perioperative diabetic and euglycemic ketoacidosis, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin should be stopped ≥ 3 days and ertugliflozin ≥ 4 days prior to scheduled surgery, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Efficacy and safety have been studied in 2 large trials after MI: in patients without diabetes or HF, dapagliflozin was not shown to reduce cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization in acute MI with impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic function, and empagliflozin did not significantly reduce all-cause death or first HF hospitalization in similar patients, although HF hospitalizations were reduced; no new safety concerns were identified and use of an SGLT-2 inhibitor does not need to be deferred in indicated patients at hospital discharge.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our large population‐based cohort study, we found evidence that SGLT2i initiators compared with GLP‐1RA had a lower risk of HHF in all subgroups (with or without HF and/or CVD) and, to a lesser extent, HHF+MACE particularly in those patients with HF with or without atherosclerotic CVD. The estimated effects on MACE are comparable but generally more favorable toward GLP‐1RA, except in a group with both CVD and HF. Our findings extend evidence from the large body of cardiovascular outcome trials documenting the CVD and HF benefits of SGLT2i and GLP‐1RA compared with placebo by examining the comparative effectiveness of the 2 classes. We believe these findings can help inform clinicians about the optimal choice of cardioprotective antihyperglycemic medications in patients with varying background CVDs.

Dapagliflozin is the first SGLT2i to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Analyses of placebo‐controlled, randomized trials suggest that protective effects of SGLT2i on HHF and MACE may be restricted to those with established HF with reduced ejection fraction, whereas benefits on stroke are uncertain. In general, SGLT2i effects on HHF are more compelling than their effects on MACE outcomes, whereas GLP‐1RA effects seem to be stronger for MACE outcomes, with their effects on HHF inconsistent across trials. Subgroup analyses from trials demonstrate MACE effects of GLP‐1RA more consistently among those with established CVD. Prior meta‐analysis of clinical trial data suggested that the beneficial effects of SGLT2i (and, to a lesser extent, GLP‐1RA) on MACE relative to placebo are more uncertain in regional subgroup analysis in North America. A nonexperimental study, based on US Medicare data, also reported findings similar to ours, although our subgroup definitions and analytical approaches are different.

### The impact of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide on natriuretic peptides in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction with and without type 2 diabetes [^113MWEc6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess the effect of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, on urinary sodium excretion as well as on circulating adrenomedullin and copeptin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Materials and Methods

In the LIVE study, patients (n = 241) with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45% were randomized to liraglutide 1.8 mg daily or placebo for 24weeks, and 30% had a concomitant diagnosis of T2D. Plasma levels of N-terminal brain-natriuretic-peptide (NT-proBNP) (a predefined secondary endpoint), midregional pro-atrial-natriuretic-peptide (MR-proANP), midregional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) and copeptin were measured at baseline and after 24weeks in this substudy. The potential effect modification of T2D was assessed.

Results

In the eligible subgroup of 231 patients with available biomarkers (115 randomized to liraglutide and 116 to placebo), MR-proANP decreased by 12% (P = 0.002) and NT-proBNP by 9% (P = 0.009) during liraglutide treatment compared with placebo at week 24. Interaction with T2D for the treatment effect of change in MR-proANP and NT-proBNP levels was P = 0.003 and P = 0.03, respectively. Consequently, in patients with T2D, liraglutide decreased MR-proANP by 27% (P < .001) and NT-proBNP by 25% (P = 0.02) compared with placebo, whereas no change was observed in patients without T2D. There was no effect of liraglutide on MR-proADM (P = 0.10) or copeptin (P = 0.52).

Conclusion

Liraglutide decreased the A- and B-type natriuretic peptides significantly in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and concomitant T2D, suggesting a beneficial mechanism of liraglutide in T2D patients with HFrEF.

### 2025 ACC scientific statement on the management of obesity in adults with heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology [^1174NRNs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Antiobesity medications (AOM) in heart failure with preserved/reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF/HFrEF) — the benefit of AOM in HFpEF is not clear, and potential gastrointestinal intolerances with possible effects on blood pressure and volume status indicate a need for better understanding of safety and efficacy in individuals with recently decompensated heart failure. In HFrEF, the potential effects of some AOM are of specific importance; concerns have been raised about the safety of GLP-1 receptor agonist use with liraglutide and exenatide, possibly related to increased heart rate, whereas larger cardiovascular outcomes trials did not identify risk for worse outcomes with liraglutide or semaglutide. Accordingly, the safety and efficacy of AOM in those with obesity and HFrEF requires further investigation.

### Cardiovascular effectiveness of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in older patients in routine clinical care with or without history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases or heart failure [^115tgsii]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Recently, the evidence from the empagliflozin trials suggested that it reduced the relative risk of HHF to a similar extent in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction and in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction. Following these estimates, we would expect the same benefits of SGLT2i on HHF in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction.

Our findings are consistent with those from randomized trials and prior claims‐based studies, although prior studies have not as explicitly examined the head‐to‐head efficacy of SGLT2i and GLP‐1RA for cardiovascular events among subgroups defined by varying burden of prevalent CVD diagnoses. We estimated beneficial effects of SGLT2i over GLP‐1RA for HHF outcomes in all subgroups and for MACE and mortality among those with a history of both CVD and HF. On the other hand, GLP‐1RA were more favorable than SGLT2i for MACE outcomes and stroke, and to a lower extent for MI and mortality, in those without documented CVD or HF. For the composite of HHF+MACE, the risk difference is relatively large (> 2%) to the benefit of SGLT2i for patients with HF with or without CVD; on the other hand, the risk difference is relatively small (< 0.5%) and statistically not significant to the benefit of GLP‐1RA for patients without HF with or without CVD. In this study, we examined the 3‐way interaction of SGLT2i with history of HF and/or atherosclerotic CVD, with an aim to estimate the valid treatment effects and help guide treatment decision making among subpopulations of interest. While most trials have a median follow‐up of 3 years, our study is limited by real‐world drug use patterns because the median treatment duration in our Medicare population is 1 year. We allowed maximum follow‐up of up to 5 years in sensitivity analyses and both AT and ITT analyses supported our primary findings.

### Semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with obesity and prevalent heart failure: a prespecified analysis of the SELECT trial [^115MnZZU]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in people with overweight or obesity, but the effects of this drug on outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart failure are unknown. We report a prespecified analysis of the effect of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2·4 mg on ischaemic and heart failure cardiovascular outcomes. We aimed to investigate if semaglutide was beneficial in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with a history of heart failure compared with placebo; if there was a difference in outcome in patients designated as having heart failure with preserved ejection fraction compared with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; and if the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in patients with heart failure was related to baseline characteristics or subtype of heart failure.

Methods

The SELECT trial was a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled, event-driven phase 3 trial in 41 countries. Adults aged 45 years and older, with a BMI of 27 kg/m² or greater and established cardiovascular disease were eligible for the study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a block size of four using an interactive web response system in a double-blind manner to escalating doses of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide over 16 weeks to a target dose of 2·4 mg, or placebo. In a prespecified analysis, we examined the effect of semaglutide compared with placebo in patients with and without a history of heart failure at enrolment, subclassified as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or unclassified heart failure. Endpoints comprised MACE (a composite of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death); a composite heart failure outcome (cardiovascular death or hospitalisation or urgent hospital visit for heart failure); cardiovascular death; and all-cause death. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03574597.

Findings

Between Oct 31, 2018, and March 31, 2021, 17604 patients with a mean age of 61·6 years (SD 8·9) and a mean BMI of 33·4 kg/m² (5·0) were randomly assigned to receive semaglutide (8803 [50·0%] patients) or placebo (8801 [50·0%] patients). 4286 (24·3%) of 17604 patients had a history of investigator-defined heart failure at enrolment: 2273 (53·0%) of 4286 patients had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, 1347 (31·4%) had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and 666 (15·5%) had unclassified heart failure. Baseline characteristics were similar between patients with and without heart failure. Patients with heart failure had a higher incidence of clinical events. Semaglutide improved all outcome measures in patients with heart failure at random assignment compared with those without heart failure (hazard ratio [HR] 0·72, 95% CI 0·60–0·87 for MACE; 0·79, 0·64–0·98 for the heart failure composite endpoint; 0·76, 0·59–0·97 for cardiovascular death; and 0·81, 0·66–1·00 for all-cause death; all p interaction > 0·19). Treatment with semaglutide resulted in improved outcomes in both the heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HR 0·65, 95% CI 0·49–0·87 for MACE; 0·79, 0·58–1·08 for the composite heart failure endpoint) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction groups (0·69, 0·51–0·91 for MACE; 0·75, 0·52–1·07 for the composite heart failure endpoint), although patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction had higher absolute event rates than those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. For MACE and the heart failure composite, there were no significant differences in benefits across baseline age, sex, BMI, New York Heart Association status, and diuretic use. Serious adverse events were less frequent with semaglutide versus placebo, regardless of heart failure subtype.

Interpretation

In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular diease and overweight or obesity, treatment with semaglutide 2·4 mg reduced MACE and composite heart failure endpoints compared with placebo in those with and without clinical heart failure, regardless of heart failure subtype. Our findings could facilitate prescribing and result in improved clinical outcomes for this patient group.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116dfqKG]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prediabetes — epidemiology, stroke associations, and cardiometabolic therapy signals are as follows: The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among US adults is 9%, and prediabetes and diabetes are associated with increased risk for first ischemic stroke (RR, 1.5%–3.7% for diabetes). Prediabetes is present in ≈30% of patients with acute ischemic stroke and is associated with increased risk for recurrence, and T2D is also present in ≈30% of patients with ischemic stroke with recurrence risk (RR, ≈1.6). Recent trials show at least one drug in each of three glucose-lowering classes — thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like protein 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor — can reduce risk for MACEs in T2D with established atherosclerotic vascular disease, while cardiovascular outcome trials of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors do not suggest a specific effect on stroke but rather on cardiovascular death, MI, and heart failure.

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112xAC1W]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Evidence gaps and research needs — Most included studies had shorter-term follow-up. The evidence was very uncertain regarding predefined subgroups of interest, including demographic subgroups, treatment-naive patients, and patients with established CVD or CKD, and evidence was insufficient or had low certainty regarding cost-effectiveness analyses directly comparing newer type 2 diabetes medications or pharmacologic classes. For newer type 2 diabetes medications compared with usual care, evidence was not available on the effects of GLP-1 agonists for the progression of CKD and effects of tirzepatide on MI, stroke, hospitalizations for CHF, and progression of CKD. Evidence from RCTs was lacking for examined newer diabetes pharmacologic classes in patients with type 2 diabetes who have not been previously treated, and the net benefit and cost-effectiveness of combined formulations or combined treatments with newer pharmacologic classes beyond glycemic control are currently unknown.

### Semaglutide in heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction: benefits above and beyond weight loss [^116L96sC]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the promising findings from the study by Withaar et alprovide a strong rationale for further investigation of semaglutide as a potential therapeutic option for obesity-related HFpEF in clinical settings. Beyond its weight-reducing effects, semaglutide exhibits multifaceted cardiometabolic benefits in HFpEF, including improved glycemic control, enhanced exercise capacity, and structural and functional improvements of the heart. Ongoing clinical trials (STEP-HFpEF trial, STEP-HFpEF-DM [Research Study to Look at How Well Semaglutide Works in People Living With Heart Failure, Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes;], and SUMMIT [A Study of Tirzepatide (LY3298176) in Participants With Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction and Obesity;]) are already evaluating the effects of GLP-1RAs in HFpEF patients with and without T2DM. If the positive findings from this preclinical study are confirmed in clinical trials, semaglutide could significantly improve the management of HFpEF by targeting not only body weight but also the underlying cardiometabolic abnormalities.

### Effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist initiation in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and implantable cardiac devices [^1136BwkN]. JACC: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) may increase heart rate in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), which could induce deleterious effects in this population. Information retrieved from implanted cardiac devices may provide more insights into GLP1RA-associated effects on heart rate and arrhythmic events.

Objectives

This study aims to analyze the effects of GLP1RA on device-related rhythm parameters in patients with HFrEF and implanted cardiac devices.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective analysis of outpatients with HFrEF with implanted cardiac devices followed in cardiorenal clinics from a single-center quaternary care hospital in Canada. GLP1RA users were compared with GLP1RA nonusers with similar baseline characteristics for longitudinal changes (1-year follow-up) in heart rate, using data from electrophysiology interrogation reports. Secondary endpoints included relevant arrhythmic events, changes in body mass index (BMI), and laboratory biomarkers.

Results

Among 253 patients with HFrEF and implanted cardiac devices, 53 new GLP1RA users were compared with 53 GLP1RA nonusers. The mean age was 66 ± 10 years, 81% were men, 93% had diabetes, and 36% had atrial fibrillation. The mean BMI was 31.4 kg/m², and the mean ejection fraction was 28% ± 10%. After adjustment, GLP1RA use (vs no use) significantly increased heart rate by +7 beats/min (95% CI: 4–10 beats/min; P < 0.01). GLP1RA use (vs no use) was associated with a numeric increase in ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation events (13 vs 2; P = 0.07) and a significant increase in nonsustained ventricular events and total shock/antitachycardia pacing therapies (33 vs 3; P = 0.01).

Conclusions

In this retrospective analysis of patients with HFrEF and implanted cardiac devices, GLP1RA use was associated with significant increase in heart rate and increased number of nonsustained ventricular events and total shock/antitachycardia pacing therapies. These findings highlight the need for further evaluation of GLP1RA use in HFrEF.

### Cardiovascular effectiveness of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in older patients in routine clinical care with or without history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases or heart failure [^1119HcUH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Head‐to‐head comparison with alternative second‐line medications (SGLT2i and GLP‐1RA in this case) also reduced the potential for confounding by indication by limiting the study comparison to patients with similar indications and similar disease progression (underlying disease severity). Remaining confounding should be minimized by using propensity score–based approaches that allow us to control for a wide range of covariates in various health care settings.

Nonetheless, our observational cohort study could still experience unmeasured or residual confounding attributable to diabetes or CVD severity, given the lack of clinically relevant biomarkers in claims data. We used the results from a prior claims‐based validation study to control for diabetes severity, by adjusting for the number of classes of antihyperglycemic medication use, microvascular or macrovascular complications (nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, peripheral vascular complications, and amputation), hypoglycemia, and the number of hyperglycemia‐related diagnoses. The algorithm has been shown to balance risk factors related to diabetes severity in claims data. We also controlled for conditions that have been shown in a prior study to predict HF severity. Although we did not include hemoglobin A1C and lipid levels in our analyses, a subset (≈10%) of patients have Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System/CPT codes for categories of hemoglobin A1C, low‐density lipoproteins, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. We measured their distributions across our treatment cohorts, and they were balanced before and after PS weighting (Table and Table S7). We also included markers of frailty following a prior algorithm to minimize concerns that older, frail patients might not be prescribed beneficial medications and have worse clinical outcomes.

Table
Distributions of Baseline Characteristics in the Total Cohort Before PS Weighting

We tailored confounding control in each subgroup by estimating PS separately and applied treatment and censoring weights in each subgroup. This approach allows us to control confounding and informative censoring attributable to treatment nonadherence separately within each subgroup, instead of assuming that PS estimated in the whole cohort could balance covariates within each subgroup. We conducted both ITT and AT analyses using both time‐fixed and time‐varying predictors of treatment nonadherence, allowing variable follow‐up times; and all sensitivity analyses supported our primary findings (Tables S14, S22, and S23). We also observed the similar distribution of baseline characteristics among patients who dropped out because of treatment changes versus those who did not, supporting our assumption that censoring of patients because of treatment nonadherence might not lead to selection bias (data not presented).

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^117WzJKy]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Glucose-centric algorithm for glycemic control (persons without established or high ASCVD/HF/stroke/TIA/CKD risk) — initial therapy and escalation: Metformin should be initiated if there is no contraindication (eg, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) and started at a low dose titrated over a few weeks to the maximally tolerated dose. Given T2D progression, many will need a second antihyperglycemic medication to reach targets, which usually occurs within 3 months. Agents such as GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i are associated with low risk of hypoglycemia unless combined with insulin or sulfonylureas. Patients often present with > 1 treatment-shaping factor; in those with overweight/obesity and a weight-loss goal, oral GLP-1 RA, GLP-1 RA, or SGLT2i are preferred options. For cost/access constraints, a TZD, SU, or glinide would be more economical. Patients with symptomatic hyperglycemia and/or an A1C > 10% should start basal insulin; basal can be initiated with or without a GLP-1 RA, and some may need simultaneous bolus insulin.

### Liraglutide in the treatment of heart failure: insight from FIGHT and LIVE [^113piQ92]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

There are many glucose-lowering agents used in patients with heart failure, showing mixed results, this study was conducted to determine the effect of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, on the treatment of patients with heart failure. Patients from the FIGHT and LIVE trials were included, all overlapped data were summarized and described. No significant changes from baseline in left ventricular ejection fraction, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, hemoglobin A1c, heart rate, left ventricular end-systolic volume index, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, and 6 min walk test were observed in FIGHT. In LIVE, liraglutide significantly decreased hemoglobin A1c and inceased 6 min walk test and increased heart rate and serious cardiac adverse events, and there were no statistical differences in left ventricular ejection fraction, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, left ventricular end-systolic volume index, and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index. In this study, we found that there is not enough reason to support the use of liraglutide in patients with heart failure, and importantly, the safety of liraglutide in this particular population remains uncertain. Enhanced recognition the risks and benefits of liraglutide would help guide therapeutic decisions in patients with heart failure.

### Effect of liraglutide on myocardial glucose uptake and blood flow in stable chronic heart failure patients: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled LIVE sub-study [^117JAHq9]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The glucagon-like peptide-1 analog liraglutide increases heart rate and may be associated with more cardiac events in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. We studied whether this could be ascribed to effects on myocardial glucose uptake (MGU), myocardial blood flow (MBF) and MBF reserve (MFR).

Methods and Results

CHF patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45% and without type 2 diabetes were randomized to liraglutide (N = 18) 1.8 mg once daily or placebo (N = 18) for 24 weeks in a double-blinded design. Changes in MGU during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and changes in MBF and MFR from baseline to follow-up were measured quantitatively by 18 F-FDG and 15 O-H₂O positron emission tomography. Compared with placebo, liraglutide reduced weight (P = 0.03), HbA1c (P = 0.03) and the 2-hour glucose value during the OGTT (P = 0.004). Despite this, changes in MGU (P = 0.98), MBF (P = 0.76) and MFR (P = 0.89) from baseline to follow-up did not differ between groups. Furthermore, there was no association between the level of insulin resistance at baseline and changes in MGU in patients treated with liraglutide.

Conclusion

Liraglutide did not affect MGU, MBF, or MFR in non-diabetic CHF patients. Any potential increase in cardiac events in these patients seems not to involve changes in MGU, MBF, or MFR.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy — In patients with symptomatic chronic HFrEF, SGLT2i are recommended to reduce hospitalization for heart failure and cardiovascular mortality irrespective of the presence of type 2 diabetes, and SGLT2i therapy provides intermediate economic value. Across type 2 diabetes cardiovascular outcome trials, the overall 31% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations was noted irrespective of preexisting heart failure, although only 10% to 14% had heart failure at baseline, and the benefit appears independent of glucose-lowering effects; several trials were subsequently launched to examine efficacy in heart failure irrespective of diabetes.

### Baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the exenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering (EXSCEL) [^115vVZ8z]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

EXSCEL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examining the effect of exenatide once-weekly (EQW) versus placebo on time to the primary composite outcome (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and a wide range of cardiovascular (CV) risk.

Methods

Patients were enrolled at 688 sites in 35 countries. We describe their baseline characteristics according to prior CV event status and compare patients with those enrolled in prior glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) outcomes trials.

Results

Of a total of 14,752 participants randomized between June 2010 and September 2015, 6,788 (46.0%) patients were enrolled in Europe; 3,708 (25.1%), North America; 2,727 (18.5%), Latin America; and 1,529 (10.4%), Asia Pacific. Overall, 73% had at least one prior CV event (70% coronary artery disease, 24% peripheral arterial disease, 22% cerebrovascular disease). The median (IQR) age was 63 years (56, 69), 38% were female, median baseline HbA1c was 8.0% (7.3, 8.9) and 16% had a prior history of heart failure. Those without a prior CV event were younger with a shorter duration of diabetes and better renal function than those with at least one prior CV event. Compared with prior GLP-1RA trials, EXSCEL has a larger percentage of patients without a prior CV event and a notable percentage who were taking a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor at baseline (15%).

Conclusions

EXSCEL is one of the largest global GLP-1RA trials, evaluating the safety and efficacy of EQW with a broad patient population that may extend generalizability compared to prior GLP-1RA trials (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01144338).

AACE 2022 diabetes — dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors: DPP-4 inhibitors do not cause weight gain; linagliptin can be administered in chronic kidney disease at full dosage since it is not cleared by the kidneys, whereas sitagliptin, saxagliptin and alogliptin are renally cleared and require appropriate dose adjustment in decreased eGFR. These agents do not have significant gastrointestinal adverse effects and may be used in early combination with metformin. Cardiovascular outcomes trials with DPP-4 inhibitors achieved non-inferiority compared with placebo for major adverse cardiovascular events, and a saxagliptin trial showed increased likelihood of hospitalization for congestive heart failure without increase in mortality; prescribing information advises clinicians to consider the risks and benefits of saxagliptin in patients who have known risk factors.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112fVvk3]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Cardiometabolic disease in type 2 diabetes — integrated management emphasizes concurrent cardiovascular and kidney risk reduction: There is an increasing appreciation of the common pathophysiology and interrelationship of cardiometabolic risk factors leading to both adverse cardiovascular and adverse kidney outcomes in people with diabetes, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). These three comorbidities have been termed cardiometabolic disease or cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health. Reasons to concurrently consider these comorbidities include the major benefit observed across the spectrum of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes treated with sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). Therefore, in addition to the management of hyperglycemia, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 RAs that have demonstrated benefit is considered a foundational element of risk reduction and the pharmacological strategy to improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes.

### Semaglutide versus placebo in people with obesity-related heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a pooled analysis of the STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpEF DM randomised trials [^1162Aj3z]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

In the STEP-HFpEF (NCT04788511) and STEP-HFpEF DM (NCT04916470) trials, the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide improved symptoms, physical limitations, bodyweight, and exercise function in people with obesity-related heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. In this prespecified pooled analysis of the STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpEF DM trials, we aimed to provide a more definitive assessment of the effects of semaglutide across a range of outcomes and to test whether these effects were consistent across key patient subgroups.

Methods

We conducted a prespecified pooled analysis of individual patient data from STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpEF DM, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials at 129 clinical research sites in 18 countries. In both trials, eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, had heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 45%, a BMI of at least 30 kg/m 2, New York Heart Association class II-IV symptoms, and a Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS; a measure of heart failure-related symptoms and physical limitations) of less than 90 points. In STEP-HFpEF, people with diabetes or glycated haemoglobin A 1c concentrations of at least 6·5% were excluded, whereas for inclusion in STEP-HFpEF DM participants had to have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at least 90 days before screening and to have an HbA 1c of 10% or lower. In both trials, participants were randomly assigned to either 2·4 mg semaglutide once weekly or matched placebo for 52 weeks. The dual primary endpoints were change from baseline to week 52 in KCCQ-CSS and bodyweight in all randomly assigned participants. Confirmatory secondary endpoints included change from baseline to week 52 in 6-min walk distance, a hierarchical composite endpoint (all-cause death, heart failure events, and differences in changes in KCCQ-CSS and 6-min walk distance); and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Heterogeneity in treatment effects was assessed across subgroups of interest. We assessed safety in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug.

Findings

Between March 19, 2021 and March 9, 2022, 529 people were randomly assigned in STEP-HFpEF, and between June 27, 2021 and Sept 2, 2022, 616 were randomly assigned in STEP-HFpEF DM. Overall, 1145 were included in our pooled analysis, 573 in the semaglutide group and 572 in the placebo group. Improvements in KCCQ-CSS and reductions in bodyweight between baseline and week 52 were significantly greater in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group (mean between-group difference for the change from baseline to week 52 in KCCQ-CSS 7·5 points [95% CI 5·3 to 9·8]; p < 0·0001; mean between-group difference in bodyweight at week 52–8·4% [-9·2 to -7·5]; p < 0·0001). For the confirmatory secondary endpoints, 6-min walk distance (mean between-group difference at week 52 17·1 metres [9·2 to 25·0]) and the hierarchical composite endpoint (win ratio 1·65 [1·42 to 1·91]) were significantly improved, and CRP concentrations (treatment ratio 0·64 [0·56 to 0·72]) were significantly reduced, in the semaglutide group compared with the placebo group (p < 0·0001 for all comparisons). For the dual primary endpoints, the efficacy of semaglutide was largely consistent across multiple subgroups, including those defined by age, race, sex, BMI, systolic blood pressure, baseline CRP, and left ventricular ejection fraction. 161 serious adverse events were reported in the semaglutide group compared with 301 in the placebo group.

Interpretation

In this prespecified pooled analysis of the STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpEF DM trials, semaglutide was superior to placebo in improving heart failure-related symptoms and physical limitations, and reducing bodyweight in participants with obesity-related heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. These effects were largely consistent across patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Semaglutide was well tolerated.

### A cardiologic approach to non-insulin antidiabetic pharmacotherapy in patients with heart disease [^112Tu7tz]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

Classical non-insulin antihyperglycemic drugs currently approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) comprise five groups: biguanides, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, glitazones and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Novel compounds are represented by the incretin mimetic drugs like glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) agonists (glitazars) and amylin mimetic drugs. We review the cardiovascular effects of these drugs in an attempt to improve knowledge regarding their potential risks when treating T2DM in cardiac patients. Metformin may lead to lethal lactic acidosis, especially in patients with clinical conditions that predispose to this complication, such as recent myocardial infarction, heart or renal failure. Sulfonylureas exert their effect by closing the ATP-dependent potassium channels. This prevents the opening of these channels during myocardial ischemia, impeding the necessary hyperpolarization that protects the cell. The combined sulfonylurea/metformin therapy reveals additive effects on mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Meglitinides effects are similar to those of sulfonylureas, due to their almost analogous mechanism of action. Glitazones lower leptin levels, leading to weight gain and are unsafe in NYHA class III or IV. The long-term effects of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors on morbidity and mortality rates is yet unknown. The incretin GLP-1 is associated with reductions in body weight and appears to present positive inotropic effects. DPP-4 inhibitors influences on the cardiovascular system seem to be neutral and patients do not gain weight. The future of glitazars is presently uncertain following concerns about their safety. The amylin mimetic drug paramlintide, while a satisfactory adjuvant medication in insulin-dependent diabetes, is unlikely to play a major role in the management of T2DM. Summarizing the present information it can be stated that 1. Four out the five classical oral antidiabetic drug groups present proven or potential cardiac hazards; 2. These hazards are not mere 'side effects', but biochemical phenomena which are deeply rooted in the drugs' mechanism of action; 3. Current data indicate that the combined glibenclamide/metformin therapy seems to present special risk and should be avoided in the long-term management of T2DM with proven CAD; 4. Glitazones should be avoided in patients with overt heart failure; 5, The novel incretin mimetic drugs and DPP-4 inhibitors — while usually inadequate as monotherapy — appear to be satisfactory adjuvant drugs due to the lack of known undesirable cardiovascular effects; 6. Customized antihyperglycemic pharmacological approaches should be implemented for the achievement of optimal treatment of T2DM patients with heart disease. In this context, it should be carefully taken into consideration whether the leading clinical status is CAD or heart failure.

### The effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists on cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes [^115kJCbs]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The LEADER trial, one of the first GLP‐1 agonist trials evaluated the effects of the addition of liraglutide, a GLP‐1 agonist, on MACE, defined as CV death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke, in 9340 patients with diabetes and elevated cardiovascular risk when compared with placebo. 44 72% of these patients had established cardiovascular disease at baseline; mean glycated hemoglobin level was 8.7%. 44 After a median of 3.8 years of follow up, 13.0% of patients in the liraglutide group had experienced MACE, compared to 14.9% in the placebo group (P = 0.01, HR 0.87). 44 While the overall rate of myocardial infarction was slightly lower in the liraglutide group (1.6 vs 1.9 per 100 patient‐years in placebo, P = 0.046), no significant trends were observed in rates of fatal MI, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. 44 At 36 months, patients in the liraglutide group experienced an average decrease in weight of 2.3 kg more than those in the placebo group, in addition to a 1.2 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure and an increase in heart rate of 3.0 beats per minute. Patients in the liraglutide group had elevated amylase and lipase compared to those in the placebo group, as well as a non‐significantly elevated incidence of pancreatic carcinomas (0.3% vs 0.1%, P = 0.06). 44 Glycated hemoglobin levels in the liraglutide group were 0.40 percentage points lower than those of the placebo group. 44 The FIGHT trial evaluated the use of liraglutide in patients recently hospitalized with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and did not show any clinical benefit post heart failure hospitalization. 45 The LIVE trial evaluated the use of liraglutide on patients with advanced cardiomyopathy and chronic heart failure. This study not only confirmed prior results but also showed that liraglutide is associated with an increase in heart rate as well as more serious cardiac adverse events in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular function. 46

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients [^111cVXHv]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Topic 6: Management of cardiovascular risk after heart transplantation — diabetes management is described as similar to general practice, with metformin retained when renal function allows. Specifically, "Monitoring and management of diabetes in heart transplant recipients is performed similarly to the general population", and "Metformin remains an excellent agent in patients without advanced renal failure". Sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) "have proven effective in reducing major cardiovascular and renal events in patients with diabetes", and "reduce the risk of hospitalization or death from cardiovascular causes in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes". Transplant data include "A small series in 16 heart transplant recipients" with SGLT2 therapy over a "median 9 months", showing reductions in "body weight, blood pressure, and furosemide dose" with "no adverse infectious events and no significant drug-drug interactions (other than the reduction in furosemide dose)", and "a recent retrospective study of 21 heart transplant recipients with type 2 diabetes" showing weight loss and reductions in insulin use, hemoglobin A1c, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol without adverse events. Given limited transplant experience, "SGLT2 inhibitors can be considered as an option to manage post-transplant diabetes mellitus in select heart transplant recipients", with the caveat that "Replication of these findings in large prospective trials is required before widespread endorsement of these agents can be made in the post-transplant setting".

### Risk of adverse events with liraglutide in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: a post hoc analysis of the FIGHT trial [^115CyVKj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Given the potential adverse effects of GLP‐1RAs in HFrEF, in patients with T2D or obesity with symptoms suggestive of or clinical suspicion of HF, an echocardiogram and natriuretic peptides may be considered before starting the treatment. On the other hand, in those without HFrEF, our results should not discourage clinicians from using GLP‐1RAs, given their well‐established atherosclerotic cardiovascular benefit in T2Dand their potential cardiovascular benefits in obesity.

Our study has some limitations. This was a post hoc analysis of an RCT and some studied endpoints did not reach the statistical significance threshold of 0.05; however, the consistent trend for increased risk of adverse events across different outcomes, the biological plausibility, and the finding of similar results in the LIVE trial provide robustness to our analyses. This RCT had a short follow‐up (6 months) and a modest size sample (300 participants); however, the remarkably high‐risk population included led to a high number of "hard" outcomes during the trial. The increased risk observed in this high‐risk population with a recent hospitalization may not apply to other groups of patients with HFrEF. The FIGHT trial was conducted between August 2013 and March 2015, and new therapeutic interventions have been introduced since then in the management of HFrEF (including ARNI and SGLT2 inhibitors); although the potential detrimental effects of GLP‐1RAs are not expected to be modified by the current management of HFrEF, we cannot exclude this possibility. We could not determine the cause of HF decompensation that led to hospitalization, but it is possible that arrythmias could have contributed to some of these HF events. No correction for multiplicity of tests was made, which may increase the risk of chance findings and type I error.
