## Question

can we use pioglitazone and insulin together?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pioglitazone can be used together with insulin in type 2 diabetes, and if so, how to do it safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about regulatory approval and whether combination therapy is indicated. Then, I should verify the mechanistic rationale for combining an insulin sensitizer with exogenous insulin. Next, I will review clinical efficacy data, followed by safety concerns and contraindications. After that, I need to check guideline positions and practical dosing strategies, including how to adjust insulin. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check areas of controversy like cardiovascular signals and bladder cancer risk before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status, because I need to ensure we are not overstepping labeled indications. The FDA labeling for pioglitazone supports use as monotherapy or in combination with other agents, explicitly including insulin, and describes additive glycemic effects when combined with insulin in controlled trials, which establishes that the combination is both approved and evidence-based in appropriate patients with type 2 diabetes [^114YfBqH] [^112K9Hs2] [^113a9kPu].

> Now, I should review the mechanistic rationale to make sure this pairing makes physiologic sense. Pioglitazone is a PPAR-γ agonist that reduces insulin resistance in liver and muscle and requires the presence of insulin for its antihyperglycemic effect, so combining it with exogenous insulin targets both insulin supply and insulin action, which is complementary and mechanistically coherent for insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes [^113BTY9i] [^114d9U61].

> Next, I will examine clinical efficacy, and I need to check whether the benefits are consistent across studies. Randomized trials and FDA summaries show that adding pioglitazone to insulin reduces HbA1c by roughly 1.2–1.5% and often allows a reduction in total daily insulin dose by about 5–12 units, with durable effects observed in longer-term outcome datasets, including PROactive where insulin-treated patients on pioglitazone had lower mean insulin doses and greater A1C reductions than placebo [^112bdY2t] [^112BNBKW] [^112vngHm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without checking the major risks. The most prominent concern is fluid retention and heart failure exacerbation, which is dose-related and more frequent with insulin coadministration; FDA labeling carries a boxed warning and recommends vigilance for edema, dyspnea, and rapid weight gain, with dose reduction or discontinuation if heart failure develops, and major society guidance advises avoiding pioglitazone in patients with or at risk for heart failure [^115pqhqr] [^115TrxBU] [^115e7mf6].

> I should also confirm hypoglycemia risk and insulin adjustment guidance. Because pioglitazone enhances insulin sensitivity, the risk of hypoglycemia increases when combined with insulin, and labeling advises reducing the insulin dose by about 10–25% if hypoglycemia occurs and then individualizing further adjustments, which I need to ensure is incorporated into the titration plan [^112jSEEU] [^113GAD45].

> Let me consider other important adverse effects so I do not miss counseling points. Pioglitazone is associated with weight gain of roughly 2–5 kg, edema, and increased fracture risk, particularly in women; there are also postmarketing signals for macular edema and rare hepatotoxicity, and an ongoing but debated concern for bladder cancer, so baseline and symptom-triggered liver tests, weight and edema checks, and fracture risk assessment are prudent [^114ypSZs] [^113c1Hs9] [^115pqhqr].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to ensure my recommendation aligns with contemporary standards. ADA/EASD guidance supports a person-centered approach and notes that adjunctive pioglitazone may help improve glycemia and reduce insulin requirements in selected patients, while emphasizing caution in heart failure and older adults; specialty guidance for older adults explicitly advises very cautious use with insulin due to fluid retention and fall/fracture risk, and ESC guidance recommends avoiding pioglitazone in patients with or at risk for heart failure [^117TKWu3] [^116RRTgX] [^115e7mf6].

> I will now examine practical implementation, and I need to double-check dosing and titration details. Typical pioglitazone dosing is 15–45 mg daily, with many clinicians favoring 15–30 mg when combining with insulin to mitigate edema and weight gain; when adding pioglitazone, consider preemptively lowering the insulin dose by about 10–20% in patients prone to hypoglycemia, then titrate insulin based on fasting and premeal glucose while monitoring for edema and weight changes over the first 4–8 weeks [^115pqhqr] [^112jSEEU] [^113PDkvg].

> But wait, what about cardiovascular outcomes and conflicting signals, since that often drives decision-making. Meta-analytic and trial data suggest pioglitazone may reduce myocardial infarction and stroke, yet observational data from Taiwan suggest increased ischemic heart disease risk when pioglitazone is added to insulin on a background of metformin, so I should frame this as uncertain benefit–risk and individualize based on ASCVD risk, heart failure status, and patient preferences, documenting shared decision-making [^113ERH8H] [^113XXCey] [^114fwPzv].

> Let me synthesize a balanced recommendation. Yes, pioglitazone can be used with insulin in appropriately selected adults with type 2 diabetes who have persistent hyperglycemia on insulin, particularly if insulin resistance is prominent, provided there is no heart failure or high risk for fluid overload, and after discussing weight gain, edema, fracture risk, and the need for proactive insulin dose adjustments. In patients with established CVD or high risk, consider GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors first-line and reserve pioglitazone as an adjunct when additional A1C lowering is needed and safety screening is acceptable [^113PDkvg] [^115pqhqr].

> Finally, I need to ensure the monitoring plan is explicit. Before starting, obtain liver enzymes, assess heart failure risk, edema, and fracture risk. After initiation, check weight and edema at each visit for the first 3 months, review hypoglycemia logs and adjust insulin as needed, and reassess A1C in about 3 months. If edema or heart failure symptoms emerge, reduce dose or discontinue, and if ALT exceeds 3 times the upper limit of normal with symptoms, stop and evaluate for liver injury, documenting all counseling and shared decisions [^115pqhqr] [^113c1Hs9] [^115TrxBU].

---

Pioglitazone and insulin can be used together in type 2 diabetes, but **monitor closely for edema and heart failure** [^115pqhqr] because pioglitazone increases fluid retention risk, especially with insulin [^116tEtqY]. The combination improves **glycemic control** and can reduce insulin requirements [^112bdY2t], but **weight gain and hypoglycemia** are more likely [^114ypSZs], so adjust insulin and monitor for edema and heart failure [^115pqhqr]. Avoid pioglitazone in patients with heart failure or at high risk for it [^115e7mf6], and use the lowest effective dose with regular follow-up [^116RRTgX].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting combination therapy

Several clinical trials and studies have evaluated the **efficacy and safety** of combining pioglitazone with insulin therapy:

- **Glycemic control**: Pioglitazone added to insulin significantly improves glycemic control, reducing HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose levels [^112bdY2t] [^112BNBKW].

- **Insulin dose reduction**: The combination allows for a reduction in daily insulin requirements, with studies reporting a mean reduction of approximately 12 units per day [^112vngHm] [^112BNBKW].

- **Lipid profile**: Pioglitazone improves lipid parameters, including increases in HDL cholesterol and reductions in triglycerides [^112vngHm] [^112K9Hs2].

---

## Potential benefits of combination therapy

The combination of pioglitazone and insulin offers several **clinical benefits**:

| **Benefit** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|
| Improved glycemic control | Significant reductions in HbA1c and fasting glucose levels [^112bdY2t] |
| Reduced insulin dose | Decreased daily insulin requirements by approximately 12 units [^112vngHm] [^112BNBKW] |
| Improved lipid profile | Increased HDL cholesterol and reduced triglycerides [^112vngHm] [^112K9Hs2] |
| Beta-cell function | Potential improvement in beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity [^113aETvJ] |

---

## Risks and adverse effects

While the combination therapy offers benefits, it is also associated with **significant risks and adverse effects**:

- **Fluid retention and heart failure**: Pioglitazone can cause dose-related fluid retention, which may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure, particularly when combined with insulin [^115pqhqr] [^116tEtqY].

- **Weight gain**: The combination therapy is associated with significant weight gain, averaging approximately 3.8 kg in clinical trials [^114ypSZs] [^112vngHm].

- **Hypoglycemia**: Increased risk of hypoglycemia due to enhanced insulin sensitivity, necessitating careful insulin dose adjustment [^115pqhqr] [^113GAD45].

- **Bone fractures**: Increased risk of bone fractures, particularly in female patients [^113c1Hs9].

- **Bladder cancer**: Controversial association with increased risk of bladder cancer, requiring cautious consideration in patients with a history of bladder cancer [^113c1Hs9].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines provide **specific recommendations** regarding the use of pioglitazone in combination with insulin:

- **ADA 2025 guidelines**: Adjunctive use of pioglitazone may be considered to improve glycemia and reduce insulin requirements, but careful monitoring for fluid retention and heart failure is essential [^117TKWu3].

- **ESC 2023 guidelines**: Pioglitazone is not recommended for patients at risk of heart failure or with previous heart failure due to increased risk of incident heart failure [^115e7mf6].

- **VA/DoD guidelines**: Pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with heart failure or high risk of fluid overload, and caution is advised in older adults due to increased risk of edema and heart failure [^113RA6go] [^116RRTgX].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from combination therapy

Certain patient populations may benefit from the combination of pioglitazone and insulin therapy:

- **Highly insulin-resistant patients**: Patients with pronounced insulin resistance may experience significant improvements in glycemic control and insulin sensitivity [^112BNBKW].

- **Patients with dyslipidemia**: Pioglitazone's favorable effects on lipid parameters may benefit patients with concurrent dyslipidemia [^112K9Hs2].

- **Patients unable to achieve glycemic targets with insulin alone**: The combination therapy may be considered for patients who fail to achieve glycemic targets despite optimized insulin therapy [^114ypSZs].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

To minimize risks associated with combination therapy, the following **monitoring and management strategies** are recommended:

- **Regular monitoring**: Frequent monitoring of weight, edema, and signs of heart failure is essential [^115pqhqr].

- **Insulin dose adjustment**: Insulin doses should be carefully adjusted to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia [^113GAD45].

- **Bone health monitoring**: Regular assessment of bone health, particularly in female patients, is recommended [^notfound].

- **Liver function tests**: Periodic liver function tests are advised due to potential hepatic adverse effects [^notfound].

---

## Alternative therapeutic options

If the risks associated with pioglitazone and insulin combination therapy outweigh the benefits, **alternative therapeutic options** may be considered:

- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: These agents provide significant glycemic control, weight loss, and cardiovascular benefits [^111gnj4N].

- **SGLT-2 inhibitors**: These agents offer glycemic control, weight loss, and cardiovascular risk reduction [^111gnj4N].

- **Metformin**: Continues to be a first-line therapy due to its favorable safety profile and efficacy [^111PirjK].

---

Pioglitazone and insulin can be used together in type 2 diabetes, providing improved glycemic control and reduced insulin requirements, but **careful monitoring** is essential due to risks of fluid retention, heart failure, weight gain, and hypoglycemia. The combination is **not recommended** for patients with heart failure or at high risk of fluid overload.

### Efficacy and safety of pioglitazone add-on in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with metformin and dapagliflozin: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^11285MgJ]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for over 90% of diabetes cases worldwide. Its pathophysiology primarily involves progressive dysfunction of pancreatic β‐cells and deteriorating insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Most patients with T2DM require a combination of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) with different mechanisms of action to achieve glycaemic control and prevent long‐term complications. When two‐drug therapy fails to achieve euglycemia, a third agent is typically added to the regimen.

Sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have become a standard add‐on option due to their unique insulin‐independent mechanism, which promotes urinary glucose excretion by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubule. This mechanism minimises the risk of hypoglycaemia while conferring benefits on visceral adiposity, hyperuricaemia, lipid profile and blood pressure. Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes, primarily attributed to their osmotic diuretic effect. However, despite their favourable safety profile, they are associated with adverse events such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), genitourinary infections and hypotension. Current guidelines by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology endorse SGLT2 inhibitors as a core component of T2DM management, particularly for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease.

Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, works by activating the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐γ (PPAR‐γ), thereby enhancing insulin sensitivity in various tissues. Extensive clinical trials have demonstrated that pioglitazone significantly reduces the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke and may also slow the progression of atherosclerosis. However, side effects, including weight gain and plasma volume expansion, which may precipitate heart failure, have limited its use as a monotherapy. Combining pioglitazone with SGLT2 inhibitors may provide a synergistic effect by mitigating pioglitazone‐associated fluid retention and weight gain without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia.

Evidence on the efficacy and safety of adding pioglitazone as a third agent for patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors is limited. This systematic review and meta‐analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pioglitazone as an add‐on therapy for patients with T2DM who are not achieving glycaemic targets with dual therapy.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117TKWu3]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Combination injectable therapy and prandial insulin — indications and dosing — indicates that if basal insulin has been titrated to an acceptable fasting blood glucose level and A1C remains above goal, if there is evidence of significant postprandial hyperglycemia, or if signs of overbasalization are present, advancement to combination injectable therapy is necessary. This approach can use a GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA added to basal insulin or multiple doses of prandial insulin, and if an individual is not already being treated with these, a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA should be considered prior to starting prandial insulin. Starting with a single prandial dose with the largest meal of the day is simple and effective. We suggest starting with a prandial insulin dose of 4 units or 10% of the amount of basal insulin at the largest meal or the meal with the greatest postprandial excursion. Individuals with type 2 diabetes require higher daily doses (~1 unit/kg). When initiating intensification of insulin therapy, metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 RAs (or a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA) should be maintained, use of sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and DPP-4 inhibitors should be limited or discontinued, and adjunctive use of pioglitazone may help to improve glycemia and reduce the amount of insulin needed.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to management of CVD, glucose-lowering medications, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to do not use pioglitazone for glucose-lowering treatment in patients at risk of HF (or with previous HF) because of the increased risk of incident HF in patients with diabetes.

### Combination therapy with pioglitazone / exenatide improves β-cell function and produces superior glycaemic control compared with basal / bolus insulin in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes: a 3-year follow-up of the Qatar study [^114k8s4D]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To examine the long-term efficacy of thiazolidinedione plus a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist versus basal-bolus insulin on glycaemic control and beta-cell function in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (T2D) on metformin plus sulphonylurea.

Materials and Methods

Three hundred and thirty-one patients with poorly controlled T2D were recruited over 3years and were followed for an additional year. Subjects received a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at baseline and at study end. After completing the baseline OGTT, subjects were randomized to receive either pioglitazone plus weekly exenatide (combination therapy) or basal/bolus insulin (insulin therapy) to maintain an HbA1c of less than 7.0%. The primary outcome of the study was the difference in HbA1c at study end between the two treatment groups.

Results

Both therapies caused a robust decrease in HbA1c. However, combination therapy caused a greater decrement (-1.1%, P < .0001) than insulin therapy, and more subjects in the combination therapy group (86%) achieved the American Diabetes Association goal of glycaemic control (HbA1c < 7.0%) than those in the insulin therapy group (44%) (P < .0001). Both therapies improved insulin secretion. However, the improvement in insulin secretion with combination therapy was 2.5-fold greater (P < .001) than with insulin therapy (50%). Insulin therapy caused more weight gain and hypoglycaemia.

Conclusion

Both combination therapy and insulin therapy effectively reduced HbA1c in poorly controlled T2D on multiple oral agents. However, combination therapy produced a greater improvement in insulin secretion and decrease in HbA1c with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia.

### Effect of pioglitazone in combination with insulin therapy on glycaemic control, insulin dose requirement and lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes previously poorly controlled with combination therapy [^112vngHm]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this randomized placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pioglitazone administered alone or in combination with metformin in reducing insulin dosage requirements for improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes previously poorly controlled with combination therapy.

Methods

In this multicentre, double-blind study, 222 patients with haemoglobin A1c (HbA(1c)) > 8.0% at screening treated with combination therapy initially were given titrated insulin therapy (to fasting plasma glucose < 140 mg/dl) and then were randomly assigned to 20-week treatment with pioglitazone or placebo in combination with insulin, with or without concurrent metformin therapy. More than 98% of patients were taking metformin prior to and during the study.

Results

Pioglitazone significantly reduced (p < 0.05) insulin dose requirements 2 weeks after treatment initiation. At study end relative to baseline, pioglitazone reduced daily insulin dosages by 12.0 units (p < 0.001), a 21.5% (12.0/55.8 units at baseline) group mean average reduction. Relative to placebo, pioglitazone reduced daily insulin dosages by 12.7 units [95% confidence interval [CI]: -17.5, -8.0], while improving mean HbA(1c) levels [adjusted mean HbA(1c) change: pioglitazone, -1.6% vs. placebo, -1.4% (not statistically different)]. Pioglitazone also significantly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [adjusted mean difference: +4.5 (95% CI: 2.6–6.5) mg/dl], decreased triglyceride levels [-43.9 (-69.2, -18.6) mg/dl], shifted low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle concentrations from small [pattern B, -13.6% (-17.7%, -9.5%)] to large [pattern A, +15.1% (10.8%, 19.5%)] and increased mean LDL particle size [+3.8 (2.6, 4.9) A]. More pioglitazone-treated patients experienced oedema (9.0 vs. 4.5%) and weight gain (9.1 vs. 2.7%) than placebo patients.

Conclusions

Pioglitazone in combination with insulin therapy improved glycaemic control, reduced insulin dose requirements and improved lipid profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes previously poorly controlled with combination therapy.

### How long can insulin therapy be avoided in the patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus by use of a combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea? [^114aWdmK]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effective longevity of combination double oral therapy before insulin or triple oral therapy is needed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of our first 100 patients with type 2 diabetes who were successfully transferred from twice-daily mixed NPH and regular insulin to a combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea.

Results

Of the 100 study patients, 40 had well-controlled plasma glucose (glycosylated hemoglobin levels < 8.0%) with use of metformin and a sulfonylurea. Good glycemic control was achieved with triple oral therapy (a sulfonylurea, metformin, and a thiazolidinedione) in 14 patients and with a sulfonylurea, metformin, and evening-administered mixed NPH and regular insulin in 7. In addition, plasma glucose was effectively controlled with twice-daily mixed NPH and regular insulin in conjunction with metformin or a thiazolidinedione (or both) in 22 patients and with twice-daily mixed NPH and regular insulin alone in 17. The mean time (± standard error) from primary failure of sulfonylurea monotherapy to the time when a third hypoglycemic agent was needed was 7.9 ± 1.1 years (95% confidence interval, 5.7 to 10.1).

Conclusion

When oral monotherapy fails (that is, glycosylated hemoglobin values exceed 8.0%) in patients with type 2 diabetes, combination therapy with a sulfonylurea and metformin is potentially effective in maintaining glycemic control and avoiding the addition of insulin or a thiazolidinedione for a mean duration of 7.9 years.

### Pioglitazone hcl and metformin hydrochloride [^112geNFi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets combine two antihyperglycemic agents: pioglitazone and metformin.

Pioglitazone

Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Pioglitazone is an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.

In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.

Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.

Metformin HCl

Metformin HCl improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or healthy subjects [except in specific circumstances, see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.

### Practical strategies for improving outcomes in T2DM: the potential role of pioglitazone and DPP4 inhibitors [^112LeMDK]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

T2DM is a complex disease underlined by multiple pathogenic defects responsible for the development and progression of hyperglycaemia. Each of these factors can now be tackled in a more targeted manner thanks to glucose-lowering drugs that have been made available in the past 2 to 3 decades. Recognition of the multiplicity of the mechanisms underlying hyperglycaemia calls for treatments that address more than 1 of these mechanisms, with more emphasis placed on the earlier use of combination therapies. Although chronic hyperglycaemia contributes to and amplifies cardiovascular risk, several trials have failed to show a marked effect from intensive glycaemic control. During the past 10 years, the effect of specific glucose-lowering agents on cardiovascular risk has been explored with dedicated trials. Overall, the cardiovascular safety of the new glucose-lowering agents has been proven with some of the trials summarized in this review, showing significant reduction of cardiovascular risk. Against this background, pioglitazone, in addition to exerting a sustained glucose-lowering effect, also has ancillary metabolic actions of potential interest in addressing the cardiovascular risk of T2DM, such as preservation of beta-cell mass and function. As such, it seems a logical agent to combine with other oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents, including dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i). DPP4i, which may also have a potential to preserve beta-cell function, is available as a fixed-dose combination with pioglitazone, and could, potentially, attenuate some of the side effects of pioglitazone, particularly if a lower dose of the thiazolidinedione is used. This review critically discusses the potential for early combination of pioglitazone and DPP4i.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor plus pioglitazone vs pioglitazone alone in patients with diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114rCCEn]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive disease characterized by insulin resistance, deterioration of β‐cell function and impaired glucose tolerance. 1 In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), roughly 50% of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients were adequately controlled with monotherapy after 3 years, which declined to only about 25% after 9 years. 2 Combination therapy of oral anti‐hyperglycaemic agents appears to be a more viable strategy for improving glycaemic control.

Multiple classes of oral anti‐hyperglycaemic agents are available. 3 Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, increases insulin sensitivity and decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis. 4 Pioglitazone reduces the risk of cardiovascular events, 5, 6 which is important because type 2 diabetic patients are greatly burdened by cardiovascular disease. 7 However, pioglitazone has adverse effects of fluid retention, body weight gain and heart failure. 8, 9 Sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT‐2) inhibitor, a new class of oral anti‐hyperglycaemic agent, increases urinary glucose excretion by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption and facilitating net calorie loss. 10 Moreover, the mild osmotic diuresis 10 and caloric loss caused by SGLT‐2 inhibitors reduce body weight, oedema and risk of heart failure. 11, 12, 13

Combining pioglitazone with an SGLT‐2 inhibitor to balance fluid status and body weight might enhance glycaemic and other vascular risk factor control, while reducing side effects among type 2 diabetics. To better assess this notion, we conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy (eg, glycaemic control) and safety (eg, hypoglycaemia, weight change, urinary/genital tract infection) of combined therapy with pioglitazone plus SGLT‐2 inhibitors versus pioglitazone alone, in type 2 diabetic patients.

### Earlier triple therapy with pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes [^115gDDFR]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

This study assessed the efficacy of add-on pioglitazone vs. placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled by metformin and a sulphonylurea or a glinide.

Methods

This multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group study randomized 299 patients with type 2 diabetes to receive 30 mg/day pioglitazone or placebo for 3 months. After this time, patients continued with pioglitazone, either 30 mg [if glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA(1c)) ≤ 6.5%] or titrated up to 45 mg (if HbA(1c) > 6.5%), or placebo for a further 4 months. The primary efficacy end-point was improvement in HbA(1c) (per cent change). Secondary end-points included changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin and lipids. The proinsulin/insulin ratio and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) were calculated.

Results

Pioglitazone add-on therapy to failing metformin and sulphonylurea or glinide combination therapy showed statistically more significant glycaemic control than placebo addition. The between-group difference after 7 months of triple therapy was 1.18% in HbA(1c) and -2.56 mmol/l for FPG (p < 0.001). Almost half (44.4%) of the patients in the pioglitazone group who had a baseline HbA(1c) level of < 8.5% achieved the HbA(1c) target of < 7.0% by final visit compared with 4.9% in the placebo group. When the baseline HbA(1c) level was ≥ 8.5%, 13% achieved the HbA(1c) target of < 7.0% in the pioglitazone group and none in the placebo group. HOMA-IR, insulin, proinsulin and C-peptide decreased and HOMA-B increased in the pioglitazone group relative to the placebo group.

Conclusions

In patients who were not well controlled with dual combination therapy, the early addition of pioglitazone improved HbA(1c), FPG and surrogate measures of beta-cell function. Patients were more likely to reach target HbA(1c) levels (< 7.0%) with pioglitazone treatment if their baseline HbA(1c) levels were < 8.5%, highlighting the importance of early triple therapy.

### Pioglitazone improved insulin sensitivity and first phase insulin secretion among obese and lean people with diabetes: a multicenter clamp study [^1133pv5f]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Limitation

Clinically, PIO is not a new antidiabetic agent, and its effect on plasma glucose reduction is well established. The main purpose of the present study was to confirm if PIO is effective in decreasing plasma glucose in both obese and non-obese type 2 diabetes patients, but not to compare the effectiveness between different groups. Therefore we did not use an untreated control group here. However, in order to avoid confounders, subjects who under some conditions may have experienced modified glucose metabolism were excluded, and all participants were required to retain their usual diet and lifestyle.

Safety issues with pioglitazone

The clinical use of pioglitazone is limited by the risk of adverse events, including weight gain, CHF, bone fractures, macular edema, and possibly bladder cancer. Increase in mean body weight was 3.6 kg in the PROactive study, but interestingly, weight gain rather than weight loss was associated with an improved survival in patients treated with pioglitazone in a post hoc analysis of the PROactive population. Although weight gain can be problematic in some cases, a recent large observational study showed that weight gain was rarely the cause of withdrawal of pioglitazone therapy (0.9% of 12,772 patients).

Edema occurs in ~5% of patients treated with pioglitazone in monotherapy or in oral combination therapy and in ~10% of patients treated with TZDs in combination with insulin. Although edema rate may be somewhat higher in patients with contraindications for pioglitazone, a recent large observational study showed that edema was rarely the cause (0.9% of 12,772 patients) of withdrawal of pioglitazone therapy. In the PROactive study, 5.7 and 4.1% of pioglitazone and placebo patients, respectively, were admitted to hospital with CHF; however, mortality rates due to CHF were similar (0.96 vs. 0.84%; P = NS). Interestingly, fewer pioglitazone patients with serious CHF had a combined end point of death, MI, or stroke compared with placebo patients (34.9 vs. 47.2%; P = 0.025). The underlying mechanism of both edema and CHF exacerbation is likely to be fluid retention and plasma volume expansion. Mouse models show that pioglitazone activation of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ receptors in the distal nephron increases sodium reabsorption through the epithelial Na + channel. In humans, pioglitazone has been shown to decrease urine sodium excretion and also to increase plasma renin and aldosterone levels. Increased vasodilation and increased vascular permeability may also contribute to edema.

### Pioglitazone (Actos) [^115pqhqr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Congestive Heart Failure

ACTOS, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when ACTOS is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of ACTOS must be considered [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.2 Hypoglycemia

Patients receiving ACTOS in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Triaging and initial treatment in the patient with suspected type 2 diabetes [^111vKSNn]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Insulin titration protocol: weaning — manage insulin reduction with the following steps and thresholds. If still on MDI, stop short acting insulin and contact approximately every 3 days to review glucoses. Wait until fasting numbers are < 100 mg/dl for at least 2–3 days in a 5–7 day period. If so, cut back long-acting insulin dose by 20%/10 units, but may consider 30%/15–20 units if glucoses are 80 mg/dl or less, and consider reliability of patient contact when making the decision to more aggressively wean insulin. Once the dose is down to 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day, consider stopping, and consider using a small decrease in insulin as a motivational factor to continue to maintain contact. If patient was lost to follow-up between onset visit and follow-up visit, but has an HbA1c < 6% 3 months+ after diagnosis and is on full-dose metformin (or pioglitazone), stop long-acting insulin with careful monitoring after. If HbA1c is 6.5–7% at the next visit, add a second agent.

### Efficacy and safety of pioglitazone, empagliflozin and glimepiride as third-line agents in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin and DPP-4 inhibitors: a multicentre, phase 4 randomized controlled trial [^111JMNQA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the aforementioned limitations, this study has notable strengths and important clinical implications. Specifically, the differential effects observed in secondary outcomes such as body weight, lipid profiles and insulin sensitivity highlight the distinct metabolic profiles of the three agents. For instance, empagliflozin is associated with weight reduction and modest improvements in HDL‐C levels, suggesting its benefits for patients with obesity or metabolic syndromes. Pioglitazone led to the most favourable changes in triglyceride and HDL‐C levels, reinforcing its role in patients with pronounced insulin resistance or atherogenic dyslipidaemia, despite its known effect on weight gain. In contrast, glimepiride showed robust glycaemic efficacy but was accompanied by weight gain, a reduction in HDL‐C and a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia, which may limit its use in certain patient groups. Although modest in absolute terms, these differences were clinically meaningful. They underscore the importance of moving beyond a one‐size‐fits‐all approach and instead adopting a patient‐centred treatment strategy that considers individual metabolic profiles, comorbidities and treatment goals. This nuanced understanding can help guide personalised and effective decision‐making when selecting third‐line agents for routine clinical practice.

In conclusion, this study showed that adding empagliflozin, pioglitazone, or glimepiride to a combination of metformin and a DPP‐4 inhibitor significantly improves glycaemic control in Korean patients with T2D inadequately managed with dual oral therapy. All three agents significantly reduced HbA1c levels when added as a third oral glucose‐lowering drug, while exhibiting distinct profiles with respect to body weight, lipid parameters, insulin sensitivity and adverse events. These findings underscore the need for a patient‐centred approach when selecting a third‐line therapy, considering individual metabolic characteristics, comorbidities and treatment priorities. Long‐term studies are required to further assess the durability of glycaemic control and the broader cardiometabolic outcomes associated with these combination regimens in diverse populations.

### Pioglitazone use in combination with insulin in the prospective pioglitazone clinical trial in macrovascular events study (PROactive19) [^112BNBKW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

In this post hoc analysis, we examined insulin requirements and regimens, glycemic control, cardiovascular outcomes, and safety in the patients treated with insulin at baseline in the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events study.

Design

The Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled outcome study (mean follow-up 34.5 months) in 5238 high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes randomized to pioglitazone (force titrated to 45 mg) or placebo. One third of the total population (pioglitazone 864; placebo 896) were receiving insulin at baseline.

Results

A rapid and sustained decrease in insulin dose was observed with pioglitazone vs. a progressive increase with placebo. By study end, the mean insulin dose was lower with pioglitazone (42 vs. 55 U/d with placebo; P < 0.0001). The insulin regimen (number on insulin, need for multiple injections, and reduction in oral agents) had been simplified vs. placebo; nevertheless, a greater glycosylated hemoglobin reduction was observed with pioglitazone (-0.93%) vs. placebo (-0.45%; P < 0.0001). At the final visit, insulin had been discontinued in 9% of pioglitazone vs. 2% of placebo patients (P < 0.0001). More insulin-resistant patients (defined as poorly controlled type 2 diabetes despite high doses of insulin) in the pioglitazone plus insulin group showed the greatest glycosylated hemoglobin decline. There were nonsignificant reductions with pioglitazone relative to placebo in the cardiovascular primary (hazard ratio 0.86; 95% confidence interval 0.71, 1.04; P = 0.1198) and main secondary (hazard ratio 0.85; 95% confidence interval 0.67, 1.08; P = 0.1831) end points in insulin-treated patients. The rates of overall heart failure, edema, and hypoglycemia were higher with pioglitazone [13.5 vs 10.5% (P = 0.0489); 30.8 vs. 18.2% (P < 0.0001); and 42.1 vs 29.0% (P < 0.0001), respectively], but there were no significant differences in serious events.

Conclusions

Pioglitazone use in combination with insulin resulted in a sustained improved glycemic control and allowed the treatment regimens to be simplified and the insulin doses reduced.

### Efficacy and safety of biphasic insulin aspart 30 combined with pioglitazone in type 2 diabetes poorly controlled on glibenclamide (glyburide) monotherapy or combination therapy: an 18-week, randomized, open-label study [^1115Fkgf]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Few large randomized controlled trials have assessed the value of adding insulin to an oral antidiabetic drug regimen.

Objective

This trial compared the efficacy and safety of biphasic insulin aspart 30/70 (BIAsp 30) plus pioglitazone (n = 93), glibenclamide (glyburide) plus pioglitazone (n = 91), or BIAsp 30 monotherapy (n = 97).

Methods

This 18-week, multinational, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial involved 281 patients with type 2 diabetes (60% male; mean age, 56 years; mean body mass index, 29.5 kg/m²) with inadequate glycemic control (mean glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA(1c)], 9.5%; range, 7.4%-14.7%) on glibenclamide monotherapy or combination therapy. The primary objective was to compare end-of-trial HbA(1c) among the 3 treatment groups. Fasting and mean 7- and 8-point blood glucose profiles, blood lipid levels, plasminogen activator inhibitor levels, adverse events, and hypoglycemia frequency were also compared. Patients using BIAsp 30 (alone or with pioglitazone) were injected twice daily (immediately before breakfast and dinner). Pioglitazone (30 mg/d) and glibenclamide (5–15 mg/d) were taken orally once daily with or immediately after breakfast.

Results

At the end of the trial, HbA(1c) was significantly lower for the BIAsp 30 plus pioglitazone group than for the glibenclamide plus pioglitazone group (mean [SD], -0.64% [0.23%]; P = 0.005) and the BIAsp 30 monotherapy group (-0.60% [0.22%]; P = 0.008). Mean (SD) fasting blood glucose (before breakfast) was significantly lower for BIAsp 30 plus pioglitazone than for glibenclamide plus pioglitazone (153 [45] mg/dL vs 169 [65] mg/dL, respectively; P = 0.012). Each time point on the 8-point blood glucose profile was lower for BIAsp 30 plus pioglitazone than for glibenclamide plus pioglitazone (P < 0.001 to P < 0.05). No major hypoglycemic episodes were reported, and the absolute rate of hypoglycemic events was low (< 1 event/patient-week) in the BIAsp-only group. Edema was reported in ≤ 9% of patients in each treatment group, but no occurrence was classified as serious. Weight gain (mean, 4.0 kg) was more common in the BIAsp plus pioglitazone group (8%); however, this was consistent with improved glycemic control and is similar to that reported in other pioglitazone trials.

Conclusions

BIAsp 30 plus pioglitazone provided an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment alternative to glibenclamide plus pioglitazone or BIAsp 30 alone in this population of patients who previously were not well controlled on glibenclamide monotherapy or combination therapy.

### Pioglitazone and glimepiride [^111oPqUe]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets combine 2 antihyperglycemic agents with different mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: pioglitazone, a member of the thiazolidinedione class, and glimepiride, a member of the sulfonylurea class. Thiazolidinediones are insulin-sensitizing agents that act primarily by enhancing peripheral glucose utilization, whereas sulfonylureas are insulin secretagogues that act primarily by stimulating release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells.

Pioglitazone

Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Pioglitazone is an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.

In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.

Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.

Glimepiride

Glimepiride primarily lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor in the pancreatic beta cell plasma membrane, leading to closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, thereby stimulating the release of insulin.

### Glitazones and the management of insulin resistance: what they do and how might they be used [^111Q5v5k]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Thiazolidinediones (glitazones) are the only compounds currently available that specifically target tissue insulin resistance. The two currently available drugs in this class, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus only. The therapeutic potential of the glitazones for other consequences of insulin resistance has stirred considerable interest, especially with regard to their potential beneficial impact on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and diabetes prevention. They also have been considered in the management of polycystic ovarian syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and other consequences of insulin resistance. The nonglycemic potential of glitazones is a clinical area in rapid evolution, wherein most data are on the impact of the glitazones onsurrogate markers that are associated with diseases, not on disease outcomes. This article provides insight and guidance to clinicians on the diverse nonglycemic potential of glitazones until conclusive outcome data become available.

### Pioglitazone in clinical practice: where are we now? [^117QQuHv]. Diabetes Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, improves insulin sensitivity and thus reduces blood glucose. Clinical trials have suggested potential cardiovascular outcome benefits in association with pioglitazone; however, safety concerns are mounting, with recent data suggesting a link between pioglitazone and an increased risk of bladder cancer. There is thus a growing focus on the risk-benefit profile of this agent and hence its potential role in the blood glucose-lowering treatment algorithm for people with type 2 diabetes. There are clear potential outcome benefits associated with pioglitazone. In this review, the authors focus on putting the true risk-benefit profile of pioglitazone into context based on critical appraisal of the currently available evidence.

### Pioglitazone increases risk of ischemic heart disease in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving insulin [^113XXCey]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

Studies evaluating the cardiovascular safety of pioglitazone show inconsistent results and ischemic heart disease (IHD) risks associated with different anti-diabetic drugs added to metformin uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are not assessed. This study aimed to evaluate IHD risk associated with pioglitazone and/or insulin added to patients with metformin uncontrolled T2DM.

Methods

Data were extracted from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. A total of 19,952 patients with T2DM uncontrolled on metformin received pioglitazone and/or insulin added to metformin were included.

Results

Compared to those who never received pioglitazone and/or insulin, patients receiving both insulin and pioglitazone had higher cumulative risk of IHD (adjusted HR [aHR] = 1.911, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.506–2.351), pioglitazone alone (aHR = 1.446, 95% CI: 1.111–1.775), and insulin alone (aHR = 1.351, 95% CI: 1.1052–1.684) (all, p < 0.05). Patients who received both pioglitazone and insulin had a higher cumulative risk of IHD than those who received insulin or pioglitazone as well as a similar result in the cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) of the drugs.

Conclusion

Administering pioglitazone plus insulin to patients with T2DM uncontrolled on metformin may increase the risk of IHD, suggesting that other second-line anti-diabetes drugs may be a better choice for patients with T2DM uncontrolled on metformin.

### Pioglitazone [^115TrxBU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Congestive Heart Failure

Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone must be considered [see Boxed Warning, and].

5.2 Hypoglycemia

Patients receiving pioglitazone in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see].

5.3 Hepatic Effects

There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date [see].

Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone should be initiated with caution.

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.

Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on pioglitazone. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone can be used with caution.

In the second trial, 690 patients receiving a median of 60 units per day of insulin were randomized to receive either 30 mg or 45 mg of pioglitazone once daily for 24 weeks in addition to their current insulin regimen. The mean reduction from baseline at Week 24 in HbA1c was 1.2% for the 30 mg dose and 1.5% for the 45 mg dose. The mean reduction from baseline at Week 24 in FPG was 32 mg/dL for the 30 mg dose and 46 mg/dL for the 45 mg dose (see Table 25). The mean daily insulin dose at baseline in both treatment groups was approximately 70 units. The majority of patients (55% overall, 58% treated with pioglitazone 30 mg, and 52% treated with pioglitazone 45 mg) had no change in their daily insulin dose from baseline to the final study visit. The mean change from baseline in daily dose of insulin (including patients with no insulin dose modifications) was -5 units in the patients treated with pioglitazone 30 mg and -8 units in the patients treated with pioglitazone 45 mg.

### Efficacy and safety of pioglitazone add-on in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with metformin and dapagliflozin: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115YVHtn]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for over 90% of diabetes cases worldwide. Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, enhances insulin sensitivity by activating PPAR-γ. Evidence on its efficacy and safety as an add-on to metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors in inadequately controlled T2DM is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates pioglitazone's role as a third-line therapy for improving glycaemic control in addition to metformin and Dapagliflozin.

Methodology

We conducted comprehensive searches across PubMed, CENTRAL, WOS, Scopus and EMBASE until December 2024. Pooled data were reported using risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, along with a 95% confidence interval (CI). This systematic review and meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO ID: CRD42024612005.

Results

We included three RCTs with 885 patients. Pioglitazone add-on therapy significantly reduced HbA1c levels (MD: -0.41; 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.27, p = < 0.00001, I² = 0%), fasting blood glucose (MD: -11.91; 95% CI: -16.34 to -7.48, p = < 0.00001, I² = 0%), Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (MD: -0.65; 95% CI: -1.05 to -0.25, p = 0.001, I² = 4.89%), increased the rate of achieving HbA1c < 7% (RR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.66 to 2.64, p = < 0.00001, I² = 0%), and HbA1c < 6.5% (RR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.36 to 3.53, p = 0.001, I² = 0%). However, there was no difference regarding Homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β) between the two groups (MD: 2.73; 95% CI: -5.24 to 10.70, p = 0.5, I² = 27.53%).

Conclusion

Pioglitazone add-on therapy significantly improved glycaemic control by reducing HbA1c, fasting blood glucose and HOMA-IR while increasing the likelihood of achieving HbA1c targets. However, no significant difference was observed in HOMA-β between groups. These findings suggest the potential benefit of pioglitazone in enhancing glycaemic outcomes in diabetes management.

### Are all glitazones the same? [^1119YK7L]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

This supplement focuses on the benefits of targeting insulin resistance through therapy with a new class of oral antidiabetic agents, the thiazolidinediones (TZDs) or 'glitazones'. There are important differences between the three TZD class members that warrant discussion to enable physicians to make rational and informed therapeutic choices between the agents. Overall the TZDs appear to be similar in their effects on blood glucose, as all class members have demonstrated effective glycaemic control, both as monotherapy and in combination with sulphonylureas, metformin or exogenous insulin. The safety profiles of the three agents are more diverse, with what appear to be 'TZD class effects', (probably mediated via activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma [PPAR gamma]) and 'TZD-specific effects', which are unique to each agent and may be a consequence of differing chemical structures. While rosiglitazone and pioglitazone share some class effects with troglitazone, they have several characteristics that define them as unique agents. By tackling the control of type 2 diabetes through direct effects on insulin resistance, the TZDs represent an important new therapeutic tool for healthcare professionals.

### Combination therapy using metformin or thiazolidinediones and insulin in the treatment of diabetes mellitus [^111i1uZD]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

The biguanide, metformin, sensitizes the liver to the effect of insulin, suppressing hepatic glucose output. Thiazolidinediones such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone enhance insulin-mediated glucose disposal, leading to reduced plasma insulin concentrations. These classes of drugs may also have varying beneficial effects on features of insulin resistance such as lipid levels, blood pressure and body weight. Metformin in combination with insulin has been shown to significantly improve blood glucose levels while lowering total daily insulin dose and body weight. The thiazolidinediones in combination with insulin have also been effective in lowering blood glucose levels and total daily insulin dose. Triple combination therapy using insulin, metformin and a thiazolidinedione improves glycaemic control to a greater degree than dual therapy using insulin and metformin or insulin and a thiazolidinedione. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of metformin or thiazolidinediones in type 1 diabetic patients. Although these agents are largely well tolerated, some subjects experience significant gastrointestinal problems while using metformin. Metformin is associated with a low risk of lactic acidosis, but should not be used in patients with elevated serum creatinine or those being treated for congestive heart failure. The thiazolidinediones are associated with an increase in body weight, although this can be avoided with careful lifestyle management. Thiazolidinediones may also lead to oedema and are associated with a low incidence of hepatocellular injury. Thiazolidinediones are contraindicated in patients with underlying heart disease who are at risk of congestive heart failure and in patients who have abnormal hepatic function. The desired blood glucose-lowering effect and adverse event profiles of these agents should be considered when recommending these agents to diabetic patients. The potential for metformin or the thiazolidinediones to impact long-term cardiovascular outcomes remains under investigation.

### Dose-response effect of pioglitazone on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes [^113aETvJ]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the dose-response effects of pioglitazone on glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

A total of 58 diet-treated patients with type 2 diabetes (aged 54 ± 1 years; 34 men and 24 women; BMI 31.5 ± 0.6 kg/m²) were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 11) or 7.5 mg (n = 13), 15 mg (n = 12), 30 mg (n = 11), or 45 mg (n = 11) of pioglitazone per day for 26 weeks. Before and after 26 weeks, subjects underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

Results

Patients treated with 7.5 or 15 mg/day of pioglitazone had no change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and fasting plasma insulin (FPI) concentrations or in plasma glucose (PG) and insulin concentrations during the OGTT. Patients treated with 30 and 45 mg/day of pioglitazone, respectively, had significant decreases from placebo in HbA1c (delta = -2.0 and -2.9%), FPG (delta = -66 and -97 mg/dl), and mean PG during OGTT (delta = -84 and -107 mg/dl). Fasting plasma insulin decreased significantly in the 45-mg/day pioglitazone group, but the mean plasma insulin during the OGTT did not change. The insulinogenic index (delta area under the curve [AUC] insulin/deltaAUC glucose) during the OGTT increased significantly in the 30- and 45-mg/day pioglitazone groups (0.13 ± 0.03 to 0.27 ± 0.05, P < 0.05). From the OGTT, we previously have derived a composite whole-body insulin sensitivity index (ISI) that correlates well with that measured directly with the insulin clamp technique. Whole-body ISI [ISI = 10,000/(√(FPG × FPI) × (PG × PI)) where PG and PI equal mean plasma glucose and insulin concentrations during OGTT] increased significantly in patients treated with 30 mg (1.8 ± 0.3 to 2.5 ± 0.3, P < 0.05) or 45 mg (1.6 ± 0.2 to 2.7 ± 0.6, P < 0.05) per day of pioglitazone. In the basal state, the hepatic ISI [k/(FPG × FPI)[k/(FPG × FPI)], which agrees closely with that measured directly with tritiated glucose, increased in patients treated with 30 mg (0.13 ± 0.02 to 0.21 ± 0.03, P < 0.05) and 45 mg (0.11 ± 0.02 to 0.24 ± 0.06, P < 0.05) per day of pioglitazone. Significant correlations between the dose of pioglitazone and the changes in HbA1c (r = -0.58), FPG (r = -0.47), mean PG during the OGTT (r = -0.46), insulinogenic index (r = 0.34), hepatic ISI (r = 0.44), and whole-body ISI (r = 0.36) were observed.

Conclusions

Pioglitazone improves glycemic control through the dose-dependent enhancement of beta-cell function and improved whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity.

### Effects of pioglitazone and rosiglitazone combined with metformin on body weight in people with diabetes [^115g2R9v]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Currently, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone are the thiazolidinediones available for clinical use. In the literature, there are different studies concerning the efficacy, safety and tolerability of thiazolidinediones as add-on therapy to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin alone. Metformin and thiazolidinediones are both antihyperglycaemic drugs, both lower blood glucose concentrations in type 2 diabetes without causing overt hypoglycaemia and both require the presence of insulin to generate their therapeutic effects, but act without stimulating insulin secretion. Some authors reported that the improved glycaemic control obtained with thiazolidinediones is associated with an increase in body weight with an estimated 2–3 kg weight gain for every 1% decrease in HbA(1c) which could negate some of the benefits of the improved metabolic control. Some other authors, instead, reported that thiazolidinediones give a better improvement in the glycaemic control compared with metformin alone without giving weight gain. The emerging discrepancies from these studies could be because of the study design, the patient selection, the degree of glycaemic control and/or the methods to measure body weight. We have undertaken a thorough literature search on Medline and Embase to evaluate the effects of thiazolidinediones plus metformin combination in people with diabetes on the body weight.

### In praise of pioglitazone: an economically efficacious therapy for type 2 diabetes and other manifestations of the metabolic syndrome [^1118vEXV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Pioglitazone improves glycaemic control, not only by lowering insulin resistance, but also by improving beta cell function. Because of the improved beta cell function the glycaemic control that occurs with pioglitazone is prolonged. Pioglitazone has positive effects not only on cardiac risk factors and surrogate measures of cardiovascular disease, it also lowers the incidence of cardiac events in patients with diabetes. The recurrence of transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke is also reduced in non-diabetic, insulin-resistant subjects. Utilized at preclinical stages (but not later) of heart failure, pioglitazone improves diastolic function and avoids progression to heart failure. Pioglitazone, through suppression of atrial remodelling, also decreases the incidence of atrial fibrillation. The manifestations of diseases associated with insulin resistance (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and polycystic ovary disease) are also improved with pioglitazone. Pioglitazone may possibly improve psoriasis and other dermopathies. Pioglitazone is therefore an inexpensive and efficacious drug for the insulin-resistant subject with diabetes that is underutilized because of biases that have evolved from the toxicities of other thiazolidinediones.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Pioglitazone is an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.

In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin- dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.

Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.

The LixiLan‐G trial evaluated patients inadequately controlled on GLP‐1 RA therapy (with or without oral agents), demonstrating significantly greater HbA1c reductions after switching to iGlarLixi compared to those who continued their GLP‐1 RA regimen (−1.1% vs. −0.4%, respectively). As expected, those in the iGlarLixi group gained a modest amount of weight compared to those continuing the GLP‐1 RA therapy (+1.9 kg and −1.1 kg, respectively) and experienced more hypoglycaemia, findings which are consistent with existing literature.

In the DUAL III trial, people on liraglutide once daily or exenatide twice daily with metformin alone or with pioglitazone and/or sulfonylurea were randomised to iDegLira once daily. Those in the iDegLira group experienced a greater reduction in HbA1c compared to those continuing their GLP‐1 RA (−1.3% vs. −0.3%, respectively). As expected, the mean change in body weight was +2 kg with iDegLira and −0.8 kg in the unchanged GLP‐1 RA group. Rates of hypoglycaemia were low overall, though higher with iDegLira vs. unchanged GLP‐1 RA.

14.2 Combination Therapy

Three 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the effects of pioglitazone (15 mg and/or 30 mg) on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled (HbA1c ≥ 8%) despite current therapy with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin. In addition, three 24-week randomized, double-blind clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the effects of pioglitazone 30 mg vs. pioglitazone 45 mg on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled (HbA1c ≥ 8%) despite current therapy with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin. Previous diabetes treatment may have been monotherapy or combination therapy.

Add-on to Sulfonylurea Trials

Two clinical trials were conducted with pioglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea. Both studies included patients with type 2 diabetes on any dose of a sulfonylurea, either alone or in combination with another antidiabetic agent. All other antidiabetic agents were withdrawn at least three weeks prior to starting study treatment.

In the first study, 560 patients were randomized to receive 15 mg or 30 mg of pioglitazone or placebo once daily for 16 weeks in addition to their current sulfonylurea regimen. Treatment with pioglitazone as add-on to sulfonylurea produced statistically significant improvements in HbA1c and FPG at endpoint compared to placebo add-on to sulfonylurea (see Table 20).

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both pioglitazone and metformin is appropriate [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)].

Important Limitations of Use

Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of endogenous insulin. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings.

Use caution in patients with liver disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are a thiazolidinedione and biguanide combination product indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both pioglitazone and metformin is appropriate. (1, 14)

Important Limitations of Use:

- Not for treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. (1)

5.3 Edema

In controlled clinical trials with pioglitazone, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose related [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening of edema have been received.

Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1), and PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.1)].

5.4 Hypoglycemia

Patients receiving pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia[see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2)].

Hypoglycemia can also occur when caloric intake is deficient or when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplement. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.

iDegLira has been studied in people with T2D inadequately controlled on OAD in the DUAL I, DUAL IV, and DUAL VI trials. Across these clinical trials, iDegLira led to HbA1c reductions in the range of −1.9% to 2%. Overall, rates of hypoglycaemia with iDegLira were higher than with liraglutide alone, though lower than with basal insulin. Weight change was modest or neutral, ranging from −0.5 to −1.5 kg, with less weight gain compared to basal insulin and less weight loss compared to liraglutide monotherapy. The DUAL‐I trial included patients who were insulin‐naïve and without using a sulfonylurea within 90 days of screening. In this trial, iDegLira led to significant reductions in HbA1c (−1.9%) compared with insulin degludec (−1.4%) or liraglutide alone (−1.3%) at 26 weeks in people inadequately controlled on metformin with or without pioglitazone. The number of hypoglycaemic events per patient year was 1.8 for iDegLira, 0.2 for liraglutide and 2.6 for insulin degludec. In DUAL IV, iDegLira was compared with placebo in insulin‐naïve people, added to a therapeutic regimen of a sulfonylurea maintained at pre‐trial dose and frequency (unless there was a safety concern), with or without metformin. At 26 weeks, iDegLira had a greater reduction in HbA1c (−1.4%) vs. placebo (−0.4%). Confirmed hypoglycaemia occurred in ~42% of patients treated with iDegLira vs. ~17% of patients in the placebo arm. An increase in body weight (+0.5 kg) was observed in the iDegLira arm as compared to a modest weight loss (−1 kg) observed in the placebo arm. It should be emphasised that although an improvement in HbA1c was observed when adding an FRC to background sulfonylurea therapy, the increased risk of hypoglycaemia and potential for weight gain are not ideal. Thus, clinicians should consider stopping sulfonylureas or reducing the dose when initiating an FRC. The DUAL VI trial used a simpler titration algorithm for iDegLira vs. other DUAL trials, with once‐weekly adjustments, resulting in a safety and glycemic efficacy profile comparable to twice weekly adjustments. These results have important implications for clinical practice as simpler, patient‐managed titration algorithms aim to mitigate clinical inertia and may reduce healthcare costs and burden. Lastly, in the DUAL IX trial, when iDegLira was compared to insulin glargine alone in people with uncontrolled T2D on an SGLT‐2 inhibitor, there was no clinically significant improvement in HbA1c (−1.9% vs. −1.7%), though iDegLira had less weight gain and hypoglycaemia risk vs. insulin glargine alone.

### Practical strategies for improving outcomes in T2DM: the potential role of pioglitazone and DPP4 inhibitors [^115f52iT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Metformin, the common front‐line therapy in T2DM treatment, is considered an insulin sensitizer, but pioglitazone exerts a stronger effect on insulin action in peripheral tissues. 8 Although metformin CV protection was apparent in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), 9 more data lend support to the CV protection properties of pioglitazone. 10, 11

Among the agents used to improve beta‐cell function, incretins have a more physiologic mechanism of action than, for instance, sulfonylureas (SU). Dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors (DPP4i) also have a very good safety and tolerability profile and, as such, can be considered for combination with pioglitazone, even in the early stage of the disease.

The purpose of this review article is to evaluate the potential of combination therapy with pioglitazone and DPP4i with respect to: (1) addressing pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying T2DM; (2) maintenance of sustained glycaemic control; (3) effect on CV risk; and (4) overall safety.

7 Conclusion

This meta‐analysis provides strong evidence supporting the addition of pioglitazone to metformin and SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in patients with inadequately controlled T2DM. The combination demonstrates significant glycaemic benefits with an acceptable safety profile, though careful weight monitoring is warranted. Based on these findings, we recommend considering pioglitazone as a cost‐effective third‐line option, particularly in patients with features of insulin resistance.

### Effect of pioglitazone versus insulin glargine on cardiac size, function, and measures of fluid retention in patients with type 2 diabetes [^11123QyD]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

When choosing pioglitazone as an add-on treatment in patients with insufficiently controlled T2D, an increase in LVD vol by 11% and LA vol by 17% could be observed. This was parallel with an increase in natriuretic peptids. These changes in cardiac volume and natriuretic peptid-levels were not observed with insulin glargine. Larger randomised trials are warranted to confirm these findings. There is a need for tools to help clinicians to identify subsets of patients for whom this kind of therapy is likely to have particularly favourable/unfavourable effect, using readily identifiable clinical and laboratory factors. Knowledge is increasing in this field and hopefully the results will enable clinicians to select the proper therapy for individual patients in the future.

### Insulin monotherapy compared with the addition of oral glucose-lowering agents to insulin for people with type 2 diabetes already on insulin therapy and inadequate glycaemic control [^114ypSZs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether people with type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin monotherapy who do not achieve adequate glycaemic control should continue insulin as monotherapy or can benefit from adding oral glucose-lowering agents to the insulin therapy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of insulin monotherapy compared with the addition of oral glucose-lowering agents to insulin monotherapy for people with type 2 diabetes already on insulin therapy and inadequate glycaemic control.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and reference lists of articles. The date of the last search was November 2015 for all databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical trials of at least two months' duration comparing insulin monotherapy with combinations of insulin with one or more oral glucose-lowering agent in people with type 2 diabetes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, extracted data and evaluated overall quality of the evidence using GRADE. We summarised data statistically if they were available, sufficiently similar and of sufficient quality. We performed statistical analyses according to the statistical guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Main Results

We included 37 trials with 40 treatment comparisons involving 3227 participants. The duration of the interventions ranged from 2 to 12 months for parallel trials and two to four months for cross-over trials. The majority of trials had an unclear risk of bias in several risk of bias domains. Fourteen trials showed a high risk of bias, mainly for performance and detection bias. Insulin monotherapy, including once-daily long-acting, once-daily intermediate-acting, twice-daily premixed insulin, and basal-bolus regimens (multiple injections), was compared to insulin in combination with sulphonylureas (17 comparisons: glibenclamide = 11, glipizide = 2, tolazamide = 2, gliclazide = 1, glimepiride = 1), metformin (11 comparisons), pioglitazone (four comparisons), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (four comparisons: acarbose = 3, miglitol = 1), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 inhibitors) (three comparisons: vildagliptin = 1, sitagliptin = 1, saxagliptin = 1) and the combination of metformin and glimepiride (one comparison). No trials assessed all-cause mortality, diabetes-related morbidity or health-related quality of life. Only one trial assessed patients' treatment satisfaction and showed no substantial differences between the addition of either glimepiride or metformin and glimepiride to insulin compared with insulin monotherapy. Insulin-sulphonylurea combination therapy (CT) compared with insulin monotherapy (IM) showed a MD in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of -1% (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.6 to -0.5); P < 0.01; 316 participants; 9 trials; low-quality evidence. Insulin-metformin CT compared with IM showed a MD in HbA1c of -0.9% (95% CI -1.2 to -0.5); P < 0.01; 698 participants; 9 trials; low-quality evidence. We could not pool the results of adding pioglitazone to insulin. Insulin combined with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors compared with IM showed a MD in HbA1c of -0.4% (95% CI -0.5 to -0.2); P < 0.01; 448 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence). Insulin combined with DPP-4 inhibitors compared with IM showed a MD in HbA1c of -0.4% (95% CI -0.5 to -0.4); P < 0.01; 265 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence. In most trials the participants with CT needed less insulin, whereas insulin requirements increased or remained stable in participants with IM. We did not perform a meta-analysis for hypoglycaemic events because the included studies used different definitions. In most trials the insulin-sulphonylurea combination resulted in a higher number of mild episodes of hypoglycaemia, compared to the IM group (range: 2.2 to 6.1 episodes per participant in CT versus 2.0 to 2.6 episodes per participant in IM; low-quality evidence). Pioglitazone CT also resulted in more mild to moderate hypoglycaemic episodes compared with IM (range 15 to 90 episodes versus 9 to 75 episodes, respectively; low-quality evidence. The trials that reported hypoglycaemic episodes in the other combinations found comparable numbers of mild to moderate hypoglycaemic events (low-quality evidence). The addition of sulphonylureas resulted in an additional weight gain of 0.4 kg to 1.9 kg versus -0.8 kg to 2.1 kg in the IM group (220 participants; 7 trials; low-quality evidence). Pioglitazone CT caused more weight gain compared to IM: MD 3.8 kg (95% CI 3.0 to 4.6); P < 0.01; 288 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence. Metformin CT was associated with weight loss: MD -2.1 kg (95% CI -3.2 to -1.1), P < 0.01; 615 participants; 7 trials; low-quality evidence). DPP-4 inhibitors CT showed weight gain of -0.7 to 1.3 kg versus 0.6 to 1.1 kg in the IM group (362 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence). Alpha-glucosidase CT compared to IM showed a MD of -0.5 kg (95% CI -1.2 to 0.3); P = 0.26; 241 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence. Users of metformin CT (range 7% to 67% versus 5% to 16%), and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors CT (14% to 75% versus 4% to 35%) experienced more gastro-intestinal adverse effects compared to participants on IM. Two trials reported a higher frequency of oedema with the use of pioglitazone CT (range: 16% to 18% versus 4% to 7% IM).

Authors' Conclusions

The addition of all oral glucose-lowering agents in people with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycaemic control who are on insulin therapy has positive effects on glycaemic control and insulin requirements. The addition of sulphonylureas results in more hypoglycaemic events. Additional weight gain can only be avoided by adding metformin to insulin. Other well-known adverse effects of oral glucose-lowering agents have to be taken into account when prescribing oral glucose-lowering agents in addition to insulin therapy.

### Pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride (actoplus Met) [^115za3te]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Mechanism of Action

ACTOPLUS MET

ACTOPLUS MET combines two antihyperglycemic agents with different mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: pioglitazone hydrochloride, a member of the thiazolidinedione class, and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class. Thiazolidinediones are insulin-sensitizing agents that act primarily by enhancing peripheral glucose utilization, whereas biguanides act primarily by decreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production.

Pioglitazone hydrochloride

Pioglitazone depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Unlike sulfonylureas, pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Pioglitazone is a potent and highly selective agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.

In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.

Since pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.

Metformin hydrochloride

Metformin hydrochloride improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects (except in special circumstances, see PRECAUTIONS, General: Metformin hydrochloride) and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.

### Efficacy and safety of pioglitazone / metformin fixed-dose combination versus uptitrated metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes without adequate glycemic control: a randomized clinical trial [^113Gtx6e]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Several studies have reported that pioglitazone caused weight gain. One proposed mechanism for this effect is that pioglitazone promotes preadipocyte differentiation into mature adipocytes, leading to an increase in adipose tissue mass. Another proposed mechanism is that pioglitazone increases insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, leading to increased glucose uptake and storage as fat. Metformin might mitigate the weight gain caused by pioglitazone, yet the ultimate outcomes are not uniform for their combination. Despite an adverse tendency to weight gain, pioglitazone significantly decreased both intrahepatic and visceral fat in patients with T2DM and also improved metabolic activity, which might have an independent mechanism from its hypoglycemic effects. Additionally, some studies have shown that the greater the weight gain after glitazone treatment, the better the actual glycemic control, with more significant improvements in HbA1c reduction, insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, and cardiovascular risk factors. The results of HbA1c, FBG, and insulin resistance in the FDC group in this study also support this view.

### Pathophysiologic approach to therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^111HpCTF]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In combination with metformin (inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis), pioglitazone (improves insulin sensitivity in liver/muscle and preserves β-cell function) offers an effective, durable, and additive therapy that retards progressive β-cell failure with little risk of hypoglycemia. In a 6-month trial comparing fixed-dose combination with pioglitazone (30 mg)/metformin (1,700 mg) in 600 drug-naïve T2DM patients, HbA 1c declined by 1.8% (from baseline HbA 1c 8.6%) and was significantly greater than the 1.0% reduction observed with metformin alone or pioglitazone alone. Similar results were reported by Rosenstock et al. using initial combination therapy with rosiglitazone (8 mg)/metformin (2,000 mg).

Combining pioglitazone with GLP-1 analog curbs weight gain associated with the TZD. Further, the natriuretic effect of GLP-1 analogs mitigates against fluid retention observed with TZDs. Therefore, we advocate combined GLP-1 analog/pioglitazone therapy with or without metformin in newly diagnosed T2DM patients.

Intensive therapy with insulin plus metformin: reversal of metabolic decompensation.

Newly diagnosed T2DM patients who present in poor metabolic control are markedly resistant to insulin and have severely impaired β-cell function. Glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and multiple metabolic abnormalities play an important role in the insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. Institution of intensive insulin therapy with or without other antidiabetes agents to correct these many metabolic abnormalities, therefore, represents a rational approach to therapy based upon pathophysiology. After a period of sustained metabolic control, the insulin therapy can be continued or the patient can be switched to a noninsulin therapeutic regimen. This approach has recently been examined by Harrison et al. Fifty-eight newly diagnosed T2DM patients in poor metabolic control (HbA 1c 10.8%) initially were treated for 3 months with metformin plus insulin to reduce the HbA 1c to 5.9%. Subjects then were randomized to continued therapy with insulin-metformin combination therapy with pioglitazone/metformin/glyburide. During 3 years of follow-up, both groups maintained the reduction in HbA 1c, but the insulin dose had to be increased, indicating that, despite excellent glycemic control, β-cell failure continued in this group. Further, glycemic control in both groups was achieved at the expense of a relatively high rate of hypoglycemia and weight gain in the insulin/metformin group, consistent with multiple studies demonstrating a high incidence of hypoglycemia in sulfonylurea-treated and insulin-treated subjects.

### Efficacy and safety of pioglitazone versus metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a double-blind, randomized trial [^115ZsPQZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Pioglitazone increases the insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissues and may provide an alternative first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. This study compared metabolic control in drug-naive type 2 diabetes patients given either pioglitazone or metformin. Eleven hundred and ninety-nine patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus [glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 7.5–11%; normal, 4.3–6.1%] were randomized to receive either pioglitazone (≤ 45 mg/d) or metformin (≤ 850 mg, three times daily). HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin levels, total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio were measured. Mean HbA1c decreased in both treatment groups from baseline to wk 52 (-1.4% and -1.5%). Significantly greater mean reductions in FPG were observed in the pioglitazone group (-45.0 mg/dl; -2.5 mmol/liter) than in the metformin (-39.6 mg/dl; -2.2 mmol/liter) group (P = 0.016). Favorable changes in triglycerides and HDL-C were more pronounced with pioglitazone. Although low density lipoprotein cholesterol and TC levels increased with pioglitazone, TC/HDL-C ratios decreased similarly with both treatments. The urinary albumin/creatinine ratio was reduced by 19% with pioglitazone treatment, but remained unchanged with metformin therapy (-1%; P = 0.002). There was an increase in body weight of 1.9 kg in the pioglitazone group and a decrease of 2.5 kg in the metformin group. The overall frequency of adverse events was similar between treatment groups, but adverse event profiles were different between treatment groups. HbA1c reduction is similar after pioglitazone and metformin monotherapies, but differences in FPG, plasma lipids, and adverse effects between the two compounds may influence decision-making in individual prescribers.

### Efficacy and safety of pioglitazone add-on in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with metformin and dapagliflozin: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111p7CUS]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for over 90% of diabetes cases worldwide. Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, enhances insulin sensitivity by activating PPAR‐γ. Evidence on its efficacy and safety as an add‐on to metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors in inadequately controlled T2DM is limited. This systematic review and meta‐analysis evaluates pioglitazone's role as a third‐line therapy for improving glycaemic control in addition to metformin and Dapagliflozin.

Methodology

We conducted comprehensive searches across PubMed, CENTRAL, WOS, Scopus and EMBASE until December 2024. Pooled data were reported using risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, along with a 95% confidence interval (CI). This systematic review and meta‐analysis is registered with PROSPERO ID:

Results

We included three RCTs with 885 patients. Pioglitazone add‐on therapy significantly reduced HbA1c levels (MD: −0.41; 95% CI: −0.54 to −0.27, p = < 0.00001, I² = 0%), fasting blood glucose (MD: −11.91; 95% CI: −16.34 to −7.48, p = < 0.00001, I² = 0%), Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA‐IR) (MD: −0.65; 95% CI: −1.05 to −0.25, p = 0.001, I² = 4.89%), increased the rate of achieving HbA1c < 7% (RR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.66 to 2.64, p = < 0.00001, I² = 0%), and HbA1c < 6.5% (RR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.36 to 3.53, p = 0.001, I² = 0%). However, there was no difference regarding Homeostasis model assessment of β‐cell function (HOMA‐β) between the two groups (MD: 2.73; 95% CI: −5.24 to 10.70, p = 0.5, I² = 27.53%).

Conclusion

Pioglitazone add‐on therapy significantly improved glycaemic control by reducing HbA1c, fasting blood glucose and HOMA‐IR while increasing the likelihood of achieving HbA1c targets. However, no significant difference was observed in HOMA‐β between groups. These findings suggest the potential benefit of pioglitazone in enhancing glycaemic outcomes in diabetes management.

### A systematic review of the clinical effectiveness of pioglitazone in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117VJ44g]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Pioglitazone is a member of a recently developed class of glucose-lowering agents, the thiazolidinediones, used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the United States, it is approved for use both as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, a sulfonylurea, or insulin; in Europe, it is approved for use in combination with metformin or a sulfonylurea but not insulin.

Objective

This article presents a systematic review of the published literature on the effectiveness of pioglitazone in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, both as monotherapy and in combination with other antidiabetic agents.

Methods

The peer-reviewed English- and foreign-language literature was searched using MEDLINE, PubMED, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the UK National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases, and the Office of Health Economics Health Economic Evaluations Database. Searches were not limited to specific publication types, study designs, dates, or languages. The latest search was performed in March 2001. For a trial to be included in the review, at least 1 outcome measure had to involve the effects of pioglitazone on glycemic control or cardiovascular risk factors, or its side effects. Because of the heterogeneity of studies, no formal meta-analysis was performed.

Results

Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria, 6 involving pioglitazone monotherapy and 5 involving combination therapy. Full reports were available for only 6 of the 11 studies. No studies directly compared pioglitazone with other antidiabetic drugs. Both as monotherapy and in combination therapy, pioglitazone produced decreases in blood glucose levels (up to 95 mg/dL) and glycosylated hemoglobin (up to 2.6%). At doses of ≥ 30 mg/d, pioglitazone was associated with reductions in triglyceride levels (-30–70 mg/dL) and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (-4–5 mg/dL). Pioglitazone treatment was associated with significant weight gain (up to 4 kg over 16 weeks). Adverse effects included mild edema (in up to 11.7% of patients) and a clinically nonsignificant decrease in hemoglobin concentrations. Abnormal results on liver function testing were no more common in treated patients than in control groups.

Conclusions

Pioglitazone has been shown to reduce blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although the observed decreases in triglyceride levels and increases in HDL-C levels could be expected to lead to a reduction in cardiovascular risk, the effects of weight gain may counteract this benefit. The evidence suggests that the preferred role for pioglitazone may be as an adjunct to metformin or a sulfonylurea in patients whose condition is not well controlled with monotherapy and for whom a metformin-sulfonylurea combination is contraindicated. There is a need for large-scale, long-term studies comparing the effectiveness of combination therapy that includes pioglitazone with that of other combinations of antidiabetic drugs.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Pioglitazone

Clinical studies demonstrate that pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients. Pioglitazone enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal and improves hepatic sensitivity to insulin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the decreased insulin resistance produced by pioglitazone results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin concentrations, and lower HbA1c values. In controlled clinical trials, pioglitazone had an additive effect on glycemic control when used in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)].

Patients with lipid abnormalities were included in clinical trials with pioglitazone. Overall, patients treated with pioglitazone had mean decreases in serum triglycerides, mean increases in HDL cholesterol, and no consistent mean changes in LDL and total cholesterol. There is no conclusive evidence of macrovascular benefit with pioglitazone or any other antidiabetic medication [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.15) and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].

In a 26-week, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging monotherapy study, mean serum triglycerides decreased in the 15-mg, 30-mg, and 45-mg pioglitazone dose groups compared to a mean increase in the placebo group. Mean HDL cholesterol increased to a greater extent in patients treated with pioglitazone than in the placebo-treated patients. There were no consistent differences for LDL and total cholesterol in patients treated with pioglitazone compared to placebo (see Table 16).

In the two other monotherapy studies (16 weeks and 24 weeks) and in combination therapy studies with metformin (16 weeks and 24 weeks), the results were generally consistent with the data above.

4 Discussion

The primary findings demonstrated a significant reduction in HbA1c with pioglitazone add‐on therapy, accompanied by substantially higher achievement rates of both HbA1c < 7% and < 6.5% targets. These improvements in glycaemic control were consistent across studies, as evidenced by the negligible heterogeneity in our analyses. The magnitude of HbA1c reduction likely reflects pioglitazone's complementary mechanism of action, enhancing insulin sensitivity through PPAR‐γ activation, while working synergistically with the glucose excretion effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin's reduction of hepatic glucose production.

Secondary outcomes revealed meaningful improvements in several metabolic parameters, including fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR), supporting pioglitazone's insulin‐sensitising effects. As measured by HOMA‐β, beta‐cell function remained unchanged, suggesting that pioglitazone's primary mechanism operates through insulin sensitisation rather than beta‐cell preservation.

The lipid profile remained largely stable, with no significant alterations in total cholesterol, LDL‐C, or triglycerides. The observed increase in HDL‐C aligns with pioglitazone's known beneficial effects on lipid metabolism. Notably, adding pioglitazone did not significantly impact most cardiovascular parameters, except for a modest reduction in diastolic blood pressure. The neutral effect on these parameters is particularly noteworthy as it suggests that pioglitazone addition does not adversely affect the cardiovascular and metabolic benefits of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. However, the anticipated side effect of weight gain (MD: 2.03 kg) was confirmed, though this may have been partially attenuated by the concurrent use of SGLT2 inhibitors. The complementary cardiovascular mechanisms of these agents merit consideration. SGLT2 inhibitors primarily reduce heart failure hospitalisation through hemodynamic effects, while pioglitazone's cardiovascular benefits appear mediated through impacts on coronary atherosclerosis progression as demonstrated in the PERISCOPE trial and suggested in the PROactive study. This mechanistic complementarity provides a theoretical basis for additive cardiovascular protection, though longer‐duration studies are needed to confirm combined effects.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are already treated with a thiazolidinedione and sulfonylurea or who have inadequate glycemic control on a thiazolidinedione alone or a sulfonylurea alone [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets are a thiazolidinedione and a sulfonylurea combination product indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both pioglitazone and glimepiride is appropriate. (1)

Important Limitations of Use:

Not for treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. (1)

Important Limitations of Use

Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of endogenous insulin. Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings.

Use caution in patients with liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Clinical use of thiazolidinediones: recommendations [^113FCLUi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by progressive beta-cell secretory dysfunction against a background of insulin resistance, which is present many years before the onset of hyperglycemia in most patients. Intensive treatment of diabetes reduces the risk of the onset and progression of microvascular complications and may impact the risk of development of macrovascular complications, notably coronary artery disease. Therefore, aggressive treatment with the goal of achieving serum glucose concentrations as close to normal as possible is warranted. Although medical nutritional therapy and exercise remain the cornerstones of therapy for type 2 diabetes, > 90% of patients ultimately require pharmacologic therapy, and most need > 1 agent to achieve therapeutic objectives. When considering which agent or agents to use to treat type 2 diabetes, one must consider the mechanism of action of the drug, its ability to lower serum glucose concentrations, the durability of effect, and potential adverse effects. In addition, some medications have potential benefits that extend beyond glucose lowering. These include beneficial effects on the adverse metabolic consequences of insulin resistance and possibly beta-cell preservation. Thiazolidinediones should be considered as early as possible in the natural history of type 2 diabetes because of their persistent glucose-lowering effect and their ability to reduce insulin resistance as well as because these agents may preserve beta-cell function and reverse some of the adverse metabolic consequences of insulin resistance.

### Practical strategies for improving outcomes in T2DM: the potential role of pioglitazone and DPP4 inhibitors [^116GHD4a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

5 SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS: BALANCE BETWEEN RISK AND BENEFIT

DPP4i alone or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs are generally well tolerated. 4 The risk of hypoglycaemia is generally low 89 and mainly caused by concomitant insulin‐delivery background therapy. In trials assessing the effect of DPP4i and pioglitazone, no significant increase in the rate of hypoglycaemia has been reported. Therefore, to the extent that severe episodes of hypoglycaemia may trigger CV events, the combination of the two drugs appears to be safe.

The increased risk of pancreatitis reported in early observational studies have not been confirmed in a number of investigations and a meta‐analysis, 90, 91 leading the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) to conclude that there is no final evidence for a certain increase in the risk of pancreatitis or pancreatic neoplasia with the use of DPP4i. 92 The initial concern about bladder cancer with use of pioglitazone has also been dismissed, in light of the results of a prospective study, mandated by the FDA, 93 and analyses of large databases. 94

BENEFIT-RISK ANALYSIS

As reviewed in preceding sections, the benefit-to-risk ratio for pioglitazone is very favorable. Importantly, if physicians are aware of potential risks associated with thiazolidinediones and if the pioglitazone dose does not exceed 30 mg/day, side effects can be reduced even further (Table 1).

Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects

Pioglitazone hydrochloride

Clinical studies demonstrate that pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients. Pioglitazone enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal, improves hepatic sensitivity to insulin, and improves dysfunctional glucose homeostasis. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the decreased insulin resistance produced by pioglitazone results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin levels, and lower A1C values. Based on results from an open-label extension study, the glucose-lowering effects of pioglitazone appear to persist for at least one year. In controlled clinical studies, pioglitazone in combination with metformin had an additive effect on glycemic control.

Patients with lipid abnormalities were included in placebo-controlled monotherapy clinical studies with pioglitazone. Overall, patients treated with pioglitazone had mean decreases in triglycerides, mean increases in HDL cholesterol, and no consistent mean changes in LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol compared to the placebo group. A similar pattern of results was seen in 16-week and 24-week combination therapy studies of pioglitazone with metformin.

Clinical Studies

There have been no clinical efficacy studies conducted with ACTOPLUS MET. However, the efficacy and safety of the separate components have been previously established and the co-administration of the separate components has been evaluated for efficacy and safety in two clinical studies. These clinical studies established an added benefit of pioglitazone in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes while on metformin therapy. Bioequivalence of ACTOPLUS MET with co-administered pioglitazone and metformin tablets was demonstrated for both ACTOPLUS MET strengths (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism).

Cardiac Failure and Other Cardiac Effects: Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If these signs and symptoms develop, the heart failure should be managed according to current standards of care. Furthermore, discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone must be considered. Patients with NYHA Class III and IV cardiac status were not studied during pre-approval clinical trials and pioglitazone is not recommended in these patients (see BOXED WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS).

In one 16-week U.S. double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 566 patients with type 2 diabetes, pioglitazone at doses of 15 mg and 30 mg in combination with insulin was compared to insulin therapy alone. This trial included patients with long-standing diabetes and a high prevalence of pre-existing medical conditions as follows: arterial hypertension (57.2%), peripheral neuropathy (22.6%), coronary heart disease (19.6%), retinopathy (13.1%), myocardial infarction (8.8%), vascular disease (6.4%), angina pectoris (4.4%), stroke and/or transient ischemic attack (4.1%), and congestive heart failure (2.3%).

### Rethinking pioglitazone as a cardioprotective agent: a new perspective on an overlooked drug [^114fwPzv]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Since 1985, the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone has been widely used as an insulin sensitizer drug for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although fluid retention was early recognized as a safety concern, data from clinical trials have not provided conclusive evidence for a benefit or a harm on cardiac function, leaving the question unanswered. We reviewed the available evidence encompassing both in vitro and in vivo studies in tissues, isolated organs, animals and humans, including the evidence generated by major clinical trials. Despite the increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure due to fluid retention, pioglitazone is consistently associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke both in primary and secondary prevention, without any proven direct harm on the myocardium. Moreover, it reduces atherosclerosis progression, in-stent restenosis after coronary stent implantation, progression rate from persistent to permanent atrial fibrillation, and reablation rate in diabetic patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after catheter ablation. In fact, human and animal studies consistently report direct beneficial effects on cardiomyocytes electrophysiology, energetic metabolism, ischemia-reperfusion injury, cardiac remodeling, neurohormonal activation, pulmonary circulation and biventricular systo-diastolic functions. The mechanisms involved may rely either on anti-remodeling properties (endothelium protective, inflammation-modulating, anti-proliferative and anti-fibrotic properties) and/or on metabolic (adipose tissue metabolism, increased HDL cholesterol) and neurohormonal (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, sympathetic nervous system, and adiponectin) modulation of the cardiovascular system. With appropriate prescription and titration, pioglitazone remains a useful tool in the arsenal of the clinical diabetologist.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, general principles, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to use a person-centered shared decision-making approach to guide the choice of glucose-lowering medications in adult patients with T2DM. Use medications providing sufficient effectiveness to achieve and maintain intended treatment goals with consideration of the effects on cardiovascular, kidney, weight, and other relevant comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, cost and access, risk for adverse reactions and tolerability, and individual preferences:

2.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue or Insulin

If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient coadministered pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea), the dose of the insulin secretagogue should be reduced.

If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient co-administered pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and insulin, the dose of insulin should be decreased by 10% to 25%. Further adjustments to the insulin dose should be individualized based on glycemic response.

2.3 Concomitant Use with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors

Coadministration of pioglitazone (one of the ingredients in pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets) and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are 15 mg/850 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

### Pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride [^114d9U61]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride combines two antihyperglycemic agents: pioglitazone and metformin.

Pioglitazone

Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Pioglitazone is an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.

In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.

Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.

Metformin hydrochloride

Metformin hydrochloride improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or healthy subjects [except in specific circumstances, see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.

Initial insulin titration protocol — suspected type 2 diabetes (T2D) directs early testing and stepwise therapy as follows: Order pancreatic autoantibodies at diagnosis and if + add MDI. Is patient already on MDI? If yes: Stop short-acting insulin; ensure initial long-acting dose is optimized (0.5 units/kg); and start metformin, to be titrated to 2000 mg daily, and check BG 2x daily (fasting, post-prandial). If no: Is HbA1c ≥ 8.5% OR ketosis present; if yes: Start long-acting (LA) insulin (0.5 units/kg) and start metformin, to be titrated to 2000 mg daily; if no: Start metformin, to be titrated to 2000 mg daily over 4 weeks. Use post-prandial glucoses to guide changes in eating, adding medications, etc. Reassess: Is patient on maximally tolerated dose metformin? If yes: Increase LA insulin by 5–10 units if FBG ≥ 126 mg/dl; if no: Continue to increase metformin and increase LA insulin by 5–10 units if FBG ≥ 200 mg/dl. If difficulty tolerating metformin, try extended release or consider switching to pioglitazone 30 mg daily.

### Understanding contemporary use of thiazolidinediones [^114PGoDm]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone) are oral insulin-sensitizing medications used in type 2 diabetes mellitus that reduce glucose with minimal risk of hypoglycemia and potential benefits on atherosclerosis. However, thiazolidinediones can cause fluid retention thereby increasing the risk of heart failure-a common complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods and Results Data were analyzed from the Diabetes Collaborative Registry, a US outpatient registry of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus that currently encompasses 203 cardiology, endocrinology, and primary care practices and 3074 providers. Among 424061 US adults enrolled in Diabetes Collaborative Registry who had type 2 diabetes mellitus and were taking ≥ 1 glucose-lowering medication, 35018 patients (8.3%) were on a thiazolidinedione, which has remained stable over time. Patients on thiazolidinediones tended to be old (mean age, 69.2 ± 10.7 years), 61.9% had coronary disease, and 17.2% had class 3 obesity. In total, 40.3% of patients on a thiazolidinedione had either a clinical diagnosis of heart failure (23.7%), had an ejection fraction of < 40% (7.7%), or were on a loop diuretic (29.9%). Conclusions Although thiazolidinediones lost significant market share after 2007 when concerns arose regarding their safety, thiazolidinediones are still commonly used. At least a quarter, and up to two-fifths, of patients currently treated with thiazolidinediones have some evidence of heart failure and therefore should not be candidates for this therapy. Accordingly, heart failure concerns with thiazolidinediones may be under-recognized.

Tier 2: less well-validated therapies

In selected clinical settings, this second-tier algorithm may be considered. Specifically, when hypoglycemia is particularly undesirable (e.g. in patients who have hazardous jobs), the addition of exenatide or pioglitazone may be considered. Rosiglitazone is not recommended. If promotion of weight loss is a major consideration and the A1C level is close to target (< 8.0%), exenatide is an option. If these interventions are not effective in achieving target A1C, or are not tolerated, addition of a sulfonylurea could be considered. Alternatively, the tier two interventions should be stopped and basal insulin started.

Canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, was assessed in a comprehensive Phase 3 clinical development program consisting of ~10,000 participants, of which ~80% were on background therapy that consisted of metformin alone or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs; e.g., pioglitazone, sulfonylurea, and insulin). In addition, the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin and metformin as the initial combination therapy and canagliflozin monotherapy were assessed versus metformin in treatment-naïve patients with T2DM. Across studies in patients with T2DM who were on metformin alone or in combination with other AHAs, canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg provided improvements in glycated hemoglobin for up to 104 weeks. Canagliflozin was also associated with reductions in body weight and systolic blood pressure when added to background therapy consisting of metformin alone or with other AHAs. Canagliflozin was generally well tolerated, with increased incidence of adverse events (AEs) related to the mechanism of SGLT2 inhibition (i.e., genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections, and osmotic diuresis-related AEs). Consistent with its insulin-independent mechanism of action, canagliflozin was associated with low rates of hypoglycemia when background therapy did not include sulfonylurea or insulin. Due to its favorable efficacy and safety profile, these results suggest that adding canagliflozin to a background regimen consisting of metformin or implementing treatment with a fixed-dose regimen of canagliflozin and metformin would provide an effective and safe treatment regimen for T2DM management.

### Pioglitazone and metformin [^112w7L8G]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride combines two antidiabetic medications with different mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes: pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, and metformin hydrochloride, a biguanide. Thiazolidinediones are insulin-sensitizing agents that act primarily by enhancing peripheral glucose utilization, whereas biguanides act primarily by decreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production.

Pioglitazone

Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Pioglitazone is an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.

In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.

Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.

Metformin hydrochloride

Metformin hydrochloride improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or healthy subjects [except in specific circumstances, [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)] and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1161DrvX]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Use of glucose-lowering medications in adults with type 2 diabetes — risk-focused and goal-directed algorithm is presented as follows: In high-risk individuals identified by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), indicators of high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD), the pathway emphasizes outcome-benefit agents. For ASCVD/indicators of high CVD risk, the figure lists GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) with proven CVD benefit, and if A1C is above goal it advises considering adding the complementary class or pioglitazone. For HF, it specifies an SGLT2i with proven HF benefit. For CKD (defined by eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or albuminuria thresholds), on maximally tolerated ACE inhibitor or ARB, it lists an SGLT2i with primary evidence of reducing CKD progression, which can be started with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m², continued until dialysis or transplantation, with reduced glucose-lowering efficacy when eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², or a GLP-1 RA with proven CKD benefit. The algorithm also calls for regular treatment reassessment to avoid inertia and includes liver comorbidity considerations by listing agents with potential benefit in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) or steatohepatitis (MASH), including GLP-1 RA, dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, and pioglitazone (or combination), with insulin use in decompensated cirrhosis. For achieving glycemic goals, it notes metformin or other agents (including combinations) that provide adequate efficacy to meet and maintain targets while prioritizing avoidance of hypoglycemia in high-risk individuals, and it states that in people with HF, CKD, established CVD, or multiple CVD risk factors, choosing a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i with proven benefit should be made irrespective of background metformin or A1C use.

### Differentiating members of the thiazolidinedione class: a focus on efficacy [^114X8rxK]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

The thiazolidinediones (TZDs) or 'glitazones' are a new class of drug used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Although their precise mechanism of action is not known, TZDs target insulin resistance directly and thus tackle an underlying cause of the disease. Two TZDs are indicated for use in type 2 diabetes in the USA, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone. A third, troglitazone, has been associated with significant hepatotoxicity and has been withdrawn from use. In clinical trials, all three TZDs effectively lower blood glucose levels as monotherapy and in combination therapy with sulfonylureas, metformin and insulin. To date, head-to-head comparative studies with these agents have not been performed. It is difficult, therefore, to make direct comparisons of their efficacy since other variables, including baseline glucose levels and study design, can have a significant impact on treatment outcome. Despite this and in light of unique safety issues characterized with certain TZDs, it is useful to look closely at the efficacy data for these agents. It is not sufficient to assume that 'all glitazones are the same' because the studies have not yet been done to support this statement. This article will review what is known about the relative efficacy of the TZDs.

### Long-term glycaemic effects of pioglitazone compared with placebo as add-on treatment to metformin or sulphonylurea monotherapy in PROactive (PROactive 18) [^116dqovY]. Diabetic Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the long-term glycaemic effects, concomitant changes in medications and initiation of permanent insulin use (defined as daily insulin use for a period of ≥ 90 days or ongoing use at death/final visit) with pioglitazone vs. placebo in diabetic patients receiving metformin or sulphonylurea monotherapy at baseline in the PROspective pioglitAzone Clinical Trial in macroVascular Events (PROactive).

Methods

In PROactive, patients with Type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (force titrated to 45 mg/day) or placebo, in addition to other existing glucose-lowering therapies. In a post-hoc analysis, we categorized patients not receiving insulin at baseline and treated by oral monotherapy into two main cohorts: add-on to metformin alone (n = 514) and sulphonylurea alone (n = 1001). The follow-up averaged 34.5 months.

Results

There were significantly greater reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) with pioglitazone than with placebo and more pioglitazone-treated patients achieved HbA(1c) targets, irrespective of the baseline oral glucose-lowering regimen and despite a decrease in the use of other glucose-lowering agents. Approximately twice as many in the placebo groups progressed to permanent insulin use than in the pioglitazone groups across the two cohorts: 3.4% for pioglitazone and 6.5% for placebo when added to metformin monotherapy and 6.3% and 14.8%, respectively, when added to sulphonylurea monotherapy. The overall safety of both dual therapies was good.

Conclusions

Intensifying an existing oral monotherapy regimen to a dual oral regimen by adding pioglitazone resulted in sustained improvements in glycaemic control and reduced progression to insulin therapy. The efficacy and safety of adding pioglitazone to either metformin monotherapy or sulphonylurea monotherapy were good.

### Efficacy and safety of pioglitazone add-on in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with metformin and dapagliflozin: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116PjeFr]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

When considering pioglitazone as a third‐line agent, it is important to compare its efficacy and safety with alternatives like GLP‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) and DPP‐4 inhibitors. GLP‐1RAs offer strong glycaemic control, weight loss and cardiovascular benefits but may be limited by injection requirements and cost. DPP‐4 inhibitors are an oral option with low hypoglycaemia risk but provide modest HbA1c reductions. The choice should depend on factors such as cardiovascular risk, weight concerns, hypoglycaemia risk, cost and patient preferences. Pioglitazone may benefit patients with high insulin resistance, while GLP‐1RAs may be better for those with obesity. This personalised approach aligns with patient‐centred care guidelines.

While significant, the modest weight gain observed with pioglitazone addition appears less pronounced than historically reported with pioglitazone monotherapy, suggesting a partial counterbalancing effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. This finding may help clinicians in shared decision‐making discussions with patients, particularly when weighing the benefits of improved glycaemic control against potential weight effects.

The neutral cardiovascular safety profile and improved HDL‐C levels suggest that this triple therapy combination may suit patients with established cardiovascular disease. However, more extensive outcome studies would be needed to confirm cardiovascular benefits.

### Effects of intensive insulin therapy alone and in combination with pioglitazone on body weight, composition, distribution and liver fat content in patients with type 2 diabetes [^111XWZdk]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the effects of intensive insulin therapy alone and with added pioglitazone on body weight, fat distribution, lean body mass (LBM) and liver fat in type 2 diabetic patients.

Methods

Twenty-five insulin-treated, obese patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to addition of pioglitazone 45 mg (n = 12) or placebo (n = 13) and treated intensively for 12–16 weeks. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry/abdominal computed tomography scans were performed before/after treatment. LBM, visceral/subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT/SAT) and liver/spleen (L/S) attenuation ratios were measured pre-/posttreatment (a ratio < 1 represents fatty liver).

Results

Intensive insulin alone and insulin + pioglitazone significantly improved glycaemic control (7.8 ± 0.3 to 7.2 ± 0.3% and 7.6 ± 0.3 to 7.1 ± 0.4%, respectively). Body weight gain was greater with insulin + pioglitazone (4.9 ± 4.5 kg) versus insulin therapy alone (1.7 ± 0.7 kg). SAT increased significantly with pioglitazone + insulin therapy (393.9 ± 48.5 to 443.2 ± 56.7 cm², p < 0.01) compared to a non-significant increase with insulin therapy alone (412.9 ± 42.5 to 420.8 ± 43.8 cm²). VAT decreased non-significantly in both groups (240.3 ± 41.7 to 223.8 ± 38.1 cm² with insulin + pioglitazone and 266.6 ± 27.4 to 250.5 ± 22.2 cm² with insulin therapy). LBM increased significantly by 1.92 ± 0.74 kg with insulin + pioglitazone treatment. The L/S attenuation ratio in the placebo + insulin group decreased from 1.08 ± 0.1 to 1.04 ± 0.1 (p = ns) and increased from 1.00 ± 0.1 to 1.08 ± 0.05 (p = 0.06) in the pioglitazone + insulin group.

Conclusions

Intensification of insulin therapy in type 2 diabetic patients causes modest weight gain and no change in body fat distribution, LBM or liver fat. In contrast, the addition of pioglitazone, at equivalent glycaemia, increases weight gain, fat mass and SAT; increases LBM and tends to decrease liver fat. These changes in fat distribution may contribute to the beneficial effects of pioglitazone, despite greater weight gain.

### Pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride (actoplus Met) [^113q1t2U]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

DESCRIPTION

ACTOPLUS MET®(pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride) tablets contain two oral antihyperglycemic drugs used in the management of type 2 diabetes: pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride. The concomitant use of pioglitazone and metformin has been previously approved based on clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin. Additional efficacy and safety information about pioglitazone and metformin monotherapies may be found in the prescribing information for each individual drug.

Pioglitazone hydrochloride is an oral antihyperglycemic agent that acts primarily by decreasing insulin resistance. Pioglitazone is used in the management of type 2 diabetes. Pharmacological studies indicate that pioglitazone improves sensitivity to insulin in muscle and adipose tissue and inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis. Pioglitazone improves glycemic control while reducing circulating insulin levels.

Pioglitazone [(±)-5-[[4-[2-(5-ethyl-2-pyridinyl)ethoxy]phenyl]methyl]-2,4-] thiazolidinedione monohydrochloride belongs to a different chemical class and has a different pharmacological action than the sulfonylureas, biguanides, or the α-glucosidase inhibitors. The molecule contains one asymmetric center, and the synthetic compound is a racemate. The two enantiomers of pioglitazone interconvert in vivo. The structural formula is as shown:

### Practical strategies for improving outcomes in T2DM: the potential role of pioglitazone and DPP4 inhibitors [^115jbxAU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

T2DM is a complex disease underlined by multiple pathogenic defects responsible for the development and progression of hyperglycaemia. Each of these factors can now be tackled in a more targeted manner thanks to glucose‐lowering drugs that have been made available in the past 2 to 3 decades. Recognition of the multiplicity of the mechanisms underlying hyperglycaemia calls for treatments that address more than 1 of these mechanisms, with more emphasis placed on the earlier use of combination therapies. Although chronic hyperglycaemia contributes to and amplifies cardiovascular risk, several trials have failed to show a marked effect from intensive glycaemic control. During the past 10 years, the effect of specific glucose‐lowering agents on cardiovascular risk has been explored with dedicated trials. Overall, the cardiovascular safety of the new glucose‐lowering agents has been proven with some of the trials summarized in this review, showing significant reduction of cardiovascular risk. Against this background, pioglitazone, in addition to exerting a sustained glucose‐lowering effect, also has ancillary metabolic actions of potential interest in addressing the cardiovascular risk of T2DM, such as preservation of beta‐cell mass and function. As such, it seems a logical agent to combine with other oral anti‐hyperglycaemic agents, including dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors (DPP4i). DPP4i, which may also have a potential to preserve beta‐cell function, is available as a fixed‐dose combination with pioglitazone, and could, potentially, attenuate some of the side effects of pioglitazone, particularly if a lower dose of the thiazolidinedione is used. This review critically discusses the potential for early combination of pioglitazone and DPP4i.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Pioglitazone

Clinical studies demonstrate that pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients. Pioglitazone enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal and improves hepatic sensitivity to insulin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the decreased insulin resistance produced by pioglitazone results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin concentrations, and lower HbA1c values. In controlled clinical trials, pioglitazone had an additive effect on glycemic control when used in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Patients with lipid abnormalities were included in clinical trials with pioglitazone. Overall, patients treated with pioglitazone had mean decreases in serum triglycerides, mean increases in HDL cholesterol, and no consistent mean changes in LDL and total cholesterol. There is no conclusive evidence of macrovascular benefit with pioglitazone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In a 26-week, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging monotherapy study, mean serum triglycerides decreased in the 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg pioglitazone dose groups compared to a mean increase in the placebo group. Mean HDL cholesterol increased to a greater extent in patients treated with pioglitazone than in the placebo-treated patients. There were no consistent differences for LDL and total cholesterol in patients treated with pioglitazone compared to placebo (Table 12).

In the two other monotherapy studies (16 weeks and 24 weeks) and in combination therapy studies with sulfonylurea (16 weeks and 24 weeks), metformin (16 weeks and 24 weeks) or insulin (16 weeks and 24 weeks), the results were generally consistent with the data above.

Glimepiride

In healthy subjects, the time to reach maximal effect (minimum blood glucose concentrations) was approximately by two to three hours after single oral doses of glimepiride. The effects of HbA1C, fasting plasma glucose, and post-prandial glucose have been assessed in clinical trials.

### Treating insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes with metformin and thiazolidinediones [^113XcYvw]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance underlies the pathogenesis of hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular disease in most people with type 2 diabetes. Metformin and thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) counter insulin resistance by different cellular mechanisms and with complementary effects, making them suited for use in combination. Metformin exerts a stronger suppression of hepatic glucose output, while thiazolidinediones produce a greater increase in peripheral glucose uptake, enabling metformin-thiazolidinedione combinations to improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes with additive efficacy. Basal insulin concentrations are not raised by metformin or thiazolidinediones, so there is minimal risk of hypoglycaemia, and metformin can reduce the weight gain associated with thiazolidinediones. There are overlapping effects of metformin and thiazolidinediones against a range of athero-thrombotic factors and markers. These include decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, reduced platelet aggregation, reductions of several vascular adhesion molecules, and reduced markers of low-grade inflammation such as C-reactive protein. Additionally, thiazolidinediones increase adiponectin and slightly reduce blood pressure. Both metformin and thiazolidinediones can improve components of the lipid profile: thiazolidinediones consistently reduce free fatty acid concentrations and decrease the proportion of small dense low-density-lipoprotein, and pioglitazone also decreases triglycerides. During co-administration, metformin and thiazolidinediones do not interfere with each other's pharmacokinetics, and lower doses of the two agents together can achieve efficacy with fewer side effects. Metformin-thiazolidinedione combinations require attention to the precautions for both agents, especially renal, cardiac and hepatic status. Thus, metformin and thiazolidinediones can be used in combination to address the hyperglycaemia and vascular risk in type 2 diabetes.

5.1 Congestive Heart Failure

Pioglitazone

Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride must be considered [see BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].

### Glitazones in type 2 diabetes: an update [^117CeD9V]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

The glitazones and their combination products are licensed for type 2 diabetes mellitus and now account for over 50% of NHS expenditure on oral hypoglycaemic drugs. In 2001, for pioglitazone and rosiglitazone (the two glitazones licensed in the UK), we concluded that evidence (from short-term studies) supported their use in combination with metformin or a sulphonylurea in patients unsuited to one or other of these drugs, but not more practical glitazone use, such as monotherapy or as part of triple therapy. We also said that their long-term effects were not yet clear. Since then, both drugs have also been licensed for monotherapy, as part of triple therapy that includes metformin and a sulphonylurea and, for pioglitazone, use with insulin. Here we reassess glitazones in light of published efficacy data and safety concerns raised in recent years.

6 Implications for Future Research

Future research should focus on longer‐term cardiovascular outcomes, optimal dosing strategies and effectiveness in diverse populations. Additionally, head‐to‐head comparisons with other third‐line agents would help further define pioglitazone's place in the treatment algorithm. Future studies need to include a large number of patients to increase the power of the findings.

### Can glycemic targets be achieved – in particular with two daily injections of a mix of intermediate-and short-acting insulin? [^112Ayuh4]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To present data that demonstrate the feasibility of using twice-daily insulin injections, in combination with selected orally administered agents, to achieve glycemic targets in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Recent studies of the effects of various therapeutic strategies in patients with type 2 diabetes are reviewed, and the rationale for and recommended approaches in the use of combination treatment to achieve glycemic goals are discussed.

Results

The combination of insulin and insulin sensitizers is an effective option for achieving glycemic goals (hemoglobin A1c pound 6.5%). Although thiazolidinediones are better sensitizers than metformin, they are associated with significant weight gain. In contradistinction, metformin, an effective insulin sensitizer, causes less weight gain. The sequence in which these two sensitizers are added to insulin therapy is important; if metformin is added before a thiazolidinedione, weight gain may be avoided.

Conclusion

Glycemic targets can be achieved with use of twice-daily mixtures of intermediate- and short-acting insulin in a high percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes.

Pioglitazone and Cardiovascular Outcome

Following concerns regarding the cardiovascular safety of rosiglitazone, the effect of pioglitazone on cardiovascular outcomes has been closely evaluated in recent years. Even though they belong to the same class, unlike rosiglitazone, pioglitazone has a favorable cardiovascular outcome.

A meta-analysis of 19 trials comparing pioglitazone with placebo or active comparator in 16,390 patients with diabetes has shown that pioglitazone was associated with a significantly lower risk of death, MI, or stroke. Death, MI, or stroke occurred in 375 out of 8,554 patients (4.4%) on pioglitazone therapy as compared to 450 of 7,836 patients (5.7%) receiving controlled therapy [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.94; P = 0.005].

### Addition of pioglitazone or bedtime insulin to maximal doses of sulfonylurea and metformin in type 2 diabetes patients with poor glucose control: a prospective, randomized trial [^114T5gCQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy of adding pioglitazone or bedtime isophane (NPH) insulin to maximal doses of metformin and an insulin secretagogue in patients with poor glucose control.

Methods

We conducted a nonblinded, open-label, randomized controlled trial involving 62 patients with type 2 diabetes and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels > 8.0%. Patients received either pioglitazone or bedtime NPH insulin in addition to their usual diabetes medication for 16 weeks. Outcome measurements of glycemic control, hypoglycemia, blood pressure, lipid levels, microalbuminuria, and quality of life were assessed at baseline and at 16 weeks.

Results

HbA1C levels were lowered to a similar degree in each treatment arm (pioglitazone: -1.9% ± 1.5%; insulin: -2.3% ± 1.5%; P = 0.32), but hypoglycemia was less common among patients who received pioglitazone than those who received insulin (37% [11/30] vs. 68% [19/28], P = 0.02). Pioglitazone, but not insulin, resulted in an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Both treatments had similar effects on weight, other lipid values, blood pressure, and urine microalbumin levels.

Conclusion

Adding pioglitazone or bedtime insulin for 16 weeks improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients with secondary oral agent failure. Pioglitazone was associated with less hypoglycemia and improved HDL cholesterol levels.

### Comparing the effects of insulin glargine and thiazolidinediones on plasma lipids in type 2 diabetes: a patient-level pooled analysis [^116YgTWj]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our analysis suggests that insulin has beneficial effects on lipids and glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes. The clinical impact of this observation on cardiovascular risk reduction will be addressed specifically in the ORIGIN (Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention) trial. This randomized controlled study was designed to evaluate the effects of insulin glargine on cardiovascular risk and mortality in a variety of dysglycaemic patients (i.e. impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes) who are at high risk for a cardiovascular event. Therefore, the findings of this study will be applicable to a broad spectrum of patients with glycaemic abnormalities.

The choice of antihyperglycaemics should be individualized according to the patient's medical history, disease characteristics, comorbidities, baseline A 1c, lifestyle, body weight, and risk of adverse events. Insulin glargine might be more appropriate for patients requiring a greater reduction in A 1c, whereas TZD might be more appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycaemia. On the basis of our study, either insulin glargine or pioglitazone can be chosen if additional benefits on lipids are a consideration for choosing an antihyperglycaemic agent. Insulin glargine might be more appropriate, for instance, in patients taking a lipid-lowering medication, in light of the synergistic effects of statins and insulin glargine observed in this study, whereas pioglitazone may be preferred if HDL is very low. Either insulin glargine or pioglitazone may be beneficial in patients at risk for cardiovascular disease.

5.3 Edema

In controlled clinical trials with pioglitazone, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening of edema have been received.

Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, are known to cause hypoglycemia. Therefore, a lower dosage of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride [see Drug Interactions (7.6, 7.7)].

### Rethinking pioglitazone as a cardioprotective agent: a new perspective on an overlooked drug [^114cmfun]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early after their approval for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in 1985, the insulin-sensitizing agents thiazolidinediones (TDZs) pioglitazone, rosiglitazone and troglitazone displayed alleged safety concerns about fluid retention, increased risk of developing heart failure (HF), ischemic heart disease, and liver toxicity -not all substantiated by later observations-, determining troglitazone and rosiglitazone withdrawal and subsequent reinstatements. Moreover, concerns related to potential adverse effects of pioglitazone, including weight gain, bladder cancer and decreased bone mineral density with increased risk of fractures, have led to a progressive and sustained decline in pioglitazone prescriptions. Nevertheless, treatment with pioglitazone is still available in most countries, is cost-effective, and has gained renewed popularity after novel favorable evidence. Especially after the discovery of the cardioprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists, the T2D treatment paradigm has faced a Copernican revolution, now also focusing on non-glycemic, cardioprotective effects of glucose-lowering agents -including the oldest ones. Despite the initial aversion due to increased HF risk, several studies have examined the complex metabolic and biological roles of pioglitazone in many cardiovascular diseases. Experimental and human data suggest beneficial effects on the vascular system, including delayed atherosclerosis progression and reduced cardiovascular events. Although pioglitazone might worsen HF by inducing sodium-water retention and oedema, there are some counterarguments: first, it does not increase mortality due to HF, second, it has no detectable deleterious effect on the heart. On the contrary, it positively modulates several cardiac and vascular functions, as well as some cardiovascular risk factors, either directly or indirectly through its main target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), as it will be later clarified. The non-negligible degree of uncertainty about the safety and the exact effects of pioglitazone on the cardiovascular system, both in research and in everyday clinical practice, makes it a very current topic. This is particularly relevant in a worldwide environment where cardiovascular diseases and "diabesity" are the 21st century leading pandemic, with a very high economic impact on the healthcare systems.

To clarify this issue, we reviewed the available literature on the cardiac and vascular effects of pioglitazone, encompassing both in vitro and in vivo studies in experimental animals and humans, as well as the evidence generated by major randomized clinical trials (RCTs), to condensate and critically evaluate the evidence for an aware clinical use of pioglitazone.

### Pioglitazone and metformin [^112YwZ8r]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Pioglitazone

A total of 92 patients (15.2%) treated with pioglitazone in the three pooled 16- to 26-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, monotherapy trials were ≥ 65 years old and 2 patients (0.3%) were ≥ 75 years old. In the two pooled 16- to 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trials, 201 patients (18.7%) treated with pioglitazone were ≥ 65 years old and 19 (1.8%) were ≥ 75 years old. In the two pooled 16- to 24-week add-on to metformin trials, 155 patients (15.5%) treated with pioglitazone were ≥ 65 years old and 19 (1.9%) were ≥ 75 years old. In the two pooled 16- to 24-week add-on to insulin trials, 272 patients (25.4%) treated with pioglitazone were ≥ 65 years old and 22 (2.1%) were ≥ 75 years old.

In PROactive Trial, 1,068 patients (41%) treated with pioglitazone were ≥ 65 years old and 42 (1.6%) were ≥ 75 years old.

In pharmacokinetic studies with pioglitazone, no significant differences were observed in pharmacokinetic parameters between elderly and younger patients [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

Although clinical experiences have not identified differences in effectiveness and safety between the elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger patients, these conclusions are limited by small sample sizes for patients ≥ 75 years old.

Metformin hydrochloride

Controlled clinical studies of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients. Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and because the risk of serious adverse reactions to the drug is greater in patients with impaired renal function, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should only be used in patients with normal renal function [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2), and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Because aging is associated with reduced renal function, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be used with caution as age increases. Care should be taken in dose selection and should be based on careful and regular monitoring of renal function. Generally, elderly patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)].

### Pioglitazone (Actos) [^113c1Hs9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of pioglitazone hydrochloride PO (also known as Actos):
- **ALF**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as pioglitazone has been associated with an increased risk of fatal and non-fatal liver failure. Discontinue pioglitazone in case of abnormal liver tests.
- **Bladder cancer**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as pioglitazone has been associated with an increased risk of urinary bladder tumors.
- **Bone fracture**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as pioglitazone has been associated with an increased risk of fractures in females.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas. Consider reducing the dose of the concomitant medication.
- **Exacerbation of edema**: use caution in patients with edema.
- **Exacerbation of HF**: maintain a high level of suspicion, thiazolidinediones have been associated with an increased risk of dose-related fluid retention leading to or exacerbating congestive HF. Start at 15 mg daily in patients with congestive HF (NYHA class I-II).
- **Macular edema**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as pioglitazone has been associated with an increased risk of macular edema in patients with diabetes.

### Effects of different insulin sensitisers in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112bgArJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Characteristic features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) include insulin resistance and an increased risk for type 2 diabetes. To promote improved insulin sensitivity, insulin sensitisers have been used in PCOS. However, direct comparisons across these agents are limited. This study compared the effects of metformin, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone in the management of PCOS to inform the 2023 International Evidence-based PCOS Guideline.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.

Patients

Women with PCOS and treatment with insulin sensitisers.

Measurements

Hormonal and clinical outcomes, as well as side effects.

Results

Of 1660 publications identified, 13 randomised controlled trials were included. Metformin was superior in lowering weight (mean difference [MD]: -4.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -7.69 to -1.08kg), body mass index (MD: -0.95, 95% CI: -1.41 to -0.49kg/m 2) and testosterone (MD: -0.10, 95% CI: -0.18 to -0.03nmol/L) versus rosiglitazone, whereas there was no difference when comparing metformin to pioglitazone. Adding rosiglitazone or pioglitazone to metformin did not improve metabolic outcomes. However, rosiglitazone seemed superior to metformin in lowering lipid concentrations.

Conclusions

Metformin should remain the first-line insulin sensitising treatment in adults with PCOS for the prevention and management of weight and metabolic features. The addition of thiazolidinediones appears to offer little benefit.

### Prevention or delay of diabetes and associated comorbidities: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116jTdcv]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Post-stroke insulin resistance/prediabetes — pioglitazone option and risks: 3.11 In people with a history of stroke and evidence of insulin resistance and prediabetes, pioglitazone may be considered to lower the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction. However, this benefit needs to be balanced with the increased risk of weight gain, edema, and fractures, and lower doses may mitigate the risk of adverse effects but may be less effective.

### Glycaemic and nonglycaemic effects of pioglitazone in triple oral therapy of patients with type 2 diabetes [^117VmFhV]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine pioglitazone as add-on to metformin and insulin secretagogues in patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycaemic control and its effect on glycaemic control, surrogate measures of insulin sensitivity (adiponectin) and beta-cell function (proinsulin/insulin) and fluid retention.

Design and Setting

Prospective open-label study of 54 patients with type 2 diabetes and HbA1c ≥ 6.5% admitted to outpatient unit at Malmö University Hospital. The patients received 30–45 mg pioglitazone daily during 26 weeks in addition to their existing antidiabetic medication. After 26 weeks, one-third of patients were followed for 3 months without pioglitazone.

Results

HbA1c decreased (7.8 ± 0.9–6.3 ± 0.9%, P < 0.001) with 61% of patients achieving levels < 6.5%. However, in the group followed for another 3 months HbA1c increased (6.1 ± 0.73–7.1 ± 0.9, n = 18, P < 0.001) after pioglitazone withdrawal. Adiponectin increased (6.1 ± 2.8–13.2 ± 5.8 microg mL-1, P < 0.001) and the proinsulin to insulin ratio decreased (0.89 ± 0.66–0.66 ± 0.53, P < 0.001). Nt-proBNP increased from 487.3 ± 252.2 to 657.8 ± 392.1 pmol L-1 (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Pioglitazone is effective in achieving glycaemic targets and reducing risk factors involved in atherosclerosis and improving beta-cell function when used as part of triple oral therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and secondary drug failure. Nt-proBNP increase with concomitant decrease in haemoglobin suggests a subclinical sign of fluid retention.
