## Question

Which proton pump inhibitor reverses cirrhosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which proton pump inhibitor reverses cirrhosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether cirrhosis is medically reversible and under what circumstances. Then, I should verify if any PPI has proven antifibrotic activity in the liver specifically. Next, I will examine the provided evidence base for benefits versus harms of PPIs in cirrhosis. After that, I should review professional society guidance on PPI use in cirrhosis. Finally, I will consider whether any individual PPI differs meaningfully and synthesize a clear clinical answer with caveats and safer alternatives [^113NWR8v] [^116mWueB].

> Let me first confirm the disease biology. Cirrhosis represents advanced architectural distortion with fibrotic remodeling; meaningful reversal is uncommon outside of early-stage fibrosis regression when the cause is removed, and there is no established pharmacotherapy that reliably reverses established cirrhosis, so I need to be cautious about any claim that an antisecretory agent would undo hepatic scarring [^113NWR8v] [^116mWueB].

> I should double-check what the documents actually say about PPIs and cirrhosis. Wait, let me verify: scanning the referenced materials, I do not see any trial or guideline stating that any PPI — omeprazole, pantoprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole — reverses cirrhosis; instead, most data focus on associations with infections, encephalopathy, decompensation, or mortality, which points in the opposite direction of "reversal" [^115gsEYy] [^1149zDdA] [^1155S9N7].

> Next, I will examine harms because they appear to dominate. I need to ensure I cite effect sizes correctly: PPI exposure in cirrhosis cohorts is linked to higher risks of hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, with adjusted hazard ratios around 1.36–1.88 for HE and approximately 1.7–2.3 for SBP in several large analyses, and there is also a signal for increased pneumonia risk with pooled RR about 1.36, so PPIs tend to worsen — not improve — cirrhosis outcomes [^1149zDdA] [^112nYyAF] [^111zG4qE] [^1145sj6i].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mortality without checking nuances. In the large VA cohort, binary PPI use seemed neutral overall but looked beneficial within the subgroup hospitalized for GI bleeding; wait, I should verify the main finding: cumulative PPI exposure outside the GI bleeding context was actually associated with increased all-cause mortality, severe infection, decompensation, and liver-related death, which argues strongly against any "reversal" effect from PPIs in cirrhosis [^115gsEYy].

> I will now examine mechanisms to see if there is any biologic plausibility for benefit in the liver. Hmm, wait a minute — most mechanistic data point toward harm: acid suppression promotes bacterial overgrowth (notably Enterococcus), increases gut permeability and translocation, and worsens cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction, thereby fueling inflammation, infections, encephalopathy, and decompensation, which is the opposite of antifibrotic remodeling in the liver [^117CfCPz] [^1149zDdA] [^114uGApm] [^111QTxMx].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to confirm appropriate indications. I need to check: major guidance discourages routine PPI use in cirrhosis and limits it to clear acid-related indications; short-term use after variceal banding to reduce post-ligation ulcer size is the only commonly cited, time-limited scenario, while PPIs are not indicated to prevent variceal hemorrhage or portal hypertensive gastropathy, and deprescribing is encouraged when no valid indication exists [^114hVor5] [^1155S9N7] [^116mWueB] [^117AFx4X].

> Let me consider real-world practice patterns and the potential benefit of stopping PPIs. I should confirm inappropriate use rates: over half of cirrhotic patients on PPIs lack a valid indication in multiple cohorts, and an emulated trial suggests deprescribing associates with less ascites and fewer encephalopathy events, though many patients restart without clear need, underscoring overuse rather than benefit in cirrhosis [^113y2sdi] [^11365gxo] [^117BA27n].

> But wait, what if the IPF literature about PPIs being "antifibrotic" could mislead us into thinking they reverse liver fibrosis? I need to check and reconcile this. The lung data are organ-specific hypotheses with conflicting clinical signals, and the current multidisciplinary IPF guideline does not support antacid therapy for antifibrotic outcomes; more importantly, none of this translates to hepatic fibrosis reversal in cirrhosis, so I should not extrapolate cross-organ speculation to the liver [^112Y1P7i] [^114HEXPn].

> I should verify whether any particular PPI differs in a way that could matter here. Pharmacologically, pantoprazole binds an additional cysteine on the pump and may have a longer reactivation half-life, but these distinctions relate to acid suppression kinetics, not hepatic antifibrosis; there is no evidence that any individual PPI has a unique liver antifibrotic effect, and the observed harms are class-wide and related to acid suppression and the gut–liver axis [^1128okGu] [^1144mfWD].

> Let me synthesize and ensure I am not missing alternatives. For cirrhosis modification, the evidence-based strategies are etiologic therapy, portal pressure reduction with nonselective beta-blockers or endoscopic variceal ligation, appropriate SBP prophylaxis in indicated settings, and comprehensive decompensation management; PPIs play no role in reversing cirrhosis and should be used only for clear acid-related indications and for short courses post-banding when needed, followed by deprescribing if the indication resolves [^115FRqs1] [^117BUkCq] [^112Vj7Py] [^114hVor5] [^1155S9N7] [^116mWueB].

> Conclusion and clinical answer: I should double-check my bottom line — no proton pump inhibitor reverses cirrhosis; in fact, cumulative exposure is associated with more infections, decompensation, and mortality in patients without active GI bleeding, so PPIs should not be used with the expectation of hepatic fibrosis regression and should be limited to proper indications with active efforts to deprescribe when possible [^115gsEYy] [^1149zDdA] [^117AFx4X].

No proton pump inhibitor **reverses cirrhosis** [^1144mfWD]. PPIs are **not antifibrotic and do not improve liver structure or function** [^1144mfWD]; instead, they are **associated with higher risks** of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^113qugjm], hepatic encephalopathy [^1149zDdA] [^114uGApm], and mortality in cirrhosis [^115gsEYy]. Use PPIs only for **clear indications** (e.g. peptic ulcer disease, GERD, or short-term post–variceal banding ulcers) [^1155S9N7] and **avoid routine or prolonged use** in cirrhosis [^114hVor5] [^116mRu8j].

---

## Evidence regarding PPIs and cirrhosis reversal

- **No evidence of reversal**: There is no evidence that any PPI reverses cirrhosis or improves liver histology or function [^1144mfWD] [^1155S9N7].
- **Increased complications**: PPI use in cirrhosis is linked to higher risks of SBP [^113qugjm] [^1123weig], hepatic encephalopathy [^1149zDdA] [^114uGApm], and mortality [^115gsEYy].
- **No antifibrotic effect**: PPIs do not have antifibrotic properties and do not reverse liver fibrosis or cirrhosis [^1144mfWD].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Use PPIs **only for clear indications** [^116mRu8j] (e.g. peptic ulcer disease, GERD, or short-term post–variceal banding ulcers) [^1155S9N7]. In cirrhosis, **avoid routine or prolonged use** [^112Vj7Py] because of increased risks of infections and other complications.

---

## Conclusion

No proton pump inhibitor **reverses cirrhosis** [^1144mfWD]. Use PPIs **cautiously and only for clear indications** in cirrhosis because they are associated with increased risks of complications and mortality [^115gsEYy].

### Proton pump inhibitors as a risk factor for hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis with ascites [^1149zDdA]. Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may be a risk factor for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in patients with cirrhosis, possibly through translocation of gut bacteria, which can also lead to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). We examined the associations between PPIs and the development of HE or SBP in patients with cirrhosis with ascites. Data from three 1-year trials of satavaptan for ascites control were used.

Cox regression was employed to compare HE and SBP rates between users and non-users of PPIs. At inclusion, 39% of the 865 patients with cirrhosis with ascites used PPIs. During the follow-up, 52% of patients used them at some point, with the proportion of users consistently between 30%-39%. There were 189 first-time HE episodes during the follow-up, with a cumulative 1-year risk of 31% for those who used PPIs at baseline versus 25% for non-users. The confounder-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of HE for PPI use versus non-use was 1.36 (95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.84). The HR for overt HE was higher (adjusted HR = 1.88; 95% CI, 1.21–1.91). Additionally, 86 patients developed SBP during the follow-up, with an adjusted HR of 1.72 (95% CI, 1.10–2.69) for PPI users versus non-users.

In conclusion, PPIs were used by 52% of this international cirrhosis cohort during a 1-year period and were a risk factor for developing HE and SBP. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that PPIs may increase translocation of gut bacteria.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^1155S9N7]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In patients with liver cirrhosis, the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) must be handled with caution. There is no evidence of benefit except for reducing esophageal ulcers following sclerotherapy or banding of esophageal varices. Furthermore, their use may be linked to the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

In clinical practice, PPI therapy is frequently administered to cirrhotic patients, even in the absence of an acid-related disease, to prevent bleeding from hypertensive gastropathy. However, this approach lacks evidence support and is therefore unjustified, especially considering the significantly reduced acid secretion in these patients.

A systematic review conducted in 2008 found no randomized clinical trials on acid-lowering drugs for preventing esophago-gastric variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. Consequently, the benefits or harms of these drugs in this context remain unclear. Notably, PPI use is linked to microbiota shifts and functional changes in the distal gut of patients with compensated cirrhosis, potentially exacerbating pre-existing small intestine bacterial overgrowth.

The only indication for PPIs, albeit weakly evidence-based, is the prevention and/or treatment of esophageal ulcers following sclerotherapy or variceal band ligation. The best available evidence supports the short-term use (a maximum of 10 days) of PPIs to reduce ulcer size, assuming spontaneous ulcer healing is a concern.

### The association between proton pump inhibitor exposure and key liver-related outcomes in patients with cirrhosis: A Veterans Affairs cohort study [^115gsEYy]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

The impact of proton pump inhibitory (PPI) medications on adverse outcomes in cirrhosis remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the association between PPI exposure and all-cause mortality, infection, and decompensation in a large national cohort.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective study of patients with cirrhosis in the Veterans Health Administration. PPI exposure was classified as a time-updating variable from the index time of the cirrhosis diagnosis. Inverse probability treatment weighting-adjusted Cox regression was performed, with additional adjustment for key time-varying covariates, including cardiovascular comorbidities, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and statin exposure.

- **Results**: The study included 76,251 patients, 23,628 of whom were on a PPI at baseline. In adjusted models, binary (yes/no) PPI exposure was associated with a reduced hazard of all-cause mortality in patients with hospitalization for GIB (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.84–0.91; P < .001) but had no significant association in all others (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.02; p = 0.58). However, cumulative PPI exposure was associated with increased mortality in patients without hospitalization for GIB (HR, 1.07 per 320 mg-months [omeprazole equivalents]; 95% CI, 1.06–1.08; P < .001). PPI exposure was significantly associated with severe infection (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.18–1.24; P < .001) and decompensation (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.61–1.68; P < .001). In a cause-specific mortality analysis, PPI exposure was associated with increased liver-related mortality (HR, 1.23).

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with minimal and overt hepatic encephalopathy and increased mortality in patients with cirrhosis [^114uGApm]. Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is a subclinical cognitive impairment frequently observable in patients with cirrhosis. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can contribute to small-bowel bacterial overgrowth, but no study has investigated the link between PPIs and MHE. We investigated the relationship between MHE and PPI use, as well as the role of PPI use in the development of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and survival.

Consecutive patients with cirrhosis (n = 310) were included in the study and followed up for 14.1 ± 12.3 months. At entry, MHE was diagnosed when the Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score was ≤ -4. Data were analyzed by logistic regression for the factors associated with MHE and by time-related models for overt HE development and survival.

At inclusion, 131 out of 310 patients with cirrhosis (42%) were affected by MHE. One hundred and twenty-five patients (40%) were using PPIs. The variables independently associated with the presence of MHE were PPI use, previous overt HE, low albumin, low sodium, and age. During follow-up, the development of overt HE was higher (64% versus 25%, P < 0.001) and overall survival lower (41% versus 81%, P < 0.001) in PPI users than in nonusers.
- **Factors associated with overt HE**: Variables independently associated with the development of overt HE were PPI use, history of overt HE, low albumin, MHE, and age.
- **Factors associated with mortality**: Variables independently associated with mortality were PPI use, development of overt HE, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, low sodium, and age.

The study identifies a potentially removable factor associated with the presence of MHE and related to the development of overt HE.

### Bacterial load and cytokine profile in patients with cirrhosis following therapy with proton pump inhibitors: a prospective cohort study [^111A71jR]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to explore the presence of bacterial products and the cytokine profile in outpatients with cirrhosis before and after short-term (4–8 weeks) administration of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).
- **Methods**: Seventeen patients with cirrhosis (male/female: 12/5; median age: 59.2 years, range 49–65) were included, with etiologies including HBV ± HDV (23.5%), HCV (17.7%), alcohol (41.2%), and other (17.6%). The Child-Pugh score median was 7.5 (range 5–12) and the Model for End-stage Liver Disease was 10.5 (range 7–21) with 17.7% presenting with ascites. Indications for PPIs were esophagitis (35.3%), peptic ulcer (58.6%), and other (5.9%). Bacterial DNA in serum, and levels of endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide binding protein, transforming growth factor-β, interleukin-1β, -6, -8, -12, -10, tumor necrosis factor-α, and nitric oxide were assessed at baseline (time 1) and at the end of treatment (time 2). The Wilcoxon signed rank test evaluated significant differences before and after PPI administration.
- **Results**: No patients developed infection during the study period. Bacterial DNA was not detected before or after treatment. No significant differences were observed in the concentrations of any indices between times 1 and 2 (P > 0.05). Subgroup analysis according to Child-Pugh stage yielded similar results.
- **Conclusion**: Short-term administration of PPIs had no effect on bacterial DNA, bacterial products, or cytokine concentrations in patients with liver cirrhosis.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in adults: An official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guideline [^114HEXPn]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

A small randomized trial found no significant difference in 90-day mortality when a proton pump inhibitor was compared with placebo, and multiple observational studies that reported mortality at time points ranging from 30 weeks to 5 years all revealed no significant difference when antacid medication was compared with no medication. Only the 1-year time point was reported by multiple observational studies and therefore could be evaluated by a meta-analysis, which showed no significant difference when antacid medication was compared with no antacid medication. There were similarly no differences in IPF-related mortality according to four observational studies.

Meta-analyses of observational studies detected no statistically significant effect on exacerbations over a 30-week to 1-year follow-up period or hospitalizations over a 90-day to 1-year follow-up period. A small randomized trial similarly showed no effect on hospitalizations at 90 days.

A meta-analysis of three observational studies showed no difference in the change of percentage predicted FVC when patients who received antacid medication were compared with those who did not receive antacid medication. Additional observational studies similarly demonstrated no differences in the change in FVC or 6MWD between patients with and without antacid medication over 30 weeks to 1 year. A small randomized trial showed that FVC and percentage predicted FVC were both decreased at 90 days in the omeprazole group, but not the placebo group, with no differences in D CO or 6MWD.

### Inhibiting the proton pump: Mechanisms, benefits, harms, and questions [^115w3zAB]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Some drugs used to modulate gastric acid secretion and their times of introduction (earliest papers listed in PubMed); some are no longer in use. The color coding corresponds to that in a previous figure.

The H+/K+-adenosine triphosphatase (the proton pump) on the apical surfaces of gastric parietal cells is the final common pathway for medicines with different mechanisms of action that alter gastric acid secretion. This observation led to the development of a range of substituted benzimidazoles that inhibit the pump, which have come to be known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), of which omeprazole was the first to be developed for clinical use. Recently, newer reversible PPI inhibitors, potassium-competitive acid blockers such as vonoprazan, have also become available.

### AGA clinical practice update on de-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: Expert review [^117AFx4X]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for deprescribing proton pump inhibitors, specifically concerning the indications for discontinuation, the AGA 2022 guidelines recommend discontinuing PPIs solely based on the absence of an indication for PPI therapy and not due to concerns of PPI-associated adverse events. The presence of a PPI-associated adverse event, a history of such an event in a PPI user, or underlying risk factors for developing a PPI-associated adverse event should not be used as independent indications for PPI withdrawal.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^116mWueB]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

The 2018 EASL guidelines provide recommendations for the medical management of liver cirrhosis, specifically relating to the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and secondary prevention strategies. It is recommended to initiate prophylactic norfloxacin (400 mg/day, PO) in patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP, as well as to prevent hepatorenal syndrome-AKI.

### Protonix i.v [^112ij7wk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Drug interactions**: Table 3 includes drugs with clinically important drug interactions and interactions with diagnostics when administered concomitantly with Protonix I.V., along with instructions for preventing or managing them. Consult the labeling of concomitantly used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with PPIs. See the full prescribing information for a list of clinically important drug interactions.

### Deprescribing proton pump inhibitors: Evidence-based clinical practice guideline [^115Snmg4]. Canadian Family Physician Medecin de Famille Canadien (2017). High credibility.

In the context of medical management for deprescribing proton pump inhibitors, the CFPC 2017 guidelines recommend either decreasing the daily dose or discontinuing PPIs altogether, transitioning to on-demand use. This approach is advised for adult patients who have completed a minimum of a 4-week course of PPI treatment and have experienced a resolution of upper gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Vitamin B(12) deficiency associated with concomitant metformin and proton pump inhibitor use [^116Ckgw8]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Metformin is a first-line medication used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes but has also been shown in multiple studies to reduce serum B12 levels in 10–30% of patients. Proton pump inhibitors are commonly used medications for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer prevention and treatment. In the short term, they have been shown to decrease B12 levels from 3.4% to 0.4% (P < 0.05) over a 2-week period. However, studies looking at long-term proton pump inhibitor use and vitamin B12 deficiency have yielded conflicting results. Ting et al. found no significantly increased risk associated with the use of histamine H2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors in the development of metformin-related B12 deficiency. However, they did not separate out the use of H2 blockers from proton pump inhibitors in calculating the risk of developing metformin-related B12 deficiency.

Proton pump inhibitors and metformin alone were not associated with a significant difference in vitamin B12 deficiency, but the combination was associated with a significant increase in vitamin B12 deficiency. More studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which proton pump inhibitors and metformin affect vitamin B12 levels and relate these changes to clinical findings.

### Iqirvo [^114TSCry]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The safety and efficacy of Iqirvo in patients with decompensated cirrhosis have not been established. Use of Iqirvo is not recommended in patients who have or develop decompensated cirrhosis (e.g. ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy). Monitor patients with cirrhosis for evidence of decompensation. Consider discontinuing Iqirvo if the patient progresses to moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).

### Cirrhotic patients on proton pump inhibitors are at a twofold risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis independently of gastrointestinal bleeding: a population-based retrospective study [^111zG4qE]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

We investigated the risk and predictors of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with cirrhosis using a multivariate regression analysis model. This model adjusted for age greater than 65 years, male sex, Caucasian ethnicity, and the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and β-blockers. The analysis revealed that cirrhotic patients with SBP had a higher risk associated with being male (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.25–1.35), and using β-blockers (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.21–1.31) or PPIs (OR 2.31, 95% CI 2.21–2.42).
- **Risk of developing SBP before controlling for gastrointestinal bleeding**: To further investigate the risk in patients using PPIs, the model was adjusted to control for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in addition to the covariates mentioned earlier. The findings indicated that the risk of SBP remained higher in male patients (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.25–1.34), patients diagnosed with GIB (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.64–1.76), and those using β-blockers (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.17–1.27) or PPIs (OR 2.13, 95% CI 2.03–2.23).

GI, gastrointestinal; PPI, proton pump inhibitor.

### Bacterial load and cytokine profile in patients with cirrhosis following therapy with proton pump inhibitors: A prospective cohort study [^111PFfdA]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

This prospective cohort study was performed at the University Hospital of Patras (Patras, Greece) between February 2010 and October 2011. Patients with a previous history of SBP, liver transplantation, human immunodeficiency virus infection, or any kind of immunosuppression, gastrointestinal bleeding, antibiotic prophylaxis during the last 2 weeks, hepatocellular carcinoma that exceeded the Milan criteria, portal vein thrombosis, and previous portosystemic shunt were excluded. We evaluated 45 consecutive patients with cirrhosis attending the hepatology outpatient clinic, who had no clinical, bacteriological, or radiological signs of urinary tract, respiratory, or systemic infection, and who underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Finally, 17 patients were enrolled (15 patients received antibiotics during the last 2 weeks or after endoscopy, 2 had hepatocellular carcinoma that exceeded the Milan criteria, and the others refused to participate in the study). Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.

The characteristics of PPI use in terms of indication for administration, duration of therapy, and the scheduled dose were recorded. "Appropriate" PPI use was defined as the use for the following indications: gastro-esophageal reflux disease, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication, Barrett's esophagus, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, prevention of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced ulcers, and peptic ulcer disease. Prophylaxis following variceal band ligation was also considered "appropriate".

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Novel concepts of proton pump inhibitors as antifibrotic drugs [^112Y1P7i]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The prevalence of abnormal acid gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is higher in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) than in matched control subjects. Several studies demonstrated that more than one-third of patients with IPF have abnormal esophageal acid exposures. In addition, many of these studies indicate that the majority of patients with IPF have silent reflux with no symptoms of GER. Findings of abnormal reflux persist in a large proportion of patients with IPF placed on antacid therapy such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). This seemingly paradoxical observation suggests that either patients with IPF are somehow resistant to PPI-based intervention or PPIs are inherently unable to suppress acid GER.

By contrast, patients with IPF who undergo Nissen fundoplication surgery are effectively relieved from the complications of GER, and retrospective studies suggest improved lung function. Retrospective, anecdotal data suggest a beneficial role of PPIs in IPF, including stabilization of lung function, reduction in episodes of acute exacerbation, and enhanced longevity. The recent evidence-based guidelines for treatment of IPF approved conditional recommendation of PPIs for all patients with IPF, regardless of their GER status.

Recently, we have reported that PPIs possess anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic activities by directly suppressing proinflammatory cytokines, profibrotic proteins, and proliferation of lung fibroblasts. Our study provides an alternative explanation for the beneficial effect of PPIs in IPF.

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^115FRqs1]. Gut (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, specifically concerning the prevention of variceal hemorrhage, the BSG 2015 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of carvedilol (6.25 mg once daily, titrating the dose to a maintenance dose of 12.5 mg following a week if tolerated or once a heart rate of < 50–55 bpm is reached) or nadolol (40 mg BID, titrating the dose to the maximum tolerated or once a heart rate of 50–55 bpm is achieved, to a maximum dose of 240 mg) as alternatives to propranolol.

### Pathophysiology and therapeutic options for cirrhotic portal hypertension [^113NWR8v]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Portal hypertension represents the primary non-neoplastic complication of liver cirrhosis and has life-threatening consequences, such as esophageal variceal bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. It occurs due to increased resistance of the cirrhotic liver vasculature to portal blood flow and is further aggravated by the hyperdynamic circulatory syndrome.

Existing knowledge indicates that the profibrogenic phenotype acquired by sinusoidal cells is the initial factor leading to increased hepatic vascular tone and fibrosis, causing increased vascular resistance and portal hypertension. Data also suggest that the phenotype of hepatic cells could be further impaired due to the altered mechanical properties of the cirrhotic liver itself, creating a deleterious cycle that worsens portal hypertension in the advanced stages of liver disease.

In this review, we discuss recent discoveries in the pathophysiology and treatment of cirrhotic portal hypertension, a condition with few pharmacological treatment options.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis: Risk stratification, diagnosis, and management: 2016 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^117BUkCq]. Hepatology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, and more specifically with respect to the prevention of variceal hemorrhage and secondary prevention, the AASLD 2017 guidelines recommend the performance of TIPS placement or balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration as first-line treatments. These are advised in the prevention of rebleeding in patients who have recovered from type 2 gastroesophageal or type 1 isolated gastric variceal hemorrhage.

### An emulated clinical trial of deprescribing proton pump inhibitors in patients with cirrhosis [^117BA27n]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are overused and pose risks in patients with cirrhosis. While deprescribing is advocated, it has not been trialed.
- **Methods and findings**: We emulated a clinical trial using Medicare data. All patients were on chronic PPI therapy prior to a compensated cirrhosis diagnosis. We compared the risk of death or decompensation over 3 years between continuous users and those who deprescribe. We found that PPI deprescribing is associated with less ascites, while cumulative PPI use is linked to more ascites and encephalopathy. Ultimately, 71% of those who deprescribe restart PPIs.
- **Discussion**: PPI deprescribing shows benefits but requires ongoing support and alternative therapies for managing gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Bacterial load and cytokine profile in patients with cirrhosis following therapy with proton pump inhibitors: a prospective cohort study [^111QTxMx]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Liver cirrhosis is associated with a type of immune dysfunction referred to as cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction syndrome. Altered small bowel motility, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and increased intestinal permeability lead to increased bacterial translocation and gut-related infections. Bacterial infections influence hemodynamics and coagulation status and represent one of the most important reasons for the progression of liver failure, development of liver-related complications, and mortality in patients with cirrhosis.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used in patients with cirrhosis because of the frequently observed mucosal abnormalities following screening endoscopy and their use as prophylaxis for bleeding from post-banding esophageal ulcers. Although there are data to suggest that PPIs increase the risk of infection, this positive association is not universal. In a study of 607 consecutive patients with cirrhosis undergoing their first paracentesis at a tertiary center, the authors observed no association between PPIs and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), other infections, or mortality, suggesting that the severity of liver disease and other factors, rather than PPI treatment per se, may predispose to infectious complications. Lastly, in a recent large, multicenter, prospective study, which included 519 patients with decompensated cirrhosis, PPI therapy was not found to be associated with a higher risk of SBP.

The interpretation of the published data is difficult because most of the studies were retrospective.

### Proton pump inhibitors: An update [^111Y5bhT]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Since their introduction in the late 1980s, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have demonstrated gastric acid suppression superior to that of histamine H2-receptor blockers. PPIs have enabled improved treatment of various acid-peptic disorders, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastropathy. They have minimal side effects, few significant drug interactions, and are generally considered safe for long-term treatment. The proton pump inhibitors omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and the recently approved esomeprazole appear to have similar efficacy.

### Cirrhotic patients on proton pump inhibitors are at a twofold risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis independently of gastrointestinal bleeding: a population-based retrospective study [^116NZUNR]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

In light of our findings and since the safety profile of PPIs still needs to be clearly defined, close surveillance for PPI use should be warranted in clinical practice settings. Recommendations should lean towards limiting the prescription of PPIs unless medically indicated. This recommendation applies to the general population and to cirrhotic patients in particular, given their higher risk of decompensating to SBP.

This study had several limitations, starting with its retrospective nature. Prospective studies with prolonged patient follow-up allow the establishment of a higher level of evidence. In addition, although the database used is longitudinal, our study looked at the use of PPIs as a whole, without assessing their time-sensitive nature (such as the date of initiation and duration of the course) or their cumulative effect. These limitations could affect the outcome measured and should be taken into consideration to help further understand and quantify the association between PPI use and the emergence of SBP, as clearly displayed in the study by Chang et al. Another significant limitation is the lack of information in the database about the Child-Pugh and model for end-stage liver disease scores of the patients in the population included. Since the risk of SBP is higher in individuals with severe liver disease, it would be interesting for further prospective studies to stratify the population at risk of developing SBP according to their liver disease severity. Moreover, the database used does not offer any information regarding previous episodes of SBP.

### Cirrhotic patients on proton pump inhibitors are at a twofold risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis independently of gastrointestinal bleeding: A population-based retrospective study [^112nYyAF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Recent findings suggest that cirrhotic patients on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are at a higher risk for developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) than non-PPI users. We aimed to identify whether PPI use is an independent risk factor for the development of SBP among cirrhotic patients in the United States (US).
- **Methods**: We enrolled a retrospective cohort using a validated multicenter database. Patients with a SNOMED-CT diagnosis of "cirrhosis" between 1999 and 2022 were identified. All patients below 18 years of age were excluded. We calculated the prevalence of individuals using PPIs in the total US population and in cirrhotic patients from 1999 up to the time of writing, and the incidence of SBP in the past year. Finally, we constructed a multivariate regression model, controlling for multiple covariates.
- **Results**: The final analysis included 377,420 patients. The 20-year prevalence of SBP in patients with cirrhosis was 3.54% and the prevalence of patients using PPIs in the US population was 12,000 per 100,000 people (12.00%). The 1-year incidence of SBP in cirrhotic patients using PPIs was 2500 per 100,000 people. After accounting for confounders, the risk of SBP was higher among males, patients with a diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding, and those using β-blockers and PPIs.
- **Conclusions**: At the time of writing, this is the largest cohort used to examine the prevalence of SBP among cirrhotic patients in the US. PPI use and hepatic encephalopathy offered the highest risk for the development of SBP, independently of gastrointestinal bleeding. Focusing on judicious PPI use is crucial.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^116474iY]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is characterized by pancreatic and peripancreatic fat injury, partly mediated by autodigestive enzymes. Excessive stimulation of the exocrine pancreas was long thought to worsen AP. This belief led to the rationale for using inhibitors of exocrine pancreatic secretion, such as somatostatin and its analogs, as potential therapies for AP. Similarly, antisecretory agents might inhibit pancreatic secretion through the inhibition of acid secretion and secretin release due to duodenal acidification.

Despite omeprazole being unable to inhibit amylase release from isolated pancreatic acini, pantoprazole appears capable of reducing tissue infiltration of inflammatory cells and acinar cell necrosis in rats with experimentally-induced pancreatitis. This action is likely mediated by a reduced expression of inflammatory and adhesive proteins, which are key mediators in the pathogenesis of AP.

The only clinical trial at the time found that treatment with pantoprazole does not affect the clinical course of AP, such as the length of hospitalization, time to starting oral intake, or pain relief. Additionally, two retrospective studies found that PPI use does not affect clinical outcomes in patients with severe AP or prevent post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis. Consequently, most international guidelines on the management of AP do not mention PPIs. The only exception is the Italian guideline, which clearly states that routine use of PPIs is not recommended in patients with acute AP.

### Proton pump inhibitor-responsive oesophageal eosinophilia and eosinophilic oesophagitis: more similarities than differences [^111TR3oq]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to discuss the clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features, pathogenesis, and disease mechanisms of proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-responsive oesophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE), highlighting similarities and differences with eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE).

PPI-REE is a condition in which patients have clinical and histologic findings similar to EoE but achieve complete remission with PPI treatment. More than one-third of patients who have oesophageal symptoms associated with oesophageal eosinophilia respond to PPI treatment. Emerging data elucidating the pathogenesis of PPI-REE have shown that Th2-related inflammatory factors, such as interleukin (IL)-13, IL-5, eotaxin-3, and major basic protein (MBP), are elevated in PPI-REE, similar to EoE. PPI-REE also shares a genetic expression signature with EoE that reverses with PPI treatment. Mechanisms proposed to explain the PPI response include an acid-independent, anti-inflammatory action of PPIs and PPI-induced restoration of oesophageal barrier function.

Multiple features of PPI-REE overlap extensively with EoE. This raises the question of whether PPI-REE is merely a subtype of EoE rather than an independent condition. This similarity may have future implications for algorithms informing the evaluation and treatment of oesophageal eosinophilia.

### Cirrhotic patients on proton pump inhibitors are at a twofold risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis independently of gastrointestinal bleeding: a population-based retrospective study [^113qugjm]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The results of this study identified apparent clinical and demographic factors independently associated with the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients. In particular, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use was associated with a significantly higher risk of progression to SBP. To our knowledge, this is the largest multicenter cohort ever to examine the association between PPI use and the development of SBP throughout the United States and worldwide. The results of this study are generalizable and can be incorporated into future management guidelines for SBP patients.

Infection is a leading cause of mortality among cirrhotic patients, increasing it fourfold. According to a recent study by Arvaniti et al, the occurrence of infection, even after its resolution, is indicative of the subsequent prognosis stage and must therefore be considered when classifying cirrhosis. SBP is the most frequently encountered infection in cirrhotic patients and is always associated with a poor prognosis.

In terms of prevalence, the number varies with time and with the population in question. However, the numbers have plateaued within a range hovering around 10–30% for the past two decades, with the most recent systematic review pointing to a pooled prevalence of 17.12%. The prevalence in our population-based study fits within this range (18.36%), further validating the generalizability of the results. The first episode of SBP has a survival rate of 40%, with a recurrence rate reaching 70%, accounting for 4% of emergency department visits in the cirrhotic population. Acute kidney injury has been reported in about…

### Ppi use in the OTC era: who to treat, with what, and for how long [^113NY6YW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been shown to be the most effective class of medication to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The availability of over-the-counter (OTC) and generic PPIs provides consumers with options other than antacids and histamine 2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) for self-medication of heartburn and acid regurgitation. Medical concerns arising from these developments include management of patients in whom symptoms persist despite OTC PPI use, proper administration of PPIs, and potential masking of more serious pathology, such as malignancy. Studies indicate that different forms of PPI administration, such as on-demand and intermittent therapy, are likely to become more acceptable. Prospective clinical trials show the efficacy of these noncontinuous PPI administration strategies and the potential for cost reduction in GERD management. Newer agents, such as reversible acid pump antagonists, will compete for selected markets in the future, further expanding the role of alternative dosing regimens. Ultimately, therapy should be tailored to individual patients because no single strategy will be optimal for the entire population with GERD symptoms.

### Increased rate of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis among cirrhotic patients receiving pharmacologic acid suppression [^1123weig]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis frequently receive proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2-receptor antagonist therapies. We investigated whether acid-suppressive therapy is associated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients with ascites.
- **Aims**: We aimed to assess the correlation between acid-suppressive therapy and the incidence of SBP in these patients.
- **Methods**: Data from 65 hospitalized cirrhotic patients with paracentesis-proven SBP, collected between 2006 and 2009, were compared with data from 65 contemporaneous, hospitalized cirrhotic patients without SBP (controls). PPI use was evaluated, and the effects of covariates were analyzed.
- **Results**: Patients with SBP had a significantly higher incidence of recent (past 7 days) PPI use (71%) compared to controls (42%). Of the patients with SBP, 68% had no documented indication for PPI therapy. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that subjects who had not taken PPIs in the past 90 days were almost 70% less likely to develop SBP than those who had taken PPIs in the previous 7 days. Subjects who took PPIs within 8 to 90 days before hospitalization were 79% less likely to develop SBP than those who took PPIs within 7 days before hospitalization. There was no significant difference between patients who had no PPI therapy in the previous 90 days and those who had taken PPIs in the previous 8 to 90 days (P = .58). Hyponatremia was significantly associated with SBP. There were no significant differences in length of hospital stay or 30-day survival between the SBP and control groups.
- **Conclusions**: Pharmacologic acid suppression is associated with SBP in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Prospective studies are needed to deter further correlations and causations.

### The evidence base of proton pump inhibitor chemopreventative agents in Barrett's esophagus — the good, the bad, and the flawed [^112Rb8QK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Gastric acid is believed to be an important etiological factor in the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus. Pulsatile acid exposure increases cell proliferation in ex vivo Barrett's tissue, and normalization of esophageal pH reverses this. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the mainstay of therapy in Barrett's esophagus and have numerous beneficial effects, including symptom control, reduction of inflammation, and promotion of the development of squamous islands.

However, PPI therapy causes hypergastrinemia and has not prevented the recent increase in the incidences of esophageal cancer. Additionally, evidence presented by Feagins et al. suggests that acid exposure has a p53-mediated, antiproliferative effect on a nondysplastic Barrett's epithelial cell line, an effect that acid suppression might abrogate. These complex pH, inflammation, and growth factor biological interactions can be most reliably tested in large clinical trials with hard endpoints like cancer conversion or all causes of mortality.

Combining the anti-inflammatory effects of acid suppression with aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, is the subject of the AspECT clinical trial, and this may be the future of chemoprevention in Barrett's.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^112Vj7Py]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

In patients who survive an episode of SBP, the cumulative recurrence rate at 1 year is approximately 70%. Probability of survival at 1 year after an episode of SBP is 30–50% and falls to 25–30% at 2 years. There is only one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of norfloxacin (400 mg/day) in patients who had a previous episode of SBP; treatment reduced the probability of recurrence of SBP from 68% to 20%. A recent systematic review with meta-analysis concluded that rifaximin may be effective for both primary and secondary SBP prophylaxis compared with systemically absorbed antibiotics and compared with no intervention. However, additional prospective studies are required before a change in clinical practice can be recommended. It has been suggested that proton pump inhibitor use may increase the risk for the development of SBP, and indications for long-term use should be carefully assessed.

We therefore recommend norfloxacin 400 mg once a day as secondary prophylaxis. Although in view of limited availability in the UK, many centers use once daily ciprofloxacin 500 mg once a day as an alternative.

### Use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with a higher risk of pneumonia in cirrhotic patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111N55N5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

A total of 1947 articles (276 from MEDLINE and 1671 from EMBASE) were identified, from which 237 duplicate articles were removed, leaving 1710 articles for title and abstract review. At this stage of review, 1675 articles were excluded because they were clearly ineligible based on study design and type of article. Therefore, 35 full-length articles were thoroughly reviewed, and 27 articles were further excluded as they did not report the outcome of interest. Finally, 3 cohort and 5 cross-sectional studies with a total of 40,295 participants met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Two of the 3 included cohort studies were published as conference abstracts. No eligible case-control study was identified.
- **Literature review and study selection process**: The reference Figure 1 summarizes this process.
- **Characteristics of included studies**:
	- Tables 1 and 2 describe the main characteristics and Newcastle-Ottawa assessment scales of the included cross-sectional and cohort studies, respectively.
- **Risk of pneumonia among cirrhotic patients exposed to PPI**: Cirrhotic patients with a history of PPI use had a significantly higher risk of developing pneumonia than those without PPI use, with a pooled relative risk (RR) of 1.36 (95% CI 1.00–1.85). The statistical heterogeneity was low, with an I² of 47%. Subgroup analysis by study design showed an increased risk in both cohort and cross-sectional studies.

### Cirrhotic patients on proton pump inhibitors are at a twofold risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis independently of gastrointestinal bleeding: a population-based retrospective study [^114xdFS9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

At the time of writing, this is the largest cohort to examine the prevalence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) among cirrhotic patients in the United States (US). Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use and hepatic encephalopathy were associated with the highest risks for developing SBP independently of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The results of this study are consistent with previous ones and may prepare the ground for future recommendations concerning judicious PPI use in cirrhotic patients.

- **Summary box**:

- **What is already known**: Decompensation of liver disease is a distinct characteristic of cirrhosis. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a widely-used class of medication, as about 50 million people in the US are on PPIs. Scattered evidence in the literature suggests a potentially higher risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients on PPIs compared to those not on PPIs.
- **What the new findings are**: The use of PPIs in the US is highly prevalent, reaching 12.00% in our cohort. In the US, the incidence of SBP in patients on PPIs is 2500 per 100,000 individuals. The use of PPIs is an independent risk factor for the development of SBP in cirrhotic patients.

### Bacterial load and cytokine profile in patients with cirrhosis following therapy with proton pump inhibitors: A prospective cohort study [^112romMf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

We conducted this prospective study considering the need to use proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in patients with cirrhosis, the conflicting data in the literature, and the fact that only a few studies have examined the potential association between PPIs and a broad range of bacterial infections, with controversial results. We found that the "appropriate" use of PPIs had no effect on serum bacterial DNA and other bacterial products, or on the cytokine profile of patients with cirrhosis.

In cirrhosis, the increased susceptibility to bacterial infections is related to a deficiency of bactericidal and opsonic activity, impaired monocyte function, depressed phagocytic activity of the reticuloendothelial system, defective chemotaxis, and low levels of complement in serum. The clearance of translocated bacteria by the liver is inadequate because of the impaired reticuloendothelial cell phagocytosis and the increased collateral blood flow. Urinary tract infections, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), respiratory tract infections, and bacteremia are the most frequent bacterial infections seen in this setting.

### Use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with a higher risk of pneumonia in cirrhotic patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115MGHhF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly prescribed for cirrhotic patients. However, the use of PPIs in these patients may increase the risk of bacterial infection. The study aimed to investigate the risk of developing pneumonia among cirrhotic patients exposed to PPIs.
- **Methods**: A literature search was independently conducted by two investigators using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases up to September 2019. To be eligible, a study had to be an observational (cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional) study that included one group of cirrhotic patients with PPI use and another group of cirrhotic patients without PPI use. Effect estimates of the association between PPI use and pneumonia had to be reported. Point estimates and standard errors from each eligible study were combined using the generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird.
- **Results**: Of 1,947 articles identified from the two databases, three cohort and five cross-sectional studies with 40,295 participants met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis found that cirrhotic patients with a history of PPI use had a significantly higher risk of developing pneumonia than those without PPI use, with a pooled risk ratio of 1.36 (95% confidence interval 1.00–1.85; I² = 47%).
- **Conclusion**: A significantly increased risk of pneumonia among cirrhotic patients exposed to PPIs was demonstrated in this study.

### Nexium [^116wcWpW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Drug interactions section**:

- **Interference with antiretroviral therapy**: Concomitant use of atazanavir and nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Co-administration of atazanavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and the development of drug resistance. Co-administration of saquinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to increase saquinavir concentrations, which may increase toxicity and require dose reduction.

	- Omeprazole, of which esomeprazole is an enantiomer, has been reported to interact with some antiretroviral drugs. The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known. An increased gastric pH during omeprazole treatment may change the absorption of the antiretroviral drug. Other possible interaction mechanisms are via CYP2C19.
- **Reduced concentrations of atazanavir and nelfinavir**: For some antiretroviral drugs, such as atazanavir and nelfinavir, decreased serum levels have been reported when given together with omeprazole. Following multiple doses of nelfinavir (1250 mg, twice daily) and omeprazole (40 mg daily), AUC was decreased by 36% and 92%, Cmax by 37% and 89%, and Cmin by 39% and 75%, respectively, for nelfinavir and M8. Following multiple doses of atazanavir (400 mg, daily) and omeprazole (40 mg, daily, 2 hours before atazanavir), AUC was decreased by 94%, Cmax by 96%, and Cmin by 95%. Concomitant administration with omeprazole and drugs such as atazanavir and nelfinavir is therefore not recommended.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^112qWyjB]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of liver cirrhosis, specifically in the context of managing variceal hemorrhage through pharmacotherapy, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend administering antibiotic prophylaxis to patients with cirrhosis experiencing acute gastrointestinal bleeding. This approach aims to reduce the incidence of infections and improve bleeding control and overall survival. The recommended protocol is to initiate treatment upon presentation of bleeding and continue for up to seven days.
- **Ceftriaxone administration**: Administer ceftriaxone 1 g/24 hours as the first choice for patients with decompensated cirrhosis. This is particularly important for those already on quinolone prophylaxis and in hospital settings with a high prevalence of quinolone-resistant bacterial infections.
- **Oral quinolones administration**: In the remaining patients, administer oral quinolones such as norfloxacin at a dosage of 400 mg BID.

### Restoration of acid secretion following treatment with proton pump inhibitors [^1128okGu]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are covalent inhibitors of the gastric H+, K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), forming disulfide bonds. Recovery of acid secretion after PPI inhibition may be due to de novo synthesis of pump protein and/or disulfide reduction and reactivation of the inhibited pump. The half-time of recovery of acid secretion in rats following omeprazole treatment is approximately 15 hours, whereas the pump protein half-life is 54 hours. In humans, the half-life of the inhibitory effect on acid secretion is approximately 28 hours for omeprazole and approximately 46 hours for pantoprazole. Whereas all PPIs bind to cysteine 813, pantoprazole additionally binds to cysteine 822, deeper in the membrane domain of TM6. Their different durations of action may reflect different rates of pump reactivation due to differing accessibility of the disulfides to glutathione.
- **Methods**: Rats were stimulated and treated with 30 mg/kg of each PPI. Gastric ATPase was prepared, and the reversal of inhibition of the H+, K+-ATPase was measured as the time-dependent restoration of activity by incubation with dithiothreitol or glutathione.
- **Results**: One hundred percent reactivation of ATPase following inhibition in vivo by omeprazole or its enantiomers was seen with dithiothreitol, and 89% with glutathione. Similar data were found for lansoprazole or rabeprazole. No reactivation by either reducing agent was seen following inhibition by pantoprazole.
- **Conclusions**: Recovery of acid secretion following inhibition by all PPIs, other than pantoprazole, may depend on both protein turnover.

### Gastric acid suppression promotes alcoholic liver disease by inducing overgrowth of intestinal Enterococcus [^117CfCPz]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

The number of people with chronic liver disease is increasing rapidly in Western countries. Liver cirrhosis, as an end-stage organ disease, is now the 12th leading cause of death worldwide. This increase is partly due to the growing prevalence of obesity, which is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH). Approximately 50% of all cirrhosis-associated deaths are related to alcohol.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which reduce gastric acid secretion, are among the most commonly prescribed medications globally. There has been substantial growth in total PPI use, with approximately 6–15% of the general population receiving acid suppression therapy, 32% of patients with NAFLD, and 67–72% of patients with cirrhosis taking acid-reducing medications. Gastric acid kills ingested microbes, and suppression of gastric acid secretion can change the composition of the intestinal microbiota.

We investigated the effects of gastric acid suppression on the progression of chronic liver disease. Here, we report that gastric acid suppression induces overgrowth of intestinal Enterococcus and its translocation to the liver. In the liver, hepatic macrophages and Kupffer cells recognize Enterococcus and induce interleukin-1 beta (IL1B) secretion, contributing to ethanol-induced liver inflammation and hepatocyte damage. We provide evidence from mice and humans that gastric acid suppression promotes liver injury and the progression of chronic liver disease.

### Clopidogrel with proton pump inhibitors: Safe or not [^111ZUvuE]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious complication associated with the use of antiplatelet therapy, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are known to be beneficial in decreasing such risk. Several studies in the recent past have suggested concerns regarding the interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs, presumably due to the inhibition of clopidogrel activity and thus attenuation of its antiplatelet effect. A web-based literature and guidelines search was conducted using the keywords "clopidogrel", "omeprazole", "proton pump inhibitors", and "interaction". Of the available results, relevant studies (n = 11) were systematically reviewed and summarized.

The studies were categorized based on their retrospective or prospective nature. Most of the retrospective, observational studies suggested a link between the two; however, recent prospective studies have shown no interaction, and a positive influence of PPIs in preventing the GI side effects of antiplatelet therapy. There is currently insufficient clinical evidence to suggest an interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs. The decision to add PPI therapy to clopidogrel should be guided by its clinical indications rather than as a routine prophylactic measure.

### Bacterial load and cytokine profile in patients with cirrhosis following therapy with proton pump inhibitors: A prospective cohort study [^1147gfTD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis was diagnosed based on histological findings, clinical evaluation, laboratory data, or imaging findings compatible with a diagnosis of cirrhosis. The severity of liver disease was assessed using the Child-Pugh classification and the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) at baseline. In addition, routine clinical, biochemical, and radiological analyses, including abdominal ultrasound and/or computed tomography, were performed. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were abstinent for at least three months before their inclusion in this study. After the baseline examination, patients were followed in the hepatology clinic at regular intervals according to guidelines.

The presence of bacterial DNA in serum and the levels of endotoxin, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukins (IL) -1β, -6, -8, -10, and -12p70, lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), and nitric oxide (NOx) were assessed at baseline (time 1) and at the end (time 2) of treatment with PPIs.

### Patterns of proton pump inhibitor use in clinical practice [^114Mmx4m]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Little is known about differences between gastroenterologists and primary care physicians in their patterns of prescribing proton pump inhibitors.
- **Subjects and methods**: A survey of practicing primary care physicians from the American Board of Medical Specialties and practicing gastroenterologists from the American Gastroenterological Association was conducted by facsimile. The survey instrument consisted of 13 questions about pharmacokinetics and the administration of proton pump inhibitors.
- **Results**: The overall response rate was 15% (491 of 3273), and 80% (395 of 491) of respondents were nontrainee gastroenterologists or primary care physicians. Approximately 90% (n = 355) of eligible respondents correctly identified proton pump inhibitors as inhibitors of H+, K+-adenosinetriphosphatase. Proton pump inhibitors were prescribed by 80% (n = 314) of each group for reflux esophagitis. They were prescribed by 67% (122 of 182) of gastroenterologists and 27% (58 of 213) of primary care physicians to prevent ulcers induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (P < 0.001). They were prescribed by 40% (n = 73) of gastroenterologists and 16% (n = 34) of primary care physicians for uncomplicated heartburn (P < 0.001). Proton pump inhibitors were prescribed before a meal by 95% (n = 173) of gastroenterologists and 33% (n = 70) of primary care physicians (P < 0.001). Nearly 99% (n = 391) of respondents agreed that proton pump inhibitors were safe, but only 15% (n = 59) thought they should be available without prescription.

- **Conclusion**: Our survey suggests that the use of proton pump inhibitors greatly varies between gastroenterologists and primary care physicians.

### Use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with a higher risk of pneumonia in cirrhotic patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1145sj6i]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly prescribed for cirrhotic patients. However, the use of PPIs in these patients may increase the risk of bacterial infection. The study aimed to investigate the risk of developing pneumonia among cirrhotic patients exposed to PPIs.
- **Methods**: A literature search was independently conducted by two investigators using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases up to September 2019. To be eligible, a study had to be an observational (cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional) study that included one group of cirrhotic patients with PPI use and another group of cirrhotic patients without PPI use. Effect estimates of the association between PPI use and pneumonia had to be reported. Point estimates and standard errors from each eligible study were combined using the generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird.
- **Results**: Of 1,947 articles identified from the two databases, three cohort and five cross-sectional studies with 40,295 participants met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis found that cirrhotic patients with a history of PPI use had a significantly higher risk of developing pneumonia than those without PPI use, with a pooled risk ratio of 1.36 (95% confidence interval 1.00–1.85; I² = 47%).
- **Conclusion**: A significantly increased risk of pneumonia among cirrhotic patients exposed to PPIs was demonstrated in this study.

### Inappropriate use of proton pump inhibitors in patients with liver cirrhosis: A cross-sectional study [^113y2sdi]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed for acid-related disorders; however, concerns have emerged regarding their misuse, particularly in patients with liver cirrhosis. This study aimed to assess the appropriateness of PPI prescriptions in patients with cirrhosis and to identify factors contributing to their overutilization in this patient population.
- **Methods**: In this cross-sectional study, 1000 patients with cirrhosis receiving PPIs were enrolled. Data on demographics, clinical parameters, and endoscopic findings were collected, and indications for PPI therapy were assessed according to established guidelines.
- **Results**: Among patients with cirrhosis, 60.5% were prescribed PPIs, with pantoprazole being the most prescribed (55.7%). Inappropriate PPI use was observed in 53.6% of the patients, mainly because of lacking an approved indication (78.54%) or exceeding the recommended treatment duration (21.46%).

	- Causes contributing to misuse included:
		- Prolonged PPI use postendoscopic band ligation (29.1%)
		- Extended treatment for functional dyspepsia (21.46%)
		- Failure to discontinue PPIs upon hospital discharge (17.54%)
		- Using PPIs for preventing portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) or variceal bleeding (16.42%)
		- Stress ulcer prophylaxis in non-ICU patients (15.86%)

	- Multivariate analysis identified independent predictors of inappropriate PPI use, including Child classification C, Mayo End-Stage Liver Disease score greater than 18, hepatocellular carcinoma, and previous variceal bleeding, whereas hematemesis was identified as an independent predictor.

### Use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with a higher risk of pneumonia in cirrhotic patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1118LNmo]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

We utilized Review Manager 5.3 software from the Cochrane Collaboration (London, United Kingdom) to analyze all data. Point estimates and standard errors from each study were pooled using the generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird, assigning the study's weight inversely to its variance. A random-effect model was used, as the assumption of the fixed-effect model that every study should yield the same result is rarely justified, especially in a meta-analysis of observational studies.

Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by Cochran's Q test, complemented by the I² statistic. This I² statistic quantifies the proportion of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance. A value of I² of 0–25% represents insignificant heterogeneity, 26–50% represents low heterogeneity, 51–75% represents moderate heterogeneity, and 76% or higher represents high heterogeneity. The presence of publication bias was assessed by visualization of a funnel plot along with Egger's regression test. Egger's regression test was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-analysis 3.0 software (Englewood, New Jersey, United States).

### Long-term use of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors predict development of infections in patients with cirrhosis [^1114qudE]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Bacterial infections, particularly repeated infections, are significant causes of morbidity and mortality among patients with cirrhosis. This study investigated and characterized risk factors for repeat infections in these patients.

In a prospective study, data were collected from 188 patients hospitalized with cirrhosis and infections, enrolled in the North American Consortium for the Study of End-Stage Liver Disease across 12 centers. Patients were followed for 6 months after hospital discharge, and data on the type of infections and factors associated with subsequent infections were analyzed.

Six months after hospital discharge, 14% of subjects had received liver transplants, 27% died, and 59% were alive without liver transplantation. After discharge, 45% had subsequent infections; however, only 26% of these occurred at the same site. Compared with patients who were not re-infected, patients with repeat infections were older, and a higher proportion used proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (P = .006), rifaximin (P < .001), or prophylactic therapy for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) (P < .001). Logistic regression indicated that SBP prophylaxis (odds ratio [OR], 3.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.56–7.63), PPI use (OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.39–6.20), SBP at hospital admission (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15–0.91), and age (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02–1.11) were independent predictors of subsequent infections.

In conclusion, patients hospitalized with cirrhosis and infections are at high risk for subsequent infections, mostly occurring at different sites, within 6 months.

### Bacterial load and cytokine profile in patients with cirrhosis following therapy with proton pump inhibitors: a prospective cohort study [^111BTgnK]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with liver cirrhosis rarely show normal endoscopic findings on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. In everyday clinical practice, there are several reasons for clinicians to consider administering PPIs to patients with liver cirrhosis. These reasons include abdominal discomfort related to ascites, dyspeptic symptoms associated with impaired small bowel motility, esophageal motor disorders, and the mistaken belief that gastroesophageal reflux contributes to variceal bleeding. A study by Tzathas et al. suggested that H. pylori eradication does not protect all cirrhotic patients from ulcer recurrence. The majority of ulcers recur in H. pylori-negative patients; therefore, omeprazole maintenance treatment is mandatory regardless of H. pylori status. Additionally, there is data supporting the use of acid suppression therapy in treating post-banding ulcers.

The overuse of PPIs in this setting is well documented. In the study by Bajaj et al, 47% of patients receiving PPIs had no documented indication. In two other recent studies, PPI use was inappropriate in 63% and 39.6% of cirrhotic patients. In another prospective evaluation of intravenous PPI use, 56% of patients had no acceptable indication for their use. Goel et al. found no documented indication for PPI use in two-thirds of the patients. Lastly, in another cohort of cirrhotic patients, PPIs were the most frequently prescribed drugs (67%), often without a clear indication (59%). In the same cohort, the use of β-blockers by cirrhotic patients had beneficial effects, reducing the prevalence.

### Protonix delayed-release [^116undG2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets were used in the following clinical trials related to adult patients.

A US multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated PROTONIX doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg administered once daily to 603 patients with reflux symptoms and endoscopically diagnosed erosive esophagitis (EE) of grade 2 or above according to the Hetzel-Dent scale. In this study, approximately 25% of the enrolled patients had severe EE of grade 3, and 10% had grade 4. The percentages of patients healed (per protocol, n = 541) in this study are presented in Table 8.

The study found that every PROTONIX treatment group experienced significantly higher healing rates compared to the placebo group, irrespective of H. pylori status, for the 40 mg and 20 mg treatment groups. The 40 mg dose of PROTONIX demonstrated healing rates significantly greater than those of either the 20 mg or 10 mg doses.

A significantly greater proportion of patients taking PROTONIX 40 mg experienced complete relief from both daytime and nighttime heartburn and the absence of regurgitation, starting from the first day of treatment, when compared with the placebo group. Patients undergoing PROTONIX treatment also consumed significantly fewer antacid tablets per day than those taking the placebo.

Additionally, PROTONIX doses of 40 mg and 20 mg once daily were compared with nizatidine 150 mg taken twice daily in another US multicenter, double-blind study, involving 243 patients with reflux symptoms and endoscopically diagnosed EE of grade 2 or above. The percentages of patients healed (per protocol, n = 212) are shown in Table 9.

### Prevacid SoluTab [^113vZNkv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Lansoprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, lansoprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, as it blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion regardless of the stimulus. Lansoprazole does not exhibit anticholinergic or histamine type-2 antagonist activity.
- **Antisecretory activity**: After oral administration, lansoprazole was shown to significantly decrease the basal acid output and significantly increase the mean gastric pH and the percentage of time the gastric pH was greater than three and greater than four. Lansoprazole also significantly reduced meal-stimulated gastric acid output and secretion volume, as well as pentagastrin-stimulated acid output. In patients with hypersecretion of acid, lansoprazole significantly reduced basal and pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion. Lansoprazole inhibited the normal increases in secretion volume, acidity, and acid output induced by insulin.

The intragastric pH results of a five-day, pharmacodynamic, crossover study of 15 and 30 mg of once-daily lansoprazole show that after the initial dose, increased gastric pH was seen within one to two hours with 30 mg of lansoprazole.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, particularly concerning the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), the AASLD/ACG 2007 guidelines recommend considering ceftriaxone (1 g IV once daily) over fluoroquinolones for patients with advanced cirrhosis. This is especially pertinent in centers with a high prevalence of quinolone-resistant organisms.

### Editorial: Clostridium difficile infection: Yet another predictor of poor outcome in cirrhosis [^116AUPoB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

The development of Clostridium difficile infection in cirrhosis is predictive of death, independent of the severity of liver disease. The main risk factors are the use of antibiotics and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). This is further evidence that supports the wise and cautious use of antibiotics in cirrhosis and suggests avoiding the use of PPIs in these patients except for indications of proven benefit.

### Nexium [^111Jx6ma]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology section**:

	- **Mechanism of action**: Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. The S- and R-isomers of omeprazole are protonated and converted in the acidic compartment of the parietal cell, forming the active inhibitor, the achiral sulphenamide. By acting specifically on the proton pump, esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity. This effect is dose-related up to a daily dose of 20 to 40 mg and leads to inhibition of gastric acid secretion.

	- **Pharmacodynamics**:

		- **Antisecretory activity**: The effect of Nexium on intragastric pH was determined in patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease in two separate studies. In the first study of 36 patients, Nexium 40 mg and 20 mg capsules were administered over 5 days. The results are shown in Table 3.

		In a second study, the effect on intragastric pH of Nexium 40 mg administered once daily over a five-day period was similar to the first study (% time with pH > 4 was 68%, or 16.3 hours).

		- **Serum gastrin effects**: The effect of Nexium on serum gastrin concentrations was evaluated in approximately 2,700 patients in clinical trials up to 8 weeks and in over 1,300 patients for up to 6 to 12 months. The mean fasting gastrin level increased in a dose-related manner. This increase reached a plateau within two to three months of therapy and returned to baseline levels within four weeks after discontinuation of therapy.

### Inadequate use of proton-pump inhibitors in patients with liver cirrhosis [^11365gxo]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with liver cirrhosis have a high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms, and the use of antiacid therapy (AAT) in these patients is unexplored. We aimed to assess the use of AAT in cirrhotic patients. A total of 128 consecutive cirrhotic patients were evaluated for the use of and indications for acid-suppressive agents. Upper endoscopy findings and concomitant medications were recorded. A validated questionnaire was used to measure the gastrointestinal symptom burden. Adequate indications for AAT were those strongly supported by medical literature.

Forty percent (n = 51) of patients with cirrhosis were on AAT. Among these, 37% (n = 19) had adequate indications, and 63% (n = 32) had inadequate indications for AAT. The major inadequate indication was previous variceal bleeding (34%). Patients with inadequate indications for AAT experienced increased severity of symptoms of indigestion compared with those without AAT (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that inadequate use of AAT was independently related only to previous variceal bleeding and the number of concomitant medications.

Acid-suppressive therapy is used by a large proportion of patients with cirrhosis. In the majority, therapy is based on inadequate indications, mainly continuous long-term therapy after previous variceal bleeding. Patients with an inadequate indication for acid-suppressive medications have increased severity of symptoms of indigestion, indicating that gastrointestinal symptoms might contribute to proton-pump inhibitor consumption in these patients.

### Deleterious effect of proton pump inhibitors on the disease course of cirrhosis [^116wAGyo]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed to patients with liver cirrhosis. It was hypothesized that long-standing PPI use is associated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and accelerated development of disease-specific complications and liver-related death.
- **Methods**: A 5-year follow-up observational cohort study assessed the impact of long-standing PPI use on the clinical course of cirrhosis in a large referral patient cohort. Three hundred fifty patients with cirrhosis (alcohol: 69.1%, Child-Pugh stage A/B/C: 206/108/36) were assigned to two groups: regular PPI users (n = 196) and non-users (n = 154). Occurrence of SBP, decompensation events (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal bleeding), and liver-related death were assessed.
- **Results**: Regular PPI use was associated with an increased cumulative probability of SBP compared to non-users [55% vs. 24.8%, hazard ratio (HR): 4.25; P = 0.05], in patients without a previous SBP episode (n = 84). A similar association was found between regular PPI use and decompensation events. The risk of the development of a first decompensation was higher in regular PPI users compared with non-users, in patients with compensated clinical stage at enrollment (HR: 2.81, P = 0.008, n = 146). The risk of liver-related death was also significantly increased among regular PPI users (P < 0.001). In multivariate Cox-regression analysis, regular PPI use (HR: 2.81, P = 0.003) and MELD score (HR: 1.21, P < 0.001) was an independent predictor of mortality.

In the present follow-up cohort study, long-term PPI use was associated with negative outcomes in patients with cirrhosis.

### Effect of Helicobacter pylori eradication and antisecretory maintenance therapy on peptic ulcer recurrence in cirrhotic patients: a prospective, cohort 2-year follow-up study [^113ZWmPh]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The role of Helicobacter pylori eradication in curing peptic ulcer disease in patients with cirrhosis remains unclear.

- **Aim**: To investigate the course of peptic ulcer disease in cirrhotic patients, first after healing with either H. pylori eradication or omeprazole therapy, and second while on omeprazole maintenance therapy after recurrence.

- **Methods**: This study was a prospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary-care hospital in Greece. Out of 365 consecutive cirrhotic patients who underwent endoscopy, 67 had peptic ulcers, and 30 were enrolled. H. pylori positive patients received eradication therapy, while H. pylori negative patients received omeprazole treatment. Follow-up endoscopies were performed at 12 and 24 months or when symptoms recurred. Patients with ulcer recurrence were treated with omeprazole maintenance therapy. The main outcome measurement was the peptic ulcer relapse rate during follow-up.

- **Results**: Twenty-eight patients with healed ulcers were followed for up to 2 years. During follow-up, ulcers relapsed in 17 patients (8/18 H. pylori positive and 9/10 H. pylori negative at study entry, P = 0.041), including 2 patients who died from ulcer bleeding. No further ulcer relapse was observed in the remaining 15 patients who received omeprazole maintenance therapy for the rest of the follow-up. H. pylori negative status (P = 0.002) and severity of cirrhosis (P = 0.015) at study entry were independently related to a shorter peptic ulcer relapse-free time.

- **Conclusions**: H. pylori eradication does not protect all cirrhotic patients from ulcer recurrence, and the majority of ulcers recur in H. pylori negative individuals.
