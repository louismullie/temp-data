## Question

Treat elbow bursitis with ckd

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat elbow (olecranon) bursitis in a patient with chronic kidney disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing septic from nonseptic bursitis because that drives everything. Then, I should verify how CKD alters the safety of anti-inflammatory options, especially NSAIDs. Next, I will consider evidence-based treatments for nonseptic bursitis, including whether aspiration or corticosteroid injection helps. After that, I need to check management of septic bursitis, including when aspiration is necessary and whether empiric antibiotics without aspiration can be safe in select patients. Finally, I will integrate CKD-specific modifications and outline a practical algorithm with follow-up and red flags, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic fork in the road: septic versus nonseptic olecranon bursitis, because treatment diverges sharply. I should look for fever, erythema, warmth, marked tenderness, fluctuance, and systemic features; if infection is suspected, bursal aspiration with Gram stain, cell count, glucose, crystals, and culture is recommended to guide therapy and exclude septic arthritis, even though some recent emergency department data suggest empiric antibiotics without aspiration may be reasonable in carefully selected, reliable patients with close follow-up [^112EJvpa] [^111B9w6a] [^113sGu7w].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about NSAIDs in CKD. I need to check guideline positions. KDIGO advises that for acute gout flares in CKD, low-dose colchicine or glucocorticoids are preferable to NSAIDs because NSAIDs can worsen renal function and increase cardiovascular risk; this principle of avoiding NSAIDs in CKD is echoed by VA/DoD osteoarthritis guidance recommending avoidance of NSAIDs in patients with CKD, especially severe CKD, so I should extend that caution to bursitis care in CKD even though the bursa is not a joint [^1173P22p] [^115S2gLD] [^1163C3kU].

> Next, I should review nonseptic olecranon bursitis management and verify whether aspiration or steroids improve outcomes. Conservative therapy with activity modification, ice, compression, and elevation is foundational; a randomized trial found no significant difference in resolution by 4 weeks among compression plus NSAIDs, aspiration alone, or aspiration plus steroid, though aspiration with steroid achieved the fastest symptom resolution, suggesting that if used, steroids may shorten symptoms but do not clearly improve overall resolution rates; importantly, aspiration carries a risk of iatrogenic infection, so I should be cautious and reserve it for diagnostic needs or refractory cases rather than routine use [^116LWq3d] [^116mKaCA] [^112EJvpa].

> Wait, let me verify the role of corticosteroid injection specifically in nonseptic bursitis. Multisociety pain guidelines give a Grade B recommendation that aspiration followed by corticosteroid injection may be offered for nonseptic olecranon bursitis, acknowledging low certainty and potential earlier symptom improvement; given CKD, I should favor local steroid strategies over systemic NSAIDs when anti-inflammatory therapy is needed, while still counseling on risks such as skin atrophy, infection, and delayed healing [^114ZfAdJ].

> I will now examine septic bursitis management. If infection is suspected or confirmed, I should confirm that antibiotics active against Staphylococcus aureus are indicated; historically, many clinicians aspirate to guide therapy, but recent ED data suggest that in carefully selected, immunocompetent patients with reliable follow-up, empiric oral antibiotics without aspiration can lead to high rates of uncomplicated resolution, though I need to ensure close follow-up and a low threshold to aspirate if there is no improvement or if the patient is high risk; surgery is reserved for refractory cases or those not responding to antibiotics [^111B9w6a] [^113sGu7w] [^112EJvpa].

> But wait, what if the bursitis is driven by crystal disease rather than trauma or infection. I should double-check for gout or CPPD when the history or fluid analysis suggests crystals, because management of the underlying crystal disease changes the plan; in CKD, for acute gouty flares, KDIGO and ACR recommend low-dose colchicine or glucocorticoids rather than NSAIDs, and for chronic gout with CKD, allopurinol is first-line with low starting doses and careful titration to a serum urate target, which can reduce recurrent bursal inflammation if urate-driven [^1173P22p] [^115sedX8] [^111ukgVR].

> Let me synthesize a CKD-aware algorithm and make sure it aligns with evidence. For nonseptic olecranon bursitis in CKD, prioritize conservative measures and avoid NSAIDs; consider acetaminophen for analgesia; if symptoms persist beyond a few weeks and function remains impaired, discuss aspiration with or without corticosteroid injection, balancing modest benefit against infection risk; if crystals are found, treat the crystal disease per gout/CPPD protocols with CKD-appropriate agents. For septic bursitis, obtain aspiration when feasible to confirm diagnosis and guide therapy; if aspiration is deferred, start empiric antistaphylococcal antibiotics with close follow-up and reassess within 48–72 hours, escalating to IV therapy or surgical drainage if there is no improvement or deterioration [^116LWq3d] [^114ZfAdJ] [^112EJvpa] [^111B9w6a].

> I should confirm dosing and safety nuances in CKD. Colchicine for flares should be used at low dose with dose adjustments in advanced CKD, and systemic glucocorticoids can be used short course for flares when colchicine is contraindicated or ineffective; for urate-lowering therapy, start allopurinol low, for example 100 mg daily or lower in eGFR below 60 mL/min, and titrate to serum urate less than 6 mg/dL with monitoring for hypersensitivity and renal function, recognizing that dose escalation above 300 mg/day can be done safely in many patients with CKD under supervision [^1173P22p] [^115sedX8] [^113BoToL].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up and red flags. Re-evaluation at 1–2 weeks to ensure improvement is prudent; persistent swelling, increasing pain, erythema, fever, or systemic symptoms should prompt reassessment for missed infection or alternative diagnoses such as rheumatoid nodules or tophaceous gout, and imaging with ultrasound can help distinguish bursal effusions from cellulitis or deeper infection when the diagnosis is uncertain [^112EJvpa].

> In summary, I need to ensure the plan remains septic versus nonseptic driven, NSAID-avoidant in CKD, and procedurally judicious. Nonseptic cases should lean conservative with selective use of aspiration with or without steroid only after shared decision-making, whereas septic cases generally warrant diagnostic aspiration when feasible and timely antibiotics, with emerging evidence that carefully selected patients may do well with empiric oral therapy and close follow-up; throughout, address crystal disease when present and tailor all choices to CKD-specific safety constraints [^116LWq3d] [^114ZfAdJ] [^111B9w6a] [^1173P22p].

Elbow bursitis in CKD should be managed with **conservative measures first** (rest, ice, elevation, activity modification, and padded elbow protection) [^116mKaCA] and **NSAIDs avoided** due to renal risk [^1173P22p]; use acetaminophen for pain control. If inflammation persists, **intra-bursal corticosteroid injection** is reasonable [^114ZfAdJ] with caution, and aspiration is reserved for diagnostic purposes or large, symptomatic effusions. For septic bursitis, **obtain aspiration** for Gram stain, culture, and cell count, then start antibiotics targeting Staphylococcus aureus [^112EJvpa]; avoid nephrotoxic agents and adjust dosing for renal function. Monitor for complications such as chronic bursitis or infection, and escalate to surgical evaluation if refractory or complicated [^1116PzVn].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

- **Clinical assessment**: Evaluate for erythema, warmth, swelling, tenderness, and fluctuance; assess for systemic symptoms (fever, malaise) and recent trauma or repetitive pressure [^112EJvpa].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound can differentiate bursitis from cellulitis or abscess and guide aspiration [^112EJvpa].

- **Aspiration**: Indicated if infection is suspected or to differentiate septic from aseptic bursitis; analyze fluid for Gram stain, culture, cell count, and crystals [^112EJvpa].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is **first-line** for aseptic olecranon bursitis in CKD:

- **Rest and activity modification**: Avoid repetitive pressure or trauma to the elbow; use padded elbow protection [^1116PzVn].

- **Ice and elevation**: Apply ice and elevate the elbow to reduce swelling and inflammation [^116mKaCA].

- **Analgesia**: Acetaminophen is preferred for pain control; avoid NSAIDs due to renal risk [^1173P22p].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

### Corticosteroid injections

Intra-bursal corticosteroid injection can reduce inflammation and accelerate symptom resolution in persistent cases [^114ZfAdJ]; however, use caution in CKD because of potential systemic effects and infection risk. Aspiration with corticosteroid injection may be considered for refractory non-septic bursitis, balancing benefits and risks [^114ZfAdJ].

---

### Antibiotics

Antibiotics are indicated only for **septic bursitis** [^112EJvpa]. Start empiric therapy targeting Staphylococcus aureus, then tailor to culture results; avoid nephrotoxic agents (e.g. aminoglycosides) and adjust dosing for renal function.

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is reserved for **refractory or complicated cases**. Bursectomy is indicated for chronic, recurrent bursitis or failure of conservative therapy [^1116PzVn], and incision and drainage are used for septic bursitis unresponsive to antibiotics or with abscess formation [^112EJvpa].

---

## Special considerations in CKD

- **Medication dosing**: Adjust all medications for renal function to avoid toxicity [^notfound].

- **Infection risk**: CKD patients have higher infection risk; maintain vigilance for septic bursitis [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess renal function, electrolytes, and response to therapy [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

Complications include **chronic bursitis** with persistent swelling and functional impairment, as well as **septic arthritis** from progression of untreated septic bursitis. Recurrence is common without activity modification and protective measures [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Arrange regular follow-up to track symptom resolution, renal function, and medication tolerance, and provide patient education on activity modification, protective measures, and signs of infection or recurrence [^notfound].

---

Elbow bursitis in CKD is best managed with **conservative measures**, avoidance of NSAIDs, and selective use of corticosteroid injections; antibiotics are reserved for septic cases, and surgery for refractory or complicated disease. Close monitoring and patient education are essential to prevent recurrence and complications.

### Tophaceous gout [^1112f1Ph]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

An 82‐year‐old male with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, chronic kidney disease, and gout presented with volume overload. Examination of his right elbow revealed a large, firm, painless, multilobulated nodule that did not transilluminate (Figures 1 and 2). Multiple small, firm subcutaneous nodules scattered across both extremities consistent with gouty tophi (Figure 3) were also present. He first experienced podagra 20 years prior and preferred using lime juice to treat his frequent gout flares. His tophi had slowly grown over that period. A serum uric acid level returned elevated at 11.6 mg/dL. On discharge he resumed allopurinol and colchicine with eventual improvement in his symptoms.

Figure 1
Right forearm with a large right elbow nodule.

Figure 2
Right elbow tophus.

Figure 3
Right hand with multiple small periarticular tophi.

Tophi are deposits of monosodium urate accompanied by chronic granulomatous inflammatory changes in the surrounding tissue. While often located around appendicular skeletal joints, tophi may locate in other soft tissue structures including the ears, bursae, tendons, and axial skeleton. Tophi are associated with longstanding gout and poorly controlled levels of urate. They are typically firm and painless but can begin to soften with the initiation of urate‐lowering therapy and may periodically experience acute inflammation leading to pain. Tophi are often variable in size and location may lead to misdiagnosis as nodules of rheumatoid arthritis or Heberden's nodes of osteoarthritis.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: a G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^113jcmxe]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

There is a paucity of data on the natural history of gout, which has several stages of development (Fig. 1). The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) has previously endorsed a definition of the disease state 'gout' that requires current or prior clinically evident symptoms or signs resulting from MSU crystal deposition. Gout is generally considered a chronic disease, with episodic highly symptomatic flares. Poorly controlled gout can have a substantial impact on an affected individual and the individual's family. Inadequately treated gout leads to recurrent gout flares, the formation of tophi (which contain aggregated masses of MSU crystals in joints and certain soft tissues), chronic gouty arthritis and joint erosion. Ulceration and infection associated with tophi occurs frequently, and surgical interventions for these sequelae have a high rate of complications. Substantial time off work, poor health-related quality of life and disability are common in those with poorly controlled gout –. Gout is associated with frequent hospital admissions, particularly in patients with hyperuricaemia and inadequate allopurinol use and/or dose. However, not all individuals with gout develop severe disease, and whether everyone diagnosed with gout requires long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) has been questioned.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — acute gout management in chronic kidney disease (CKD): For symptomatic treatment of acute gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oral glucocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Administration early after symptom onset is encouraged. For colchicine, the US Food and Drug Administration–approved dosing is 1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing anti-inflammatory therapy until the flare has resolved; dose adjustment should be considered for CKD G5. NSAIDs can cause toxicity in CKD and need to be used cautiously, and short courses of oral glucocorticoids such as 30 mg prednisone orally for 3–5 days could be used as an alternative.

### Naproxen (SALLUS pain relief collection with naproxen) [^113JQpFR]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

 Patients with Moderate to Severe Renal Impairment

Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) (see WARNINGS: Renal Effects).

During long-term administration, the dose of naproxen may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. A lower daily dose may suffice for long-term administration. The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and the administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily is not necessary.

In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg/day for limited periods of up to 6 months when a higher level of anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity is required. When treating such patients with naproxen 1500 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset the potential increased risk. The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily does not generally make a difference in response (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

 Juvenile Arthritis

The recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg/kg given in 2 divided doses (ie, 5 mg/kg given twice a day).

 Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea, and Acute Tendonitis and Bursitis

The recommended starting dose is 550 mg of naproxen sodium as naproxen sodium tablet followed by 550 mg every 12 hours or 275 mg every 6 to 8 hours as required. The initial total daily dose should not exceed 1375 mg of naproxen sodium. Thereafter, the total daily dose should not exceed 1100 mg of naproxen sodium. Because the sodium salt of naproxen is more rapidly absorbed, naproxen sodium tablets are recommended for the management of acute painful conditions when prompt onset of pain relief is desired. Naproxen may also be used for initial treatment of acute pain because absorption of naproxen is delayed compared to other naproxen-containing products (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, INDICATIONS AND USAGE).

 Acute Gout

The recommended starting dose is 750 mg of naproxen followed by 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has subsided. Naproxen sodium may also be used at a starting dose of 825 mg followed by 275 mg every 8 hours.

### Remembering the forgotten non-communicable diseases [^111N3yZt]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 8
Epidemiology, diagnosis and optimal management of gout.

Second is the challenge of correctly diagnosing gout. Gout manifests as intermittent monarticular acute arthritis in the early years/phase of the disease and as chronic polyarthritis with intermittent flares in the later years. Tophi and renal stones may accompany arthritis. The rates of joint fluid aspirate-proven diagnosis of gout are low. Given the common involvement of great toe and other lower extremity joints in two other common conditions, osteoarthritis and pseudogout, a presumptive diagnosis of gout based on a history of big toe pain and a borderline high or higher than normal range serum urate level is problematic (Figure 8). Documentation of additional clinical features of acute synovitis, radiographic signs of overhanging margin and punched-out erosions typical of gout, and close attention to looking for features of other differential diagnoses (osteoarthritis, pseudogout and rheumatoid arthritis), will often help in a correct diagnosis of gout. The 1977 American Rheumatism Association (ARA) preliminary criteria for classification of acute gouty arthritis are also commonly used for a clinical diagnosis of gout, but are inadequate for in-office diagnosis in about 21% of cases. Attempts should always be made to aspirate joint/bursa/tophus and confirm the diagnosis, since documentation of urate crystals in synovial fluid confirms gout as a single test and the treatment for gout is often life-long.

### Arthroscopic synovectomy for the management of shoulder arthropathy in chronic renal dialysis patients [^115b8dAP]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

We present the clinical results of 7 hemodialysis patients after arthroscopic shoulder synovectomy (1 bilateral) for night pain and decreased range of motion. There was no evidence of infection in any of the shoulders at the time of surgery. The results of histologic analysis of synovial tissue were negative for crystals in all of the patients. Tissue from 1 of 7 patients was positive for amyloid. All 7 patients had significant pain relief at a mean of 2.3 months postoperatively. At a mean of 5.5 years postoperatively, the mean L'Insalata score was 68.8 ± 12.2 points. Five of six patients rated their overall satisfaction with the procedure as good or excellent. Forward flexion and external rotation had improved by a mean of 40 degrees and 20 degrees, respectively. The mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score was 64.5 ± 13.1 points. We believe that arthroscopic synovectomy is an effective treatment for hemodialysis patients who have shoulder pain, particularly night pain that is not caused by infection and fails to respond to conservative management.

Methodological approach — implications of strength wording describe how "We recommend" versus "We suggest" apply to patients, clinicians, and policy. For "We recommend", patients: "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", clinicians: "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and policy: "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". For "We suggest", patients: "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", clinicians: "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and policy: "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined".

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^1174vhHc]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Gout is an increasingly common condition in the United States and often comorbid with hypertension, obesity, and chronic kidney disease. The benchmark for diagnosis is joint aspiration revealing uric acid crystals. Gout flares must be differentiated from septic arthritis and may be concurrently infected. The main treatment for acute and chronic gout is medical management of acute inflammation and chronic uric acid levels, but surgical treatment may be indicated in cases of damage to the surrounding soft tissue, concomitant septic arthritis, symptomatic cartilage loss, or neurologic deficits. In addition, gout does not seem to independently affect outcomes after total hip, knee, and ankle arthroplasty, but associated comorbidities should be considered. Finally, it is important for surgeons to collaborate with rheumatologists for perioperative management.

### Gout: will the "King of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured? [^115Ldos4]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in adults in the Western world. Characterized by hyperuricemia and the effects of acute and chronic inflammation in joints and bursa, gout leads to an agonizing, chronically painful arthritis. Arthritis can also be accompanied by urate nephropathy and subcutaneous urate deposits (tophi). Exciting new developments in the last decade have brought back the focus on this interesting, crystal-induced chronic inflammatory condition. New insights include the role of NALP3 inflammasome-induced inflammation in acute gout, the characterization of diagnostic signs on ultrasound and dual-energy computed tomography imaging modalities, the recognition of target serum urate less than 6 mg/day as the goal for urate-lowering therapies, and evidence-based treatment guidelines. A better understanding of disease mechanisms has enabled drug discovery – three new urate-lowering drugs have been approved in the last decade, with several more in the pipeline. We now recognize the important role that environment and genetics play in the causation of gout. A focus on the cardiac, renal, and metabolic comorbidities of gout will help translational research and discovery over the next decade.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^115sedX8]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology gout guideline — strong recommendations included initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage ≥ 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (≤ 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended, and for management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

### Spondyloarthritis: a gouty display [^116VmEy2]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Gout is a systemic, metabolic disease that typically affects the peripheral joints. We describe an unusual presentation of gout affecting the facet joints and costovertebral joints in the thoracic and lumbar spine. A 54-year old man presents to the emergency department with increasing swelling and pain at the left elbow for one week and difficulty ambulating. The imaging work-up included plain radiographs of the left elbow, left wrist, and chest with subsequent admission for possible septic arthritis. MRI of the elbow showed olecranon bursitis and an erosion of the lateral epicondyle. CT scan demonstrated lytic cloud-like lesions localized to the facet joints and costovertebral joints of the thoracic and lumbar spine as well as bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis. Possible hyperparathyroidism manifestations (including Brown tumors and medullary nephrocalcinosis) were evaluated with plains films of the hands; x-rays instead showed classic gouty arthritis. Our report reviews the disease, epidemiology, classic radiologic findings, and treatment of gout.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^111B9w6a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Patients with symptomatic olecranon bursitis commonly present to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation. Up to 50% of all olecranon bursitis cases in the ED are septic in nature. It is important to recognize and appropriately treat these cases to prevent complications including septic arthritis and sepsis.

The ED evaluation and diagnosis of septic bursitis is widely variable and often based on anecdotal evidence. Diagnostic aspiration of the olecranon bursa to assess for septic bursitis is commonly recommended and performed, despite the paucity of evidence to support this practice. Aspiration may increase the risk for complications including chronic fistula formation, infection, and need for a future bursectomy.

There are only limited studies focused on ED evaluation and management of septic bursitis. Additionally, the efficacy of conservative management of suspected septic olecranon bursitis with empiric antibiotic therapy is unknown. The objective of our study was to describe outcomes associated with empiric antibiotic therapy without bursal aspiration among ED patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis.

KDIGO methodological approach — grading overall evidence, net health benefit, and recommendation strength — notes that overall evidence grading across outcomes was complex, so evidence profiles recorded overall grades for patient-centered outcomes, surrogate outcomes, and laboratory outcomes, and the overall evidence categories were "A, B, C, and D". Net health benefit "was determined on the basis of the anticipated balance of benefits and harms across all clinically important outcomes" and is summarized as: "(i) There is net benefit from intervention when benefits outweigh harms; (ii) there is no net benefit; (iii) there are trade-offs between benefits and harm when harm does not altogether offset benefits but requires consideration in decision making; or (iv) uncertainty remains regarding net benefit". The strength of a recommendation "is graded as Level 1 or Level 2", and recommendations "can be for or against doing something".

KDIGO 2017 CKD-MBD recommendation grading — Within each recommendation, the strength of recommendation is indicated as Level 1, Level 2, or not graded, and the quality of the supporting evidence is shown as A, B, C, or D. Level 1 "We recommend" implies for patients, "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", for clinicians, "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and for policy, "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 "We suggest" implies for patients, "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", for clinicians, "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and for policy, "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". The additional category "not graded" is used "to provide guidance based on common sense or when the topic does not allow adequate application of evidence", with examples including "monitoring intervals, counseling, and referral to other clinical specialists", and such "ungraded recommendations are generally written as simple declarative statements, but are not meant to be interpreted as being stronger recommendations than Level 1 or 2 recommendations". Evidence quality definitions are A "High" with meaning "We are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect", B "Moderate" with meaning "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different", C "Low" with meaning "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect", and D "Very low" with meaning "The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often will be far from the truth".

### Clinical management of olecranon bursitis: a review [^116mKaCA]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Olecranon bursitis is a disease characterized by inflammation of the olecranon bursa, most often due to microtrauma. Although it is a common condition, there is a lack of evidence-based recommendations for the management of nonseptic olecranon bursitis. The condition is often self-limited and resolves with conservative methods such as rest, ice, compression, orthosis wear, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Older studies have shown resolution of symptoms with intrabursal corticosteroid injections and surgical bursectomy. More recent literature has demonstrated adverse effects of intrabursal injections and surgery compared with noninvasive management for initial treatment of nonseptic olecranon bursitis. In order to better tailor decision-making, it is important that hand surgeons understand the comparative efficacies of each option for management of nonseptic olecranon bursitis.

Studies not meeting criteria "could be cited in the narrative but was not considered part of the body of evidence for a particular recommendation". For data extraction, "One reviewer abstracted data directly into the modified tables, and a second reviewer confirmed the data abstraction", and the ERT abstracted "general study characteristics, participant characteristics, interventions and co-interventions, and outcome measures, including measures of variability". Quality assessment used "the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias for RCTs and using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool for observational studies". The Work Group "critically reviewed draft tables, and tables were revised as appropriate". The ERT "created evidence matrices for each of the key outcomes for each research question", listing "the individual studies, their sample size, follow-up duration, and the individual study quality", and "drafted evidence profiles to display the total number and overall quality of the studies".

Question 2: What type of calcinosis cutis does this patient have?
A. Dystrophic
B. Metastatic
C. Idiopathic
D. Iatrogenic
E. Calciphylaxis

Answers:
A. Dystrophic – Incorrect. Dystrophic calcinosis cutis occurs with normal serum calcium and phosphate levels due to local tissue damage. It is the most common subtype and is often seen in connective tissue disease, in certain inherited disorders, in cutaneous neoplasms, and as a result of trauma.
B. Metastatic – Incorrect. Metastatic calcinosis cutis occurs due to abnormal calcium or phosphate metabolism. This patient had normal calcium and phosphate test results.
C. Idiopathic – Correct. Idiopathic calcinosis cutis occurs in the absence of local tissue injury or abnormal calcium or phosphate metabolism, as was seen in this patient. This patient specifically had tumoral idiopathic calcinosis cutis, which is rare but has been reported to occur in otherwise healthy adolescents around large joints.
D. Iatrogenic – Incorrect. Iatrogenic calcinosis cutis occurs as a result of medical causes, such as extravasation of intravenous calcium gluconate therapy.
E. Calciphylaxis – Incorrect. Calciphylaxis occurs in the setting of end-stage renal disease when there is deposition of calcium in blood vessels in the dermis or subcutaneous fat, and it presents with different clinical skin findings.

Practice Point 3.14.1 — Uric acid–lowering therapy initiation after first gout in CKD: Consider initiating uric acid–lowering therapy after the first episode of gout in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly when there is no avoidable precipitant or serum uric acid concentration is > 9 mg/dl [535 μmol/l]. Uric acid–lowering therapy use was suggested to be initiated in people with CKD G3–G5, serum uric acid concentration > 9 mg/dl (> 535 μmol/l), or urolithiasis at the time of their first episode of gout. The ERT evidence review identified that uric acid–lowering therapy results in an increased risk of a gout flare during the first 3 months after initiation in people with CKD; this is an expected short-term risk of uric acid lowering that people should be counseled about when initiating such therapy. Two relatively small randomized trials have suggested that starting uric acid–lowering therapy during a gout flare does not appear to extend flare duration, and once initiated, the American College of Rheumatology suggests continuing uric acid–lowering therapy indefinitely.

KDIGO methodological approach — grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) for quality of evidence for an outcome — starts with study design categories ("High for randomized controlled trials", "Low for observational study", and "Very low for any other evidence"), then applies grade reductions and upgrades. Reductions include "Study quality −1 level if serious limitations −2 levels in very serious limitations", "Consistency −1 level if important inconsistency", "Directness −1 level if some uncertainty −2 levels if major uncertainty", and "Other −1 level if sparse or imprecise data −1 level if high probability of reporting bias". Upgrades include "Strength of association +1 level if stronga, no plausible confounders, consistent and direct evidence +2 levels if very stronga, no major threats to validity and direct evidence", and "Other +1 level if evidence of a dose-response gradient +1 level if all residual confounders would have reduced the observed effect". For interventions, "the Work Group graded only RCTs", and final grades for an intervention–outcome pair are "high", "moderate", "low", or "very low".

Consider initiating uric acid–lowering therapy for people with CKD after their first episode of gout particularly where there is no avoidable precipitant or serum uric acid concentration is > 9 mg/dl [535 μmol/l]. Prescribe xanthine oxidase inhibitors in preference to uricosuric agents in people with CKD and symptomatic hyperuricemia. For symptomatic treatment of acute gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oral glucocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Nonpharmacological interventions which may help prevent gout include limiting alcohol, meats, and high-fructose corn syrup intake. We suggest not using agents to lower serum uric acid in people with CKD and asymptomatic hyperuricemia to delay CKD progression (2D).

DISCUSSION

We studied the management of ED patients presenting with acute olecranon bursitis and found that among 266 patients included in our study only four (1.5%) underwent bursal aspiration at the time of their initial ED visit. To our knowledge, this represents the largest study of ED patients with olecranon bursitis. Among patients who did not undergo bursal aspiration in the ED and were dismissed home on oral antibiotics for suspected septic olecranon bursitis, 88% had an uncomplicated resolution, 7% were subsequently hospitalized, and 6% subsequently underwent bursal aspiration, including two patients with confirmation of septic bursitis and five patients with septic bursitis ruled out. In addition, among patients admitted for suspected septic bursitis, 89% did not undergo bursal aspiration at any point and all of these patients had an uncomplicated resolution on antibiotics. Among patients dismissed without antibiotics, only two patients (3%) required subsequent hospitalization for parenteral antibiotics for a possible, although unconfirmed, septic bursitis. None of the patients in our cohort with confirmed or suspected septic bursitis went on to develop a chronic wound or require operative management. Taken together, these findings suggest that empiric antibiotic administration for suspected septic bursitis without bursal aspiration may be an appropriate first‐line management strategy among select ED patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis who are reliable, understand return precautions, and are at low risk of antibiotic complications and treatment failure.

Drugs used for flare prophylaxis

Although the medications used for flare prophylaxis are the same as those used to treat flares, they are generally used at lower doses and for longer periods of time (months rather than days or weeks). A post hoc analysis of three phase III RCTs in people starting febuxostat who also received prophylaxis with colchicine included participants with an eGFR of < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² but again the results were not stratified by renal function. Long-term use of colchicine in the general population has been associated with bone marrow suppression and neuromyotoxicity, but whether these effects are increased in those with gout and CKD is unknown. Whereas short-term courses of glucocorticoids can be considered to have an acceptable risk–benefit profile, long-term use of glucocorticoids for flare prophylaxis can be associated with an increased risk of glucocorticoid-related adverse events, particularly infections, as seen in other rheumatic diseases. This risk could be particularly concerning in a population that is already at high risk of severe infections, such as those with CKD. Whether the gout flare rate when starting ULT is the same in those with CKD as in those without, and whether prophylaxis is always required, are unknown, although a recent study of incremental use of febuxostat suggested that prophylaxis might not be required when a dose-escalation approach is used.

Issues with studies of gout and CKD

Two important areas of concern were identified with respect to studies of gout and CKD: issues related to the natural history of gout in people with CKD and generic study-related issues.

General research areas

Several issues related to the natural history of gout in people with CKD were identified as general areas for research (summarized in Box 1). As mentioned above, data on the natural history of gout (Fig. 1) are scarce but the application of modern imaging techniques, such as dual-energy CT, has led to the recognition of a pre-symptomatic phase of gout in some individuals in whom MSU crystal deposition occurs in joints, soft tissues and vascular sites before the first gout flare (asymptomatic MSU crystal deposition). Whether this pre-symptomatic phase is more common in people with CKD in whom the inflammatory response to crystals might be suppressed remains unknown, as does the timing of progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic gout in people with CKD.

Other questions to be addressed concern prediction of the disease course and the need for ULT in those with gout and CKD. The question of whether ULT is required could be an even more important issue in individuals potentially at increased risk of adverse events associated with therapy, such as those with CKD. An increased risk of mortality in people with gout, typically from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, has been reported in association with the presence of subcutaneous tophi and high serum urate concentrations, but not with renal insufficiency. Whether urate lowering in people with gout and CKD alters mortality was not considered as part of the literature reviews and this consensus statement.

### Managing hyperuricemia and gout in chronic kidney disease: a clinical conundrum [^116p5u6x]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is controversy regarding the impact of hyperuricemia on the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and gout remains sub optimally managed in this population. We discuss the prescribing of drugs for the treatment of gout in patients with CKD.

Recent Findings

There is a lack of consensus from expert guidelines, and prescribers have concerns regarding the risk of adverse reactions from medicines used to treat gout. These situations appear to contribute to suboptimal management of gout in this cohort. Recent data have challenged the role of urate lowering therapy (ULT) in the management of asymptomatic hyperuricemia in CKD.

Summary

ULT should be commenced in all patients with severe, recurrent disease, tophaceous gout and evidence of joint damage. Most international guidelines recommend a treat-to-target approach for the management of gout. In CKD, ULT should be started at low dose with up titration adjusted to serum urate levels, rather than being based on the creatinine clearance. If patients fail first-line therapy, alternative agents are utilized, the specific agent depending on ease of access, burden of disease and other comorbidities. This approach should be incorporated into routine practice to ensure optimal treatment of gout in CKD. More research is required to investigate whether treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia has clinical benefits.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^1154jqqf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Eighty‐eight percent of ED patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis treated with empiric outpatient antibiotics without aspiration had resolution without need for subsequent bursal aspiration, hospitalization, or surgery. Eighty‐nine percent of patients admitted to the hospital for empiric antibiotic management for whom follow‐up was available did not undergo bursal aspiration in the ED or after admission and 100% of these patients had an uncomplicated resolution. Our findings suggest that empiric antibiotics without bursal aspiration is a reasonable initial approach to ED management of select patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis who have adequate access to follow‐up care, are immunocompetent, are able to tolerate oral antibiotics, and are at low risk for antibiotic complications.

### A randomized trial among compression plus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection for nonseptic olecranon bursitis [^116LWq3d]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Olecranon bursitis might be a minor problem in the outpatient clinic but relatively be common to occur. However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?

Methods

We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.

Results

There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27–1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98–4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22–1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1–4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2–4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2–4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2–9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4–6 weeks]; p = 0.008).

Conclusions

With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.

Level Of Evidence

Level II, therapeutic study.

We describe the case of a 44-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of pain and swelling over the left elbow of 1-week duration. After olecranon bursal aspiration, synovial fluid analysis yielded an increased white blood cell count (3040 cells/mm(3)) and the presence of bacteria. Culture of the fluid later grew Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was initially treated with oral antibiotics for septic bursitis and returned to the orthopedics clinic for follow-up 2 days later with interval worsening of symptoms. He was subsequently admitted for parenteral antibiotics and surgical wash-out of the affected bursa. This report briefly discusses the clinical history and appropriate diagnostic evaluation for septic olecranon bursitis, as well as the shortcomings of existing treatment guidelines.

### Major unanswered questions in the clinical gout field [^111JghgA]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although gout is one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis, it has been relatively neglected until recently. Despite progress in many areas of pathophysiology and genetics of gout and the development of new urate lowering therapies, there remain a number of unanswered clinical questions. With the resurgence of interest in gout it is important to recognize key aspects of gout management that remain challenging and require further research.

Recent Findings

The unanswered clinical issues outlined in this review are basic aspects of gout management that clinicians treating people with gout face on a daily basis and include when urate lowering therapy should be commenced, the most appropriate target serum urate, use of prophylaxis when starting urate lowering therapy and the most appropriate urate lowering therapy, particularly for those with chronic kidney disease.

Summary

Some of the issues outlined in this article are the subject of ongoing clinical research and some, such as use of allopurinol in people with chronic kidney impairment, may be less relevant with the advent of potentially safer urate lowering therapies but until that time further understanding to aid clinical decision-making is required.

### Four common types of bursitis: diagnosis and management [^114WQg7M]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Bursitis is a common cause of musculoskeletal pain and often prompts orthopaedic consultation. Bursitis must be distinguished from arthritis, fracture, tendinitis, and nerve pathology. Common types of bursitis include prepatellar, olecranon, trochanteric, and retrocalcaneal. Most patients respond to nonsurgical management, including ice, activity modification, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In cases of septic bursitis, oral antibiotics may be administered. Local corticosteroid injection may be used in the management of prepatellar and olecranon bursitis; however, steroid injection into the retrocalcaneal bursa may adversely affect the biomechanical properties of the Achilles tendon. Surgical intervention may be required for recalcitrant bursitis, such as refractory trochanteric bursitis.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^113ZunYn]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^1163C3kU]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Non-surgical management of hip & knee osteoarthritis — clinical summary and recommendation state that the evidence supports a clinically significant reduction in pain with NSAIDs and a lesser overall effect of reducing pain with acetaminophen in patients with OA of the hip or knee; the superiority of NSAIDs over acetaminophen was more apparent in patients with moderate-to-severe baseline pain, while differences were negligible in milder disease or symptoms. Therefore, providers should carefully consider the medical history of patients being considered for such therapy, and providers should avoid offering this treatment to patients with comorbidities that increase their risk for adverse events (e.g. CKD [chronic kidney disease], especially severe CKD, at risk for or known CVD, at risk for NSAID-related upper GI events). Adverse events associated with the use of acetaminophen appear to be dose-related, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of evidence was low, and avoidance of NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors is suggested in patients with certain comorbidities, leading to a "Weak for" recommendation.

### Common superficial bursitis [^112EJvpa]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Superficial bursitis most often occurs in the olecranon and prepatellar bursae. Less common locations are the superficial infrapatellar and subcutaneous (superficial) calcaneal bursae. Chronic microtrauma (e.g., kneeling on the prepatellar bursa) is the most common cause of superficial bursitis. Other causes include acute trauma/hemorrhage, inflammatory disorders such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis, and infection (septic bursitis). Diagnosis is usually based on clinical presentation, with a particular focus on signs of septic bursitis. Ultrasonography can help distinguish bursitis from cellulitis. Blood testing (white blood cell count, inflammatory markers) and magnetic resonance imaging can help distinguish infectious from noninfectious causes. If infection is suspected, bursal aspiration should be performed and fluid examined using Gram stain, crystal analysis, glucose measurement, blood cell count, and culture. Management depends on the type of bursitis. Acute traumatic/hemorrhagic bursitis is treated conservatively with ice, elevation, rest, and analgesics; aspiration may shorten the duration of symptoms. Chronic microtraumatic bursitis should be treated conservatively, and the underlying cause addressed. Bursal aspiration of microtraumatic bursitis is generally not recommended because of the risk of iatrogenic septic bursitis. Although intrabursal corticosteroid injections are sometimes used to treat microtraumatic bursitis, high-quality evidence demonstrating any benefit is unavailable. Chronic inflammatory bursitis (e.g., gout, rheumatoid arthritis) is treated by addressing the underlying condition, and intrabursal corticosteroid injections are often used. For septic bursitis, antibiotics effective against Staphylococcus aureus are generally the initial treatment, with surgery reserved for bursitis not responsive to antibiotics or for recurrent cases. Outpatient antibiotics may be considered in those who are not acutely ill; patients who are acutely ill should be hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics.

A 62-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis and immunosuppressive therapy presented with chronic olecranon bursitis. A black velvety mould with brown septate hyphae and tapered annellides was isolated from a left elbow bursa aspirate and was identified as an Exophiala species. Internal transcribed sequence rRNA sequencing showed the isolate to be identical to Exophiala oligosperma. The patient was successfully treated with aspiration and intrabursal amphotericin B.

Data analysis

Continuous features were summarized with medians, interquartile ranges (IQRs), and ranges; categorical features were summarized with frequency counts and percentages. Patient characteristics, ED management, and outcomes were compared using Kruskal‐Wallis, chi‐square, and Fisher's exact tests based on the type and distribution of the feature under study. Confidence intervals (CIs) for key frequency counts were computed using an asymptotic binomial approximation. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). All tests were two‐sided and p‐values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. p‐values were not adjusted based on multiple comparisons.
